D. Eric HoltUniversity of South Carolina,  Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures,  Faculty MemberOptimality Theory+13My academic interests are varied, and encompass many areas, including Hispanic linguistics, phonological theory, historical linguistics, dialectology, language variation and change, Hispanic sociolinguistics, and language acquisition (particularly of pronunciation by English-speaking learners of Spanish). My research interests lie in phonological theory, especially as a tool for understanding aspects of the sound structure of Spanish, both modern synchronic and historical diachronic, including dialect variation past and present. A common theme to be found in my work is the application and development of issues in general linguistic theory to Spanish and dialectal data, thus providing me the opportunity to offer refinements both to previous analyses of the data and to the theory more broadly. Other work of mine has treated aspects of dialectal and historical variation, including ‘sporadic sound changes’ like metathesis and intrusive stop formation. Beginning in 2008, I began conducting and presenting research on the acquisition of connected speech phenomena in Spanish by English–speaking learners.Address: Deparrment of Languages, Literatures, and CulturesUniversity of South CarolinaColumbia, SC 29208less246 Followers16 Following1 Co-authorTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall2 Books20 Papers2 Conference Presentations7 Book Reviews4 Teaching DocumentsBooks Optimality Theory and Language ChangeThis volume may be used as one of the texts in courses on historical phonology or syntax that tre... more This volume may be used as one of the texts in courses on historical phonology or syntax that treat these topics from generative approaches or that give a general survey of various frameworks of research into these areas. Likewise, the volume may serve as a text for courses in phonology, syntax and Optimality Theory that have a component dedicated to extensions of linguistic theory to historical change. It is of interest for historical linguists, researchers into Optimality Theory and linguistic theory, and for phonologists and syntacticians with an interest in historical change.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

While diagrams are often presented to achieve this, these are static, and it is helpful to visualize movements of articulators via useful companions such as websites that involve functional MRI and ultrasound technology. One limitation of these is that they only present someone else’s production. While fMRI is not currently a practical tool for classroom use, ultrasound technology may aid the student during the production of many potentially problematic speech sounds. In this teaching tip, an overview of online fMRI and ultrasound tools is given, with indications of their practical application.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The present chapter explores the main phonological changes that characterize the linguistic evolution of Portuguese from Latin, with special attention to those that distinguish it from its neighbors, although as a descendant of Latin, Portuguese shares many traits with its Romance language sisters, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula.The chapter is organized as follows: section 2 treats various issues related to the evolution of syllable structure from Late Spoken Latin through Hispano-Romance to Modern Portuguese. This will include treatment of (inter-)related phenomena that affect segments, both individually and in combination, of vowels and consonants, including some that occur only sporadically. Section 3 further addresses salient characteristics of the vocalic system. Section 4 treats morphophonological issues of grammaticalization, contraction and prosody that characterize Portuguese in contrast to other Romance varieties. Section 5 offers a brief conclusion.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Instead, we will see that these "constructions" are merely labels, useful perhaps, but ultimately misleading and an impediment to a fuller, richer and more holistic grasp of Spanish grammar.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
