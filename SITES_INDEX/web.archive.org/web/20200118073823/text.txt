Malaysia
– Power Sector
The Malaysian power sector
is divided into 3 separate grids: Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.
Tenaga Nasional Berhad is the national utility company that dominates the
National Grid in Peninsular Malaysia. In East Malaysia, Sabah Electricity Sdn
Bhd (SESB) and Sarawak Energy Berhad control the state grids. These national
and state-controlled utility companies monopolise all the transmission and
distribution (T&D) assets within their respective grids. 
Tenaga
Nasional Berhad :-
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) was formed in 1990
by the Electricity Supply Successor Company Act 1990, to succeed the National
Electricity Board (NEB) of the States of Malaya.
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) is the only electric
utility company in Peninsular Malaysia and also the largest power company in Southeast Asia with MYR 99.03 billion worth of assets. It
serves over 8.4 million customers  throughout Peninsular Malaysia and the eastern state of Sabah through Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd. TNB's core
activities are in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Other activities
include repairing, testing and maintaining power
plants, providing engineering, procurement and construction services for power
plants related products, assembling and manufacturing high voltage switchgears,
coal mining and trading. 
The TNB Group has a complete power supply system, including
the National Grid which is energised at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolt (kV), with its tallest electricity pylon in Malaysia and Southeast Asia being
the Kerinchi Pylon located near Menara Telekom, Kerinchi, Kuala Lumpur. The National Grid is
linked via 132 kV HVAC and 300 kV HVDC interconnection to Thailand and 230 kV
cables to Singapore.
The Generation
division owns and operates thermal assets and hydroelectric generation schemes in Peninsular
Malaysia and one Independent
Power Producer (IPP) operating in Pakistan. In the peninsula, it has a
generation capacity of 11,296 MW. Plans to expand its generation capacity
include increasing hydroelectric generation  and
commissioning the first nuclear power plant in Malaysia by 2025 if the
government decides to include nuclear as an acceptable energy option.
Sabah Electricity :-
Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB) is an electrical
company that generates, transmits and distributes electricity mainly in Sabah and Federal
Territory of Labuan. It supplies electrical power
to 413,983 customers distributed over a wide area of 74,000 km2.
82.8% of the customers are domestic customers consuming only 28.8% of the power
generated.
The
total generation capacity of SESB is 866.4 MW, 50.3% of the total units
generated are purchased from the independent
power producers (IPP). The SESB
installed capacity (excluding IPP) of the Sabah Grid which supplies electricity
for major towns from Federal Territory Labuan to Tawau is 430.9 MW and the
maximum demand is 760 MW. The East Coast Grid 132kV Transmission Line
connecting the major towns in the East Coast has an installed capacity of
333.02MW and the maximum demand is 203.3MW.
The forecast
demand growth of electricity is in a region of 7.7% per annum up to the year
2010 and the electricity demand is expected to reach 1,500 MW by the year 2020.
Sarawak Energy
Berhad (SEB) :-
Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) is responsible for the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity for the state of Sarawak in Malaysia.
It is wholly owned by the State Government of Sarawak. As of May 2016, Sarawak
Energy has about 600,000 customers in the state. 
It has 36 power
stations, a total installed capacity of 1315MW, comprising 5 per cent diesel
engine, 25.6 per cent gas turbines, 36.5 per cent coal-fired power plant, 25
per cent Combined Cycle power station and 7.6 per cent hydro
turbines throughout the state.  SESCO
generates electricity mainly from two major types of plant; hydroelectric plants and thermal plants.
National Grid :- 
National Grid, Malaysia is the high-voltage electric power transmission network in Peninsular
Malaysia. It is operated and owned by Tenaga
Nasional Berhad (TNB) by its
Transmission Division. There are
two other electrical grids in Sabah and Sarawak operated by Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (SESB) and Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) respectively. The system spans
the whole of Peninsular Malaysia, transporting electricity in bulk from power
generators owned by TNB and Independent
Power Producers (IPPs) to
distributors. The grid also transports directly to large industrial customers,
such as steel mills and fertilizer plants.
Power
generation capacity connected to the Malaysian National Grid is 22,858 megawatt, with a maximum demand of
17,788 megawatt as of April 2016. The generation fuel mix in peninsular is
45.55% gas, 50.23% coal, 3.59% hydro and 0.63% from other forms of fuel.
