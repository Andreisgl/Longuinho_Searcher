Different recruitment methods financial models and delivery channels are being tested to maximize coverage enrollment and retention. In Bangladesh the MAMA Aponjon initiative was launched after an extensive formative research phase to build local partnerships tailor content develop information delivery channels and build brand awareness among target stakeholder groups. There are two purposes to this formative report: (1) to identify the most effective programmatic strategies to guide the future implementation of Aponjon based on preliminary evidence for the formative research phase; and (2) to identify gaps in the existing data monitoring and evaluation system and guide future avenue for implementation research.

The evaluation used a pseudo-random sample of respondents across SMC’s different beneficiary groups, and included an instrumental mix of qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry. During the ten-month pilot period, SMC and its staff made a total of BDT 95,179,014 (approximately USD $1.2 million) in transactions using DFS, including both mobile and other electronic channels. Of that total, slightly more than three-quarters were for sales collections, while the remainder were for training payments. Overall, the evaluation found that the transition to DFS resulted in increased efficiencies for administrative tasks by considerably lowering time spent when compared against the baseline data collected at the start of this pilot.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Epidemiologists concentrate on quantitative data which is collated by structured interviews. In contrast, anthropologists depend on participant observation and produce qualitative data. For the dominant position in the public health sector, epidemiologists often ignore the qualitative data in their analysis. This qualitative data which relates to the behaviour of certain kinds of &amp;#39;disease&amp;#39; gives a better and more authentic picture about a particular aspect of that disease. The reason for overlooking these ethnographic findings is because it is problematic to link up this behavioural data with &amp;#39;risk factors&amp;#39; or with &amp;#39;variables&amp;#39; in epidemiological statistical analysis. But apart from the &amp;#39;germ theory&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;risk factors&amp;#39; there are so many social and cultural factors in different contexts that can influence disease development and prognosis, which are also very important to consider in designing and implementing an effective intervention programme. Anthropologists can make a big contribution to finding out those factors.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Aponjon is an mHealth initiative focused on maternal and child healthcare. Aponjon deploys agents across the country to increase subscriptions to the mobile phone service; agents receive an incentive payment based on the number of customer acquisitions they make. Aponjon pays incentives to their agents using different means. Due to the popularity of MFS in Bangladesh as well as its potential to increase efficiency, Dnet applied for and received a fixed-obligation grant from the mSTAR project to integrate mobile financial services into its Aponjon program. To begin, Dnet conducted a study on MFS and cash payment practices by customer acquisition agents. The purpose of the study is to understand the advantages, disadvantages, and convenience of cash versus mobile financial services.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this article, we aim to better approximate the mandatory quarantine days based on the available published literature. Our review of scientific publications revealed that 14 days of quarantine is nor enough neither effective in restricting the Coronavirus. Instead of 14 days, one study suggested to imply 21 days of quarantine to completely assure the symptom appearance in infected people. In case of community transmission, as it might take up to 19.9 days to death from the first appearance of symptom in a community, an effective quarantine period to contain the spread of Coronavirus should be a minimum of 40 days. For a densely populated country like Bangladesh, planning effective strategies using available data is crucial to prevent the upcoming second wave of this pandemic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Strategies to Connect Low-Income Communities with the Proposed Sewerage Network of the Dhaka Sanitation Improvement Project, Bangladesh: A Qualitative Assessment of the Perspectives of StakeholdersInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public HealthIn Bangladesh, approximately 31% of urban residents are living without safely managed sanitation,... more In Bangladesh, approximately 31% of urban residents are living without safely managed sanitation, the majority of whom are slum residents. To improve the situation, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) is implementing the Dhaka Sanitation Improvement Project (DSIP), mostly funded by the World Bank. This study assessed the challenges and opportunities of bringing low-income communities (LICs) under a sewerage connection within the proposed sewerage network plan by 2025. We conducted nine key-informant interviews from DWASA and City Corporation, and 23 focus-group discussions with landlords, tenants, and Community Based Organisations (CBOs) from 16 LICs near the proposed catchment area. To achieve connections, LICs would require improved toilet infrastructures and have to be connected to main roads. Construction of large communal septic tanks is also required where individual toilet connections are difficult. To encourage connection in LICs, income-based or area-based sub...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By contrast, the cumulative number of dengue patients admitted to hospitals in the previous 19 yr (2000–2018) was 50,674 (Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research 2019).
