This paper is an attempt to address this issue by proposing a new metric so that the educational potential when using robots can be further developed. Tasks in which students in Japan and UK interact in a 3D virtual space to collaboratively program robots to navigate mazes have resulted in quantitative data of immersion, Circuit Task Complexity and Robot Task Complexity. The data has subsequently been collated to create a proposed new metric for tasks involving robots, which we have termed Task Fidelity. The paper proposes that Task Fidelity is a quantitative measure of a set robot task in relation to a learner’s solution. By quantifying Task Fidelity educators utilizing robots in schools and in Higher Education will be able to provide tasks commensurate with the expected successful outcomes achieved by the learners.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers222 - Applied Information Science Researchin a Virtual World Simulation to Support Robot-Mediated InteractionFollowing the Fukushima Nuclear DisasterMichael Vallance, Catherine NaamaniDownload Free PDFView PDFApplied Information Science Research in a Virtual World Simulation to Support Robot-Mediated Interaction Following the Fukushima Nuclear DisasterMichael Vallance, Catherine NaamaniThe absence of robots to assist with the repair efforts in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi power plant disaster of March 2011 revealed much about Japan&#39;s lack of preparedness for nuclear accidents. The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission highlighted insufficient knowledge and training at the plant, with residents being left confused by the conflicting information regarding the dangers of the effects of the reactor explosions. The research summarized in this paper examines how students in Japan and UK collaborate towards the development of a better understanding of the challenges and possible solutions when dealing with disaster recovery such as Fukushima. The context for collaboration is set within a 3D virtual space and Fukushima simulation where students program LEGO robots to follow distinct circuits.

Despite the brave efforts of its labor force leading up to, and in the aftermath of, the reactor explosions, it became apparent that coordination and communication were disorganized. The research summarized in this paper will examine how students in Japan and UK collaborate; eventually towards a better understanding of the challenges and possible solutions when dealing with disaster recovery such as Fukushima. The context for collaboration is set within a 3D virtual world with students programming robots to follow distinct circuits. The immersion affect of programming, constructing, collaborating and communicating is captured to determine task criteria of educational value. This interdisciplinary &amp;#39;information science&amp;#39; research incorporates computer science, cognitive science, the social sciences, communication and design.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Virtual Worlds ResearchLearning spaces, tasks and metrics for effective communication in Second Life within the context of programming LEGO NXT Mindstorms™ robots: towards a framework for design and implementation2010 • Michael Vallance, Stewart MartinScience education is concerned with the meaningful pursuit of comprehension, knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes.

In Vygotskian social! constructivist learning, personal interpretation, decision-making and community cooperation foster long"term understanding and transference of learned concepts. In short, the construction of knowledge requires learners to be actively involved in the process of learning. This paper presents a discussion of the method used to assess and define effective measurements. We use these measurements to evaluate strategies for communicating science by using LEGO robots and a MindstormsTM RCX controller that are collaboratively constructed and programmed by students in a virtual technology (Second Life). This occurs while the students are physically situated in different locations.Download Free PDFView PDFRobotic Agents used to Help Teach Social Skills to Children withDeitra  KuesterThis paper reports on the cross-collaborative efforts between computer science, special education and mechanical engineering on some of the robotic platforms used in therapeutic environments, and our investigation of using robots as educationally useful interventions to improve social interactions for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Development of a third generation robotic agent is described which uses an approach to treatment as an educational intervention based on Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR), direct instruction pedagogy, the use of social scripts, and our investigative process of using Lego® NXT platforms.Download Free PDFView PDFDesigning effective spaces, tasks and metrics for communication in second life within the context of programming LEGO NXT mindstorms robots2009 • Michael VallanceDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
