Tyap is a regionally important dialect cluster of Plateau languages in Nigeria's Middle Belt, named after its prestige dialect. It is also known by its Hausa exonym as Katab or Kataf.[3][4] It is also known by the names of its dialectical varieties including Sholyio, Fantswam, Gworok, Takad, "Mabatado" (Tyap 'proper'), Tyeca̱rak and Tyuku (Tuku).
Distribution[edit]
Native Tyap speakers are primarily found in the local government areas of Jema'a, Kaura and Zangon Kataf, although pockets of speakers are also found in Kachia and Kauru in southern Kaduna state, and Riyom (especially Takad speakers[5]) in Plateau State of Nigeria. There are also large speaking communities in Kaduna South and Chikun Local Government Areas of the state.[6] Skoggard (2014) presented the distribution of the Atyap (Katab) people in Nigeria to include: Niger, Nasarawa, Kaduna states and the FCT.[7]
Classification and dialects[edit]
Meek (1931:2) suggested that the Katab (Atyap), Morwa (Asholyio), Ataka (Atakad) and Kagoro (Agworok) speak a common tongue and may be regarded as one; and later on, McKinney (1983:290) commented that the Kaje (Bajju) should likewise be included with the above, due to the linguistic and cultural similarities shared by them.[8][9] Murdock (1959) classified Kagoro (Gworok) and other dialects comprising the current Tyap language group as "Plateau Nigerian",[10] in his "Semi-Bantu" branch of "Bantoid subfamily" of "Negritic Stock".[11][12] Tyap and Jju were placed by Greenberg (1963) under the "Plateau II" branch of the Benue-Congo language family. Later on, Gerhardt (1974) made a reconstruction of the branch, assigning it as "proto-Plateau". Again in 1989, Gerhardt placed Tyap and Jju under the South-Central subgroup, Central group, Plateau branch of Platoid, a division of the Benue-Congo languages.[4][13][14][15] Achi (2005) stated that the Atyap speak a language in the Kwa group of the Benue-Congo language family.[16] However, according to Bitiyong, Y. I., in Achi et al. (2019:44), the Kataf Group (an old classification) to which Tyap language belongs, is a member of the eastern Plateau. He went further to suggest that by utilizing a glotochronological time scale established for Yoruba and Edo languages and their neighbours,  the separation of the Kataf Group into distinguishable dialects and dialect clusters would require thousands of years. Also mentioned was that,
Between Igala and Yoruba language, for example, at least 2,000 years were required to develop the distinction, while 6,000 years were needed for the differences observable in a comparison of Idoma and Yoruba language clusters
noting further that this indicates that
even within dialect clusters, a period of up to 2,000 years was needed to create clearly identifiable dialect separation and that it is thus a slow process of steady population growth and expansion and cultural differentiation over thousands of years.[17]
He thereafter summarized that the implication for Tyap is that it has taken thousands of years to separate, in the same general geographical location from its about six most closely related dialects and stated that as a sub-unit, they required probably more thousands of years earlier to separate from other members of the "Kataf group" like Gyong, Hyam, Duya and Ashe (Koro) who are little intelligible to them. The stability of language and other culture traits in this region of Nigeria has been recognized.[18][17]
Dialects[edit]
Tyap has a number of dialects, including:
Dialect
Description
Fantswam (Hausa exonym Kafanchan, Kafancan)
Spoken by inhabitants of the Fantswam chiefdom in Jema'a LGA, earlier regarded as Kagoro (of Jama'a) not until about the late 1950s were they recognized as a separate entity.[19] It is closely related to Jju, the Gworok and Tyap proper dialects.
Gworok (Hausa exonym Kagoro; Tyap proper Gwoot)
Spoken by the A̱gworok (also spelt: Oegworok), inhabitants of chiefdom bearing their name, in Kaura LGA. It seems like a 'junction dialect' between Jju and Takad and seems to be influenced by neighbouring dialects of the nearest language cluster, most notably Nikyob-Nindem and others.
Jju (Hausa exonym Kaje, Kajji; Tyap proper Jhyo)
Listed as a separate language (with the SIL code kaj, although its grammar and morphology are similar those of a Tyap dialect, with a bit of a variation in its syntax). It is spoken by inhabitants of the Ba̱jju chiefdom in Zangon Kataf, Jema'a and Kachia LGAs. It has the greater number of speakers of any Tyap dialect, and could have been deeply influenced by Izere and Rigwe (with whose speakers the Ba̱jju lived near Chawai with, in today's Kauru by oral narrative, before migrating to their present homeland several centuries ago). Jju was also probably influenced by the dialects of its present Hyam-speaking neighbours and former neighbours, to the southwest. These contacts seem to be the leading factor in its drift from Tyap in comparison to other dialects.
Sholyio (variant spellings Sholio, Sholyia̱; Hausa exonym Moro'a, Moroa, Marwa)
Spoken by the A̱sholyio (also spelt: Osholio, Aesholio, Asholio, A̱sholyia̱) people of the chiefdom bearing their name in the Kaura LGA. It seems to have been influenced by the Beromic dialect of Iten, Rigwe and Gworok; its speakers share common borders to the east and south, respectively, with the people of the aforementioned.
Takad (variant spellings Takat; Hausa exonym Attakar, Attaka, Ataka)
Spoken by the Takad (Tyap proper A̱takat) of the chiefdom bearing their name, in Kaura LGA, Kaduna State and Riyom LGA, Plateau State. It is closely related to the Tyuku and Gworok dialects, as well as Jju. Although its speakers see themselves as brothers of the Ba̱jju (with whom the migrated from Chawai by oral narrative), Takat seems more related to the core Tyap dialects than to Jju, although has some of its special elements.
Tyap proper (also Tyap-Central,[20] Tyap Mabatado, Tyab; Hausa exonym Katab, Kataf, Katab proper)
Spoken by the A̱tyap people of the chiefdom bearing their name, in Zangon Kataf, also found in neighbouring chiefdoms in Kaura, Jema'a and Kauru LGAs. The dialect seems to be the mother dialect from which the others evolved, and was probably influenced by other languages, causing its drift from its parent proto-Plateau language root. British colonial anthropologist, Charles Kingsley Meek in 1931, classified most of the proto-Plateau ethno-linguistic groups as part of the "Kataf (Atyap) Culture Complex", speaking closely related dialects of a possible single language.
Tyecha̱rak (also spelt Tachirak, Techerak, Ticarak; Hausa exonym Kachechere, Kacecere, Kacicere; Tyap proper Tyecaat, Ta̱caat, Ta̱chaat)
Spoken by the A̱tyeca̱rak; (Tyap proper A̱tyecaat) people in the A̱tyap, A̱sholyio (Moro'a) and Gworok (Kagoro) chiefdoms in Zangon Kataf and Kaura LGAs and as far south as the Jema'a LGA.
Tyuku (variant spelling: Tuku, Tukun,[21] Tyukum; Hausa exonym Atuku)
Spoken by the A̱tyuku (also Atuku, Atukum, Atyukum) people in Jema'a Local Government Area in Takat chiefdom, around the Ni̱mbyio (also spelt Nimbio) forest reserve of southern Kaduna State. The dialect is often regarded as a dialect of Takad, and seems to possess the most language drift of any Tyap dialect, second to Jju.
Other dialects
Other dialects related to Tyap include Kulu (SIL code ikl, also an Adara dialect), Nghan (SIL code kcl, a Gyongic dialect) and Terri (SIL code cfd).

Comparison of dialects[edit]
Comparing the cognate percentages between Kaje (Jju), Katab ("Mabatado" Tyap) and Kagoro (Gworok) on the Swadesh wordlist consisting of 118 items of core basic vocabulary, Wurm (1971), in his remark stated that, the cognate percentages indicate that the three ethnic groups speak dialects of the same language.[32]
Kaje
84%
Katab

91%
Kagoro
Percentages of cognates on the Swadesh wordlist: Wurm (1971).
With a further comparison of their kinship terminologies, McKinney (1983:291), after comparing 174 entries between the above three found only eight to be non-cognate.[33]

The numbers 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 are formed by replacing the prefix 2 to 5, affixed to the "swak" (ten) with n-, with the swak itself taking the prefix n- throughout:
20: Nswak nfeang
30: Nswak ntat
40: Nswak nnaai
50: Nswak nfwuon
60: Nswak a̱taa
70: Nswak a̱natat
80: Nswak a̱ni̱nai (or nswak a̱ri̱nai)
90: Nswak a̱kubunyiung
Other numbers are formed by adding 1–9, similar to the teens:
91: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱nyiung
92: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱feang
93: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱tat
94: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱naai
95: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱fwuon
96: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱taa
97: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱natat
98: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱ni̱nai
99: Nswak a̱kubunyiung ma̱ng a̱kubunyiung
Hundreds[edit]
Note that what could be termed as the "ancient" counting system used for 1-5 is usually used from 100 until infinity. 1 becomes jhyiung, and no more a̱nyiung. Same thing the 2,3,4 and 5 placed immediately after cyi, the word for hundred.
100: Cyi jhyiung
200: Cyi sweang
300: Cyi tsat
400: Cyi nyaai
500: Cyi tswuon
600: Cyi a̱taa
700: Cyi a̱natat
800: Cyi a̱ni̱nai (or a̱ri̱nai)
900: Cyi a̱kubunyiung
479: Cyi nyaai ma̱ng nswak a̱natat ma̱ng a̱kubunyiung
Thousands[edit]
Hayab (2016:66-67) in his research on Hyam, a related language to Tyap found out that the original word for number 10 is "kop"/kwop, and that the present word used for ten was the de facto word used for twelve or a dozen is "shwak" (in Hyam) or swak (in Tyap). Due to the growing Hausa/English influence, undoubtedly before 1920 (because Thomas (1920:59) cited an example with Kagoro (Gworok) which, unlike its neighbours the Nungu, Ninzam, S. Mada and Mama, was not using as at then, the duodecimal system[34]), the counting system has taken the shape of the Hausa/English decimal style and the word "kop/kwop" became almost extinct, while the "swak" took its place and misplaced its original meaning, which is twelve, to now mean ten. With this in mind, when one considers the number "1,000" or cyi kwop jhyiung ("cyi kwop" is spelled one word), one can say that it literally means "hundred ten one" or "100 X 10 X 1".
Below are the modern Tyap Counting style in thousands:
1,000: Cyikwop jhyiung
2,000: Cyikwop sweang
3,000: Cyikwop tsat
4,000: Cyikwop nyaai
5,000: Cyikwop tswuon
6,000: Cyikwop a̱taa
7,000: Cyikwop a̱natat
8,000: Cyikwop a̱ni̱nai
9,000: Cyikwop a̱kubunyiung
2,018: Cyikwop sweang ma̱ng nswak ma̱ng a̱ni̱nai
10,000: Cyikwop swak
100,000: Cyikwop cyi jhyiung
Larger numbers[edit]
1,000,000: Milyon or cyikwop cyikwop jhyiung or simply Cyikwop a̱ka̱feang jhyiung
1,000,000,000: Bilyon or Cyikwop cyikwop cyikwop or simply Cyikwop a̱ka̱tat jhyiung
1,000,000,000,000: Trilyon or cyikwop cyikwop cyikwop cyikwop or simply Cyikwop a̱ka̱naai jhyiung.[6]

Endangered status[edit]
Research has shown that the Tyap language is classified as one of the endangered languages vulnerable towards extinction.[36]
Language is the key to the heart of a people. If we lose the key, we lose the people. A lost language is a lost tribe, a lost tribe is a lost culture, a lost culture is a lost civilization a lost civilization is invaluable knowledge lost. The whole vast archives of knowledge and experience in them will be consigned to oblivion.— Centre for Endangered Languages 
(1996).
A study by Ayuba (2014) showed that Tyap is endangered and that Hausa language and the non-transmission of Tyap by the older generation of Atyap to the younger generation largely accounted for the endangerment of Tyap. 
The study recommended, among other measures, that the Atyap Community Development Association (ACDA) should set up a committee to create awareness on the need for Atyap to rise up and save their language and another to work towards establishing vacation schools where older adults would provide pre-school child care where Tyap children could be immersed in the language.[37]
