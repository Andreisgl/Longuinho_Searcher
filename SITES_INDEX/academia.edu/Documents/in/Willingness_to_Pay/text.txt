Methodology/Technique – The data regarding geographical, demographical, socioeconomic , and topographical condition collected from local governments in Central Java Province, Meteorology and Geophysics Board, the Statistical Bureau, and Planning and Development Boar. Findings – Spatial analysis with GIS provides evidence that Surakarta, Sragen, and Sukoharjo districts are more vulnerable to flood than other districts in Central Java Province. This evidence points the need to conduct a thorough study on these areas. Novelty – This research contributes to empirical study, methodology, and policy implications.Save to LibraryDownloadby GATR  Journals•  5  Spatial Analysis, Local Wisdom, Economic valuation, Willingness to PayWillingness to pay to assess patient preferences for therapy in a Canadian settingSave to LibraryDownloadby Peter Jewesson•  23  Library and Information Studies, Prospective studies, Humans, FemaleInformation versus persuasion: experimental evidence on salesmanship, mandatory disclosure and the purchase of income and loan payment protection insuranceSave to LibraryDownloadby Diane Reyniers•  4  Value at Risk, Information disclosure, Value for money, Willingness to PayThe optimal pace of product updatesSave to LibraryDownloadby Glen Schmidt•  6  New Product Development, Multidisciplinary, Diffusion, Research and DevelopmentA Study on Willingness to Pay of Household Solid Waste Management in Kureepuzha of Kollam District, KeralaSince the origin of human beings, there exists a parallel waste generation.

Human wants are unlimited; the generation of waste also differs. With the increase in industrial growth and urbanisation, waste generation was also going at an alarming rate. The improper disposal of waste will lead to a rise in the pollution level. It can be managed from the household level. So the study was based on the willingness to pay by the household for the household solid waste management and the reasons behind the non-willingness to pay.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr.B.

It presumes that action in support of environmental quality may derive from any of three value orientations: egoistic, social-altruistic, or biospheric, and that gender may be implicated in the relation between these orientations and behavior. Behavioral intentions are modeled as the sum across values of the strength of a value times the strength of beliefs about the consequences of environmental conditions for valued objects. Evidence from a survey of 349 college students shows that beliefs about consequences for each type of valued object independently predict willingness to take political action, but only beliefs about consequences for self reliably predict willingness to pay through taxes. This result is consistent with other recent findings from contingent valuation surveys.

The study used a questionnaire survey of 271 randomly selected consumers; data was collected between December 2006 and February 2007. Heckman models were used for demand estimates. From demand estimates, price elasticity was found to be-0.53 for potatoes,-0.49 for peas,-0.28 for green beans,-0.80 for strawberries and-0.69 for cherries. The study calculated price premium that consumers would be willing to pay for consuming frozen food. It was found that consumers would pay an 82 % price premium for frozen peas; 108 % for frozen strawberries; and 130% for frozen cherries. It was found that consumers were not willing to pay a price premium for frozen potatoes or frozen green beans.Save to LibraryDownloadby Murat Cankurt•  4  Turkey, Key words, Willingness to Pay, Frozen FoodEstimating the Recreation Value of Ecosystems by Using a Travel Cost Method ApproachSave to LibraryDownloadby isabel mendes•  9  Hyperbolic Discounting, Estimation, Count data, Working PapersPublic Perceptions of Climate Change: A "Willingness to Pay" AssessmentIn this paper, we examine for a sample of Los Angeles residents their willingness to pay to prevent significant climate change.

The standard approach is to model main effectsfor each attribute, but interactions between attributes are also possible. Recently, a companythat produces choice modeling software has introduced an automated interaction searchfeature creating additional buzz for interactions in choice studies.More needs to be known about interactions in the presence of heterogeneity beforeapplying feature interactions willy-nilly.Here we propose a method for testing interaction terms with a special look atbrand-price interactions (equivalent to brand-specific price effects) that are oftenrecommended in practice.We show that brand-specific pricing is unnecessary when using HB estimation and theadded terms can lead to devastating model overfit.We provide a general framework for testing interactions. The step-by-step process canbe used without a set of dedicated holdout tasks or sample. When evaluating interactionsand model specifications more generally, overfit as well as managerial inferences should bothbe evaluated.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jake Lee•  5  Discrete Choice Modeling, Conjoint Analysis, Pricing, Discrete Choice ExperimentsThe Economic Effects of High Speed Rail InvestmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Gines  De Rus•  6  Investment, Willingness to Pay, Cost Benefit Analysis, High Speed RailSelf and others' willingness to pay for improvements to the paved road surfaceSave to LibraryDownloadby Darren Walton•  6  Economics, Urban And Regional Planning, Experimental Design, Contingent valuationWillingness-to-pay for Borivli National Park: evidence from a Contingent ValuationSave to LibraryDownloadby SUDHIR SHARMA•  10  Decision Making, Ecological Economics, Applied Economics, Developing CountryA comparison of importance weights and willingness-to-pay measures derived from choice-based conjoint, constant sum scales and best–worst scalingSave to LibraryDownloadby Towhidul Islam•  8  Business, Multidisciplinary, Context Effect, Choice ExperimentComparing methods for measuring consumer willingness to pay for a basic and an improved ready made soup productSave to LibraryDownloadby Tino Bech-larsen and +1Hans Juhl•  13  Marketing, Conjoint Analysis, Information Processing, InformationConsumer liking and willingness to pay for high welfare animal-based productsConsumers currently tend to rely more and more on extrinsic cues and credence characteristics, including process characteristics (e.g. the way animals are raised), to form their expectations about animal-based food products.

This review shows that if expectations are negatively disconfirmed, the hedonic ratings and consumer willingness to pay move towards the expectations induced by information on animal welfare according to the sensitivity of different groups of consumers. The combination of reliable animal welfare monitoring and effective labelling of animal-based products may then help meeting the increasing demand for animal welfare-friendly products while sustaining the welfare of the animals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ada  Braghieri•  2  Willingness to Pay, Food SciencesUnderstanding Money-Back Guarantees: Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral OutcomesSave to LibraryDownloadby Jens Hogreve•  7  Marketing, Retailing, Risk Perception, Experimental StudyHuman preferences for species conservation: Animal charisma trumps endangered statusA good deal of research has recently focused on people's commitment to biodiversity conservation by investigating their " willingness-to-pay " (WTP).

Because of the public's self-reported preferences for species that are more charismatic or similar to humans, conservation programs are often biased toward these species. Our study aimed to explore the determinants of WTP among 10066 participants in a zoo conservation program. The program aims to raise money to support conservation programs and involves donating a sum of money to " adopt " an animal in the zoo. We explored whether participants were influenced by particular scientific characteristics of the animal (IUCN conservation status and phylogenetic distance from humans) or by more affect-related characteristics, such as the charisma of the animal. We found that participants did not choose an animal to adopt because of the endangered status of the species, and did not donate more to endangered species than to other species. Instead , they were more likely to choose a charismatic species. However, surprisingly, those who chose a less char-ismatic species gave more money on average to the program than those who adopted more charismatic species, suggesting a higher level of commitment among the former. These results therefore suggest that this type of conservation program may not be an effective way of reconnecting people with conservation issues related to endangered species. We therefore advise zoos to communicate more strongly on the level of threat to species and to increase the ratio of endangered over charismatic species in their animal adoption programs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Agathe  Colléony and +2Susan ClaytonAnne-Caroline Prévot•  3  Charisma, Biodiversity Conservation, Willingness to PayThe poor pay more: Health-related inequality in ThailandSave to LibraryDownloadby Supasit Pannarunothai•  22  Sociology, Anthropology, Poverty, Health CareEstimating the Economic Value of Landscape Losses Due to Flooding by Hydropower Plants in the Chilean PatagoniaThis paper presents a contingent valuation study concerning landscape impacts generated by the construction of one dam (Baker 1) of the HIDROAYSEN hydropower project located in the Chilean Patagonia.

A survey was used to collect information about citizens’ opinions towards the hydropower project in four major cities in Chile. Specifically, a One-and-One-Half-Bound (OOHB) willingness to pay eliciting format was applied to capture citizens’ WTP. The economic loss, associated to the landscape impacts for people living in urban areas of the country, is found to be approximately US$ 205 million, which is nearly 28% of the total investment. Our results also show that the cities’ distance from the dam affects citizens’ willingness to pay.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alejandra Stehr•  11  Water resources, Landscape, Water Resources Management, MultidisciplinaryEstimating Demand for Urban Fisheries Management: an Illustration of Conjoint Analysis as a Tool for Fisheries ManagersThis paper illustrates the use of discrete-choice analysis, a nonmarket valuation technique, for assessing the effect of different management or fishing site quality variables on demand for urban fisheries.

The study was carried out in three fishing ponds that are a part of the Close-to-Home Fishing Program in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. We found that, on average, anglers were willing to pay more for physical infrastructure improvements, such as flush toilets ($3.81/year) and docks ($1.28/year), than for having larger channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus stocked ($0.23/year for a 4-in increase). Willingness to pay for improvements to the ponds was less for minority anglers than for other anglers. Having relative values for potential management changes for a fishery helps to inform fisheries managers about what characteristics are valued most by anglers, allowing managers to better serve the anglers' interest and to justify the costs of implementing these changes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Phumsith  Mahasuweerachai and +1Tracy Boyer•  8  Conjoint Analysis, Fishery Management, American, Fisheries SciencesThe non-use benefits of enhancing forest biodiversity: A contingent ranking studySave to LibraryDownloadby Guy Garrod•  11  Ecological Economics, Applied Economics, United Kingdom, Contingent valuationEstimating the Willingness‐to‐Pay for Road Safety ImprovementsSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan de Dios Ortuzar•  7  Road safety, Urban And Regional Planning, Contingent valuation, Willingness to PayToo much of a good thing?

The application of CV studies in the domain of flood exposure and flood control, where people are asked to trade-off money income in terms of willingness to pay (WTP), the risk of flooding and corresponding impacts on their life and livelihood, is rare.

In the present study, 115 participants recruited from a local shopping mall were asked to taste and evaluate three paired food samples (i.e., cookies, potato chips, and yogurt). Each of those food samples was labeled, specifying one of the items in the pair as 'organic' and the other label specifying its counterpart as 'regular', although they were identical and organically produced. Results found that participants estimated those foods with organic labels to be lower in calories than those without the organic label. Furthermore, foods with the organic label elicited a higher willingness-to-pay and yielded better nutritional evaluations (e.g., tastes lower in fat, higher in fiber) than foods without the organic label. Finally, results found that the effects of the organic label on caloric estimations were less pronounced among people who typically read nutritional labels, who often buy organic foods, and who often engage in pro-environmental activities. This underscores the idea that the health halo effect is primarily driven by automatic processing based on heuristics. Understanding how consumers use nutritional information on product labels has important implications for both public policy as well as processed food manufacturers who use such claims as tools to market their products.Save to LibraryDownloadby Brian Wansink•  3  Organic Food, Dual Process Theory, Willingness to PayConsumers’ willingness to pay for organic chicken breast: Evidence from choice experimentSave to LibraryDownloadby Zeki  Bayramoğlu•  9  Marketing, Organic Food, Choice Experiment, Organic productionAn empirical study of option prices for hunting permitsSave to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Boyle•  12  Ecological Economics, Applied Economics, Contingent valuation, EcologicalMeasuring the total economic value of restoring ecosystem services in an impaired river basin: results from a contingent valuation surveySave to LibraryDownloadby Alan Covich•  12  Ecological Economics, Applied Economics, Contingent valuation, River BasinThe Value of Digital Culture: A case study on the public value of online public access to film heritageAn important contribution to the literature on valuing Digital Culture: This study is an evaluation of Britain on Film (BoF) which offers curated film collections from the BFI National Archive and Regional and National Archives, launched... moreAn important contribution to the literature on valuing Digital Culture: This study is an evaluation of Britain on Film (BoF) which offers curated film collections from the BFI National Archive and Regional and National Archives, launched in July 2015. It uses contingent valuation methods to measure the value people place on the films in BoF. We also assessed the range of values users and the general public have for BofF and the wider Unlocking Film Heritage archive programme through a contingent valuation study of around 2,500 users and non-users. This was in terms of a monthly willingness to pay a subscription/donation, and a combined annual WTP at the national level. We also tested how engagement with archive film collections is positively associated with subjective wellbeing.Key finding: Users of the BFI's free ‘Britain on Film’ portal, which provides stories of UK life through the history of film, valued this service at over £3 a monthSave to LibraryDownloadby Ricky N Lawton•  4  Digital Culture, Contingent valuation, Revealed and Stated Preferences, Willingness to PayUser reviews and uncertainty assessment: A two stage model of consumers' willingness-to-pay in online marketsWe develop a two-stage conceptual consumer decision model from the risk perspective to understand the role of online user reviews in consumers' Willingness-To-Pay (WTP).

In stage one, consumers assess product uncertainty with product reviews. In stage two, they assess seller uncertainty with seller reviews, conditional on their assessment of product uncertainty in stage one. We further develop an operationalization of our conceptual model using the expected utility theory and derive hypotheses on the effects of online user reviews on consumers' WTP. We test our hypotheses using data from an experimental study and an empirical study.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zhilin Yang•  6  Marketing, Consumer Behavior, Willingness to Pay, E-CommerceDiscounting spotted apples: Investigating consumers’ willingness to accept cosmetic damage in an organic productSave to LibraryDownloadby Chengyan Yue•  9  Applied Economics, Business and Management, Research and Development, Crop ProductionOverconfidence in investment decisions: An experimental approachSave to LibraryDownloadby Werner Güth•  9  Experimental Economics, Decision Making, Behavioral Finance, Risk AversionUniversiti Putra Malaysia Press The Estimation of Economic Benefits of Urban Trees Using Contingent Valuation Method in Tasik Perdana, Kuala LumpurSave to LibraryDownloadby Awang Noor Abd Ghani and +1Yeo Cheng•  3  Willingness to Pay, Urban Park, Ordered Logit ModelWillingness to pay for organic products: Differences between virtue and vice foodsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jenny Van Doorn•  12  Marketing, Food Safety, Consumer Behavior, EnvironmentalismMoney for nothing and content for free?

To do this, we carried out a choice experiment. In the analysis, we focus on chickens reared indoors and outdoors and chicken labelled campylobacter-free versus non-labelled chicken. The results suggest that there is a positive willingness to pay (WTP) both for chicken reared outdoors and for campylobacter-free labelled chicken. Information about rearing methods resulted in a higher WTP for chicken reared outdoors, while information about campylobacter had both positive and negative effects on respondents’ WTP. The highest increase in WTP for campylobacter-free labelled chicken was found for one of the high risk groups, individuals with poor kitchen hygiene.Save to LibraryDownloadby Morten Mørkbak•  11  Law, Applied Economics, Animal Production, Consumer PolicyThe feasibility of community-based health insurance in Burkina FasoSave to LibraryDownloadby Rainer Sauerborn•  23  Community-Based Mental Health Services, Consumer Behavior, Developing Countries, Health insuranceLand reclamation efforts in Haller Park, MombasaLand reclamation of derelict landscapes, until in recent times, was a rare experience, especially in developing countries.

This has however changed with the adoption of environmental policies and legislative frameworks in most countries in the world. This drive was mainly inspired by the conservation strategies developed and promoted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). This article is a presentation of the findings and observations that led to successful land reclamation by the cement factory. Steps taken for this reclamation effort were of prime interest to the author and were retraced resulting in this position paper. A comparative approach is used, given the conventional methods that most projects of this nature employ. Most of the environmental and land degradation are caused by profit motivated industries who do nothing or very little to repair the damage caused in the course of their work.
