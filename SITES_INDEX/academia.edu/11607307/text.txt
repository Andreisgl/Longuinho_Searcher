In the FS plane, earthquakes and quarry blasts measured in Vértes Hills (Hungary) are significantly discriminated from each other. Furthermore, the results of the receiving-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis reveal that FIM is a classifier more efficient than N x in discriminating earthquakes from quarry blasts.Download Free PDFView PDFNatural HazardsEstimating tsunami potential of earthquakes in the Sumatra–Andaman region based on broadband seismograms in India2012 • R.

It revealed the need and importance of warning system for Tsunami generation to minimize the casualties. Seismograms of the Honshu earthquake event (recorded by broadband seismograms, being operated in the NW Himalaya by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun) are used for quick prediction of tsunami. The frequency content of these seismo- grams is studied and energy content in high frequencies is calculated, which is used to give tsunami warning. It is observed that wavelet coefficients for frequencies greater than 0.33 Hz tsunamigenic earthquakes do not show significant energy in the spectrum. However, significant energy is found in wavelet spectrum of non tsunamigenic earthquake. In this paper we present the wavelet analysis on the Honshu, Japan earthquake of 11th March, 2011. Some other global tsunamigenic and non-tsunamigenic events are also analyzed for test and comparison purpose of the methodology used.Download Free PDFView PDFInformational analysis of seismic sequences by applying the Fisher Information Measure and the Shannon entropy: An application to the 2004–2010 seismicity of Aswan area (Egypt)2012 • Abuo MohamedDownload Free PDFView PDFNonlinear Processes in GeophysicsWavelet analysis of the seismograms for tsunami warning2010 • KIRTI SRIVASTAVAThe complexity in the tsunami phenomenon makes the available warning systems not much effective in the practical situations. The problem arises due to the time lapsed in the data transfer, processing and modeling. The modeling and simulation needs the input fault geometry and mechanism of the earthquake. The estimation of these parameters and other aprior information increases the utilized time for making any warning. Here, the wavelet analysis is used to identify the tsunamigenesis of an earthquake. The frequency content of the seismogram in time scale domain is examined using wavelet transform. The energy content in high frequencies is calculated and gives a threshold for tsunami warnings. Only first few minutes of the seismograms of the earthquake events are used for quick estimation. The results for the earthquake events of Andaman Sumatra region and other historic events are promising.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysica A: Statistical Mechanics and its ApplicationsSingular spectrum analysis and Fisher–Shannon analysis of spring flow time series: An application to Anjar Spring, Lebanon2013 • Amin ShabanDownload Free PDFView PDFPure and Applied GeophysicsValidation and Joint Inversion of Teleseismic Waveforms for Earthquake Source Models Using Deep Ocean Bottom Pressure Records: A Case Study of the 2006 Kuril Megathrust Earthquake2009 • Hong Kie ThioThe importance of accurate tsunami simulation has increased since the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami that followed it, because it is an important tool for inundation mapping and, potentially, tsunami warning. An important source of uncertainty in tsunami simulations is the source model, which is often estimated from some combination of seismic, geodetic or geological data. A magnitude 8.3 earthquake that occurred in the Kuril subduction zone on 15 November, 2006 resulted in the first teletsunami to be widely recorded by bottom pressure recorders deployed in the northern Pacific Ocean. Because these recordings were unaffected by shallow complicated bathymetry near the coast, this provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether seismic rupture models can be inferred from teleseismic waves with sufficient accuracy to be used to forecast teletsunami. In this study, we estimated the rupture model of the 2006 Kuril earthquake by inverting the teleseimic waves and used that to model the tsunami source. The tsunami propagation was then calculated by solving the linear long-wave equations. We found that the simulated 2006 Kuril tsunami compared very well to the ocean bottom recordings when simultaneously using P and long-period surface waves in the earthquake source process inversion.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysica A: Statistical Mechanics and its ApplicationsThe role of propagating stress waves on a geophysical scale: Evidence in terms of nonextensivity2012 • C.
