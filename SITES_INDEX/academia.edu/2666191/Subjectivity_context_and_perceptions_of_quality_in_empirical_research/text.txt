Different assumptional frameworks underlying the opposing worldviews of positivism and interpretivism explain the differing treatments of context and subjectivity within these two frames of reference and thus the different criteria for quality that can be applied to each.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRigor in Grounded Theory Research - An Interpretive Perspective on Generating Theory From Qualitative Field Studies2004 • Susan GassonABSTRACT This chapter presents a set of principles for the use of Grounded Theory techniques in qualitative field studies. Some issues and controversies relating to rigor in Grounded Theory generation are discussed. These include: inductive theory generation and emergence, how theoretical saturation may be judged, the extent to which coding schemes should be formalized, the objectivist-subjectivist debate, and the assessment of quality and rigor in interpretive research.Download Free PDFView PDFDialogical principles for qualitative inquiry: a nonfoundational pathCharo Rodriguez, Maira Petrini, Marlei PozzebonDownload Free PDFView PDFInformation Systems JournalA paradigmatic and methodological examination of information systems research from 1991 to 20012004 • Rudy HirschheimDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Management and SustainabilityPositivist and Non-Positivist Paradigm in Social Science Research: Conflicting Paradigms or Perfect Partners?2014 • Rozilah  KasimDownload Free PDFView PDFInformation Systems JournalEpistemological perspectives on IS research: a framework for analysing and systematizing epistemological assumptions2007 • Jörg BeckerDownload Free PDFView PDFPhenomenological approaches and intersubjectivitySusan GassonDownload Free PDFView PDFQualtiatative research 3Right MagejoDownload Free PDFView PDFInterpretive paradigm infoRebecca BessongDownload Free PDFView PDFQualitative and Quantitative Research Paradigms in Business Research: A Philosophical ReflectionStephen Kwadwo Antwi, Hamza  KasimThis paper attempts to discuss quantitative and qualitative research methodologies within the broad field of business research. In the light of looking for possible similarities and differences between the two approaches, the study gives an overview of the historical development of both methods, the paradigms and interpretative frameworks, discusses major advantages and limitations and look at the new trend that combines both quantitative and qualitative data in a single research project in an effort to reconcile both methods. The main intention of this paper is not to extend the current and long-lasting debate regarding qualitative versus quantitative research, rather to describe and reflect on the philosophical stance guiding the two research methodologies from ontological, epistemological and methodological perspectives. The essence of this study is to enable professionals with little or no previous experience of the various research methodologies and falling in to the trap that one research is better than the other, gain a basic understanding of qualitative and quantitative research. The study concludes that, in addition to quantitative and qualitative research, mixed research also offers an exciting mode of conducting business research.Download Free PDFView PDFSystemes D Information Et ManagementFinding one’s way around various methods and guidelines for doing rigorous qualitative research: A comparison of four epistemological frameworks2015 • Catherine ThomasDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
