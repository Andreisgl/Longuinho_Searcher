Capable of creating jobs, invigorating cities and regions, cultural and social life, contributing to the increase in value added, exports and quality of life, numerous researches proved CI to have impact on national economy. However, CI impact should not be limited to superficial analysis of static data. CI impact on national economy is best disclosed in comparison to other countries and the aim of this research is to analyse economic CI impact by running an empirical research in EU countries in 2008-2014 and taking into consideration CI impact on employment, added value and exports. We conclude there are three CI impact directions, namely economic, sociocultural, and environmental impact areas and verify that CI is an influential sector that holds impact on various areas of national economy.Download Free PDFView PDFCreative Europe 2014-2020.

We address each societal challenge from the CCI perspective, indicating how the CCI can provide innovative responses to such challenges and enable strategic crossovers through networking and collaboration, but also referring to some criticalities.

In this case the creative industries became subject of interest to reach various policy objectives: city marketing, city branding, urban sociology, urban regeneration etc. In the same time the creative industries have a strong relation with social media and the development of digital economy.
