Steward requests  (Permissions)
latest archive→
Shortcut: SRP
This page is for requests to have stewards grant or revoke administrator, bureaucrat, checkuser, and oversight rights on Wikimedia projects which do not have a local permissions procedure.
Old sections are archived. The list of archives is below.
Requests for bot flags are handled at SRB, and requests for global permissions are handled at SRGP.
If you are requesting adminship or bureaucratship, and your wiki has a local bureaucrat, submit your request to that user or to the relevant local request page (index).
For urgent requests, such as to combat large-scale vandalism on a small wiki, contact a steward in the #wikimedia-stewardsconnect IRC channel. In emergencies, type !steward in the channel to get the attention of stewards. Otherwise, you can type @steward for non-urgent help.
Other than requests to remove your own access or emergencies, please only make requests here after gaining the on-wiki approval of your local community.

Using this page[edit]
1. Place the following code at the bottom of the appropriate section below:
==== Username@xxproject ====
{{sr-request
 |status    = <!-- don't change this line -->
 |domain    = <!-- such as en.wikibooks -->
 |user name =
 |discussion= 
}}
(your remarks) ~~~~
2. Fill in the values:
domain: the wiki's URL domain (like "ex.wikipedia" or "meta.wikimedia").
user name: the name of the user whose rights are to be changed (like "Exampleuser"). In case you're requesting access for multiple bots, leave this field blank and give a list of these bots in your remarks
discussion: a link to the local vote or discussion about the rights change (for example, "[[ex:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship#ExampleUser]]").
3. If anything is missing from your request, a steward will request more information.
Confirmation of signing confidentiality agreement[edit]
Certain permissions (notably CheckUser and Oversight) additionally require users to sign a confidentiality agreement. Users requesting these permissions must make a request below, and must also sign the confidentiality agreement with the Wikimedia Foundation. The request is placed on hold temporarily, until the receipt has been formally confirmed by the Office.
Requests[edit]
COPY THE FOLLOWING CODE to the bottom of the appropriate section below:
==== User name@xxproject ====
{{sr-request
  |status    = <!--don't change this line-->
  |domain    =
  |user name =
  |discussion= 
}}
Administrator access[edit]
See Administrator  for information about this user group.
If you are requesting adminship to handle one time vandalism incidents or clearing a deletion backlog, please see Steward requests/Miscellaneous.
MediaWiki interface translations are done at translatewiki.net. Please do not request administrator access solely for that purpose; your request will be declined.
Admins doing cross-wiki work may wish to see IRC/wikimedia-admin  for information about joining #wikimedia-adminconnect.
Stewards: Please use {{Systmp}} for approved temporary requests.
Requests for removal of access should be posted at the section below.
Please start a new discussion about requesting the permission on the local village pump, administrators' noticeboard or a designated page for requesting permissions each time you request or renew adminship.
Discussions should be open for seven days. Please request adminship here seven days after discussions started. This page is not the place for any discussions or votes. (For wikis with few active users, it is OK to have no comments.)
If you only want adminship for specific tasks, please state for how long and for which tasks you need it. Otherwise stewards will decide whether to assign permanent adminship and the duration of adminship. See Steward requests/Permissions/Minimum voting requirements.

Hi @Aram, thanks for the request. I'm sorry, but I can't locate any recent discussion about your interface adminship on that page; I only see requests from April. Am I missing something please? Martin Urbanec (talk) 21:10, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Martin Urbanec Thank you for your quick reply! No, you’re not wrong, but is it mandatory for me to run again? The community has full confidence in me. Furthermore, if one or two users had asked for these rights, I would not have assumed this responsibility and participating as a regular user would have been enough for me. However, If it is obligatory for me to run again, then it is okay and I will. Thank you! Aram (talk) 21:39, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Thanks for the re @Aram. Indeed it is mandatory; the goal is to ensure the community trusts you / has confidence in you (which is hard to verify without a voting). The length of appoingment is generally growing, up to indefinite grant (once the community meets MVR criteria). I'm making this  On hold -- please link the discussion here and we'll proceed from there. Best, Martin Urbanec (talk) 19:06, 16 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
‌Hi again @Martin Urbanec, since you last comment, I have run again for administrator and interface administrator rights. Today is the seventh day. I want to say that I have asked for these rights permanently because we really may not be able to do everything in a short period of time. Please check these out:

Interface administrator access[edit]
See Interface admin  for information about this user group.
If you need to accomplish one-time, non-recurring task, please request your task at Steward requests/Miscellaneous.
If you are requesting adminship and the interface admin at the same time, you can file one request in administrator section and state you want interface adminship as well.
MediaWiki interface translations are done at translatewiki.net. Please do not request interface administrator access solely for that purpose; your request will be declined.
Since the end of 2018, all interface administrators are required to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled. Please, enable it before posting your request here.
Stewards: Please use {{Systmp}} for approved temporary requests.
Requests for removal of access should be posted at the section below.
Please start a new discussion about requesting the permission on the local village pump, administrators' noticeboard or a designated page for requesting permissions each time you request or renew interface adminship.
Discussions should be open for seven days. Please request interface adminship here seven days after discussions started. This page is not the place for any discussions or votes. (For wikis with few active users, it is OK to have no comments.)
If you only want interface adminship for specific tasks, please state for how long and for which tasks you need it. Otherwise stewards will decide whether to assign permanent interface adminship and the duration of interface adminship. See Steward requests/Permissions/Minimum voting requirements.

Additionally, I hold roles as a sysop and a bureaucrat on the azwiki. eldarado (talk | contributions | meta page) 20:15, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

@Xaosflux: I know, but wiki opened today. And needs some technical edits, what's your advise? --eldarado (talk | contributions | meta page) 21:00, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Eldarado for anything urgently immediate, mock up the change locally and ask over at SRM where a global sysop can action it; for this request, start whatever that project's version of wikidata:Q16503 will be and at least post your intention there. You will likely need to be an admin and an intadmin for certain tasks unless you know you won't need both. Temp grants will likely start at 3 months in duration. — xaosflux Talk 21:33, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Bureaucrat access[edit]
See Bureaucrat  for information about this user group.
In principle, requests for temporary bureaucrat access are not granted.
A small project does not need bureaucrats. Currently whether a promotion is valid or not is decided by stewards. See here for a guideline.
Requests for removal of access should be posted at the section below.
CheckUser access[edit]
See CheckUser policy  for information about this user group and the policy governing the use of this tool.
To request CheckUser information, see Steward requests/Checkuser. This is the place to request CheckUser access.
Temporary CheckUser access is not permitted and temporary access is only used by Stewards .
Stewards: Before granting this permission to a user, please check the current policy and make sure that the user has signed the confidentiality agreement with the Wikimedia Foundation. An email template is available for requesting new users to identify.
When a new user is assigned to this group, please add them to this list, ask them to subscribe to checkuser-l, notify listowners checkuser-l-ownerlists.wikimedia.org, and make sure they contact an op for access to #wikimedia-privacyconnect and #wikimedia-checkuserconnect.

Oversight access[edit]
See Oversight policy  for information about this user group and the policy governing the use of this tool.
To request to have content oversighted, ask for a steward in #wikimedia-stewardsconnect and contact a steward privately. This section is for requesting access to the Oversight tool.
For contact details about oversighters across the wikis, refer to this page.
Note that temporary Oversight access is not permitted and temporary status is only used by Stewards .
Stewards: Before granting this permission to a user, please check the current policy and make sure that the user has signed the confidentiality agreement with the Wikimedia Foundation.
When a new user is assigned to this group, please add them to this list.
Miscellaneous requests[edit]
Requests for permissions that don't fit in other sections belong here. Importer  rights can be granted on most wikis by stewards only. Please gain local community consensus before posting a new section here.
Note that the following types of permissions requests belong on separate pages:
SRB — Local or global bot status
SRGP — Global permissions
Removal of access[edit]
If you're requesting the removal of your own permissions, make sure you're logged in to your account. If you have multiple flags, specify which you want removed. Stewards may delay your request a short time to ensure you have time to rethink your request (see previous discussion on 24 hour delays); the rights will not be restored by stewards once they are removed.
To request the removal of another user's permissions, you must gain consensus on the local wiki first. When there is community consensus that the user's access should be removed, provide a link to the discussion, with a brief explanation of the reason for the request, and summarize the results of discussion. However, as bureaucrats of some wikis may remove users from the administrator or bureaucrat group, please see also a separate list of these specific wikis.
To request the removal of another user's permissions for inactivity, link to your local inactivity policy. If your site does not have inactivity policy, the global policy Admin activity review applies.
See the instructions above for adding new requests. Please post new requests at the bottom of the section.
