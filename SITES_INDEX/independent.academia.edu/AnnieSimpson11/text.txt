The US-RIIS consists of three regional species checklists. Each record in the checklist is linked to one or more authoritative scientific reference asserting the species' non-native and established or invasive status somewhere within the locality. These checklists are maintained through input from more than 30 invasive species and taxonomic specialists and the general public. The US-RIIS has been created as a country-level contribution to the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) Initiative (https://griis.org). Its three species checklist datasets (for Alaska, Hawaii, and the conterminous U.S.) are periodically updated with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://GBIF.org). GBIF is an international biodiversity network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments which provides open access to data about life on Earth.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its purpose is to inform policy makers and the public which non-native taxa are currently established (with reproducing populations) in Alaska, Hawaii, and the conterminous United States. Our intention, though not a guarantee, is that this national non-native species list will be continually and regularly updated with new information (including corrections), made publicly available online and in a machine-readable web service format, and be clearly labeled with a version number and release date.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Introduced (non-native) species ... more This is apreadsheet database of introduced and invasive species. Introduced (non-native) species that become established may eventually become invasive, so tracking all introduced species provides a baseline for effective modeling of species trends and interactions, geospatially and temporally.The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) (ver. 2.0, November 2022, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9KFFTOD), as of 2022-10-23, is comprised of three lists, for the localities of Alaska (AK, with 545 records), Hawaii (HI, with 5,628 records), and the conterminous (or lower 48) United States (L48, with 8,527 records). Each includes introduced (non-native), established (reproducing) taxa that: are, or may become, invasive (harmful) in the locality; are not known to be harmful there; and/or have been used for biological control in the locality. To be included in the US-RIIS, a taxon must be non-native everywhere in the locality and established (reproducing) anywhere in the locality. Native pest species are not included.Each record has information on taxonomy, a vernacular name, establishment means (introduced unintentionally, or assisted colonization), degree of establishment (established, invasive, or widespread invasive), hybrid status, pathway of introduction (where available), habitat (where available), dates of introduction (where available), associated taxa (where applicable), native and introduced distributions (where available), and citations for the authoritative source(s) from which this information is drawn. All versions of the US-RIIS builds on a previous dataset, A Comprehensive List of Non-Native Species Established in Three Major Regions of the U.S. (ver. 3.0) (Simpson et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/p9e5k160).In summary, ver. 2.0 of the US-RIIS has 14,700 records in the master list and 12,571 unique names. The list is derived from more than 5,800 authoritative sources, was reviewed by or based on input from more than 30 taxonomic experts and invasive species scientists.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

MARIS data is owned and provided by participating state natural resource management agencies. This legacy dataset is hosted by the Core Science Systems Science Analytics and Synthesis Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. MARIS served data collected by a variety of agencies and organizations over various time periods. Data collection techniques, gear, and protocols may not be consistent across all datasets. Therefore, users of MARIS data should be aware of the limitations of the data available through the system.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is taxonomically refined, has tighter control of establishment status, and now includes approximate dates of introduction for 20% of its records.

The Big Island Invasive Species Committee (BIISC) is a voluntary partnership of private citizens, community organizations, businesses, land owners, and government agencies to address invasive species issues on the island of Hawaii. BIISC&#39;s mission includes education, early detection, rapid response, control and eradication of invasive pests threatening agriculture, native ecosystems, industry, human health or the quality of life within Hawaii County.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With this massive database one can see not only the 15 million records for nearly 10 thousand non-native species in the U.S. and its territories, but also their relationship to all of the other species in the country as well as their full national range. Leveraging this huge resource and its enterprise level cyberinfrastructure, USGS BISON staff have created a value-added feature by labeling non-native species records, even where contributing datasets have not provided such labels.

We provide an overview of information management needs for enacting EDRR and discuss challenges to meeting these needs. We then review the history of relevant US policy directives for advancing invasive species information systems and provide an overview of federal invasive species information system capacities, including current gaps and inconsistencies. We conclude with a summary of key principles and needs for establishing a national invasive species information framework.
