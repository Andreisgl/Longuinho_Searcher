A lawyer for the men did not respond to a request for comment.Malaysia is home to 32 million people, where ethnic Malay Muslims make up more than 60 percent of the population.It has a dual-track legal system, with Islamic criminal and family laws applicable to Muslims running alongside civil laws.Numan Afifi, president of sexuality rights’ group Pelangi, said the sentencing was “outrageous” and could create an environment of fear within the LGBT community.Numan, who attended the court hearing, said five other men arrested with the accused will also be sentenced on Nov. 19.The case comes amid concerns around growing intolerance toward the LGBT community in Malaysia in recent months.In September 2018, two women were caned for “attempting lesbian sex” in the east coast state of Terengganu.Earlier this year, a minister and other Muslim groups protested after LGBT activists attended a march for International Women’s Day.Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Raju GopalakrishnanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
