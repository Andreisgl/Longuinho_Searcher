More than that, analysis of paleo-pathology (study of trauma and disease in the past) and mortuary behavior is critical data for reconstructing meaning in the past. Evidence for traumatic injuries has been demonstrated at six Harappan sites. We have also found that stigmatized infectious diseases appear in the subcontinent at this time. Patho-physiological variations, including congenital differences, dental diseases, arthritis, and nutritional insufficiency, have also been discovered in the remains from Harappan cities. These human experiences, contextualized within mortuary treatment, have revitalized research into the socio-cultural dimensions of life in South Asia’s first urban period. This chapter demonstrates the evidence from some of the major Harappan cities that have been thoroughly studied—Harappa, Rakhigarhi, Farmana—and for some of the Harappan cities that deserve more thorough attention--Mohenjo Daro, Kalibangan, and Sanauli. I provide details about the skeletal evidence and its interpretation with the goal of encouraging the burgeoning field of bioarchaeological research in the subcontinent.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Bioarchaeology of Urbanization2020_Ritual, Urbanism, and the Everyday: Mortuary Behavior in the Indus Civilization2020 • Gwen Robbins SchugHuman skeletal material from archaeological sites is the most important source of evidence about embodied experience, habitual behaviors, and aspects of health in past people. Within bioarchaeology's broad area of inquiry, analysis of mortuary behavior (particularly when combined with paleopathology) is potentially the most critical tool for archaeologists to reconstruct ritual and meaning in the past. This work typically combines embodiment and practice theory to examine the importance of ritual, its contours, and its social function. This chapter asks what we mean by "ritual" and how "ritual" emerges from mortuary artifacts and features. This chapter seeks to move away from mortuary ritual as a distinct category of behavior in the Indus context, separate from a secular life in the urban environment. I argue that mortuary behavior for individuals in the Indus civilization varies because of the nature of the heterogeneous populations that occupied these urban settlements in the Indus Age but perhaps also that mortuary and other ritual behaviors in the Indus civilization were entangled, enmeshed, and interacted with the everyday heterogeneity of people's life in the urban environment. While there is no common tradition apparent within or among all Indus cities, what is clear is that the urban lifestyle and environment participated in creating diverse rituals that were performed here in a funerary context and that participation would contribute to memories of the cities long after their decline. Evidence is drawn from mortuary archaeology and objects, bodies and emergent behaviors, pathophysiology and health. These ritual and everyday dimensions of life in South Asia's first urban period speak to the deepest anthropological questions we can ask about the past and how it was lived in the urban context.Download Free PDFView PDFArchaeological and anthropological studies on the Harappan cemetery of Rakhigarhi, IndiaAvradeep Munshi, Yogesh Yadav, Malavika Chatterjee, Yongjun KimAn insufficient number of archaeological surveys has been carried out to date on Harappan Civilization cemeteries. One case in point is the necropolis at Rakhigarhi site (Haryana, India), one of the largest cities of the Harappan Civilization, where most burials within the cemetery remained uninvestigated. Over the course of the past three seasons (2013 to 2016), we therefore conducted excavations in an attempt to remedy this data shortfall. In brief, we found different kinds of graves co-existing within the Rakhigarhi cemetery in varying proportions. Primary interment was most common, followed by the use of secondary, symbolic, and unused (empty) graves. Within the first category, the atypical burials appear to have been elaborately prepared. Prone-positioned internments also attracted our attention. Since those individuals are not likely to have been social deviants, it is necessary to reconsider our pre-conceptions about such prone-position burials in archaeology, at least in the context of the Harappan Civilization. The data presented in this report, albeit insufficient to provide a complete understanding of Harappan Civilization cemeteries, nevertheless does present new and significant information on the mortuary practices and anthropological features at that time. Indeed, the range of different kinds of burials at the Rakhigarhi cemetery do appear indicative of the differences in mortuary rituals seen within Harappan societies , therefore providing a vivid glimpse of how these people respected their dead.Download Free PDFView PDFSpringerBriefs in ArchaeologyHuman Skeletal Studies in India: A Review2014 • Veena Mushrif-Tripathy, Kalyan Sekhar Chakraborty, Sutapa LahiriDownload Free PDFView PDFChapter 1 Where Are They Now?

Major skeletal collection comes from the cultural phases ranging from the Mesolithic, Harappan, Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Iron Age levels. After the Early Historic phase cremation became the most common method for disposing the dead. Though the relevant documentation is far less than complete, recovery of human burials has been reported from more than 300 sites (Mushrif-Tripathy et al. 2016) and a conservative estimate would lead to imagine approximately 2000 human skeletons. The human skeletal analysis started around 1950s and initial focus of the study was to understand the racial classification of the skulls and to prove the Indo-Aryan invasion theory. Later from 1980s multidisplinary approach including socio-cultural anthropology, growth and nutrition and medical anthropology were considered. The recent development includes the use of new scientific methods like isotope, aDNA, DXA scans, and Scanning Electron Microscope studies etc. are consider to understand ancient inhabitants of Indian Sub-continent.Download Free PDFView PDF2013_Infection, Disease, and Biosocial Processes at the End of the Indus CivilizationGwen Robbins SchugIn the third millennium B.C., the Indus Civilization flourished in northwest India and Pakistan. The late mature phase (2200-1900 B.C.) was characterized by long-distance exchange networks, planned urban settlements, sanitation facilities, standardized weights and measures, and a sphere of influence over 1,000,000 square kilometers of territory. Recent paleoclimate reconstructions from the Beas River Valley demonstrate hydro-climatic stress due to a weakened monsoon system may have impacted urban centers like Harappa by the end of the third millennium B.C. the impact of environmental change was compounded by concurrent disruptions to the regional interaction sphere. Climate, economic, and social changes contributed to the disintegration of this civilization after 1900 B.C. We assess evidence for paleopathology to infer the biological consequences of climate change and socio-economic disruption in the post-urban period at Harappa, one of the largest urban centers in the Indus Civilization. Bioarchaeological evidence demonstrates the prevalence of infection and infectious disease increased through time. Furthermore, the risk for infection and disease was uneven among burial communities. Corresponding mortuary differences suggest that socially and economically marginalized communities were most vulnerable in the context of climate uncertainty at Harappa. Combined with prior evidence for increasing levels of interpersonal violence, our data support a growing pathology of power at Harappa after 2000 B.C. Observations of the intersection between climate change and social processes in proto-historic cities offer valuable lessons about vulnerability, insecurity, and the long-term consequences of short-term strategies for coping with climate change.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Evolution of Fragility: Setting the TermsPetrie, C.A. 2019.
