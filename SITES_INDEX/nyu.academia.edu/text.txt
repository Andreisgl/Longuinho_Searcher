Black Audio and Sankofa emerged in the mid-1980s as activists and innovators in the fields of video and film arts. Formed by male and female filmmakers of African, Afro-Caribbean, and South Asian descent, they were born out of the struggles waged by black Britons in the 1980s to shape a new cultural politics and a new politics of representation. An important stage in the ongoing struggle to gain acknowledgement of diversity within “the black British experience,” and to gain control over representations of that diversity, was that of breaking the historic silence of black British women of Caribbean origins. As a result of the new cultural politics, and for the first time, black women artists gained the means to give voice to their experience and their concerns through the medium of film. At a moment when debates on representation necessarily provoked questions of racial, national, ethnic, and individual identity, the impact of migration on black women’s identity formation became a pressing concern, if not to the community as a whole, then certainly to the women. The paper evaluates the two films as responses to these debates by filmmakers committed to giving voice to black women.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

New Ethnities: West Indian in London in Literature 1948 - 2001This paper reflects on the impact of West Indian immigrants on the social and cultural dynamics o... more This paper reflects on the impact of West Indian immigrants on the social and cultural dynamics of London in the period 1948 – 2001 and explores the notion of “colonization in reverse,” first expressed by Louise Bennett in her 1959 poem of the same title. Evidence of the impact of the West Indian presence on youth cultures and race relations in London is drawn from literature, notably Samuel Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners (1956), from sociological and cultural studies of the period as well as from the sequence of political crises beginning with Notting Hill Riots of 1959. The Brixton and Tottenham riots of 1981 focused attention on police harassment of black youth in London and on the discontent of black people in poor boroughs in the city; however,  this paper proposes that the narrative of “riotous/unruly inner city black youth” that is concretized in this period obscures the ongoing process of creolization that begins in the 1950s and whose most eloquent document to date is Zadie Smith’s White Teeth (2001).Published in Caribbean Quarterly, Vol 56, no.4 (December 2015)Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This translated into a renewed interest in the social conditions of the peasantry, the working class, and the urban poor and urban popular culture. This interest is evident in two films that were released in Jamaica in the post-independence period, The Harder They Come (1972) and Rockers(1977)...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
