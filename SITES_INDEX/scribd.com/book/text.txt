A masterpiece . . . One of the best books I’ve ever read.” —Lisa Jewell, #1 New York Times bestselling authorNew York Times bestselling author Gillian McAllister has created a thriller unlike any other in this endlessly clever, twisty story of a mother who must move backward through time to prevent tragedy from striking at the heart of her family.Can you stop a murder after it’s already happened?It is midnight on the morning of Halloween, and Jen anxiously waits up for her 18-year-old son, Todd, to return home. But worries about his broken curfew transform into something much more dangerous when Todd finally emerges from the darkness. As Jen watches through the window, she sees her funny, seemingly happy teenage son stab a total stranger.She doesn’t know who the victim is, or why Todd has committed such a devastating act of violence. All she knows is that her life, and Todd’s, have been shattered. After her son is taken into custody, Jen falls asleep in despair. But when she wakes up…it is yesterday. The murder has not happened yet—and there may be a chance to stop it. Each morning, when Jen wakes, she is further back in the past, first weeks, then years, before the murder. And Jen realizes that somewhere in the past lies the trigger for Todd’s terrible crime…and it is her mission to find it, and prevent it from taking place.Both the story of a mother’s love and the sacrifices she will make for her child, and a thriller with a brilliant twist, Wrong Place Wrong Time is a one-of-a-kind novel that begs to be read in one sitting.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel

The plot is very unique with a few characters that you can invest in....if you can be sure enough of one.  How many times many of us would like to go back and try to prevent something that has happened in the past?  How far back would you "really" need to go?  Who could you possibly tell what was happening to you?  Would they believe you?  What would you see differently in the past because you have lived a bit of the present and how much are you willing to adjust the future?  It's a book that I really let go and got in to.  I would have liked more characters and those characters to have been well developed.Read moreangiestahl-1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5A time-traveling thriller that did not end up where I expected. The setup is this: a happily married mom witnesses her only child, now a teen, stab a man to death on the street outside their home. Hours later, emotionally and physically spent, she falls asleep and wakes up 24 hours earlier than the stabbing incident. She keeps traveling back in time (the book dates where she is along the timeline x days or months or years before the night her son committed murder). She relives moments and scenes from her past and picks up small clues to solve the mystery of who the man was, why her son stabbed him, and how she might be able to change the past to shift the future. Along the way, she finds out many things that she'd come to accept about her life, marriage, and family weren't what she thought them to be. But, the one thing that never wavers is her love for her son and desire to protect him. IMO, this is a story you've hear before, but the reverse chronology is a unique construction that sets it apart from a sea of similar family thrillers. If you like psychological drama, give this one a try.Read morermarcin-630843Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5This is a very cleverly crafted thriller about a mom who witnesses her son stabbing and killing a man. She is so shocked about this and shaken to her core, that she actually begins waking up in the past so she can determine what caused her son to become a killer.  Jen and Kelly have been together for about 20 years and have a teenage son, Todd. Todd stabs a man, and when he is arrested, Jen can't believe it. She keeps going back in time to try to change what happened. As she goes farther and farther back, she uncovers secrets about her family. Can she change the outcome? I really enjoyed this unique story of a mother's love for her family and what she would do to change the course of history.Read moreamzzz_1Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5This book was… fine. Interesting concept, not a great execution in my opinion. Definitely predictable in sections.Read moreacargile-1Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5I could have sworn I wrote up thoughts about this novel!  Gooness--it's been a few weeks since I finished it.  I have forgotten all the names--sorry!Getting ready for Halloween by carving a pumpkin, a mom waits up for her son.  Looking out the window, she sees him coming.  She also sees another man.  Her son stabs and kills him.  She screams for her husband; they rush out and go to the police station.  It's late, so nothing much can be done until morning, so she and her husband go home, leaving their son in jail overnight.  The next morning she wakes up and it's the day before the killing.  It takes a while to figure it out, but there's no pumpkin.  Each day she wakes up a day earlier, sometimes weeks earlier.  Each day gives a clue as to what lead to her son killing a man.  Saying much else would just ruin the novel.  I will say that I was wrong about almost everything I thought was really happening.  Overall, I enjoyed the novel except the very end,  It was a lovely book to listen to--kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing.Read moremicareadsRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Jen nervously waits for her son to return home in time for his curfew. As she sees him come down the street, she notices a man come out of the shadows, and before she knows it - her son has stabbed this man. Leaving her son in jail, she goes home and goes to bed; when she wakes up she realizes that she has gone back in time…she must figure out how to stop her son from murdering this man and determining what the root cause of the problem is and how to change it. As she learns more and more about what happened in the past that she was unaware of she finally has answers and must decide how to move forward. Lesley Sharp was a wonderful narrator and brought the story to life and was able to emote the confusion and anger the main character feels throughout the story as she is trying to save her family and when she realizes just who is guilty in this story and who remains innocent.  This was not a book for me. I had seen so many good reviews that I felt it had to be good. Sadly, I did not think that was the case. The book was far too long for my liking. I understand the reason for going so far back but there were so many details that could have been left out - maybe two or three periods skipped in order to move the story along. I appreciated the creativity that went into the story such as creating the relationship history and all the moments where bits of truth came out.Read moreclp412Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I loved this book!

Todd is promptly arrested, and Jen, along with her husband, Kelly, are left stunned, unable to speak with him until the next morning when they can return with a solicitor. The last thing Jen remembers of that night is dozing on the sofa, but when she wakes she is in bed, Todd is in his bedroom, Kelly is at work, and it’s Friday morning …again. Jen is confused, her son and husband are bemused by her story, and Jen allows herself to be convinced she dreamed the whole thing, but nevertheless insists Todd stays home, and as she’s falling asleep she is confident she’s avoided a nightmare scenario. So why, when she next wakes, is it the day before the day before?Every time Jen wakes, she finds herself further back in the past, sometimes days, weeks and even years, eventually realising that to change the future, and save her son, she has to determine where everything went wrong. I felt sympathy for Jen as her whole life slowly began to unravel, her past revealing crushing secrets, and admired her determination to find the answers.The plot is intricate, though not unfathomably so, once you become comfortable with the time slips. While I’m not a fan of time travel generally, I found I was quickly absorbed in this high concept story. The novel unfolds at a compelling pace, despite moving backwards from the crime to its cause, and offers plenty of surprising twists. The epilogue too is quite the stunner.Intriguing and clever, Gillian McAllister presents an original premise executed with impressive skill in Wrong Place Wrong Time.Read moretwink_2Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Wrong Place, Wrong Time is a first read/listen of Gillian McAllister for me - but it certainly won't be the last!The premise? "You’re waiting up for your seventeen-year-old son. He’s late. As you watch from the window, he emerges, and you realize he isn’t alone: he’s walking toward a man, and he’s armed. You can’t believe it when you see him do it: your funny, happy teenage son, he kills a stranger, right there on the street outside your house. You don’t know who. You don’t know why. You only know your son is now in custody. His future shattered."Uh huh, I was hooked immediately. But that's just the catalyst. McAllister's plotting and execution are very, very clever. I went in blind on the full description of the plot, and I think the book was all the better for me that I did so. Some may say that one of the plot devices has has been done before. Well, yes it has, in varying forms, but I think McAllister's take on this idea was unique. And she also gives the listener/reader lots of unexpected twists and turns. (Love this!)  The murder is a given, but finding out that 'why' is a deliciously winding, surprising path. Alongside this runs an exploration of maternal love, the inside of a marriage and the secrets we keep and the things we hide.I chose to listen to Wrong Place, Wrong Time. The reader was Lesley Sharp and her voice absolutely suited the lead character of Jen. Her voice is low and throaty, the  kind of tone that you lean in to hear. Her British accent is lovely and pleasant to listen to. The speed of the reading is just right. Her voice rises and falls with whatever situation or emotion is taking place. She enunciates clearly. Sharp interprets and presents McAllister's work very, very well. An excellent reading of a fantastic novel.Read morenicx27Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I'd always, without hesitation, read a Gillian McAllister book but when I heard about the concept of Wrong Place Wrong Time I was instantly smitten. I knew a time travel book would be twisty but I didn’t reckon on how completely and utterly thrilling it would be, how every twist in the tale would lead me to have to shut the book and process it excitedly, before going onto the next chapter.I won't mention anything about the story other than what is in the synopsis, which is that Jen witnesses her teenage son commit a murder and then somehow she wakes up each morning in the past looking for answers to why her lovely son could murder somebody in cold blood. To know anymore would be to spoil the way this amazing book unfolds.McAllister writes with such empathy and depth of feeling about family life and the difficulty and guilt of juggling motherhood and a career. Billed as a crime novel or a thriller, for me it's not about the crime but about what we will do for those we love. I felt unexpectedly teary at the end. Just like with my other favourite McAllister, How to Disappear, she's hit the nail on the head when it comes to family relationships and love, and made me care about the outcome.The plotting is impeccable in every way. This is one very clever novel, perfectly executed and totally unforgettable. It is jaw-droppingly good and completely original. I love the time-travel genre and this is a real standout for me.Trust me, there is no Wrong Time to pick up this book. This is a story that could have been difficult to pull off but McAllister has nailed it. I thought it was faultless, superb, and very special indeed.Read moreBook previewWrong Place Wrong Time - Gillian McAllisterDay Zero, just after midnight Jen is glad of the clocks going back tonight. A gained hour, extra time, to be spent pretending she isn’t waiting up for her son. Now that it is past midnight, it is officially the thirtieth of October. Almost Halloween. Jen tells herself that Todd is eighteen, her September baby now an adult. He can do whatever he wants. She has spent much of the evening badly carving a pumpkin. She places it now on the sill of the picture window that overlooks their driveway, and lights it. She only carved it for the same reason she does most things – because she felt she should – but it’s actually quite beautiful, in its own jagged way. She hears her husband Kelly’s feet on the landing above hers and turns to look. It’s unusual for him to be up, he the lark and she the nightingale. He emerges from their bedroom on the top floor. His hair is messy, blue-black in the dimness. He has on not a single piece of clothing, only a small, amused smile, which he blows out of the side of his mouth. He descends the stairs toward her. His wrist tattoo catches the light, an inscribed date, the day he says he knew he loved her: spring 2003. Jen looks at his body. Just a few of his dark chest hairs have turned white over the past year, his forty-third. Been busy? He gestures to the pumpkin. Everyone had done one, Jen explains lamely. All the neighbors. Who cares? he says. Classic Kelly. Todd’s not back. It’s the early evening, for him, he says. Soft Welsh accent just barely detectable on the three-syllable ev-en-ing, like his breath is stumbling over a mountain range. Isn’t it one o’clock? His curfew. It’s a typical exchange for them. Jen cares very much, Kelly perhaps too little. Just as she thinks this, he turns, and there it is: his perfect, perfect arse that she’s loved for almost twenty years. She gazes back down at the street, looking for Todd, then back at Kelly. The neighbors can now see your arse, she says. They’ll think it’s another pumpkin, he says, his wit as fast and sharp as the slice of a knife. Banter. It’s always been their currency. Come to bed? Can’t believe Merrilocks is done, he adds with a stretch. He’s been restoring a Victorian tiled floor at a house on Merrilocks Road all week. Working alone, exactly the way Kelly likes it. He listens to podcast after podcast, hardly ever sees anyone. Complicated, kind of unfulfilled, that’s Kelly. Sure, she says. In a bit. I just want to know he’s home okay. He’ll be here any minute now, kebab in hand. Kelly waves a hand. You waiting up for the chips? Stop, Jen says with a smile. Kelly winks and retreats to bed. Jen wanders aimlessly around the house. She thinks about a case she has on at work, a divorcing couple arguing primarily over a set of china plates but of course, really, over a betrayal. She shouldn’t have taken it on, she has over three hundred cases already. But Mrs. Vichare had looked at Jen in that first meeting and said, If I have to give him those plates, I will have lost every single thing I love, and Jen hadn’t been able to resist. She wishes she didn’t care so much – about divorcing strangers, about neighbors, about bloody pumpkins – but she does. She makes a tea and takes it back up to the picture window, continuing her vigil. She’ll wait as long as it takes. Both phases of parenthood – the newborn years and the almost-adult ones – are bookended by sleep deprivation, though for different reasons. They bought this house because of this window in the exact center of their three-story house. We’d look out of it like kings, Jen had said, while Kelly laughed. She stares out into the October mist, and there is Todd, outside on the street, at last. Jen sees him just as Daylight Saving Time kicks in and her phone switches from 01:59 to 01:00. She hides a smile: thanks to the clocks going back, he is deliberately no longer late. That’s Todd for you; he finds the linguistic and semantic back-flipping of arguing a curfew more important than the reason for it. He is loping up the street. He’s skin and bones, doesn’t ever seem to gain weight. His knees poke angles in his jeans as he walks. The mist outside is colorless, the trees and pavement black, the air a translucent white. A world in grayscale. Their street – the back end of Crosby, Merseyside – is unlit. Kelly installed a Narnia-style lamp outside their house. He surprised her with it, wrought iron, expensive; she has no idea how he afforded it. It clicks on as it detects movement. But – wait. Todd’s seen something. He stops dead, squints. Jen follows his gaze, and then she sees it, too: a figure hurrying along the street from the other side. He is older than Todd, much older. She can tell by his body, his movements. Jen notices things like this. Always has. It is what makes her a good lawyer. She places a hot palm on the cool glass of the window. Something is wrong. Something is about to happen. Jen is sure of this, without being able to name what it is; some instinct for danger, the same way she feels around fireworks and level crossings and cliff edges. The thoughts rush through her mind like the clicking of a camera, one after the other after the other. She sets the mug on the windowsill, calls Kelly, then rushes down the stairs two at a time, the striped runner rough on her bare feet. She throws on shoes, then pauses for a second with her hand on the metal front doorknob. What – what’s that feeling? She can’t explain it. Is it déjà vu? She hardly ever experiences it. She blinks, and the feeling is gone, as insubstantial as smoke. What was it? Her hand on the brass knob? The yellow lamp shining outside? No, she can’t recall. It’s gone now. What? Kelly says, appearing behind her, tying a gray dressing gown around his waist. Todd – he’s – he’s out there with . . . someone. They hurry out. The autumn cold chills her skin immediately. Jen runs toward Todd and the stranger. But before she’s even realized what is happening, Kelly’s shouted out: Stop! Todd is running, and within seconds has the front of this stranger’s hooded coat in his grasp. He is squaring up to him, his shoulders thrust forward, their bodies together. The stranger reaches a hand into his pocket. Kelly is running toward them, looking panicked, his eyes going left and right, up and down the street. Todd, no! he says. And that’s when Jen sees the knife. Adrenaline sharpens her vision as she sees it happen. A quick, clean stab. And then everything slows way down: the movement of the arm pulling back, the clothing resisting then releasing the knife. Two white feathers emerge with the blade, drifting aimlessly in the frozen air like snowflakes. Jen stares as blood begins to spurt, huge amounts of it. She must be kneeling down now, because she becomes aware of the little stones of the path cutting round divots into her knees. She’s cradling him, parting his jacket, feeling the heat of the blood as it surges down her hands, between her fingers, along her wrists. She undoes his shirt. His torso begins to flood; the three coin-slot wounds swim in and out of view – it’s like trying to see the bottom of a red pond. She has gone completely cold. No. Her voice is thick and wet as she screams. Jen, Kelly says hoarsely. There’s so much blood. She lays him on her driveway and leans over, looking carefully. She hopes she’s wrong, but she’s sure, for just a moment, that he isn’t here any more. The way the yellowed lamplight hits his eyes isn’t quite right. The night is completely silent, and after what must be several minutes she blinks in shock, then looks up at her son. Kelly has moved Todd away from the victim and has his arms wrapped around him. Kelly’s back is to her, Todd facing her, just gazing down at her over his father’s shoulder, his expression neutral. He drops the knife. It rings out like a church bell as the metal hits the frozen pavement. He wipes a hand across his face, leaving a smear of blood. Jen stares at his expression. Maybe he is regretful, maybe not. She can’t tell. Jen can read almost everyone, but she never could read Todd. Day Zero, just after 01:00 Somebody must have called 999, because the street is suddenly lit up with bright blue orbs. What . . . Jen says to Todd. Jen’s What . . . conveys it all: Who, why, what the fuck? Kelly releases his son, his face pale in shock, but he says nothing, as is often her husband’s way. Todd doesn’t look at her or at his father. Mum, he says eventually. Don’t children always seek out their mother first? She reaches for him, but she can’t leave the body. She can’t release the pressure on the wounds. That might make it worse for everyone. Mum, he says again. His voice is fractured, like dry ground that divides clean in two. He bites his lip and looks away, down the street. Todd, she says. The man’s blood is lapping over her hands like thick bathwater. I had to, he says to her, finally looking her way. Jen’s jaw slackens in shock. Kelly’s head drops to his chest. The sleeves of his dressing gown are covered in the blood from Todd’s hands. Mate, Kelly says, so softly Jen isn’t sure he definitely spoke. Todd. I had to, Todd says again, more emphatically. He breathes out a contrail of steam into the freezing air. There was no choice, he says again, but this time with teenage finality. The blue of the police car pulses closer. Kelly is staring at Todd. His lips – white with lack of blood – mime something, a silent profanity, maybe. She stares at him, her son, this violent perpetrator, who likes computers and statistics and – still – a pair of Christmas pajamas each year, folded and placed at the end of his bed. Kelly turns in a useless circle on the driveway, his hands in his hair. He hasn’t looked at the man once. His eyes are only on Todd. Jen tries to stem the wounds that pulsate underneath her hands. She can’t leave the – the victim. The police are here, but no paramedics yet. Todd is still trembling, with the cold or the shock, she’s not sure. Who is he? Jen asks him. She has so many more questions, but Todd shrugs, not answering. Jen wants to reach to him, to squeeze the answers out of him, but they don’t come. They’re going to arrest you, Kelly says in a low voice. A policeman is running toward them. Look – don’t say anything, all right? We’ll – Who is he? Jen says. It comes out too loudly, a shout in the night. She wills the police to slow down, please slow down, just give us a bit of time. Todd turns his gaze back to her. I . . . he says, and for once, he doesn’t have a wordy explanation, no intellectual posturing. Just nothing, a trailed-off sentence, puffed into the damp air that hangs between them in their final moments before this becomes something bigger than their family. The officer arrives next to them: tall, black stab vest, white shirt, radio held in his left hand. Echo from Tango two four five – at scene now. Ambo coming. Todd looks over his shoulder at the officer, once, twice, then back at his mother. This is the moment. This is the moment he explains, before they encroach completely with their handcuffs and their power. Jen’s face is frozen, her hands hot with blood. She is just waiting, afraid to move, to lose eye contact. Todd is the one who breaks it. He bites his lip, then stares at his feet. And that’s it. Another policeman moves Jen away from the stranger’s body, and she stands on her driveway in her trainers and pajamas, hands wet and sticky, just looking at her son, and then at her husband, in his dressing gown, trying to negotiate with the justice system. She should be the one taking charge. She’s the lawyer, after all. But she is speechless. Totally bewildered. As lost as if she has just been deposited at the North Pole. Can you confirm your name? the first policeman says to Todd. Other officers get out of other cars, like ants from a nest. Jen and Kelly step forward in one motion, but Todd does something, then, just a tiny gesture. He moves his hand out to the side to stop them. Todd Brotherhood, he says dully. Can you tell me what happened? the officer asks. Hang on, Jen says, springing to life. You can’t interview him by the side of the road. Let us all come to the station, Kelly says urgently. And – Well, I stabbed him, Todd interrupts, gesturing to the man on the ground. He puts his hands back in his pockets and steps toward the policeman. So I’m guessing you’d better arrest me. Todd, Jen says. Stop talking. Tears are clogging her throat. This cannot be happening. She needs a stiff drink, to go back in time, to be sick. Her whole body begins to tremble out here in the absurd, confusing cold. Todd Brotherhood, you do not have to say anything, the policeman says, but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned . . . Todd puts his wrists together willingly, like he is in a fucking movie, and he’s cuffed, just like that, with a metallic click. His shoulders are up. He’s cold. His expression is neutral, resigned, even. Jen cannot, cannot, cannot stop staring at him. You can’t do that! Kelly says. Is this a – Wait, Jen says, panicked, to the policeman. We’ll come? He’s just a teen . . . I’m eighteen, Todd says. In there, the policeman says to Todd, pointing at the car, ignoring Jen. Into the radio, he says, Echo from Tango two four five – dry cell prepped, please. We’ll follow you, then, she says desperately. I’m a lawyer, she adds needlessly, though she hasn’t a clue about criminal law. Still, even now, in crisis, the maternal instinct burns as bright and as obvious as the pumpkin in the window. They just need to find out why he did it, get him off, then get him help. That is what they need to do. That is what they will do. We’ll come, she says. We’ll meet you at the station. The policeman finally meets her gaze. He looks like a model. Cut-outs beneath his cheekbones. God, it’s such a cliché, but don’t all coppers look so young these days? Crosby station, he says to her, then gets back into the car without another word, taking her son with him. The other officer stays with the victim, over there. Jen can hardly bear to think about him. She glances, just once. The blood, the expression on the policeman’s face . . . she is sure the man is dead. She turns to Kelly, and she will never forget the look her stoic husband gives her just then. She meets his navy eyes. The world seems to stop turning just for a second and, in the quiet and the stillness, Jen thinks: Kelly looks how it is to be heartbroken. The police station has a white sign out the front advertising itself to the public. MERSEYSIDE POLICE – CROSBY. Behind it sits a squat sixties building, surrounded by a low brick wall. Tides of October leaves have been washed up against it. Jen pulls up outside, just on the double yellows, and stops the engine. Their son’s stabbed somebody – what does a parking ticket matter? Kelly gets out before the car is even stationary. He reaches – unconsciously, she thinks – behind him for her hand. She grasps it like it’s a raft at sea. He pushes one of the double glass doors open and they hurry in across a tired gray linoleum foyer. It smells old-fashioned inside. Like schools, like hospitals, like care homes. Institutions that require uniforms and crap food, the kind of places Kelly hates. I will never, he’d said early on in their relationship, join the rat race. I’ll talk to them, Kelly says shortly to Jen. He is trembling. But it doesn’t seem to be from fear, rather from anger. He is furious. It’s fine – I can lawyer up and do the initial – Where’s the super? Kelly barks to a bald officer manning reception who has a signet ring on his little finger. Kelly’s body language is different. Legs spread widely, shoulders puffed up. Even Jen has only rarely seen him drop his guard like this. In a bored tone, the officer tells them to wait to be seen. You’ve got five minutes, Kelly says, pointing to the clock before throwing himself into a chair across the foyer. Jen sits down next to him and takes his hand. His wedding ring is loose on his finger. He must be cold. They sit there, Kelly crossing and uncrossing his long legs, huffing, Jen saying nothing. An officer arrives in reception, speaking quietly into his phone. It’s the same crime as two days ago – a section 18 wounding with intent. That victim was Nicola Williams, perpetrator AWOL. His voice is so low, Jen has to strain to hear. She sits, just listening. Section 18 wounding with intent is a stabbing. They must be talking about Todd. And a similar crime from two days ago. Eventually, the arresting officer emerges, the tall one with the cheekbones. Jen looks at the clock behind the desk. It’s three thirty, or perhaps four thirty. She doesn’t know whether it’s British Summer Time in here still. It’s disorientating. Your son is staying with us tonight – we’ll interview him soon. Where – back there? Kelly says. Let me in. You won’t be able to see him, the officer says. You are witnesses. Irritation flares within Jen. This sort of thing – exactly this – is why people hate the justice system. It’s like that, is it? Kelly says acidly to the officer. He holds his hands up. Sorry? the officer says mildly. What, so we’re enemies? Kelly! Jen says. Nobody is anybody’s enemy, the officer says. You can speak to your son in the morning. Where is the superintendent? Kelly says. You can speak to your son in the morning. Kelly leaves a loaded, dangerous silence. Jen has seen only a handful of people on the receiving end of these, but still, she doesn’t envy the policeman. Kelly’s fuse usually takes a long time to trip but, when it does, it’s explosive. I’ll call someone, she says. I know someone. She gets her phone out and begins shakily scrolling through her contacts. Criminal lawyers. She knows loads of them. The first rule of law is never to dabble in something you don’t specialize in. The second is never to represent your family. He has said he doesn’t want one, the officer says. He needs a solicitor – you shouldn’t . . . she says. The officer raises his palms to her. Next to her, Jen can feel Kelly’s temper brewing. I’ll just call one, and then he can – she starts. All right, let me back there, Kelly says, gesturing to the white door leading to the rest of the station. That cannot be authorized, the officer says. Fuck. You, Kelly says. Jen stares at him in shock. The officer doesn’t even dignify this with a response, just looks at Kelly in stony silence. So – what now then? Jen says. God, Kelly has told a copper to fuck himself. A public order offense is not the way to defuse this situation. As I’ve already told you, he’ll remain with us overnight, the officer says to her plainly, ignoring Kelly. I suggest you come back tomorrow. His eyes flick to Kelly. You can’t force your son to take a solicitor. We have tried. But he’s a kid, Jen says, though she knows that, legally, he isn’t. He’s just a kid, she says again softly, mostly to herself, thinking of his Christmas pajamas and the way he wanted her to sit up with him recently when he had a vomiting bug. They spent all night in the en suite. Chatting about nothing, her wiping his mouth with a damp flannel. They don’t care about that, or anything, Kelly says bitterly. We’ll come back, in the morning – with a solicitor, Jen says, trying to ameliorate, to peacemake. Feel free. We need to send a team back with you to the house now, he says. Jen nods wordlessly. Forensics. Their house being searched. The lot. Jen and Kelly leave the police station. Jen rubs at her forehead as they go to the car and get in. She blasts the heat on as they sit there. Are we really just going to go home? she says. Sit there while they search? Kelly’s shoulders are tense. He stares at her, black hair everywhere, eyes sad like a poet’s. I have no fucking idea. Jen gazes out of the windshield at a bush glistening with middle-of-the-night autumnal dew. After a few seconds, she puts the car in reverse and drives, because she doesn’t know what else to do. The pumpkin greets them on the windowsill as she parks up. She must have left the candle burning. Forensics have already arrived in their white suits, standing on their driveway like ghosts by the police tape that flutters in the October wind. The puddle of blood has begun to dry at the edges. They’re let in, to their own fucking house, and they sit downstairs, watching the uniformed teams out front, some on their hands and knees doing fingertip searches of the crime scene. They say nothing at all, just hold hands in the silence. Kelly keeps his coat on. Eventually, when the scene of crime officers have gone, and the police have searched and taken Todd’s things, Jen shifts on the sofa so that she’s lying down, and stares up at the ceiling. And that’s when the tears come. Hot and fast and wet. The tears for the future. And the tears for yesterday, and what she didn’t see coming. Day Minus One, 08:00 Jen opens her eyes. She must have come up to bed. And she must have slept. She doesn’t feel like she did either, but she’s in her bedroom, not on the sofa, and it’s now light outside beyond their slatted blinds. She rolls on to her side. Say it isn’t true. She blinks, staring at the empty bed. She’s alone. Kelly will already be up, making calls, she very much hopes. Her clothes litter the bedroom floor as if she evaporated out of them. She steps over them, pulling on jeans and a plain rollneck sweater which makes her look truly enormous but that she loves anyway. She ventures out on to the hallway, standing outside Todd’s empty room. Her son. Spent the night in a police cell. She can’t think about how many more might await him. Right. She can sort this. Jen is an excellent rescuer, has spent all of her life doing just that, and now it’s time to help her son. She can figure this out. Why did he do it? Why did he have a knife with him? Who was the victim, this grown man her son has probably killed? Suddenly Jen can see little clues in Todd in the recent weeks and months. Moodiness. Weight loss. Secrecy. Things she had put down to teenagehood. Just two days ago, he had taken a call, out in the garden. When Jen had asked who it was, he told her it was none of her business, then threw the phone on to the sofa. It had bounced, once, then fallen to the floor, where they’d both looked at it. He had passed it off as a joke, but it hadn’t been, that small temper tantrum. Jen stares and stares at the door to her son’s bedroom. How had she come to raise a murderer? Teenage rage. Knife crime. Gangs. Antifa. Which is it? Which hand have they been dealt? She can’t hear Kelly at all. Halfway down the stairs, she glances out of the picture window, the window that she stood at only hours ago, the moment everything changed. It is still foggy. She is surprised to see the road below bears no stains – the rain and the mist must have washed the blood away. The police have moved on. The police tape has gone. She glances up the street, the edges peppered with trees ablaze with crunchy autumn leaves. But something is strange about what she sees. She can’t work out what. It must just be the memories of last night. Rendering the view sinister, somehow. Slightly off. She hurries downstairs, through their wooden-floored hallway and into the kitchen. It smells of last night in here, before anything happened. Food, candles. Normality. She hears a voice, right above her, a deep male register. Kelly. She looks at the ceiling, confused. He must be in Todd’s room. Searching it, probably. She understands that impulse entirely. The urge to find what the police couldn’t. Kell? she calls out, running back up the stairs, out of breath by the time she reaches the top. We need to get on – which solicitor we should – Three score and Jen! a voice says. It comes from Todd’s room and is unmistakably her son’s. Jen takes a step back so massive it makes her stumble at the top of the stairs. And she’s not imagining it: Todd emerges from the confines of his room, wearing a black T-shirt which says Science Guy on it, and jogging bottoms. He has clearly just woken, and squints down at her, his pale face the only light in the darkness. We haven’t done that one yet, he says with a dimpled grin. I even – I must confess – went on a pun website. Jen can only gape at him. Her son, the killer. There is no blood on his hands. No murderous expression on his face, and yet. What? she says. How are you here? Huh? He really does look just the same as he did. Even in her confusion, Jen is curious. Same blue eyes. Same tousled, black hair. Same tall, slim frame. But he’s committed an unforgivable act. Unforgivable to everyone, except maybe her. How is he here? How is he home? What? he prompts. How did you get back? Todd’s brow flickers. This is weird, even for you. Did Dad get you? Are you on bail? she barks. "On bail?" He raises an eyebrow, a new mannerism. For the past few months, he’s looked different. Slimmer in the body, in the hips, but bloated in the face. With the pallor somebody gets when they are working too much, eating too many takeaways and drinking no water. None of which Jen is aware Todd is doing, but who knows? And then along came this mannerism, acquired just after he met his new girlfriend, Clio. I’m about to meet Connor. Connor. A boy from his year, but another new friend, made only this summer. Jen befriended his mum, Pauline, years ago. She is just Jen’s sort of person: jaded, sweary, not a natural mother, the kind of person who implicitly gives Jen permission to mess up. Jen has always been drawn to these types of people. All of her friends are unpretentious, unafraid to do and say what they think. Just recently, Pauline had said of Connor’s younger brother, Theo: I love him, but because he’s seven, he often acts like a twat. They’d laughed like guilty loons at the school gate. Jen steps forward and looks closely at Todd. No mark of the devil on him, no change behind his eyes, no weapons in the room beyond him. In fact, it looks untouched. How did you get home – and what happened? Home from where? The police station, Jen says plainly. She finds herself keeping a distance from him. Just a step more than usual. She no longer knows what this person – her child, the love of her life – is capable of. Sorry – the police station? he says, evidently amused. Question mark? Todd’s expression twists, nose wrinkling up just like it did when he was a baby. He has two tiny scars left over from the worst of his teenage acne. Otherwise, his face is still childlike, pristine in that beautiful peach-fuzz way of the young. Your arrest, Todd! "My arrest?" Jen can usually tell when her son is lying, and at that moment she registers that he is definitely not. He looks at her with his clear twilight eyes, confusion inscribed across his features. What? she says in barely a whisper. Something is creeping up her spine, some tentative, frightening knowledge. I saw . . . I saw what you did. She gestures to the mid-landing window. And that’s the moment she realizes what’s the matter. It isn’t the scene outside: it’s the window itself. No pumpkin. It’s gone. Jen’s teeth begin to chatter. This can’t be happening. She tears her eyes away from the pumpkin-less windowsill. I saw, she says again. Saw what? His eyes are so like Kelly’s, she finds Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksSuspenseFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
