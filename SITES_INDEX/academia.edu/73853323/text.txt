It identifi es three rationales for client participation (philosophical, pragmatic, and political), along with the limitations surrounding each rationale. It uses social construction theory to examine the historical and ideological underpinnings of organized, institutionally-sanctioned client involvement inside and outside government. In order to enhance the capacity of clients to infl uence service and benefi t systems, their role must evolve through the mutual efforts of government—strengthening client participation policies and independent organizing from the bottom up through community development and advocacy programs. Key words: client participation, mental health system, mental retardation systems, social construction theory, child welfare, parent advocacyDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Review of PsychiatryRecovery in Hong Kong: Service user participation in mental health services2012 • Roger NgDownload Free PDFView PDFMental Health Self-HelpParticipatory Action Research and Evaluation with Mental Health Self-Help Initiatives: A Theoretical Framework2010 • Geoffrey NelsonDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Contributions of Mutual Help Groups for Mental Health Problems to Psychological Well-Being: A Systematic Review2010 • Chris BarkerDownload Free PDFView PDFQualitative Health  …Benefits and Mechanisms of Recovery Among Peer Providers With Psychiatric Illnesses2011 • Jung Yeon YimDownload Free PDFView PDFMoran, G.
