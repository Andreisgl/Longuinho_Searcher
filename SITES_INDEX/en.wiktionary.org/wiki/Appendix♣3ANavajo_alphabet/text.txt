Note: * = not present in the alphabet
The letters á, ą, ą́, é, ę, ę́, í, į, į́, ó, ǫ, ǫ́, ń do not belong to the Navajo alphabet, but they are used in the orthography to show tone and nasalization. Long vowels are written double: aa, áa, aá, áá, etc. The letter x is considered a variant of h, used after s, ts, g, and z to avoid confusion with digraphs. It may also be used after sh and ch to avoid the potential confusion of an h following a digraph containing h. In many texts the infix -h-/-x- is always written -x-.
