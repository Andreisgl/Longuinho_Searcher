This research aimed to develop a mangrove landscape to mitigate the impacts of ocean waves, currents, and inundation due to climate change. The study was conducted in SAL and Cilacap Coast (CC) using the environmental properties and climate change data. The data obtained were analyzed using mapping and trendline analyses. The results showed that mangrove landscaping in Segara Anakan had four zones with Nypa frutican, Rhizophora styllosa, Aegiceras corniculatum, Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia marina, Sonneratia alba identified as the best adaptation of mangrove species.

Mass accumulation rates (MARs) across the Lake Melville System (LMS) were established from 15 sediment cores collected in 2013 and 2014 by fitting excess 210Pb (210Pbex) profiles to a two-layer advection–diffusion model. MARs, validated using 137Cs, varied between 0.04 and 0.41 g cm−2 a−1, and overall decreased with increasing distance from the Churchill River, which drains into Goose Bay, a western extension of Lake Melville. The Churchill River is the greatest source of sediment to the system, but surprisingly, MARs were greatest in western Lake Melville rather than Goose Bay, reflecting the contribution of fine material carried eastward in the Churchill River plume and inputs from nearby tributaries.

Three box-cores located closer to the upwelling area show a general trend of cooling waters taking place in the last 700 years. Since the present upwelling is dependent on local and remote wind regime, a phase of dominating NE winds favors a more effective upward transport of the cold thermocline level South Atlantic CentralWater towards the coast. The intensification in the upwelling regime for the last ca. 700 years can be associated with the strengthening of the NE winds off the area and a possible increase of the Brazil Current mesoscale activity. Nevertheless, the lack of significant correlation of the paleotemperatures and most of sedimentological parameters indicate that upwelling is not the on...Save to LibraryDownloadby Silvia  Sousa•  14  Geology, Oceanography, Multidisciplinary, Mesoscale MeteorologyDispersion of bauxitic red mud in the Gulf of Corinth, GreeceSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Collins•  8  Earth Sciences, Geology, Marine Geology, Marine ScienceLate Early Miocene palaeoenvironmental changes in the North Alpine Foreland BasinSave to LibraryDownloadby Bettina Reichenbacher•  5  Evolutionary Biology, Geology, Paleontology, EcologyEstimating sedimentary environment of a Pleistocene sediment in Kyotango City, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, with the first report of Pseudopodosira kosugii from the Pleistocene series on the Japan Sea CoastSave to LibraryDownloadby 泰介 大塚•  3  Geology, Pleistocene, Sedimentary RockThe Geological Deformation of SedimentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alex Maltman•  2  Geology, Springer EbooksPatagonichnus: a new trace fossil from the Miocene of Patagonia.

The method of the unsupported 210Pb, i.e. whose activity is not derived from the radioactive decay of its 226Ra parent, has been used. Since the activity of the supported 210Pb can be determined from the activity of 226Ra, the unsupported 210Pb activity can be calculated as the difference between 210Pb total and 226Ra activities. The unsupported 210Pb decays with its own half-life time, equal to 22.3 years, so being very suitable to the aim of dating the sediment column we are interested in. The 226Ra activity has been determined through high performance gamma spectrometry with a low-energy detector of 214Pb gamma emission (351.9 keV), after secular equilibrium has been reached.
