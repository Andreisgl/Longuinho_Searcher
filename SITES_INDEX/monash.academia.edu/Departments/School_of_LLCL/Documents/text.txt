Specifically, this articlewill focus on those cinematic manifestations’ attempts to explorepost-war Italian culture, society and political context through theportrayal of some of the most important Italian criminal figures ofthis period. It argues that, while sharing some characteristics suchas the femme fatale, flashback structures and a narrative of betrayal,like its American counterpart the Italian gangster film also presentsa flexibility that show the mutative qualities of the genre. In order toprove this point, this article analyses two gangster films: CarloLizzani’s Bandits in Milan (1968) and Michele Placido’s Romanzocriminale (2005) also through the lens of the viewer’s process ofidentification. By showing how the protagonists and their victimsare represented in these films, and how this intersects with thesocial critique featured in these films, this article revaluates theItalian gangster film as a creative and artistic output that shouldbe analysed beyond its generic conventions.Save to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti and +1Marco Paoli•  3  Italian Cinema, Gangster Film, Film Noir CriticismInvestigating Italy's Past through Historical Crime Fiction, Films, and TV SeriesSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•Investigating Italy's Past through Historical Crime Fiction, Films, and TV SeriesSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•Urban Mobility and Technology in Carlo Lucarelli’s Almost BlueSave to LibraryDownloadby Barbara Pezzotti•The Foundation of the State: Giallo and the RisorgimentoSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•HistoryItalians Do It Differently: Giorgio Scerbanenco’s Appropriation of the American Hard-Boiled NovelProlific Italian crime writer Giorgio Scerbanenco appropriated the conventions of the American hard-boiled novel to put forward a critique of Italian society of the 1960s.

It examines recent events, in Italy and on the international scene, which expose the dramatic escalation of an enduring cultural and social tension between two opposing forces. On the one hand, we live in a moment marked by a strong impetus for social change and an auspicious striving for more equitable gender representation. On the other, this wide-scale global momentum is contrasted by a resistance to shift the balance of power and to alter the status quo. This tension has expressed itself both at institutional and public level, as well as in the private realm. It has been publicly visible in recent episodes of gender-based civil conflict, dismissal and under...Save to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•  3  Social Change, Violence Against Women, Feminism and Social JusticeInspector Salvo MontalbanoSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•ArtBlood on the Table: Essays on Food in International Crime FictionSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•  3  History, Sociology, Nutrition and DieteticsThe Colour of the Rose: Umberto Eco as a Giallo writerSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•Inspector Grazia NegroSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•Bridging the Gap?: Investigating Food and Identity in Transnational Television SeriesSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•  3  Literary Geography, Crime fiction, Utopian LiteratureThe Flâneur Detective as Time Traveller: Social Criticism in the Urban EnvironmentSave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•TransnationalitySave to Libraryby Barbara Pezzotti•
