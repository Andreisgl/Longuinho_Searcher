As distinct from previous calculations, for nucleotides the interaction with neighbours is taken into account up to gradient of convergence equaling 1. The dependences of these variables from the place in the codon and the determinative degree were obtained. The difference of these variables for codons and anticodons is shown.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Theoretical BiologyEvolution of the first genetic cells and the universal genetic code: A hypothesis based on macromolecular coevolution of RNA and proteins2014 • Duncan A RouchDownload Free PDFView PDFBMC Evolutionary BiologyThe enigmatic mitochondrial genome of Rhabdopleura compacta (Pterobranchia) reveals insights into selection of an efficient tRNA system and supports monophyly of Ambulacraria2011 • Martin SchlegelDownload Free PDFView PDFPurine-pyrimidine symmetry, determinative degree and DNASteven DuplijDownload Free PDFView PDFDNA and RNA Modifi cation Enzymes: Structure, Mechanism, Function and EvolutionAmmar ELAKHDARDownload Free PDFView PDFCell theoryR  SDownload Free PDFView PDFMSQs_Biochemistry.pdfZach BrewDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Zhejiang University ScienceDNA sequence representation by trianders and determinative degree of nucleotides2005 • Steven DuplijDownload Free PDFView PDFMSQs BiochemistryPanatda KantasateDownload Free PDFView PDFBASIC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND MECHANISMSmagendira mani  vinayagamDownload Free PDFView PDFDNA, RNA, AND PROTEIN SYNTHESISmagendira mani  vinayagamDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
