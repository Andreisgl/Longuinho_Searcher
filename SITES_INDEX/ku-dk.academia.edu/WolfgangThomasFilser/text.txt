He took with him 19th century archaeological pictures of these places, and photographed the sites from exactly the same place and perspective as the ones made two centuries ago. From the acqueduct at Aspendos to the Sphinx Gate in Galatia, to the Temple of Artemis in Lydia, Schleyer’s beautifully diligent photographs record the contemporary condition of these archaeological wonders. Reproduced alongside the astonishing 19th century pictures, these photographs allow you not only to compare the wear of history on these remains, but they also vividly reflect the culture of Orientalism. In some places, grass has grown over the masonry, or a fully grown tree towers over a courtyard, in others a column or statue have disappeared, while sites such as the Roman theatre at Hierapolis, appear scrupulously restored. Schleyer’s photographs form such exact comparisons, you can trace the patina of time on actual stones and, standing back, on whole landscapes.Ruprecht Schleyer writes about his experiences photographing these sites, and relates the history of those who preceeded him in the 19th century. The exotically dressed figures who stand in these earlier pictures are more than living providers of scale; as Wolfgang Filser explores in his essay, they are actors in the 19th century's Orientalist imagination.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mehrdeutigkeiten. Rahmentheorien und Affordanzkonzepte in der archäologischen Bildwissenschaft: Inhaltsverzeichnisby Elisabeth Guenther, Nikolaus Dietrich, Jacobus Bracker, Wolfgang Thomas Filser, Matthias Grawehr, Martina Sauer, and Sven GuentherDie Mehrdeutigkeit antiker Bilder spielt eine wichtige Rolle in der archäologischen Forschung.

Bislang allerdings manifestierte sie sich vor allem als eine unwägbare Herausforderung bei der historischen Kontextualisierung der Artefakte und Denkmäler. Dies will der interdisziplinäre Band, der aus einer Tagung an der Freien Universität Berlin hervorgegangen ist, ändern: In neun Beiträgen werden die Mehrdeutigkeiten antiker Bilder vom Alten Ägypten über das archaische und klassische Griechenland bis in die römische Kaiserzeit diskutiert. Neue Perspektiven bieten dabei zwei theoretische Modelle: Rahmentheorien und Affordanzkonzepte. Rahmentheorien beschreiben die Strukturierung menschlichen Wissens und die Abhängigkeit der Bilddeutung von den Erfahrungen und Erwartungen der Rezipient*innen. Affordanzen sind Eigenschaften von Objekten, die bestimmte Gebrauchsweisen nahelegen. Auf Bilder übertragen wird darunter deren Potenzial beschrieben, unterschiedliche Deutungen im Rezeptionsprozess anzubieten, und zwar abhängig von den „Rahmen“ der Betrachter*innen und dem jeweiligen Rezeptions- bzw. Gebrauchskontext. Da Bilder gerade auch für die modernen digitalen Kommunikationsformen von größter Bedeutung sind, trägt die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Phänomen der Mehrdeutigkeit dazu bei, den Umgang von Menschen mit Bildern ebenso wie die Beeinflussung von Menschen durch Bilder besser zu verstehen.Vorlage der gleichnamigen Tagung vom 2.-4.11.2018 an der FU Berlin: https://www.topoi.org/event/46051/Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
PapersFrom Paul Schröder's archives on Cyprus, V. The first (?) photographs of Cesnola's Golgoi findsby Stephan G Schmid and Wolfgang Thomas FilserCahier du Centre d'Études Chypriotes 51,  2021During his trips to Cyprus in 1870 and 1873, the German orientalist and diplomat, Paul Schröder, ... more During his trips to Cyprus in 1870 and 1873, the German orientalist and diplomat, Paul Schröder, visited L. Palma di Cesnola’s excavations at Golgoi twice. The first visit, together with Cesnola, took place in spring 1870, very soon after or even during the actual fieldwork. According to his travel notes and diaries, Schröder obtained photographs of the finds during this visit, which he sent to Berlin. This contribution tries to identify these photographs and to put them in the context of the early photographic documentation of Cesnola’s Golgoi finds. It constitutes the fifth chapter on Schröder’s archives,following the ones published by S. G. Schmid in volume 49 (2019) of the Cahiers, and by A. Cannavò and S. G.

Through the study of examples from Attica, Rhodes, and Praeneste, it emerges that artificial grottos of Hellenistic and Roman periods still clearly bear witness to these roots. Already in some sanctuaries of Pan and the Nymphs exist certain installations which relate images and context – i.e. the cave – in a highly conceptual way. These rural sanctuaries emerge as starting points of a long and vivid tradition. The specific iconography of the cave, which probably originated in Attica in the fourth century BCE, is only one piece of this complex puzzle. At the heart of the art of the grotto lie different mimetic practices which were already being applied in the Hellenistic age in a systematic and often combined manner. The question then arises whether through self-referentiality – established through these divergent mimetic practices – a meditation on the very nature of the image should be provoked.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Emulation is the Leitmotif.

He understood that the propensity for emulation has a central role in an economically developed society; more than his famous concept of conspicuous consumption, emulation of the habits of the rich is keeping the wheel of wasting of resources spinning and stabilizes social inequality. Emulation, however, does not require the wasting of great material values. The only thing that counts is that usually those who emulate – by wasting time and money – threaten their social position and enhance the status of those emulated. In fact, emulation of the richer ones is not a choice in certain societies, it is rather a general condition. In this contribultion I try to apply Veblen’s system to the Casa della Fontana Piccola.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mixing Methods -The Use of 3D Techniques at the Ancient Villa of Capo di Sorrentoby Bernhard Fritsch, Steven Götz, and Wolfgang Thomas FilserAccompanying excavation activities in the area of the Roman luxury villa of Capo di Sorrento, 3D ... more Accompanying excavation activities in the area of the Roman luxury villa of Capo di Sorrento, 3D models of the landscape and relevant features have been created using mostly Structure-from-Motion (SfM) since 2015. With this method, it was possible to create a digital surface model of the excavation site combining terrestrial, aerial, and underwater photography. From this 3D model and other, more detailed sub-models of specific objects or areas, various new data were created that greatly enhance excavation documentation and the assessment of features. While some of these data, such as orthophotos generated from SfM models, are now standard practice on excavations, other products require more effort. The research project on the villa of Capo di Sorrento went beyond the results that were obtained from 3D models, and are usually presented as 2D pictures, to expand on the 3D data collected in the field in later work. In particular, the reconstruction of a grotto triclinium based on SfM models is combined with manual and tacheometric documentation to yield far-reaching insights into the architecture, furnishings, and orientation of the rooms on the north side of the pars maritima. Renderings of 3D data are used to simulate the views from certain points. This reconstruction is thus based on both the archaeological features and the specifications of the surface models and as such combines different methods of 3D processing, and fuses digital data with analog research results. Over the course of several excavation campaigns, a corpus of 3D products has grown within the research project. The respective methods of data acquisition, processing and analysis are primarily due to the landscape conditions of the study area. The detailed representation of the rocky subsoil-i.e. the heavily manipulated limestone plateau at the northern end of the cape-above and below water played a central role.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
La Villa Maritima del Capo Di Sorrento.

The aim of the re-investigation of this well-known site is to contribute new archaeological and geo-archaeological data of the pars maritima with its harbor system and the buildings on the slopes above. For this it is important to consider the geological characteristics of the calcareous promontory, on which the villa is built. With the aid of geo-electrical prospecting we are digitally recreating a 3D model of the promontory’s original shape before it was altered by the huge Roman terraces that still dominate the appearance of the Cape of Sorrento today. A new plan has been created in order to correct and complement the original by Mingazzini/Pfister from 1946 and it is developing continuously with every new excavation campaign. New results concerning the villa’s water supply system are presented as well as new indications regarding the architectural and decorative design of the villa. Furthermore, first systematic underwater surveys have shed light on the lavish harbour of the villa, traces of which have been found in several spots along the shore. The preliminary results also permit a safer chronology of the villa based on the discovery of a second or early first century BC previous period to the final destruction of the late first century BC / early first century AD pars maritima and its harbour following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Zu Status und Ambiguität in der Geneleos-Gruppe aus SamosJ. Fabricius – E. Günther (Hrsg.), Mehrdeutigkeiten.

Furthermore, it is one of very few archaic sculptures attributable to a certain artist – Geneleos. It is generally assumed that the persons shown are part of a family extending over two generations with the iconography highlighting the different social role models of its members: mother, father, son, and daughters. In this paper, I will try to question this common reading by proposing alternatives, triggered by the ambiguous iconography of the figures and by the placement of the inscriptions related to them. Feels free to ask me for a pdf.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a photographer he was more interested in the spatial situation of a collection, especially at the moment of transition out of storage to exhibition, than he was in the exact reproduction of beautiful ﬁgures. The pictures he produces are often provoked by the details of older and more recent damage suffered by the otherwise perfect sculptures. Since the casts are not painted, their white to yellow color range is contrasted with the red walls, white ceilings and color scheme of the lamps. What El Dib has captured here is the history of a collection of plaster casts of antique sculptures as that of a medium whose dynamic is repeated in a similar way in the medium of his photography.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Underwater 3D Recording of the Harbour System of the villa maritima at the Cape of Sorrentoby Bernhard Fritsch, Michaela Reinfeld, and Wolfgang Thomas Filser CHNT 23, 2018 – Proceedings,  2020The appearance and magnificent design of Roman seaside villas, the villae maritimae, is-apart fro... more The appearance and magnificent design of Roman seaside villas, the villae maritimae, is-apart from the extant architectonic remains-at least partly known to us on the basis of Roman wall paintings. Although it is doubtful that the paintings allow immediate conclusions concerning really existing villas, nevertheless, the perspective on the maritime villas in paintings and ancient texts focuses on the real life experience of somebody approaching a maritime villa in the appropriate manner, i.e. from aboard a ship sailing along the coast. The ideal "villascape" is formed basically by a luxuriously designed villa, lavishly constructed moles and gardens bordering the shore. Underwater archaeological research on the Roman villa at the Cape of Sorrento resulted in clear evidence of such a villa with two representative harbours, which served both the supply of the villa and the reception of high dignitaries. First, the villa and the rock on which it is built were documented photographically by a drone and terrestrial photographs, and a three-dimensional model of the building was created. By using "structure-from-motion" (SfM) under water as well, the two harbours of the villa were also documented and considered with regard to the interpretation of the whole complex for the first time. The resulting three-dimensional model of the entire complex provides information about the architectural design of the villa as well as the effort that was spent on the construction. All data generated during the excavation campaigns are available in an online repository at Edition Topoi 1 according to the principles of open access. Thus, the research data on the villa are published, secured in the long term and citable. In addition, the open structure of the repository allows other researchers to freely use the data and metadata. Furthermore, the data can be easily integrated into other software packages for further analysis via an interface.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The detailed representation of the rocky subsoil-i.e. the heavily manipulated limestone plateau at the northern end of the cape-above and below water played a central role.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim of the re-investigation of this well-known site is to contribute new archaeological and geo-archaeological data of the pars maritima with its harbor system and the buildings on the slopes above. For this it is important to consider the geological characteristics of the calcareous promontory, on which the villa is built. With the aid of geo-electrical prospecting we are digitally recreating a 3D model of the promontory’s original shape before it was altered by the huge Roman terraces that still dominate the appearance of the Cape of Sorrento today. A new plan has been created in order to correct and complement the original by Mingazzini/Pfister from 1946 and it is developing continuously with every new excavation campaign. New results concerning the villa’s water supply system are presented as well as new indications regarding the architectural and decorative design of the villa. Furthermore, first systematic underwater surveys have shed light on the lavish harbour of the villa, traces of which have been found in several spots along the shore. The preliminary results also permit a safer chronology of the villa based on the discovery of a second or early first century BC previous period to the final destruction of the late first century BC / early first century AD pars maritima and its harbour following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Zu Status und Ambiguität in der Geneleos-Gruppe aus SamosJ. Fabricius – E. Günther (Hrsg.), Mehrdeutigkeiten.

Furthermore, it is one of very few archaic sculptures attributable to a certain artist – Geneleos. It is generally assumed that the persons shown are part of a family extending over two generations with the iconography highlighting the different social role models of its members: mother, father, son, and daughters. In this paper, I will try to question this common reading by proposing alternatives, triggered by the ambiguous iconography of the figures and by the placement of the inscriptions related to them. Feels free to ask me for a pdf.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a photographer he was more interested in the spatial situation of a collection, especially at the moment of transition out of storage to exhibition, than he was in the exact reproduction of beautiful ﬁgures. The pictures he produces are often provoked by the details of older and more recent damage suffered by the otherwise perfect sculptures. Since the casts are not painted, their white to yellow color range is contrasted with the red walls, white ceilings and color scheme of the lamps. What El Dib has captured here is the history of a collection of plaster casts of antique sculptures as that of a medium whose dynamic is repeated in a similar way in the medium of his photography.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Underwater 3D Recording of the Harbour System of the villa maritima at the Cape of Sorrentoby Bernhard Fritsch, Michaela Reinfeld, and Wolfgang Thomas Filser CHNT 23, 2018 – Proceedings,  2020The appearance and magnificent design of Roman seaside villas, the villae maritimae, is-apart fro... more The appearance and magnificent design of Roman seaside villas, the villae maritimae, is-apart from the extant architectonic remains-at least partly known to us on the basis of Roman wall paintings. Although it is doubtful that the paintings allow immediate conclusions concerning really existing villas, nevertheless, the perspective on the maritime villas in paintings and ancient texts focuses on the real life experience of somebody approaching a maritime villa in the appropriate manner, i.e. from aboard a ship sailing along the coast. The ideal "villascape" is formed basically by a luxuriously designed villa, lavishly constructed moles and gardens bordering the shore. Underwater archaeological research on the Roman villa at the Cape of Sorrento resulted in clear evidence of such a villa with two representative harbours, which served both the supply of the villa and the reception of high dignitaries. First, the villa and the rock on which it is built were documented photographically by a drone and terrestrial photographs, and a three-dimensional model of the building was created. By using "structure-from-motion" (SfM) under water as well, the two harbours of the villa were also documented and considered with regard to the interpretation of the whole complex for the first time. The resulting three-dimensional model of the entire complex provides information about the architectural design of the villa as well as the effort that was spent on the construction. All data generated during the excavation campaigns are available in an online repository at Edition Topoi 1 according to the principles of open access. Thus, the research data on the villa are published, secured in the long term and citable. In addition, the open structure of the repository allows other researchers to freely use the data and metadata. Furthermore, the data can be easily integrated into other software packages for further analysis via an interface.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The sculpture depicts a human male clad in stag’s fur, which leads to the conclusion that it is the mythic hunter Actaeon. On the grounds of formal and iconographic observations, it is argued that the figure must have been part of a more extensive sculptural group representing a certain moment in the myth of Diana and Actaeon, hitherto unknown in three-dimensional ancient art. Complementary to this conclusion is a detailed ekphrasis in Apuleius’s Metamorphosis where the author describes a specific group in marble depicting Diana and Actaeon that neatly fits the characteristics of the statue treated here. On this basis, the interdependence of literary and rich two-dimensional pictorial sources of the myth in question are discussed. Another main aspect treated here is the way in which the observer’s attention is drawn to the artwork by combining natural elements and artificially worked materials, as well as citing different statuary types and styles. This consequently leads to a comparison with similar Hellenistic and Roman statuary groups that employ a broad range of different visual tactics in order to enhance the effect on the beholder. Although the original context of this unique statue is totally unknown, it surely belonged to the luxurious furnishings of a Roman – maybe imperial – villa of the region.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Der Grund hierfür liegt zum einen im Anspruch, die Gesamtheit der hellenistischen Skulptur zu erfassen, andererseits aber darin, dass hellenistische Kunst als Phänomen komplexer und heterogener Gesellschaften verstanden wird und sich nicht erschöpfend nur mit Blick auf Kunstzentren und Meisterwerke erklären lässt.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

While older researchdescribed faux materials and techniques (e.g.painted marbles or mosaics) primarily ineconomic terms, i.e. as cheaper substitutes,recent research has drawn attention to the ownaesthetics of transmaterial design – especiallywhen the skeuomorph reveals itself as a visualfiction. The ambition of the conference is toinvestigate the modes of transmaterial designbeyond established material hierarchies. We wantto ask how skeuomorph artifacts can beunderstood as components of complex designsystems, allowing for a better understanding ofthe (culture-specific) mechanics of making andperceiving objects.This perspective on the objects’ design principlesopens up the possibility of a comparative viewwithin larger geographical and temporaldimensions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Filser)This contribution is going to shed light on the different components that together form the art of the Hellenistic and Roman grotto. Against the comunis opinio I will try to prove that the beginnings of the art forms in question already lie in the Classical period. Already in some sanctuaries of Pan and the Nymphs in Greece (Attica, Delphi) we can observe certain installations which relate images and context – i.e. the rock walls of the cave – in a highly conceptual way. These sanctuaries emerge as starting points of a long and vivid tradition. Then, by means of a case study of the “art system” of Praeneste I will show how grotto art took on singular iconographies in one specific contest: the sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
