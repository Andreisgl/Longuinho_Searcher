Regardless if your current goal or situation is large or small, by learning to intuitively read these cards you'll have the answers you seek. Tarot cards are meant to trigger your own intuition and I fully believe that everyone can and should learn to read for themselves.  This form of divination should never come with a one-size-fits-all type of guidance since everyone and every situation is different. What you see in the cards will be completely different than what someone else may see—and this is how it's supposed to be. I'll teach you to read the cards intuitively, so you can reap the many benefits of their hidden messages. Very soon, you could even read for others and help offer guidance to friends, relatives, and clients.  I've also included several exercises that will help you strengthen your intuition, get to know your cards better, predict future events, uncover obstacles that hold you back, and learn how to recognize opportunities and higher guidance when it comes your way. I look forward to helping you along on your spiritual journey!Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextOccult & ParanormalBody, Mind, & SpiritPersonal GrowthLanguageEnglishPublisherIntuitive Living PublishingRelease dateJul 20, 2015ISBN9781516346806Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleKWAuthorKelly WallaceKelly Wallace is a best selling multi-published spiritual and self-help author, radio show host, and has been a professional psychic counselor for over twenty years.

In the past, the tarot was shrouded in mystery and sometimes fear, but now many people realize that these cards can offer insight and guidance, growth, and healing. They can even help you uncover your past lives and strengthen your natural psychic abilities. Whether you’re looking for your soulmate, a new career, wondering if you should move or could travel, or need to solve a problem, the tarot can help. Regardless if your current goal or situation is large or small, by learning to intuitively read these cards you’ll have the answers you seek. Tarot cards are meant to trigger your intuition and I fully believe that everyone can and should learn to read for themselves. If you do decide to get a reading from a professional, the very best readers won’t offer you time-worn meanings that you can find in any traditional book. Instead, they’ll look beyond the standard definitions of the cards and find hidden meanings that are unique to you and your situation. This form of divination should never come with a one-size-fits-all type of guidance since everyone and every situation is different. What you see in the cards will be completely different than what someone else may see—and this is how it’s supposed to be. Later in the book, I’ll teach you the traditional card meanings, just so you’ll have a point of reference in case you get stuck. After all, it’s sometimes difficult to read for ourselves. I’ll also teach you to read the cards intuitively, so you can reap the many benefits of their hidden messages. Very soon, you could even read for others and help offer guidance to friends, relatives, and clients. I've also included several exercises that will help you strengthen your intuition, get to know your cards better, predict future events, uncover obstacles that hold you back, and learn how to recognize opportunities and higher guidance when it comes your way. Now, let's get started... How Tarot Readings Can Help TAROT CARDS ARE EXTREMELY helpful for learning about yourself and how you handle life’s struggles and lessons. It helps with self-awareness and often uncovers a different point of view regarding a problem or situation. They can clarify past events, and help you understand why the events took place. Another thing they're helpful for is giving insight into how to avoid making the same mistakes again, or even how to make positive events happen again. The cards can also predict possible future events. This way you can steer toward it or away from it, depending on what you’d like the outcome to be. Sometimes, just knowing ahead of time that an event could happen is enough to change your path and the future result. It’s that sense of awareness, of being awake, that helps you to make positive changes in your life. There are many different reasons people seek out a tarot reading or learn to read the cards themselves. As I just mentioned, the tarot can help you to better understand the past, bring the present into focus, and see what your current or future options are. It can also assist you with mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. Tarot cards can be used as a method for understanding and healing your relationships, to help guide your career or education, and so much more.
