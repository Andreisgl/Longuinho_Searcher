Barry M CraigPontificio Ateneo Sant'Anselmo,  Faculty of Liturgy,  AlumnusEarly Christianity+16Post-graduate studies were undertaken at the Pontifical Liturgical Institute (Sant’Anselmo) in Rome, gaining the License in Sacred Liturgy in 2001, and defending the Doctoral dissertation in 2008 before its publication in May 2011 through Studia Anselmiana.A priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns, I serve as a Consultor to the National Liturgical Council (Australia), and am a member of the following associations:Societas LiturgicaAustralian Academy of LiturgyAsia-Pacific Early Christian Studies SocietyAssociation Internationale d’Études Patristiques = International Association of Patristic StudiesNorth American Patristics SocietySociety of Biblical LiteratureAddress: Malanda, Queensland, Australialess113 Followers39 FollowingTotal Views ;98 Public MentionsFollowFollowingall2 Books8 Papers10 Scripture reflections3 Conference PresentationsBooksFractio Panis: A History of the Breaking of Bread in the Roman RiteThe four biblical versions of the institution narrative give a simple description of the ritual o... more The four biblical versions of the institution narrative give a simple description of the ritual observed by Jesus, who, while at table took a loaf, praised or blessed or gave thanks, broke the loaf, and gave it to his disciples saying, “Take! Eat! This is my body”. In this description, breaking is the only preparatory act between blessing and distribution. By contrast, the eighth-century Ordo Romanus I has a more involved series of preparatory and communion rites, of which breaking the loaves is prominent. These rites were even more complicated in the Missale Romanum of 1570, but only a single wafer-host would be broken, unseen by anyone other than the priest and at a different point in the sequence of elements. Four hundred years later in the newly reformed Missale Romanum the fraction is in yet a different place, but it is again conspicuous. Clearly these rites in the Roman liturgy have undergone much movement or upheaval, even if so slowly as to go unnoticed.The historical data show that a new sort of fraction came into existence, prompted by confusion and misunderstanding, while the original practice slowly vanished due to other forces. Any adequate history of the celebration of the Eucharist in the Roman rite must acknowledge this structural upheaval, and be able to explain it.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is then noted or dismissed as a non-scriptural addition to the text. Why did it become so predominant, and why in these specific forms? This paper, adding to my previous research on the development of the institution narratives, explores this element from its first appearance in Patristic commentaries on the feedings of the multitudes and in the anaphoras from "Apostolic Constitutions", revealing yet again the influence of the feedings of the multitudes in Eucharistic thought and texts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Lacking an event-defining start, Advent in the Roman Rite is named as the four Sundays before Christmas, thus lasting twentyone to twenty-eight days, while in the Ambrosian Rite of Milan it is six Sundays. The elements common to each Sunday&#39;s gospel reading in the Roman Rite&#39;s three-year Lectionary reveal this sequence: (1) Stay awake; (2) John the Baptist is a voice crying in the wilderness &#39;Prepare a way for the Lord&#39;; (3) John the Baptist is a witness to Christ; (4) Annunciation to Joseph (A), or to Mary (B), or the Visitation (C)-in any case Mary is with child. Although this year, B, we follow the Gospel according to Mark, after reading its opening on the Second Sunday of Advent we do not read from it again until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord (4 January 2015).

Many parables are similarly named in ways that appear to miss the point of their telling, but this tendency actually points to how we engage with all stories, and the power of Christ&#39;s storytelling. We need to realise that the mind does not distinguish between reality and fiction, for all viewing and understanding of the world takes place in our heads. Thus we respond emotionally and even physically in the same way to what we see unfolding, be it real-time events in the world or depicted events, historical or fictional, as mediated by actors and machinery at the movies. In the same way, we do not distinguish between reports of actual happenings and fictional stories.

Non sum dignus/digna: Pressing out the Female VoiceEarly Christian Studies Series,  2014The English version of the communicant’s preparatory prayer in the Roman rite is without gender a... more The English version of the communicant’s preparatory prayer in the Roman rite is without gender and is equally suited to either sex, but in the Latin the speaker self-identifies as male. Its imposition on female communicants in the Roman rite has been challenged since the 1500s, even before it entered the typical edition of the Missale Romanum in 1634. This was an unintended consequence of the printing press enabling the propagation of uniform texts, coupled with a rubrical fundamentalism that grew with it. The history of the prayer is examined here, from Patristic origins to mediaeval prayer books. This history indicates a greater sensitivity to the female voice in the early centuries, a voice suppressed by technology, and a sensitivity that struggles to find its proper place again.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Celebrating the reformed Communion Rite: From practical exclusion to formal inclusionBy 1962, the Roman Catholic Communion rite in the Ordo Missae was recognized as badly in need of ... more By 1962, the Roman Catholic Communion rite in the Ordo Missae was recognized as badly in need of reform: the reception of Communion by the faithful was not treated as a normative part of the Mass, and most times only the priest received, while people often received outside Mass. Even when they received during Mass, a separate Communion rite based on that of giving Communion to the sick was used, and the priest said the preparatory prayers on their behalf. The Vatican II reforms successfully restored the people to their rightful role in the Communion rites by reordering the whole section, restoring the ancient Breaking of Bread (the Fractio panis), returning the Lamb of God chant to its proper place and function, and integrating the full participation of all communicants. This presentation covered the history, the genius of the reform, and its proper practice.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Going Before and Conducting Along the Way: The baptized and the elect in the ScrutiniesThe prayers in the Roman Missal for the celebration of the Scrutinies richly draw on biblical all... more The prayers in the Roman Missal for the celebration of the Scrutinies richly draw on biblical allusions. However, because the elect are ordinarily to be dismissed before the Liturgy of the Eucharist, since not yet being members of the Body they cannot participate in its action, the prayers over the offerings and after Communion are usually careful (at least in the Latin) in how they refer to communicants and the elect. This presentation explores both the biblical allusions and the theology of these prayers so as to develop a richer understanding of liturgical participation as the exercise of the common baptismal priesthood, and what this means for assisting the elect along the way.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Walking Dead, or Snatched from the World: a trace of Enoch in the Roman Euchology? Preliminary findingsThe ambiguous reference of Genesis 5:24 to Enoch’s early end (aged only 365 years) contributed to... more The ambiguous reference of Genesis 5:24 to Enoch’s early end (aged only 365 years) contributed to later fascination about those claimed to have been taken into heaven without dying, as found in both Jewish and Christian apocrypha. However, Enoch is a source of some awkwardness for Christian thought. Any fascination with him must have waned early in Western Christianity and he is not mentioned at all in the Roman euchology. Among the additions to the Missale Romanum in 2002 is a slightly modified Prayer over People (Tuere, Domine, supplices tuos) derived from the Sacramentarium Veronense that has a reference to the walking dead. This paper examines that prayer as a possible witness to an early use of the Enoch tradition applied to the martyrs.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
