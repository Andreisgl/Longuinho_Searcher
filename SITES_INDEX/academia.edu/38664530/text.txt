Tyler Sergent2019, Brill Companion to the Christian Tradition 84. Leiden: BrillA Companion to William of Saint-Thierry provides eight new studies on this noted twelfth-century Cistercian writer by some of the most prolific English-language William scholars from North America and Europe and is structured around William’s life, thought, and influence. A Benedictine abbot who became a Cistercian monk, William of Saint-Thierry (c. 1085-1148) lived through the first half of the twelfth century, a time of significant reform within western Christian monasticism. Although William was directly involved in these reforming efforts while at the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Thierry, his lasting legacy in Christian tradition comes through his written works, many as a Cistercian monk, that showcase his keen intellect, creative thinking, and at times profound insight for spiritual life and its fulfillment.

Tyler SergentIn order to address the question of William’s sources and influences, this book chapter provides an historiographical overview of the scholarly debates surrounding the question of his sources, citing key protagonists and their ultimate findings, and then uses two key terms in William’s writings—ratio fidei (reason of faith) and fruitio (enjoyment)—to suggest some additional authors who may well have provided source material for William’s understanding of these two terms. Findings conclude that William of Saint-Thierry read and gleaned terms and concepts from earlier patristic and medieval sources (primarily from the West but also from the Greek East in Latin translation), while at the same time, he applied these terms judiciously and creatively for his own purposes to express and explicate his overall teaching on the soul’s journey toward ultimate union with God.Download Free PDFView PDFUnity of Spirit: Studies on William of Saint-Thierry in Honor of E.

Collegeville, MN: Cistercian Publications"Unitas Spiritus and the Originality of William of Saint-Thierry"2015 • F. Tyler SergentWilliam of Saint-Thierry, a Benedictine abbot who became a Cistercian monk, was active in monastic reforms of 12th century Reims, France. His use of inherited language reveals some evidence of his literary sources and influences, yet his use of that language also demonstrates his creative and original thought. The phrase "unitas spiritus" (unity of spirit) appears in the Latin version of the bible and is used many times throughout the subsequent centuries up to William's own day. The term appears with only three different meanings: 1) intra-trinitarian unity, 2) unity within the church or monastic community, and 3) mystical union between the soul and God. William is the first to use this term with the meaning of spiritual union with God and thus adds a new significance to the term original to him.Download Free PDFView PDFOpen TheologyConflict and Authority: William of Saint-Thierry and Peter Abelard as Readers of Origen2021 • Carmen Angela  CvetkovicDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Pious Jackal and the Pseudo-Woman: Doctrines of Deification in Medieval FranceJohn ArblasterDownload Free PDFView PDFThe monastic conversion of Bernard of Clairvaux and its significance for Cistercian beginnings, ca. 1098-ca. 1128 (PhD University of Sydney, 2016 [2015])Joseph Ewan Millan-ColeThis PhD dissertation examined diverse narrative, legislative, and epistolary texts concerning conversion and leadership patterns in new religious communities of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with particular reference to Bernard of Clairvaux and early Cistercian monasticism. Congregations such as the Fonte Avellanesi, the Grandmontines, the Premonstratensians, and the Benedictines of Molesme were analysed to provide comparative perspectives. The thesis described the eleventh-century background of Cistercian asceticism and the secular contexts for Bernard of Clairvaux's early career. It examined the evidence on his extreme and idiosyncratic asceticism and situated his practices within the context of submission to abbatial and episcopal governance..Download Free PDFView PDFA Fresh Look at William of St. Thierry’s Excerpts from the Books of Blessed Ambrose on the Song of Songs (Prepub)Mark DelCogliano"A Fresh Look at William of St. Thierry’s Excerpts from the Books of Blessed Ambrose on the Song of Songs," in F.

Naturally, we do not intend to provide a complete overview, which would be utterly impossible within the constraints of one article. Nor is it this contribution's intention to identify Ruusbroec's literary or theological sources. Indeed, detailed research into Ruusbroec's sources has yet to be conducted. The intention of this contribution is merely to explore the mystical-spiritual landscape, and to indicate a number of important elements.Download Free PDFView PDFLaughter & Power in the Twelfth CenturyThe Making of Powerful Laughter, c.1100-12002019 • Peter JonesDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of the Society of Architectural Historians "Medieval Architectural Theory, the Sacred Economy, and the Public Presentation of Monastic Architecture: The Classic Cistercian Plan," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 78 (2019) 259-275.2019 • Conrad RudolphThe Cistercian abbey church plan with its flat east end--the famous "Bernardine plan"--is one of the most distinctive and written about church plans of all of medieval architecture, and has traditionally been thought to owe its origins to the architectural standards of Bernard of Clairvaux (the leading ecclesiastical politician of Europe) and to the overriding concern of simplicity. However, this view appears to have largely come about from the influence of modern architecture on modern scholars. Instead, it can be shown by reading this plan--in conjunction with the Cluniac apse-echelon plan and the well-known pilgrimage plan--through the monastic sacred economy, through a close understanding of contemporary accounts, and especially with reference to current monastic architectural theory (particularly regarding materials, craftsmanship, and public access), that the "Bernardine plan" is not really by Bernard at all but is better thought of as "the classic Cistercian plan," a compromise plan of lower spiritual standards, aimed at a broader institutional acceptance.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
