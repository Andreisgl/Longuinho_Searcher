As a result, the subsequent 1971 National Culture Congress (NCC) and the Islamization Policy undertaken by the government in the late 1970s had great influence on art practices in Malaysia, especially during the 1980s. These policies could be seen as an official attempt to shape the Malaysian identity, especially in terms of visual art in post-Independence Malaysia. The first part of this article will discuss the indirect consequences of the 1971 National Culture Policy and several Islam-centred policies since the late 1970s and how several assertions were made through a few writings about Malaysian art: that only certain modern art forms, aligned with the rhetoric of national agendas, were produced and exhibited in the late 1970s until the mid-1990s. This paper will problematize the assertion by discussing some disjuncture and inconsistencies in relation to this narrative of Malaysian art. Thus, this paper will argue how, despite the general perception that the National Culture Congress (NCC) and the Islamization Policy had great influence on art practices in Malaysia, a deeper examination of exhibitions revealed that art-making by most artists still depended on the artists' own endeavours and own modern artistic practice. Nevertheless, as this paper will also highlight, this period is an important attempt in decolonializing modern art in Malaysia by ways of state and institutional support, albeit its limited success.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSENI MODEN as an Evolving Term and Practice in Malaysian ArtSarena AbdullahA paper for GLOBAL CONVERSATIONS Papers to commemorate five years of the CAA-GETTY INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM CAA Annual Conference States of America Global Conversations I-IVDownload Free PDFView PDF[Proceeding] “Contextualizing Abstraction and Abstract Expressionist Art in Malaysia” 5th  International Conference on Southeast Asia (ICONSEA 2013), 13th -- 14th December 2013, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur.Sarena AbdullahDownload Free PDFView PDF(A Working) Bibliography On Malaysia (and SEA Art)  (updated 31/12/2020)Sarena AbdullahDownload Free PDFView PDF[JOURNAL] Art Criticisms Versus Art Writings: The Malaysian Situation KEMANUSIAAN Vol. 19, No. 2, (2012), 63–78Sarena AbdullahDownload Free PDFView PDFTerminologies of "Modern" and "Contemporary" "Art" in Southeast Asia's Vernacular LanguagesChairat PolmukDownload Free PDFView PDFA Comprehensive History of Malaysian Art2002 • Syasha NyssaDownload Free PDFView PDFABSENTEEISM OF MALAYSIAN IDENTITY IN ART IN THE EARLY YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE   JATI, Vol 15, Issue 1, (Kuala Lumpur: Universiti Malaya, 2010)Sarena Abdullah""This paper discusses the shaping of modern art identity in Malaysia during the 1950s and 1960s. It frames or investigates the development of modern art in terms of Malaysia�s plural society. While writings by Malaysian art historians such as Redza Piyadasa highlights that Malaysian modern art only in terms of its linear development, this paper attempts to discuss the early development of modern art in Malaysia as being influenced either directly or indirectly by the political and social conditions of Malaysia, therefore shifting ways of investigating Malaysia art in a wider context of Malaysia�s cultural and plural studies. Focusing on Malaysian fine arts in the 1950s and 1960s, this paper suggests the ways that Malaysia�s early form of plural society had influenced the early modern art development among artists in groups such as the Nanyang, Wednesday Art Group (WAG) and Angkatan Pelukis Semenanjung (APS). Keywords: modern art, plural society, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Wednesday Art Group (WAG) and Angkatan Pelukis Semenanjung (APS) ""Download Free PDFView PDFChanging Approaches: Installations Produced in the Malaysian Art WorldSarena AbdullahArtworks in the form of " installation art " have become a widespread artistic activity in the current art world. In the context of the Malaysian art, the term has been initially used to describe a few artworks produced during the period of the 1990s (despite being mostly categorised as mixed media). This paper examines the evolution of installation art in the Malaysian art scene and discusses several early works that can be proposed as the early impetus towards installation art in Malaysian artistic practices. Clear historical outlines and assertions on the evolution of installation art demand a different nature of investigation. However, this paper is only limited to examining three concurrent domains or significant turning points in order to give a more lucid insight into the evolution of installation art as an artistic practice in Malaysia. The three domains that this paper will elucidate are (1) the two-dimensional and three-dimensional engagements or contestations during the 1970s, (2) Young Contemporaries Award (YCA) as a platform for installation art engagements and subsequently, (3) emergence of site-specific installation art projects during the late 1990s.Download Free PDFView PDFBumi Larangan: Zulkifli DahlanCircumventing the 1980s Along Zulkifli Dahlan's Meandering Lines2017 • Tan Zi HaoDownload Free PDFView PDFBerita Malaysia/Singapore/Brunei Studies Group Association for Asian Studies[SPECIAL ARTICLE] Modernities Through Art and Design: Printing Press as a Source of Examining Penang’s Modernity 2015 • Sarena AbdullahDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
