Just brainstorming. More on the talk page.
Wikimedia.org is currently a portal with logos to our projects.
This page is a brainstorming proposal for the following idea:
Change meta's name to www.wikimedia.org
Merge various cross-project content into www.wikimedia.org
Use namespaces to create semantic structure
Spend UI/UX resources to make simple design changes across the board to improve usability / discoverability of information

1 Why
2 Why not
3 Wikis to supersede
4 Namespaces
5 Process
Why[edit]
Current wikimedia.org is arguably ineffective use of central brand portal
Simple, memorable address
Opportunity to create clean design and information architecture
Opportunity to sensibly merge various wikis into a single multi-purpose wiki. Benefits of the sensible merge are:
In day-to-day use, it's easier to search one wiki for a document, than two. For instance, many outreach materials live on Meta, in addition to those on Outreach.
â€¦
Why not[edit]
Check out the talk page for discussion about possible negative consequences. Nutshell:
Need to protect Meta as its own unique space with distinct culture, content & community
Wikis to supersede[edit]
meta.wikimedia.org (renamed)
strategy.wikimedia.org
outreach.wikimedia.org
Perhaps: Subsets of various other wikis
Namespaces[edit]
Research: for research projects
Proposal: for proposals/ideas
Grant: for grantmaking
Outreach: for outreach hub and planning pages
Bookshelf: for outreach resources (outreach:Bookshelf type stuff)
Report: for reports
Archive: for documents kept for historical interest only
Perhaps:
Event: for events
Wikimania: for Wikimanias
Tech: for technical pages spread across mediawiki.org/wikitech.wikimedia.org/labsconsole.wikimedia.org which aren't strictly related to MediaWiki development and documentation.
Journal: for a peer-reviewed Journal
Process[edit]
Rename meta.wikimedia.org to www.wikimedia.org (meta URLs should redirect) -- see considerations in bugzilla:19986 and check which ones would apply here
Start copying content from merged wikis using cross-wiki import
Any extensions used on wikis need to be supported on the new wiki; i.e., Strategy has DPL enabled.
Liquid Threads content will either have to be flattened, or Liquid Threads enabled on a per-page basis
At point of no return, mark merged wikis as read-only and add prominent "we've moved" message
Key pages (or all pages) should have cross-wiki automatic redirect enabled. Brochures, external sites, etc. advise newbies to go to certain key pages; upon their first arrival, they should not have to contend with a UI problem. For instance, outreach:GLAM/Newsletter (and redirects that point there) are linked in many places on the web, in private email messages, etc. GLAM personnel seeking the newsletter should not have to deal with a soft redirect when they first enter the site.
Identify key entry points (main page, namespace indexes, etc.) and iteratively implement redesigns
