Abstract
                    The International Conference held in 1884 at Washington defined a universal time as the mean solar time at the Greenwich meridian (GMT). Now, the Universal Time, version UT1, is strictly defined as proportional to the angle of rotation of the Earth in space. In this evolution, the departure of UT1 from GMT does not exceed one or two seconds. This is quite negligible when compared with the departure between the solar time and the legal time of citizens, which may exceed two hours without raising protests.
