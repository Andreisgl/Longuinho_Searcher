Large projects[edit]
A first milestone has been reached on New Year's Eve, 2006: The first volume of the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie has completely been transcribed. Every article from this and the second volume has (as of december 2007) at least once been proofread. Using OCR the rest will be done very faster.
Another large work, the Martina - a 15th century verse epos by Hugo von Langenstein consisting of almost 30,000 verses - was completely transcribed and proofreaded twice. The last work steps occurred in January 2007.
Implementing Proofread 2 was a huge success. We're second in usage after fr.
One of our coworkers, Felistoria, discovered a by then unknown baroque print Hundert Grab-Schrifften which was transcribed and proofread very fast.

Wikisource in French language has worked a lot on the quality of the documents. It now hosts works from more than a thousand authors. (The 1000th author was Alfred Marshall, a British economist). On June 13th we have 27 368 texts published. Our 10 admins include 3 bureaucrats, and 1 dev (the one who has made the wonderful Proofreader's Page extension which we have already applied to 52 books). Other projects do well too : the Molière project has validated 8 plays out of 33 ; the Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française du XIe au XVIe siècle has finished the letter A of its 10th (and last) volume and begins its Bs. We have lots of other projects being realized and efficient contributors and we have been in touch with ELG and might have some kind of partnership with them too.

The Armenian Wikisource was created on November 24, 2007. Import of pages from the test project on wikisource.org was completed on November 25, 2007. With the imported texts, the Armenian Wikisource was ranked 35th with 501 pages (these include 36 author pages, which will be moved to a separate namespace soon). -- Teak 15:39, 26 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
On December 15, 4 new namespaces (with the linked discussion namespaces) were created in the Armenian Wikisource: Author(100), Portal(102), Page(104), Index(106). This allowed the author pages to be moved to a separate namespace, and thus eliminate them from the text-count. On December 18, 2007 the first proofread pages appeared on hywikisource ― a 4-page article by Hovhannes Tumanyan. ― Teak 22:08, 18 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]

The Italian Wikisource has reached 5,000 text units with Artaserse/Atto terzo/Scena VIII. 555 23:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
February: bold refurbishing of Edittols to help newbies and longtime users to insert important tags.
The Italian Wikisource has reached 5,300 text units. IPork 15:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
March: After an all February long  census for unsourced texts (thanks to Torredibabele, and a spamming campaign to alert all ancient contributors to specify the origin of their unsourced texts, a thorough purging session has begun to delete every usourced unverifiable contribution. Less material but trustworthy.
April: Our Bureaucrat and JavaScriptMaster iPork prepared a complete set of scripts for users' monobook.js. A noteworthy achievement is this set which gathers many commands inside dropdown menus which change according to each namespace.
May: Three new Wikiprojects took off: Scientific texts, Mathematics and Theater
June
On June, 4th it.Wikisource chose its seventh administrator: Snark.
A giant leap in categorization: by using categorized redirects all the previously uncategorized poems included in poetry collections are now intact and categorized at the same time. This method is now extended to a vast array of poetry and prose collections (fables, short stories, and so on).
The management of our calendar of births and deaths (and other interesting events) included in the main page has evolved to match the flexible format of de.source.
Some time ago we reached 6,000 text units, but more important is the inauguration of an automated census based on SAL ("Stato di Avanzamento dei Lavoro: in brief a "quality check"): this table, updated four times a day by a bot counts the actual number of texts as seen anche marked with a "textquality template" by real users. Obviously it counts up much fewer texts than raw data show, but it's surely more reliable and offers a good picture of the overall quality in our library. This table now appears in our it:special:Statistics.
July
Our admin Frieda (admin in a bunch of other wikis, bureaucrat on it.wikipedia and it.wiktionary) is part of the Board of Trustees of Wikimedia Foundation! she always defended and promoted identity and collaboration between sister projects and was one of the first user of it.wikisource. Congratulations.
it.source on 18 July recorded its 1000th new user.
A bug on our stats counter has been fixed. What we always knew is now official: a far greater number of texts than previously showed is now seen: with more than 14,500 texts it.wikisource is catapulted from ninth to sixth place!
it.source began to use ProofreadingPage extension to show Side by side image view for proofreading.
September
We have on Wikisource the first italian (maybe international) bachelor thesis about Wikisource.
October
New namespaces "Portale" ("Portal") and "Progetto" ("Project") are now tailored to our needs. Mass migration of Wikiprojects.
November
The Authors' Portal is now open!
The Italian Wikisource has reached 16,000 text units. Gaudeamus igitur!
December
Accurimbono has just become admin, greetings! We have 8 administrators
The "XIII Century Project" is born.

Since 15 January 2007 (see here for a table on 14 January and here for a 15 January table)the Portuguese Wikisource is the 5th biggest Wikisource. For a brief period of time the 4th biggest Wikisource, but zh.ws is more fast on adding new texts ;) 555 19:59, 18 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
