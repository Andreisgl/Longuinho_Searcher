Essays on Mediterranean MigrationAfter a historical overview of migration within Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall (Minnucci), this collection of essays addresses Mediterranean issues: the case of Ceuta and Melilla (Sagnella), the relationship between Tunisia and the European Union (Gerli), the changes in North Africa from the Arab Spring to the Islamic State (Musso), the Lampedusa case (Strano), some European Models of citizenship (Turco), a focus on female genital mutilation/cutting in the context of migration (Faraca) and another one on the representation of immigrants in Italian Media (Elbreki). This collection of essays by young researchers analyzes, through various innovative approaches, the role of the Mediterranean and migration experiences.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersOne Way Trip. Essays on Mediterranean MigrationTunisia-EU: common market and migrations2016 • Gianluca GerliThe process of economic liberalization between Tunisia and EU, which has been led so far, is strictly linked to inward migration flows from the North African country towards Europe. While the movement of capital has been encouraged, the one of job-seekers has been discouraged, leading to a lowering in socioeconomic conditions in both EU and Tunisia. This article goes through the economic dependence that Tunisia, and partially the rest of the Maghreb, has developed on EU’s demand; this kind of dependence not only affected goods and services, but also low cost Tunisian workforce. It will be therefore possible to understand that both restrictive EU policies on labor market and on migrations are responsible for the increase in illegal migration towards Europe. In this way it has come to the paradox of looking at migration as a problem, although it were the same European institutions that adopted policies that caused migration to increase: the problem are those policies and not immigration, which rather is a consequenceDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropes Rio Grande: (Im)mobility in the Mediterranean.

The paper focuses on the (im)balancing act between efficiency and protection in EU policies. Beginning by expounding the notion of governance of irregular migration and asylum, we turn to critically discuss current European border control practices with a focus on the agencies and policies in place (including the Common European Asylum System). The paper concludes by showing how the EU's balancing act between irregular migration control and asylum management tips clearly towards the former even if it pays lip service to the latter as well as to the need of preventing the loss of human life.Download Free PDFView PDFTRANSIT MIGRATIONEuropean Attitudes and Policies towards the Migration/Development IssueJAIRO MUNIVEDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
