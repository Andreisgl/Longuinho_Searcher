This study assessed anemia, iron deficiency, hemoglobin (Hb), length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), and malaria infection as predictors of motor activity in 771 children aged 5-19 mo. Trained observers conducted 2- to 4-h observations of children&#39;s motor activity in and around their homes. Binary logistic regression assessed the predictors of any locomotion. Children who did not locomote during the observation (nonmovers) were excluded from further analyses. Linear regression evaluated the predictors of total motor activity (TMA) and time spent in locomotion for all children who locomoted during the observation combined (movers) and then separately for crawlers and walkers. Iron deficiency (77.0%), anemia (58.9%), malaria infection (33.9%), and stunting (34.6%) were prevalent.

Controlled for environment-market, geographic-region, and hospital-related variables, the results show almost no measurable effect of strategic adoption on rural hospital profitability and liquidity. Where statistically significant relationships existed, they were more often negative than positive. These findings were not expected; it was hypothesized that positive effects across a broad range of strategies would emerge, other things being equal. Discussed are possible explanations for these findings as well as their implication for a rural health policy relying on individual rural hospital strategic adaptation to environmental change.Save to LibraryDownloadby David Salkever•  12  Nursing, Health Services Research, Ownership, Rural HealthThe Effect of Muscle Damage on Strength and Fatigue DeficitsSave to LibraryDownloadby David G Behm•  10  Strength & Conditioning, Skeletal muscle biology, Humans, FemaleAn integrative framework for supply chain collaborationSave to LibraryDownloadby Ramaswami Sridharan•  14  Supply Chain Management, Knowledge sharing, Supply Chain, Information SharingDuct-to-duct biliary reconstruction in right lobe adult living donor liver transplantation 1 1 No competing interest declaredSave to LibraryDownloadby Santiago Vera•  10  Treatment Outcome, Humans, Female, MalePerichondritis of the auricle and its managementSave to LibraryDownloadby Sampath Chandra Prasad Rao and +1Kishore Prasad•  15  IT Management, Adolescent, Humans, ChildThe Association of Shelter Veterinarians veterinary medical care guidelines for spay-neuter programsSave to LibraryDownloadby Janet Scarlett•  20  Microbiology, Medicine, Critical Care, CatsNew Synthesis of β-Lactams by Ethylene Extrusion from Spirocyclopropane IsoxazolidinesSave to LibraryDownloadby Federica  Pisaneschi•  2  The, CHEMICAL SCIENCES4',5'-Unsaturated-5'-fluoro adenosine nucleosides: potent mechanism-based inhibitors of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolaseSave to Libraryby Philippe  Bey and +2Prasad SunkaraShujaath Mehdi•  3  The, Homocysteine, CHEMICAL SCIENCESNormalized names for clinical drugs: RxNorm at 6 yearsSave to LibraryDownloadby John Kilbourne•  20  Engineering, Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, MedicinePlatinum Monolayer Electrocatalysts for O-2 Reduction: Pt Monolayer on Carbon-Supported PdIr NanoparticlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Ramesh Singh•  15  Engineering, Materials Science, Kinetics, ElectrocatalysisReduced Dimensionality in Organic Electro-Optic Materials: Theory and Defined OrderSave to LibraryDownloadby Lewis Johnson•  4  Engineering, Physical sciences, The, CHEMICAL SCIENCESDevelopmental consequences of trace mineral deficiencies in rodents: acute and long-term effectsSave to LibraryDownloadby Robert Rucker•  17  Nutrition and Dietetics, Nutrition, Reproduction, AgingEarly Post-Prostatectomy Pelvic Floor BiofeedbackSave to LibraryDownloadby Joseph Smith•  11  Urology, Urinary incontinence, Prospective studies, HumansEffects of predator treatments, individual traits, and environment on moose survival in AlaskaSave to LibraryDownloadby Kimberlee Beckmen•  5  Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Predation, Wildlife ManagementTid1, CHIP and ErbB2 interactions and their prognostic implications for breast cancer patientsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jeng-fan  Lo•  12  Humans, Female, The, Clinical SciencesBiomechanical Comparison of Tibial Eminence Fracture Fixation With High-Strength Suture, EndoButton, and Suture AnchorSave to LibraryDownloadby serkan davul•  16  Orthopedic Surgery, Fracture, Treatment, Treatment OutcomeSevere malnutrition alters lipid composition and fatty acid profile of small intestine in newborn pigletsThe goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of severe protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) on lipid composition and fatty acid profile in the small intestinal mucosa of lactating pigs.

Malnutrition was achieved by 80% protein-energy restriction for 30 d (20% of the food intake in the control group) in 7-d-old newborn piglets. Malnourished piglets had significantly lower concentrations of cholesterol, phospholipid and triglycerides in the jejunum and ileum compared with freely fed controls. Fatty acid composition of the intestinal mucosa was severely affected by malnutrition. A sharp decline in the relative percentages of (n-3) and (n-6) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in malnourished piglets paralleled higher (n-9) fatty acid proportions in the total mucosa, microsomes and phospholipids of the jejunum. The structure of the small intestine was severely affected as assessed by light and electron microscopy, and alkaline phosphatase and disaccharidase activities ...Save to LibraryDownloadby M.

Many clinicians are hesitant to offer patients TRT after an RP, out of concern that the increased androgen levels may promote tumor progression or recurrence from residual tumor. Recently, several small studies have demonstrated the use of TRT in men following an RP and have shown an improvement in serum testosterone levels with no increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values.Aims.  The aim of this article is to assess changes in PSA and testosterone values in hypogonadal patients on TRT after RP and also to evaluate the impact of pathologic Gleason grade on ultimate PSA values.Methods.  All hypogonadal men who were treated with TRT by members of our department following RP were retrospectively reviewed. PSA values before RP, after RP, and after TRT were evaluated. Serum testosterone levels before and after TRT were also examined. Only patients with undetectable PSA values and negative surgical margins on pathologic specimen were offered TRT and included in the study.Main Outcome Measures.  Main outcome measures were changes in PSA and testosterone values after initiation of TRT.Results.  Fifty-seven men, ages 53–83 years (mean 64), were identified as having initiated TRT following RP. Men received TRT for an average of 36 months following RP (range 1–136 months). Patients were followed an average of 13 months after initiation of TRT (range 1–99 months). The mean testosterone values rose from 255 ng/dL before TRT to 459 ng/dL after TRT (P < 0.001). There was no increase in PSA values after initiation of TRT and thus no patient had a biochemical PSA recurrence.Conclusion.  TRT is effective in improving testosterone levels, without increasing PSA values, in hypogonadal men who have undergone RP.
