How to SEARCH
SEARCH provides access to physical and electronic materials held or licensed by the National Agricultural Library. If you've used AGRICOLA, PubAg, or NALDC in the past -- all of those records can now be found in SEARCH!
Simple Search
A simple search can be done from the search box at the top of the SEARCH home page by entering keywords and pressing the Search button. You terms will be searched across multiple fields including title, subjects, abstract, and more. You can also:
Search for an exact phrase by surrounding your words in double quotes. Searching for "edible mushrooms" will search only for the two words together as a phrase, while searching for edible mushrooms will search for edible anywhere in the record as well as mushrooms anywhere in the record.
Search for variations of a word using a question mark(?) for a single character variation and an asterisk (*) for multiple characters. Searching for mushroom? will return records which include mushroom and mushrooms. Searching for mushroom* will return mushroom, mushrooms, mushroomed, and mushrooming.
Use the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT. Note that these operators must be capitalized or SEARCH will not recognize them as Booleans.mushrooms AND fungus will return results that include both words
mushrooms OR fungus will return results that include mushrooms, fungus, or both words
fungus NOT mushrooms will return results that include fungus and do not include mushrooms
 
For more information on what you can do with the simple search box, see the documentation on Performing Basic Searches in Primo VE from Ex Libris.
