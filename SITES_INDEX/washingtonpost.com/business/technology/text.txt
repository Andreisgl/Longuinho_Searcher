It was as if one of the site’s Talk pages — where people argue over the finer points of online articles — had come to life. Attendees in every presentation shot up their hands in the middle of speeches, eager to add their input.Tech is not your friend. We are.

Wikipedia is also struggling to draw new editors, especially women. And, some leaders worry, the Web site is beginning to show its age.Advertisement“It’s time for us to update,” said Jimmy Wales, the site’s founder, said in an interview. “One thing we always want to look at carefully is the tone and the health of the community to make sure we continue to be welcoming and that people aren’t put off when they make their first edit.”The concern is palpable among some editors at the conference, which wrapped up on Sunday .“On Wikipedia, it’s more ‘you have to get it right’ instead of ‘it’s okay if you get it wrong,’ ” said Michael Soh, an Arlington resident, adding that he keeps his Wikipedia edits these days to grammar and spelling mistakes. “It’s not as inviting as it once was.”The bottom-up culture is critical to Wikipedia, which still dominates search results but has remained true to its nonprofit roots. The site runs on donations, and collected $22 million from supporters in its latest drive.AdvertisementWikipedia has been losing active editors over the past year, said Sue Gardner, president of the Wikimedia Foundation. Part of the problem may be that Wikipedia is “homely, awkward and hand-crafted,” she said, which has made it difficult to attract new blood who want to add to the site’s collection of at least 4 million entries.As the site makes a push to draw in more editors, it's focusing heavily on diversity. It's evident from a quick scan of Wikimania attendees that most of the editors are young men. Only around 10 percent to 15 percent of Wikipedia's editors are women, something Wales said hurts the diversity of Wikipedia's content.To address some of those issues, Wikipedia has launched easier editing software and partnered with groups such as the Ada Initiative, which works to support women in the open-source technology community. The moves may help Wikipedia’s overall “friendliness,” Gardner said, but she knows changing the editing process won’t solve the site’s problems by itself.AdvertisementJay Walsh, the head of communications for the Wikimedia Foundation, said that the community has also added some tools to make it easier for contributors to recognize each other’s work, and to bring them together.Share this articleShare“We hear those users who are claiming things might be a bit cold. Increased communications capacity, better recognition tools, and a focus on civility and functional conversations is part of our roadmap,” he said.Some of the shift in Wikipedia's culture could be due to the fact that it is evolving into something more than an online encyclopedia. The site and foundation have become a strange mix of an Internet company, advocacy group and online library, Gardner said.The site made a splash in January when it led a larger Internet blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act, pulling its English-language content off-line for 24 hours.AdvertisementThe move was copied by the Russian-language version of Wikipedia in protest over an Internet blacklist law. The Wikipedia community there voted 200 to 80 to pull the site down for 24 hours on July 10..That got a lot of attention in Russia and around the world. The bill was ultimately approved and only needs the signature of Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, but Anastasia Lvova, a key organizer in Russia, said she was encouraged by the energy around the protest.“It happened very fast,” said Lvova, a Wikipedia contributor. “This may help in the future, to have so many people saying they wanted to make changes.”Yet some Wikipedians don't want the site to step too far into the advocacy business. In a speech to the crowd on Thursday, Wales said that he doesn't want the site to ever have to go dark again, but that it "may have to" if Internet freedom is threatened. The site should, however, shy away from using those drastic measures too often.Advertisement“I don’t want us to become a site that goes on strike every six months over something,” he told attendees.Wherever the site goes, Wales said, it will be the product of community discussion.“We’re a community brought together for a particular mission,” he said at a news conference last week. “One of the things that makes us so successful is that we are a community where ideas are respected and we listen to each other.”Share CommentsLoading...View moreTOP STORIESTechnologyBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devicesTrump’s Truth Social facing a key funding deadlineNew phone sparks worry China has found a way around U.S. tech limitsTexting do’s and don’t’s for 2023RefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesCompanyAbout The Post Newsroom Policies & Standards Diversity and Inclusion Careers Media & Community Relations WP Creative Group Accessibility Statement Get The PostGift Subscriptions Mobile & Apps Newsletters & Alerts Washington Post Live Reprints & Permissions Post Store Books & E-Books Newspaper in Education Print Archives (Subscribers Only) Today’s Paper Public Notices Coupons Contact UsContact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Contact the Opinions team Advertise Licensing & Syndication Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Terms of UseDigital Products Terms of Sale Print Products Terms of Sale Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices washingtonpost.com  © 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2023 The Washington PostAbout The Post Contact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Download the Washington Post App Policies & Standards Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Print Products Terms of Sale Digital Products Terms of Sale Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices Coupons
