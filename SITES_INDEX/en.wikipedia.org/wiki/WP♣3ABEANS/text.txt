< Wikipedia:Don't stuff beans up your nose(Redirected from Wikipedia:BEANS/Uh-huh)
Humorous Wikipedia page
Great, look what you did! You just blew up Wikipedia!
While loading the page we encountered the following errors:
Fatal error: PDO Exception 08001: Cannot connect to database
in PDO::__construct(){x6/dybn}\df
UNRECOVERABLE DATABASE ERROR
Error at alert(){x/fdf3}, ABORTING OPERATION /press X to try again/...
There used to be a better image here, but now you've gone and taken out all our web servers! Nice going. It just goes to show:
DON'T STUFF BEANS UP YOUR NOSE!
You should click here to fix this.
People click links on these pages an average of 1,581 times a month.[1] We should really take it down! Or replace it with a link to http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=delete.
If you are looking for the image description page for the red button image, it is at File:Do not press button.jpg
