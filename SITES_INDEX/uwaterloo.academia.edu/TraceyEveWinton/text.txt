Drawing Out Hidden Depths: Tracing A Path Through the Castelvecchio Courtyard, Verona, by Tracey Eve WintonFRASCARI SYMPOSIUM IV

From Translating to A... more FRASCARI SYMPOSIUM IVThe Secret Lives of Architectural Drawings and ModelsFrom Translating to Archiving, Collecting, and DisplayingSession: Drawing SitesDrawing Out Hidden Depths: Tracing A Path Through the Castelvecchio Courtyard, Verona“A Castelvecchio tutto era falso…” — Carlo ScarpaAt Verona’s Castelvecchio Museum, Carlo Scarpa drew the architecture he imagined outside of conventions, in a layered, fragmentary idiom, producing images more resembling contemporary art than contract documents. Although he drew over measured prints, his drawings (archived on site) reveal traces of his working process, and incorporate the passage of time and the experience of movement. How Scarpa drew, in this case by materializing the drawing with coloured shading, both reflects his creative position with respect to knowledge-construction and discloses his reasoning. His drawings offer clues to specific narratives which he embedded into the architecture, and their communicative meanings. This paper forms part of a work in progress. With Scarpa, my interest lies in the strategies he devises, linked to the ideas of his friend Bruno Zevi, to formulate a modern language of architecture, a kind of architecture that is capable of communicating to its visitors across the entire ontological spectrum, from the conceptual to the material. (Where the ‘material’ does not mean a Renaissance version of the phenomenology of materials, but (due to the implementation of arte povera as a material model) has to do more with texture, craft and finish, as well as process.)In the postwar era in Italy and USA, artists like Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, Robert Smithson, etc. innovated non-mimetic practices that provided the work a ‘space’ of play, in which  processes we could call nature, chaos, or entropy, might enter to impact and counter-balance the formal aspects which the artist imposed. This strategy downplayed a work’s or an individual element’s object-quality in favour of emphasizing the processes in which it was materially engaged. [The implication of this mode of thinking is that the work (building, model or drawing) forms a ‘weak’ or provisional center to an ecological context, and it is not discontinuous with it.] [These processes revealed destruction and creation to be indivisible.] The very idea of a connected sequence linked by organic elements with the notion that Frank Lloyd Wright called “continuity.” Scarpa’s surfaces could be analogical to contemporary ‘action painting’ as described by Harold Rosenberg, “At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act — rather than as a space in which to reproduce, redesign, analyze or ‘express’ an object, actual or imagined. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event. The painter no longer approached his easel with an image in his mind; he went up to it with material in his hand to do something to that other piece of material in front of him. The image would be the result of this encounter.” Rosenberg’s critique, grounded in the paradigm shift in modernity from iconic representation to the indexical trace, shifted the focus from the formal appearance of the work to the interaction. In this, the completed artifact manifested traces of how it was made, the act of creation in which the art consisted. This was not just an American model, for important American artists worked in Italy, where Lucio Fontana started slashing canvases in the 1950s.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It originates and defines its limits architecturally, that is, on the near side of perspective’s picture window, in the intimate presence of domestic space, the place of everyday life. Still life or nature morte is empirically constituted by its subject matter. Typically, the raw foods that sustain life and the implements related to them in the domestic scene are presented horizontally on a table-top, the quotidian stage of the private human drama.Those things which appear in the still life are denoted already at a remove from nature, conscripted into the service of human life. These are not sublime objects of love or veneration from the tradition of art which serves and constitutes religion. Instead, their mundanity limits the potentiality of human relations toward them, and the still life articulates and explores this delimited mortal sphere as the repetitive theatre of subsistence.Although its objects may be commonplace, their deliberate choice and organization identify them as objects of desire.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

His collection grew prodigious, and his ambitious architectural program included dedicated space for a library. Under the north loggia of his former architect Luciano Laurana’s “secular cloister,” the library door stands conspicuous on the route from the carriageway to the grand stair to the apartments on the piano nobile. Its prominent location, unusual iconography, and personal importance to Federigo signal that it has a story to tell. His architect, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, told that complex story through the medium of architecture. In the Library in the ducal palace at Urbino, Italy, the books may have gone, but the story endures in built form. This is an abbreviated version of the paper intended for publication, but the full-length paper will be uploaded when I have a chance to revise it.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Her story was based on an interview with a middle-aged local woman named Janneth C. Smith whom she had tracked down through Facebook and contacted by email. Lisa Drew tantalized her avid audience with historical artifacts and old news clippings belonging to Smith’s family that suggested a solution to the hundred year old mystery: the abrupt and absolute disappearance of Toronto theatre magnate Ambrose Small in 1919 after cashing a cheque for one million dollars, leaving behind his baffled wife, his secretary, and his empire of numerous theatres. Police investigations of the high profile case, and rewards offered, even the clairvoyants they interviewed, came to nothing. While Ambrose Small never really left the public imagination due to his role in Michael Ondaatje’s famous historical novel In the Skin of a Lion, Small was an intriguing character in his own right, immensely wealthy and powerful, whose buildings concealed more than theatre machinery: there were secret apartments and hidden rooms within their walls. As the sensational report ran on 570 News, Facebook searches for Janneth C. Smith surged into the hundreds of thousands.There was only one problem with the viral news story. The news anchor had unknowingly reported on a transmedia fiction. She had inadvertently tumbled down a ‘rabbit hole’ intended for game-players of an Alternate Reality Game designed by my second year architecture students as the collective term project in their Cultural History course. The students, of course, were elated, as they had just discovered at first hand the role of the imagination in how history is made.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In Baroque culture, the wall became a key armature for displaying and embodying knowledge and order. How walls shift in meaning from defensive structure to heuristic and didactic is demonstrated in a book that Dominican monk Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639) wrote during the 26 years he languished in lightless Inquisition prisons charged with sedition and heresy.In 1602, Campanella wrote A Poetic City of the Sun. The Idea of a Philosophical Republic. His utopian vision, influenced by Plato’s Republic, demonstrated civic justice through permanent geometrical order registered in the architecture of the city, giving new dimensions to the ideal commonwealth genre.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Architecture’s Unfinished Business: Hotel Palenque Revisited Elsewhere in Yucatan, Mexico"Architecture’s Unfinished Business: Hotel Palenque Revisited Elsewhere in Yucatan, Mexico.” Pres... more "Architecture’s Unfinished Business: Hotel Palenque Revisited Elsewhere in Yucatan, Mexico.” Presentation of urbanistic research on self-built housing that combines the adaptive reuse of urban disjecta with indigenous Mayan building techniques and materials, in relation to urban growth, form, public space and streetscape in the Latin American city. Invited speaker in session ‘City as Culture: Mobility, Stories, Architecture’, at Symposium "Reimagining Resiliency in Urban Ecologies," for the Arts and Ideas in Motion (AIM) Project, held in Montreal, Canada, March 16-17 2015. The attached document is a crude pdf of my slides.   The submitted 500 word ABSTRACT  “…it’s not often that you see buildings being both ripped down and built up at the same time.” — Robert Smithson, Hotel Palenque In 1972 Robert Smithson lectured to architecture students in Utah on his experience of an unfinished and partially demolished hotel close to the important archaeological site in Palenque, Mexico, 3 years before. The artist’s Neorealist slideshow explored an abandoned, episodic edifice, tourism’s muddy handprint, owing its existence to the monumental Mayan architecture that he mentioned only in passing.Playa del Carmen is a fast-growing city on the Mayan Riviera. The former fishing village is expanding to accommodate tourists, both Mexican and foreign, and its downtown is lined with gated resorts and interspersed with luxury condo development. Outside the tourist zone live people who support the industry and more often simply sustain local economy and culture. In Playa’s remote northern end, part of the city, not a suburb, most of the residents, indigenous Maya, don’t encounter foreigners, even though their economy depends on the trickle-down effect of visitors. Like a new Manhattan, Playa is laid out on a numbered grid. The streets parallel to the coast form Playa’s main arteries. While Avenida 30 is a traditional commercial street without ground-floor dwellings, Avenida 10 (double lanes split by a median) has single and double storeys, with hybridized fabric. Streets are the dwelling places of the collective. “Also you know that the Mayans didn’t have to quarry their rocks,  they just went around and picked them up off the ground., because all the ground is loaded with all this broken rock.” — Robert Smithson, Hotel Palenque On 10 and its cross streets, few buildings look ‘finished,’ and most are a shambles, though my body reads this fabric as comfortable: I don’t feel afraid to walk it alone at night. Smithson famously characterized buildings sites under construction as ruins in reverse, and his notorious Palenque talk really concerned the force of entropy in the landscape of culture. What I see on 10, though, is a built instantiation of mythic thinking, and a high degree of both ground-up and top-down organization — top-down being cultural norms and familiar practices, transparent to the community. “…the bricoleur [creates] structures by means of events…” — Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Savage Mind Sustainable development is potentially optimized by adaptive reuse of urban materials, in other words, recognizing how architecture and the city metabolize. So let’s recuperate Mexican bricolage from the performance artists and bring it back to its home in the yard. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, in a book dedicated to his late friend Maurice Merleau-Ponty, characterized bricolage as working with heterogenous elements not preselected for the project. The Mexican bricoleur transforms his litany of oddments into a kind of Bachelardian poetics of space, which materially enfolds, yet at the same time transmits domestic and civic signs. It takes a great degree of social craft to integrate the city with the home by spatial sequencing and articulation, and this takes place around and through the events of dwelling.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mythic Geology: Under the Surface at Palazzo del TeThe Material Imagination.

Giulio took the mantle of Mannerism from the late Andrea Mantegna and created a masterwork of iconographically rich trompe l’oeil frescoes on the interior surfaces. Two of the corner rooms are particularly significant, the lyrical room of Amor and Psyche, and the Room of the Fall of the Giants, which depicts a massive architectural collapse. The palace’s outer walls manifested a bizarre articulation — including falling triglyphs and rising keystones — that scholars have debated the meaning of for years. This essay shows the complex interconnections within the complex, the city, and the Roman classical heritage, by which these façades form a manifesto, in which Giulio Romano confronts the meaning of architectural language as well as the role of the architect as intermediary between Form and Matter.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The lifetime of this poisoned river god overflows from a drowsy channel to Rome's glorious and infamous past. From two of Rome's distended mounds—Palatine and Aventine respectively—Romulus and Remus watched for signs from the other world of where the city was to lie. At that time, the Roman landscape dreamed in flights of vultures, and revealed its will through the divinities of nature.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The attached document is a crude pdf of my slides.   The submitted 500 word ABSTRACT  “…it’s not often that you see buildings being both ripped down and built up at the same time.” — Robert Smithson, Hotel Palenque In 1972 Robert Smithson lectured to architecture students in Utah on his experience of an unfinished and partially demolished hotel close to the important archaeological site in Palenque, Mexico, 3 years before. The artist’s Neorealist slideshow explored an abandoned, episodic edifice, tourism’s muddy handprint, owing its existence to the monumental Mayan architecture that he mentioned only in passing.Playa del Carmen is a fast-growing city on the Mayan Riviera. The former fishing village is expanding to accommodate tourists, both Mexican and foreign, and its downtown is lined with gated resorts and interspersed with luxury condo development. Outside the tourist zone live people who support the industry and more often simply sustain local economy and culture. In Playa’s remote northern end, part of the city, not a suburb, most of the residents, indigenous Maya, don’t encounter foreigners, even though their economy depends on the trickle-down effect of visitors. Like a new Manhattan, Playa is laid out on a numbered grid. The streets parallel to the coast form Playa’s main arteries. While Avenida 30 is a traditional commercial street without ground-floor dwellings, Avenida 10 (double lanes split by a median) has single and double storeys, with hybridized fabric. Streets are the dwelling places of the collective. “Also you know that the Mayans didn’t have to quarry their rocks,  they just went around and picked them up off the ground., because all the ground is loaded with all this broken rock.” — Robert Smithson, Hotel Palenque On 10 and its cross streets, few buildings look ‘finished,’ and most are a shambles, though my body reads this fabric as comfortable: I don’t feel afraid to walk it alone at night. Smithson famously characterized buildings sites under construction as ruins in reverse, and his notorious Palenque talk really concerned the force of entropy in the landscape of culture. What I see on 10, though, is a built instantiation of mythic thinking, and a high degree of both ground-up and top-down organization — top-down being cultural norms and familiar practices, transparent to the community. “…the bricoleur [creates] structures by means of events…” — Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Savage Mind Sustainable development is potentially optimized by adaptive reuse of urban materials, in other words, recognizing how architecture and the city metabolize. So let’s recuperate Mexican bricolage from the performance artists and bring it back to its home in the yard. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, in a book dedicated to his late friend Maurice Merleau-Ponty, characterized bricolage as working with heterogenous elements not preselected for the project. The Mexican bricoleur transforms his litany of oddments into a kind of Bachelardian poetics of space, which materially enfolds, yet at the same time transmits domestic and civic signs. It takes a great degree of social craft to integrate the city with the home by spatial sequencing and articulation, and this takes place around and through the events of dwelling.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Giulio took the mantle of Mannerism from the late Andrea Mantegna and created a masterwork of iconographically rich trompe l’oeil frescoes on the interior surfaces. Two of the corner rooms are particularly significant, the lyrical room of Amor and Psyche, and the Room of the Fall of the Giants, which depicts a massive architectural collapse. The palace’s outer walls manifested a bizarre articulation — including falling triglyphs and rising keystones — that scholars have debated the meaning of for years. This essay shows the complex interconnections within the complex, the city, and the Roman classical heritage, by which these façades form a manifesto, in which Giulio Romano confronts the meaning of architectural language as well as the role of the architect as intermediary between Form and Matter.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We’re in Surrealist era Paris — a world boiling over with odd juxtapositions and startling contrasts — for the opening of the Exposition Coloniale Internationale, a grand exhibition of foreign arts, reproducing at full scale and architectural detail many of the world’s most sensational buildings, including the Great Temple of Angkor Wat. Most Surrealist artists boycotted the controversial expo, but one famous dramatist, actor, writer and artist, was drawn to its rich and curious cultures. In August that year, at the Dutch pavilion, he watched a wordless drama of gesture performed by a troupe of Balinese dancers. Shaken with inspiration, he conceived a modern dramatic form that returned to the body, materiality, sensuality and spatiality, to restore the rawness and blood ritual that western decadence had stripped from theatre and replaced by spoken language. Our story features Antonin Artaud, whose experience of psychosis later brought him into the hands of one of the twentieth century's most famous psychoanalysts, Dr. Jacques Lacan, for 11 months in a Paris asylum. Lacan and Artaud were brilliant but difficult men, both former Surrealists, both working on problems of language and communication, and soon became antagonists for one another.  The story unfolds as Artaud, working with friends, all major figures of the era, rehearses a new work of theatre based on the early detective story by Edgar Allan Poe that fascinated both him and Lacan, “The Purloined Letter.”  This is experimental theatre, modern theatre, as first proposed by Artaud himself: not an after-dinner entertainment, but rather a ‘theatre of cruelty’ intended to ‘awaken’ the audience into an existential experience in a physical language properly theatre’s own expressive form, and an enquiry into the relationship between fiction and reality.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Heinrich Schliemann, the German archaeologist, Homer, the mythical blind poet, and Achilles, the Greek hero, are each passionately trying to find their way into it. Imagining Troy, they begin recreating the city and its people. As Schliemann investigates ruins, and Homer sings his poetry, the legends and stories grow and come to life between them. Gradually, the ghosts of Greek armies and the shadows of Trojan walls become alive and solid. As Homer and Schliemann struggle to enter the re-imagined Troy, their lives and their quests are woven together. But what, and where, really, is the city? Each summer, second year students from the University of Waterloo School of Architecture, located in Cambridge, Ontario, stage a play as the major term project for their Cultural History course. This year, we are presenting Ilion, our version of the legend of the siege of Troy.

Beyond the Campo Marzio BOOK — Matthew Davis & Miles Gertler, 4A Rome Design Studio1a
The title of this project refers to the geographical area in Rome, the Campo Marzio (Latin: “... more 1aThe title of this project refers to the geographical area in Rome, the Campo Marzio (Latin: “Campus Martius”). This was the designated military grounds outside of the city limits predating the Imperial and Late Republican era of Roman antiquity.As the old city expanded beyond the limits of the Pomerium, the area became its centre and, to this day, is loaded with iconic works and archaeological traces from the antique world, including the Pantheon, Piazza Navona (a planometric tracing of the Stadium of Domitian), and various Egyptian obelisks.Since antiquity the district has been in a state of perpetual rebuilding and layering, adding an abundance of public space (in the form of piazzas and public buildings) to the city (a circular sample area with a 1km diameter, taken by the authors of this project, reveals an 8.3% surface area of dedicated, exposed public space in the Campo Marzio). It is the quintessential urban district; one filled with public rooms of all scales which lead, from one to another, as a continuous connective fabric.1bThe title of this project refers to the frontispiece image from Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s 1762 work, “Il Campo Marzio dell’antica Roma.” In it, Piranesi layers urban fantasy with typological invention in a pseudo-historical collage of the Campo Marzio area of Rome. Referencing the planometric arsenal of ancient Roman architecture, Piranesi constructs an otherworldly image of the Campo Marzio, indicating a few real architectural elements rooted in the period from which he draws. These elements, amidst a field of invention, give geographical bearing and a ghostly sense of reality to this utopian vision of the ancient city.1cFrom the allusions conjured by the title of this project, one could gather that this design for a new park in the Ostiense district might have something to do with urban rooms, an otherworldly vision of public space and the city, typological appropriation, and the thrust by which a formerly peripheral district becomes central to the city it was once only attached to.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I am cutting a dovetail: a wood joint developed over five-thousand years ago by the hands of our ancestors. Even now, a well-fitted dovetail joint remains one of the strongest, most elegant ways to join wood. I knew nothing about traditional woodworking when I first picked up a hand-plane, but I was soon inspired by the richness of the craft: the quality of a hand-planed finish, the spirit of craftsmanship, and the nature of material. I was amazed by the wealth of knowledge embodied in craftwork. The tools and materials I encountered spoke to me; I learned to care for them and for my work. How would the things I make endure through time? How would the things I make affect others? In an era where materialism has come to represent a spiritless relationship to the things around us, traditions of craft can teach us how to imbue the human spirit in our work. After making a harvest table, four chairs, ninety-four earthenware pots, and a lamp, I reflect on the act of making as a means of discovery. Making affects our thinking and our approach to material and environment. Making can help us develop a craftsman’s capacity to listen, a great respect for material, and a desire to make better objects for posterity. Making is learning.  ILLUSTRATED WITH PHOTOGRAPHSSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As creatures subject to time, we identify with things in which we see ourselves, we identify with our mortal buildings. Alchemy used material transformation as an active metaphor for human betterment. This thesis will search for ways that the inevitable indexing of time on the built environment can be used to catalyze a broader understanding of time and our place in it. Sympathetic engagement with our environments can form rich internal narratives while also fostering collective memory. Four materials form the basis of these investigations: Cedar, Copper, Iron and Marble. For each material, chemical properties, history and mythology are invoked to describe their particular temporal nature, an understanding of how they come together and fall apart. The four material chapters of this thesis mean to return a sense of cognitive depth to our relationship with materials without resorting to symbolism.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Built during the mid-twentieth-century as an infrastructural add-on to the existing Port Lands Industrial District, the artificial peninsula was a lakefilling project made to realize the city’s ambitious desire for economic prosperity and world-class prestige by expanding its existing harbour facilities. With the decline of Toronto’s shipping industry, the Leslie Spit remained an active dump site for urban clean fill until it was unexpectedly colonized by flora and fauna during the 1970s. The site is now recognized as an important local and international environmental resource. Visitors to the Leslie Spit experience a diverse landscape of ecosystems and industrial rubble helded by the city as a symbol of environmental revival within a former industrial region undergoing another phase of urbanization. While the local aesthetic experience of the headland is pleasurable and aligns with the reinvention of Toronto as am environmentally conscious and sustainable city, human visitors remain psychologically and physically removed from the inhabiting non-human life. Occasionally, the desire to conserve and preserve the natural world requires a separation between humans and non-humans. This relationship is carried out in varying degrees on the Leslie Spit. This thesis documents events at the headland where the human/non-human divide is rigidly enforced or left ambiguous. The purpose of the thesis is not to treat the headland as an eccentric spectacle, but to investigate the unexpected coexistence between humans and non-humans.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Natya-Shashtra, a treatise on drama and dance, reveals the status of the performing arts as equal to prayer and sacrificial rites in the pursuit of moksha, the release form cycles of rebirth. Both dance and dancer function as a vehicle for divine invocation and are mirrored in the architectural surroundings. To investigate this connection between dance and place, it is imperative to understand the mythical origins of architecture and temple dance. the Hindu philosophy of the cosmic man and its religious relationship with the Dravidian architecture of Tamil Nadu is the starting point of the discussion of a south Indian aesthetic. The Vastu-purusha mandala is a philosophical diagram that provides a foundation for Hindu aesthetics, linking physical distance, religious position and universal scale in both time and space. Used as an architectural diagram, it becomes a mediator between the human body and the cosmos. The temple, as a setting for dance performances, and constructed based on the mandala, shares this quality of immersing its participants into a multi-sensory spatial experience. However, while the link between architecture and dance culture was explicit up to the 18th century, it is less compelling in the context of modern south Indian architecture. With an increasingly unstable political landscape during the 20th century, architectural growth in south India during this period is almost stagnant. Unfortunately, this creates a break in the continuity and comparative evolution of dance and architecture, leading to the fragmentation and abstraction of dance in its modern form. South Indian dance has since transformed into a prominent cultural symbol and various incarnations of the dancer have become the isolated yet important link, between tradition and modernity. As an evolving living embodiment of contemporary culture and identity, her transformation from Devadasi, to an icon of nationalism, to a choreographer of 'high art' provides the foundation for the reintegration of architecture in the cultural fabric. The culmination of this research aims to reinstate the importance of architecture as a cultural nexus in order to restring a fragmented dance, community and cultural identity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

"Divided Cities & the In-Between" M.Arch. Thesis, Meredith VagaDivided Cities & the In-Between,  2014Abstract:  All cities set up a condition of disjunction as they are inherently manmade ‘built’ pl... more Abstract:  All cities set up a condition of disjunction as they are inherently manmade ‘built’ places separate from the natural wilderness they abut. The cities that emerge over time are then places held in tension between the kinetic and static forces of civilization, nature, people, ownership and infrastructure. These conflicting pieces manifest as division within the city. The division can be physically seen in specific gaps in the physical infrastructure: urban 'slips' that act as thresholds for a city by gathering and revealing the in/visible dueling qualities, and can ultimately prove to be important spaces and cultural magnets for the city. The analysis is centered on three specific 'slips' within three northern European cities: the South Bridge in Edinburgh, the Charles Bridge in Prague and the Berlin Wall. Looking from the perspective of both the physical, visible infrastructure and the unconscious, invisible cultural realm, these architectural objects are then charted through historical, literary, cartographic and urban analyses to come to an understanding of both the specific ‘characters’ or ‘spirits of place’ and the broad predisposition for division within cities.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This thesis is a journey to centre of the Shield, through the deep water, rock and voids that encircle it. It is an expedition into the multiplicities of time through the poetic imagination. Here on the bridge to preconsciousness, we are invited in. At the heart lies Copperfields, a mine isolated on an island in Temagami. Once bearing some of the purest copper on Earth, it now sits abandoned amidst fragments of its former glory. The design proposed reclaims these elements and animates them as gateways to the dynamic Shield. In the folds of time, quivering between thought and the preconscious, a fiction rich in meaning and experience is offered up. Let us now embark on our journey to the centre of the Shield.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
"A Revetment” M.Arch. Thesis, Fariba KhorashahiA Revetment,  2013Historically, in Iran, ornament was an integral part of architecture and considered a valuable pa... more Historically, in Iran, ornament was an integral part of architecture and considered a valuable part of built form. However, in time the use of ornament suffered from the decline of figural articulation in architecture, and its status was diminished to mere decoration. In this process, ornament shifted from a pattern that was integrated with the structure to the role of revetment, from symbolic to commemorative, and from meaningfully designed to arbitrary. Investigating the changing modes of ornament to understand its significance and survival, this thesis looks at the decline of ornament from its role as a necessary structural component and/or an expressive element communicating the common values of a society into an arbitrary fragment celebrating the significant past. Traditional ornament was dependent not only on architecture but also on science, cosmology, culture, art, literature, as well as on society and its beliefs; therefore there was an intimate relationship between ornament and its context, and more importantly including the inhabitant or spectator who held those beliefs. However, today those close ties no longer exist and ornament is characterized variously as luxurious, decorative, and retrospective. This change is studied from various perspectives including historical forces, prehistory, traditional Persian cultural expression, the incursion of Islamic motifs and geometries, modernity and folk legend. To retrieve and reinstate the link between ornament and building as well as with the spectator, the thesis project engages the narrative content of ornament to re-establish these relationships. It tells its own story not in a literal way, but rather through the complex tale of the lovers in the famous historical poem (c.1190) by Nezami. The thesis narrates the epic romance of Farhad and Shirin within a love triangle with its superb pictorial cues for depiction. The story unfolds through a series of architectures and architectural representations and images. The theme and motifs of the poem imply transition (both spiritual and physical) that corresponds to the transformative mode of ornament par excellence. The ornamental manifestation of the depicted poem is applied in a subway station which is in itself the locus of transition in our contemporary lives. The architectural details of the design project are fragments of the selected episodes from the story.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
"The Mongrel Approach" M.Arch. Thesis, Lauren PoonThe Mongrel Approach,  2011Cities are concentrations of diverse populations that undergo continual transformation over time.... more Cities are concentrations of diverse populations that undergo continual transformation over time. This thesis deals with the question, how does the individual make place in a constantly changing environment? The entry point for this study was looking at neglected places in urban environments. I looked specifically at the Don River Valley in Toronto, Ontario and how it has developed as an open-ended and complex system. The site research is presented through a series of stories describing specific events or places in the Don Valley that have taken place over the past 200 years. This thesis offers a mongrel approach to design for a site within the Don Valley. “The Mongrel Approach” is an opportunistic way of building that is committed to survival and open as to how this can be achieved. The design proposes a series of intimate yet public infrastructural devices; a toilet, water fountain, shelter and bridge that are presented in a set of hand drawings as well as through an “Explanatory Tale.” A magpie narrates this short story, which is part true, part fiction and part wishful thinking. As the earth’s population becomes more urban than rural and increasingly mobile, contemporary cities are becoming home to a diverse range of individuals with complex and layered identities. The Mongrel Approach offers a way of building that can handle difference and contradiction and accommodate incongruous or inharmonious parts. It positions the designer as a conjurer or first mover. This thesis proposes Mongrel buildings that respond to change by transforming slowly and incrementally over time with the involvement of multiple authors; but at each moment, a register of time and human ritual.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

What it was able to report in just six simple words is the inescapable process of transformation to which the entire neighbourhood had been and will be subjected to. Rediscovered in a photograph years later, the presence of that message is explored here.As an instrumental narrative, this thesis invests in four parameters of architecture that are as much a reflection of my own struggle to articulate the experience of both literally and figuratively moving within the neighbourhood, as they are indicative of the neighbourhood’s propensity for fragmentation and fluctuation through time.Throughout this work, I have tried to place myself both on and in the moment of crisis between the opposed binaries of the material and immaterial city, and to write the necessary fiction that might allow me to hold them simultaneously in the present."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Beyond the Campo Marzio PANELS — Matthew Davis & Miles Gertler, 4A Rome Design Studio1a
The title of this project refers to the geographical area in Rome, the Campo Marzio (Latin: “... more 1aThe title of this project refers to the geographical area in Rome, the Campo Marzio (Latin: “Campus Martius”). This was the designated military grounds outside of the city limits predating the Imperial and Late Republican era of Roman antiquity.As the old city expanded beyond the limits of the Pomerium, the area became its centre and, to this day, is loaded with iconic works and archaeological traces from the antique world, including the Pantheon, Piazza Navona (a planometric tracing of the Stadium of Domitian), and various Egyptian obelisks.Since antiquity the district has been in a state of perpetual rebuilding and layering, adding an abundance of public space (in the form of piazzas and public buildings) to the city (a circular sample area with a 1km diameter, taken by the authors of this project, reveals an 8.3% surface area of dedicated, exposed public space in the Campo Marzio). It is the quintessential urban district; one filled with public rooms of all scales which lead, from one to another, as a continuous connective fabric.1bThe title of this project refers to the frontispiece image from Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s 1762 work, “Il Campo Marzio dell’antica Roma.” In it, Piranesi layers urban fantasy with typological invention in a pseudo-historical collage of the Campo Marzio area of Rome. Referencing the planometric arsenal of ancient Roman architecture, Piranesi constructs an otherworldly image of the Campo Marzio, indicating a few real architectural elements rooted in the period from which he draws. These elements, amidst a field of invention, give geographical bearing and a ghostly sense of reality to this utopian vision of the ancient city.1cFrom the allusions conjured by the title of this project, one could gather that this design for a new park in the Ostiense district might have something to do with urban rooms, an otherworldly vision of public space and the city, typological appropriation, and the thrust by which a formerly peripheral district becomes central to the city it was once only attached to.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
“I love my house. I am my house” M.Arch. Thesis, Darcy Shaun McNinchI love my house. I am my house,  2011My first experience of architecture, a nearly universal case, was that of the house I grew up in.... more My first experience of architecture, a nearly universal case, was that of the house I grew up in. A century old, black & white clapboard farmhouse outside of Kingston, Ontario was where I called home. Having grown up and left it behind, I find I have developed a certain amount of nostalgia or homesickness regarding my mostly positive memories and recurring dreams that take place there. The house is not lost, in fact my parents still live there, and I return several times each year to retrace my childhood rituals, sleep in my old room, dream in my old bed, eat, play and reminisce in my old home. I can return to my home, but not my childhood, and yet the two seem inseparable. This space houses my dreams and memories of childhood; floorboards, doorknobs, and wallpaper are all triggers for recollection, the ornamentation of the home is a connective entity into my past. As my parents grow older, they are finding they don’t want to be so isolated, alone in a house too big for just the two of them. The possibility of them selling the house looms heavily on my mind. I don’t want to lose this special place. This is a study of the way in which an individual becomes bound to architecture, psychologically and physically, using the home to which I feel so connected as a guide. I’ve grown apart from my house in the years since I moved out, and much of the connection has been broken. In place of this connection, at my return, there is a certain sense of the unfamiliar in this familiar space. How can I make this intangible connection both apparent and relevant to someone else?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
CRYSTALLIZATIONS OF THE SUBLIME: A PLACE WHERE TREES STAND IN WATER evoking Toronto's landscapeCompetition Entry for the Revitalization of Nathan Phillips Square (Toronto City Hall), Toronto, ... more Competition Entry for the Revitalization of Nathan Phillips Square (Toronto City Hall), Toronto, Canada, 2006. Team: Lorenzo Pignatti, Tracey Eve Winton, Robert Jan van Pelt, Yvonne Popovska, Leland Dadson, J. Martin. A deep feeling for urban forms is reflected in the powerful Canadian landscape visions of Group of Seven artist Lawren Harris. The austere beauty of his sculptural abstractions shares a language with Viljo Revell's vision for the City Hall and Henry Moore's sculpture known as The Archer. Our proposal to reinvigorate Nathan Phillips Square draws on Harris' poetics to evoke in Toronto's urban landscape his sense of the living land and its mysterious luminosity, and give visible presence to natural ecologies underlying the city. A GLOWING TRANSLUCENT PLANE Imagine the whole of Nathan Phillips Square illuminated by a new stone surface, glowing like a plane of translucent ice, flowing almost imperceptibly towards the reflecting pool to recall Toronto's relationship with Lake Ontario. This shimmering glacial plane extends over the whole square, unifying it and furnishing a layered and textured material that invites inhabitation. Lending metaphorical extension to the square's most popular element, the ice skating rink, emphasizes the civic function of popular representation. The topography invites the people of Toronto to gather on this surface, establishing a second centre, and complementing Revell's 'eye of government' by giving the community a sense of place built on collective memory.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One might expect a study entitled Renascent Joyce to be a periodized examination of the Renaissance’s influence on Joyce, and to be sure, the first half of the text does place Joyce in conversation with thinkers such as François Rabelais, Giordano Bruno, and William Shakespeare. However, the study’s aims are more ambitious than merely “to document a source or to compare for comparison’s sake.” Instead, the contributors to Renascent Joyce are primarily concerned with establishing Joyce as a renascent figure himself, a person whose embrace of “the refusal of dogmatic thinking, the drive toward universality, the belief that language is not a transparent medium and that form should reflect content, and a writing informed by sheer exuberance” enable him to keep the Renaissance spirit alive three hundred years after the period’s conclusion. In so doing, Renascent Joyce provides a compelling new way to examine and understand Joyce’s literary innovation, a revolutionary spirit that not only reignites the past in the early twentieth century, but whose subsequent rebirths productively engage our present and thus highlight Joyce’s continued significance."Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Giulio took the mantle of Mannerism from the late Andrea Mantegna and created a masterwork of iconographically rich trompe l’oeil frescoes on the interior surfaces. Two of the corner rooms are particularly significant, the lyrical room of Amor and Psyche, and the Room of the Fall of the Giants, which depicts a massive architectural collapse. The palace’s outer walls manifested a bizarre articulation — including falling triglyphs and rising keystones — that scholars have debated the meaning of for years. This essay shows the complex interconnections within the complex, the city, and the Roman classical heritage, by which these façades form a manifesto, in which Giulio Romano confronts the meaning of architectural language as well as the role of the architect as intermediary between Form and Matter.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
