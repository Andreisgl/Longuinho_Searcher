It is well documented that the NDVI approaches saturation asymptotically under conditions of moderate-to-high aboveground biomass. While reflectance in the red region (ρred) exhibits a nearly flat response once the leaf area index (LAI) exceeds 2, the near infrared (NIR) reflectance (ρNIR) continue to respond significantly to changes in moderate-to-high vegetation density (LAI from 2 to 6) in crops. However, this higher sensitivity of the ρNIR has little effect on NDVI values once the ρNIR exceeds 30 %. In this paper a simple modification of the NDVI was proposed. The Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index, WDRVI = (a * ρNIR-ρred)/(a * ρNIR+ρred), where the weighting coefficient a has a value of 0.1–0.2, increases correlation with vegetation fraction by linearizing the relationship for typical wheat, soybean, and maize canopies. The sensitivity of the WDRVI to moderate-to-high LAI (between 2 and 6) was at least three times greater than that of the NDVI. By enhancing the dynamic range while using the same bands as the NDVI, the WDRVI enables a more robust characterization of crop physiological and phenological characteristics. Although this index needs further evaluation, the linear relationship with vegetation fraction and much higher sensitivity to change in LAI will be especially valuable for precision agriculture and monitoring vegetation status under conditions of moderate-to-high density. It is anticipated that the new index will complement the NDVI and other vegetation indices that are based on the red and NIR spectral bands.Download Free PDFView PDFRemote estimation of crop gross primary production with Landsat dataAnatoly  GitelsonDownload Free PDFView PDFPost-spill state of the marsh: Remote estimation of the ecological impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on Louisiana salt marshesAmelia FoxDownload Free PDFView PDFLunds Universitets Naturgeografiska Institution SeminarieuppsatserVegetation indices, FAPAR and spatial seasonality analysis of crops in southern Sweden2010 • Raunaq  JahanDownload Free PDFView PDFIEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing LettersMonitoring sustainability in tropical forests: how changes in canopy spatial pattern can indicate forest stands for biodiversity surveys2006 • Naikoa Aguilar-AmuchasteguiSustainable management of tropical forests has been identified as one of the main objectives for global conservation and management of carbon stocks. Toward this goal, managers need tools to determine whether current management practices are sustainable. Several international initiatives have been undertaken for the development of criteria and indicators to aid managers in moving toward sustainable practices. Despite these efforts, the question of how to apply and assess indicators remains to be answered from an operational, field-based perspective. Field surveys are expensive and time-consuming when management areas are large and in the face of logistical constraints. Thus, there is a need for an approach to prioritization. We sought to determine whether satellite imagery can be used, in conjunction with standard forest management data, to identify and rank priority areas for field surveys of bioindicators. The study area in Costa Rica, in forest areas managed by the Fundacion para el Desarrollo de la Cordillera Volcanica Central (FUNDECOR), was imaged by the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper in 1986 and 2001. Through spatial statistical analysis applied to the wide dynamic range vegetation index, we were able to quantify and rank changes in canopy spatial structure. The resulting categories can be used by forest managers to identify which areas are in need of field surveys. More generally, we show how to generate a moving baseline for change analysis and evaluate for significant deviations in spatial structureDownload Free PDFView PDFEstimating maize grain yield from crop biophysical parameters using remote sensing2011 • Noemi  Guindin-GarciaThe seasonal patterns of green leaf area index (LAIg) can be used to relate crop condition, yield potential and to incorporate in crop simulation models in order to update simulated values of LAIg. This study focused on examining the potential capabilities and limitations of satellite data retrieved from MODIS 8 and 16 day composite products to track and retrieve LAIg data over maize (Zea mays L.) fields for crop simulation applications. Results clearly demonstrated the variability of pixel temporal resolution obtained from MODIS 8 and 16 day composite periods and the importance of day of pixel composite information from MODIS products for monitoring agricultural crops. Due to the maize LAIg dynamics and changes in MODIS pixel temporal resolution, the inclusion of day of pixel composite has important implications to retrieve and monitor agricultural crop dynamics. The results of this study showed that MODIS 250-m resolution provide more accurate estimates of maize LAIg during the en...Download Free PDFView PDFAn evaluation of MODIS 250-m data for green LAI estimation in crops2007 • Brian WardlowDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
