This should ideally be based only on the men who have received education, thus creating a 'perfect' oligarchy; but the same political history of classical Greece, and also that of Victorian England, shows the utopia in the Aristotelian proposals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Federica Pennacchio•  6  Aristotle, Translation and Interpretation, Ancient Greek Philosophy, Aristotle's PoliticsEntre el "gobierno de la muchedumbre" y la "dictadura del proletariado".

Las consecuencias asociadas al desarrollo de la soberanía popular desde la Revolución Francesa, los procesos de democratización de las sociedades europeas occidentales, la organización la clase obrera como fuerza política y la revolución socialista en el siglo XX, son procesos históricos de nodal importancia que influyeron sobre quienes pensaron – a partir de diferentes elaboraciones conceptuales– en la demokratía ateniense y la inclusión política de las masas populares. El objetivo de este trabajo es exponer, analizando la trayectoria de determinados pensadores, algunas de esas conceptualizaciones que van desde el “gobierno de la muchedumbre” a la “dictadura del proletariado”.The features of the Athenian demos and, specially, the implications of the political inclusion of the masses have been objects of deep attention by several modern intellectuals. The development of popular sovereignty since the French Revolution, the democratization of western European societies, the organization of the working class as a political actor and the socialist revolution in the twentieth century are key historical process with profound influence on those who had thought –with different conceptual tools– about the Athenian demokratia and the political incorporation of the popular masses. The aim of this paper is to review, through a few particular intellectual figures, some of those conceptualizations that encompass from the “mob rule” to the “dictatorship of the proletariat”.Save to LibraryDownloadby Diego  Paiaro•  51  Ancient History, Political Philosophy, Classics, Greek HistoryGeorge Grote on Plato and Athenian Democracy: A Study in Classical Reception (1999)William M.

Calder III"This is the most informative book I have read on George Grote, England's second greatest ancient historian, since Mrs Grote's life of her husband (1873). For the first time Grote is placed firmly into the intellectual milieu of his time ... Demetriou is not obsessed with finding where Grote made mistakes. He reads Grote's "History of Greece" and "Plato" as documents moulded by the political thought of their time. His analysis of Greek history and Platonic studies in England before Grote reveals Grote's enormous contribution. For moderns Greek history begins with Grote, as Roman with Mommsen. Anything earlier is ignored. We underestimate his contribution because ignorant of what came before. Demetriou by emphasising Grote's predecessors makes his achievement clear. A comprehensive up to date bibliography and an index of names conclude the volume." Religious Studies, 2000. ABSTRACTGeorge Grote (1794-1871) belonged to the leading Philosophic Radicals of early Victorian Britain. A student of James Mill and Jeremy Bentham, a self-educated classical scholar, and a committed utilitarian liberal, he succeeded in revolutionizing the field of Greek studies. The author draws on both unpublished works of Grote and also a wide range of published material, with emphasis on the 'History of Greece' and 'Plato and the other Companions of Sokrates', to give us this study of the historian's thought and understanding of classical Greece. The book starts with an examination of Grote's early intellectual influences and then proceeds to an extensive critical exploration of the reception of Athens and Plato in pre-Grotean historiography and classical scholarship. Grote's monumental work completely reversed the traditional antidemocratic approach to the history of Greece, rehabilitated the Sophists and the demagogues after centuries of derision, examined in detail the working of Athenian democracy and the merits of political participation, and demonstrated that Plato's desire was to stimulate philosophical thinking in his audience, rather than establishing a system of dogmatic solutions to moral and metaphysical problems. At the time, Grote's original works formed an encyclopedia of classical studies and a major contribution to the history of political thought. His enduring significance in our own time is foremost the result of his profound and vast scholarship, but it also proves that ancient Greek history and theory can be still understood in the light of today's values and used as a resource for contemporary political reflection. REVIEWS Professor George Huxley, Review of Kyriacos N.

It has become typical to contrast the 'Idealist' Plato portrayed by the don of Greek studies and introducer of Hegel into England, Benjamin Jowett, with the 'Sceptic' Plato presented by the Radical philosophers John Stuart Mill and George Grote. Notwithstanding the mutual high esteem and reviews of each other's works and the fundamentally similar image of Plato they offer, Grote and Mill have a very different relationship with Plato's thought: Grote recruits Plato in the Radicals' field for his use of dialectical inquiry into truth while remaining unaffected by Plato's moral and political ideas; whereas Mill shows a profound Platonic influence in his notion of the rights and duties of a philosophical elite.

Since the late 20thcentury, lively interest in the works of Grote has seen his pro le revived and his ongoing signi cance highlighted: he has taken up his rightful place among the most celebrated nineteenth-century classical intellectuals. Grote's critical engagement with Greek historiography and philosophy revolutionized classical studies in his day-a revolution set against both long-established interpretations and prevailing trends in German Altertumswissenschaft. Twenty-rst-century scholarship shows that Grote's works remain lively, sparkling and relevant, as they o fers valuable insights that cut across the intellectual borders of the Victorian age. His diligent scholarship, fascination with evidence and sound judgement, intertwined with intriguing and insightful narrative prose, continue to captivate the attention of modern readers.

Britain, 1770-1850, was one such period. In examining Athenian democracy the British historians of the late eighteenth century, like William Mitford and John Gillies, found a convenient channel to articulate their private political preferences and antipathies, thereby accentuating the ideological antagonism of the post-revolutionary age. Athenian liberalism was deliberately drawn from oblivion only to be set as a constitutional example to avoid, whereas the merits of the mixed British constitution were distinctly exposed. The British Utilitarians, by contrast, produced a case on behalf of representative government that included the basic characteristics of democracy and which witnessed its minimum prototype in ancient Athens. George Grote assumed the task of upsetting the conventional idea of Athens, thus perpetuating the typical association of Greek historiography with contemporary political discussion.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kyriakos Demetriou•  13  William James, Athenian Democracy, The Classical Tradition, History of HistoriographyDemocrazia e tolleranza.

The main thesis of this paper is that Plato and the other Companions of Sokrates integrated extensively Mill’s defence of the values of individuality, freedom and self-development into a framework which remained tied to the empiricism he shared with Mill. It can even be argued that the Plato should be read in the light of On Liberty, a work that provided to Grote, inter alia, the analytical and conceptual framework to develop and enlarge his interpretative scheme. Through this brief examination I wish to provide a new look upon Grote’s groundbreaking interpretation in Plato and shed a new light on an aspect which has been insufficiently addressed in my earlier work.Save to Libraryby Kyriakos Demetriou•  14  History Of Platonic Tradition, Utilitarianism, Plato and Platonism, John Stuart MillRelated TopicsItalian translationFollowFollowingArchaic and Classical GreeceFollowFollowingBritish Classical StudiesFollowFollowingClassical TraditionFollowFollowingClassical receptionFollowFollowingTranslation of classical  and medieval texts in modern languagesFollowFollowingAncient Greek LawFollowFollowingHistory of Classical ScholarshipFollowFollowingGreco-Roman MythologyFollowFollowingNineteenth Century British History and CultureFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
