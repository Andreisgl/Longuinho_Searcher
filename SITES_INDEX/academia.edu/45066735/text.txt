C.W.R.D. Moseley (Oxford: Berghahn, 2020), 13-20Little can be said with any certainty about the earliest reception of Chaucer’s works. We do not really know how his writings were ex­perienced. Were the poems enjoyed in silence by individual readers who may or may not have mouthed the words as they were moving their fingers along each line? Or were his works read aloud to groups of eager listeners, as is suggested by the celebrated frontispiece illu­mination in the copy of Troilus and Criseyde in Cambridge Corpus Christi College, MS 61? Where and when, in which locations and on what occasions, did Chaucer’s readers first experience his poetry? If some of his works were performed, were these readings punctuated by interjections or even topical exchanges? Were his earliest audiences socialy diverse?See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers“Duxworth Redux: The Paris Manuscript of the Canterbury Tales.”  In Manuscript, Narrrative, Lexicon: Essays on Literary and Cultural Transmission in Honor of Whitney F.

These challenges also formed a central preoccupation of the texts that illuminators illustrated; yet limners’ responses to these challenges do not replicate in picture the anxieties that are voiced in the texts they illustrate. Rather, manuscript producers, informed by the dynamics of their profession, parallel in a uniquely visual mode the anxieties then in literary circulation. To those who authored images, who is the author of a text? And how is an authorial identity negotiated via pictorial allusions that substituted for the rejected convention of the writing auctor in manuscripts of Middle Enghlish verse? In responding to these questions, I show that the limners of the earliest major works in Middle English verse produced authors through a concatenation of voices and pictures, a repertoire deriving from pictorial media extending far beyond the parameters of their own texts. When tasked with pinning a face to a text, illuminators had no choice but to consult their own notions about a text’s ontology and the author’s ontological status with respect to it. This quandary was particularly pressing when it came to illuminating the metafictional and, following A. C. Spearing’s coinage, the autographic works that populated England’s literary scene in the later Middle Ages. The arguments that illuminators frequently offered arose not only from the texts in front of them but also from the cache of images that made up the intellectual storehouse of their profession. From these images, I argue that the tradition of authorial portraiture for Middle English poets is an indeterminate one that discloses, more than anything else, the hesitations and reluctance of its makers. The consequence of this argument, to be explored in later chapters, is that whatever authority is allowed the rhetorical “I” of the text is a contingent authority, drawn not from the virtuosity of language, truth of content, or prestige of its author but rather from copy-specific features of the manuscript itself. Without a sense of the “true” origins of a text, literature was, in this period, a flexible cultural production open to opportunistic manipulation and instrumentalization that illustrative programs could—and did—provide.Download Free PDFView PDFMiscelanea a Journal of English and American StudiesI do not wish to be called auctour, but the pore compilatour": the plight of the medieval vernacular poet2004 • Graham CaieDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Dynamics of the Medieval Manuscript2017 • Bart  BesamuscaDownload Free PDFView PDFSouth Atlantic ReviewExcerpting Gower:  Exemplary Reading and New Haven, Takamiya MS 32Joe StadolnikDownload Free PDFView PDF“Woodcuts and Decorative Techniques,” in A Companion to the Early Printed Book in Britain (1476-1558), ed.
