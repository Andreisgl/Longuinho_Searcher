We used a psychophysical method, an automatically evaluated Farnsworth's Munsell 100-Hue Test, to detect color vision deficiencies in patients who received beta-methyldigoxin or beta-acetyldigoxin for at least 4 weeks as maintenance therapy. Patients were subgrouped according to serum digoxin concentrations measured by radioimmunoassay. There was a significant correlation between extent and rate of color vision deficiencies and serum digoxin concentrations. About 80% of the intoxicated patients showed generalized color vision deficiencies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On day 8, 9 and 10, the serum digoxin concentration and the amount of digoxin excreted with 24-h urine were measured radioimmunologically. After i.v. administration the mean serum digoxin concentration amounted to 0.58 ng/ml. With oral administration preparation A achieved the highest concentration (0.51 ng/ml) and preparation C the lowest (0.42 ng/ml). Accordingly, after i.v. administration 118 microgram digoxin were excreted with the 24-h urine and 95 microgram after the oral preparation A and 73 microgram after preparation C, respectively. From the serum concentrations and the amount excreted with the urine the absolute bioavailability was calculated: 88.0 and 80.4%, respectively, for preparation A, 82.5 and 67.2% for preparation B, 72.7 and 61.8% for preparation C, 76.2 and 67.3% for preparation D.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The serum digoxin concentration was determined radioimmunologically. A significant correlation (p less than 0,01) was found between the severeness of the disturbances in color vision and the concentration of digoxin in the serum. The disturbances concerned different wave length regions. The lapse of time for disturbances in the distinguishing colors is being described in a case of suicidal intoxication.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

[Long-term therapy of chronic cardiac insufficiency using enoximone]DMW - Deutsche Medizinische WochenschriftEffect and tolerance of the oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor Enoximone was tested in 14 patients ... more Effect and tolerance of the oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor Enoximone was tested in 14 patients with advanced cardiac failure (New York Heart Association groups II-IV). During a mean observation period of 40 weeks there were four deaths; one patient became therapy-resistant. The remainder reported sustained clinical improvement. During the observation period there were no changes in heart rate or arterial blood pressure. There were no significant changes in cardiothoracic ratio on the chest X-ray or of the echocardiographically determined left-ventricular diameters. However, there was a rise in shortening fraction from 13.5 +/- 6.4% to 16.8 +/- 6.5% after 26 weeks, and to 21.1 +/- 8.1 after 52 weeks (P less than 0.05). The ratio of the systolic time intervals, PEP/LVET, decreased correspondingly from 0.74 +/- 0.23 to 0.44 +/- 0.09 and 0.43 +/- 0.10 (P less than 0.05). Hemodynamic measurements after one-year treatment revealed an increase in cardiac index from 2.4 +/- 0.7 to 3.6 +/- 0.6 l/min X m2, and a fall in pulmonary artery wedge pressure from 25.5 +/- 9.7 to 12.6 +/- 13.0 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). The drug was well tolerated and there were no significant biochemical changes. Long-term ECG monitoring revealed no significant changes in the arrhythmia profiles. Enoximone thus proved to be a successful therapeutic agent in the management of advanced heart failure.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Plasma medroxalol concentrations were assayed up to 24 hr after each dose by a specific high-pressure liquid chromatographic assay. Urinary excretion of parent compound was determined as well. Following oral doses medroxalol reached peak plasma concentrations within 2.5 to 3 hr. The t 1/2 of the terminal decay phase was 11.1 hr. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was between 11.2 and 16.4 l/kg, and mean total body clearance (ClT) was between 0.73 and 0.99 l hr-1 kg-1. Mean urinary recovery of parent drug within 48 hr was 2.3%, 3.9%, and 3.6% after the oral doses compared to 8.2% after the intravenous dose. Bioavailability estimated from AUC was 27.2% after 400 mg, 31.3% after 800 mg, and 37.4% after 1200 mg by mouth. Since aVD, t 1/2, ClT, and urinary excretion did not differ significantly after the three oral doses, medroxalol kinetics appear to follow a dose-linear model.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The concentrations of R(+)-, S(-)-propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OH-propafenone) were measured up to 12 h after administration by means of a sensitive and specific HPLC method that allowed the simultaneous quantification of all three substances in plasma. The results of 23 volunteers were evaluated pharmacokinetically. Main target parameters were AUC0-infinity and Cmax of both enantiomers of propafenone. Secondary target parameters were AUC0-infinity and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone as well as tmax for R(+)- and S(-)-propafenone. The 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-infinity for R(+)-, S(-)-, and 5-OH-propafenone were 0.85-1.07, 0.83-...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In each trial 12 to 14 healthy volunteers were enrolled. The single doses for promazine, promethazine and chlorpromazine were 100, 75 and 150 mg (orally) and 20, 50 and 50 mg (intravenously), resp. The serum concentrations of the three neuroleptics were measured by means of a selective HPLC-method. the distribution-free confidence intervals for the absolute bioavailability of the three phenothiazines were within 10.5 to 24.7% for chlorpromazine, 7.8 to 24.9% for promazine and 12.3 to 40% for promethazine. Promazine and chlorpromazine are pharmacokinetically very similar and differ substantially from promethazine.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since heavy water (deuterium oxide, D2O) was shown to be active in various cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, we now investigated its effects in human pancreatic tumor cells. The cytotoxic effects of D2O were examined in three pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3 and PANC-1). Induction of apoptosis was determined by Hoechst/propidium iodide double staining and cell cycle distribution was investigated by FACS analysis. Employing a clonogenic assay, D2O yielded IC50 values of 15%, 18% and 27% in AsPC-1, PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, respectively, and led to the induction of apoptosis when compared to untreated controls. Moreover, D2O caused a cell cycle arrest in the G2-M-phase (BxPC-3, PANC-1) or in the S-phase (AsPC-1). It is hoped that D2O might offer an additional option for the treatment of pancreatic carcinomas.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
