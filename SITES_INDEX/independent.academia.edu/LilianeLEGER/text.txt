Self Diffusion Constant and Viscosity of Charged Polystyrene ColloidsLiquid Crystals and Ordered Fluids,  1984We have used the “Forced Rayleigh scattering” technique with spiropyran dyed polystyrene spheres ... more We have used the “Forced Rayleigh scattering” technique with spiropyran dyed polystyrene spheres in aqueous suspension, to measure the self diffusion as a function of the strength of interaction between the particles. The latter quantity was modified both by adding electrolyte and by changing the particle concentration, as well as by using spheres with different diameters and charges. We find that the diffusion constant decreases monotonically from the Stokes value as the repulsive interaction is increased, until the interactions are sufficiently strong to form a colloidal crystal. At this point there is a first order transition indicated by the decrease of the diffusion constant by ~ four orders of magnitude and the presence of Bragg reflections. These measurements are compared with viscosity measurements done in the liquid and solid states, with quasielastic light scattering measurements and with models for diffusion and viscosity in interacting systems.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It discusses the interest of complementary self diffusion and viscoelastic measurements, and presents the currently available methods for measuring diffusion in entangled polymer systems. Results obtained on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a model liquid polymer well above its glass temperatured at room temperature are described, and the consequences on the limits of the entangled regime as seen from diffusion measurements, compared to what is observed in rheometry, are discussed. The chapter presents the dynamics of linear chains that could be described by simple reptation arguments, assuming that each chain essentially sees a frozen environment during its reptation time, as soon as the number of entanglements per chain is larger than 10. Below this value, the dynamics is strongly accelerated mainly through the constraint release mechanism: a simple reptation behavior is recovered when the matrix is frozen down, indicating that the fluctuations of the chains inside their tube are not dominant in this acceleration of the motion.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Dry Spreading of Polymer Liquids on Solid Surfaces: Role of Long Range Forces, Precursor Film Profiles and Specific Polymeric EffectsNew Trends in Physics and Physucal Chemistry of Polymers,  1989We present experimental investigations of the spreading of nonvolatile liquids (polydimethylsilox... more We present experimental investigations of the spreading of nonvolatile liquids (polydimethylsiloxane drops) on smooth horizontal silicon wafers. We distinguish the macroscopic part of the drop, which can be seen by bare eye (or through a microscope) from the microscopic part, or precursor film, which progressively develops, like a liquid tongue (thickness smaller than 1000 A) all around the drop. The spreading kinetics of the macroscopic drop appears independent of the spreading parameter, in contrast to the precursor film which is deeply influenced by the surface energies. We have characterized this precursor film (both its profile and its evolution) by optical techniques. The results are compared with the recent de Gennes and Joanny’ theoretical predictions, and specific polymeric effects are pointed out.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nous montrons que la densite de copolymeres formes a l’interface reste tres inferieure a la valeur de saturation et apparait peu sensible aux parametres d’outillage a structure geometrique finale donnee. Les vitesses de migration des especes reactives vers l’interface et les cinetiques de reaction de formation des copolymeres en l’absence d’ecoulement ont ete caracterisees, ainsi que la creation de surface d’interface pendant l’etirage du film lie a la coextrusion. La densite finale de copolymeres depend de ces deux parametres. Nous montrons par ailleurs que l’adhesion depend des conditions d’extrusion a densite de copolymeres donnee. Une simulation numerique de l’etape de refroidissement permet de correler l’adhesion et la contrainte exercee sur la section du film lors de la cristallisation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Experimental Evidence of a Nonuniform Microemulsion in the Low Surfactant Concentration RangeSurfactants in Solution,  1989The sodium dodecyl sulfate (or SDS)/ n-butanol/toluene/ brine system has been selected for invest... more The sodium dodecyl sulfate (or SDS)/ n-butanol/toluene/ brine system has been selected for investigation in the low surfactant concentration range. For a 6.5% NaCl salinity and the following proportions of the other components: brine 65.74%, toluene 31.90%, n-butanol 2.30% and SDS 0.04%, the sample is composed of a transparent upper oily region, an intermediate turbid microemulsion region, and a lower transparent one. The oil-microemulsion interface is sharp; the intermediate and lower regions are separated by a diffuse interface, a few millimeters thick. Index of refraction and gas chromatographic analyses plus quasielastic light scattering (QELS) characterize the sample as composed of a non uniform vertical composition aqueous domain of microemulsion type and an excess oily solution. In the aqueous domain, two regions with constant but different index of refraction (n) and mutual diffusion coefficient (D) correspond approximately to the intermediate and lower regions and are separated by a region with progressive n and D variation. The composition and structure results at a given temperature suggest an alcohol-rich composition of the microemulsion interfacial film, the n-butanol/SDS ratio becoming larger than for usual SDS/n-butanol/toluene/brine systems. Due to this fact, an unusually low value of the rigidity constant of the interfacial film is expected. Preliminary experimental results define the thermal range in which the sample displays a diffuse interface, and show that the surfactant is near its solubilization limit for the given proportions of the other components.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The authors have observed the influence of the polymer molecular weight, the grafting density and the solvent quality. At a high grafting density, in good and in bad solvents, the chains are stretched and the thickness of the layers is proportional to the polymer mass. In a good solvent the inner structure of the layers is similar to that of a semi-dilute solution of free polymer at the same local concentration, in agreement with the description of Alexander.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The slip transition at the polymer-solid interfaceJournal of Physics: Condensed Matter,  1994ABSTRACT Direct measurements of the velocity of a high-molecular-weight polydimethylsiloxane melt... more ABSTRACT Direct measurements of the velocity of a high-molecular-weight polydimethylsiloxane melt in the immediate vicinity of a solid wall (100 nm from the interface) have been conducted, using a novel optical technique based on evanescent wave induced fluorescence and pattern photobleaching. On silica, quite distinct behaviours are observed: (i) for weak polymer-surface interactions (silica modified by grafting of C18 hydrocarbon chains), a sharp transition between almost no and strong slippage at the wall appears for high enough shear rate, in good agreement with a recent model that ascribes the onset of slippage to a stretching transition of a few chains attached to the surface; (ii) for strong polymer-surface interactions (bare silica) chains irreversibly adsorbed build a pseudo-brush; only weak slippage develops with b (the length under the surface where the velocity extrapolates to zero) independent of the shear rate. No sharp transition appears within the explored shear rate range.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
