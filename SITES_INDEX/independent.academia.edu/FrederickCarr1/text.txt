The report also recommended that research testbeds be established, such as the Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) DFW Testbed, to ascertain the potential benefit of proposed observing systems. In this work, we use various conventional and non-conventional observing systems from the DFW Testbed in a series of observing system experiments (OSEs). Of special interest are radar data from Terminal Doppler Weather Radars and CASA X-band radars, as well as novel surface observations. The Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model is used to perform OSEs that are designed to assess the impact of these observing systems. A three-dimensional variational analysis system and companion complex cloud analysis are used to produce analysis increments, which are assimilated in ARPS using Increme...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Such observations are central to some of the most important research and operational goals in atmospheric and Earth system studies, mesoscale numerical weather prediction, and monitoring of regional climate variability. The Workshop was also motivated by the recommendations of the NRC study Observing Weather and Climate from the Ground Up; A Nationwide Network of Networks (2009, available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12540), several of which dealt with observational priorities in the low troposphere.

The system has been successfully used in research and operational mesoand storm-scale simulations and forecasting, and is flexible in dealing with data of varying spatial densities. It is also computationally very efficient. A drawback of such schemes, including the until-recent-years rather popular optimal interpolation (OI) schemes (Bratseth scheme actually converges to OI), is that observations that differ from the analysis variables cannot be directly analyzed. Examples include the precipitable water from GPS, satellite radiances, radar radial velocity and reflectivity. Variational methods have the advantages of being able to directly use the observations in a cost function, and through the minimization of this function the desired analysis variables ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
