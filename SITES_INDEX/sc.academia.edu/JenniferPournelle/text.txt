These theories hold that it was the seventh millennium BCE introduction of irrigation technologies from the northern alluvium to the south that began the punctuated evolution of Mesopotamian irrigation schemes. In this view, irrigation-dependent agro-pastoral production was the primary stimulus to urbanization and, millennia later, the emergence of city-states. In this dissertation, I cast serious doubt on the landscape characterization underlying this model. I argue that much of the archaic alluvial landscape of southern Iraq consisted in large part, not of desert or steppe, but of wetlands, and that this finding requires a comprehensive reassessment of southern Mesopotamian resource management strategies and their role in emergent complex polities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The question is used to examine the political relationships between the army officer corps, state, and society in Western-occupied Germany immediately following the Second World War, and to draw conclusions about the nature of the relationship between political and military power. To answer this question, I have considered historigraphy of the German postwar period; German twentieth-century military historiography; historical and sociological examinations of politico-military relationships in general; and political science analyses of postwar German domestic and foreign policy issues, especially as they relate to those of the Western occupying powers. In the narrowest sense, I conclude that Adenauer picked these particular men to be his military advisors because they were technically competent and highly qualified; trusted by and acceptable politically to the United States, France, and key members of his own and the opposition political parties; and shared an interrelated set of political and moral convictions which were nearly identical to his own.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a result of the hiatus in fieldwork in that region since the 1980s, and the antiquity of the majority of archaeological excavations conducted there, the record of radiocarbon dates for southern Mesopotamia is patchy for all periods. This is especially true for the mid-Holocene, when the world’s oldest and longest-sustained urban system first emerged there. The dates here reported not only make a significant contribution to available dates for this important region and period; they fill specific gaps in crucial geographic coverage, and shed light on the extent of marshland boundaries and the antiquity of settlement at key urban centers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
REVISITING THE SEALANDS: REPORT OF PRELIMINARY GROUND RECONNAISSANCE IN THE HAMMAR DISTRICT, DHI QAR AND BASRA GOVERNORATES, IRAQby Jennifer R Pournelle and Jen SmithBy the onset of the fourth millennium BC, proto-Sumerian civilization in southern Iraq exhibited ... more By the onset of the fourth millennium BC, proto-Sumerian civilization in southern Iraq exhibited a degree of economic differentiation, socio-political complexity, and urbanization previously unseen anywhere in the ancient world. The processes that began at that time culminated a millennium later in the formation of a powerful, persistent city-state system across southern Mesopotamia. Based on latter third millennium BC texts and twentieth-century ethnographic analogy, scholarly discussions of the economic underpinnings of these events have long emphasized three complementary natural resource pillars: (1) expansive irrigable plains in the northern portion of the Tigris-Euphrates alluvium; (2) vast pasture lands within and beyond the alluvial margins, extending into the eastern mountain foothills of the Zagros; and (3) the littoral resources of levee back-swamps throughout the irrigable plains, persistent lakes and marshes formed within the inner delta of the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karkheh/Karun river systems, and the outer deltaic estuaries where those rivers debauch into the head of the Arabian-Persian Gulf. Following a 20-year hiatus in foreign archaeological field work in Iraq, we present herein preliminary results of a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded geo-archaeological ground reconnaissance of the Mesopotamian delta, intended to launch explicit, rigorous investigation of the relative contributions of all three economic pillars to the genesis and long-term viability of the oldest, longest-lived urban heartland in the ancient world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A Southeast Regional Testbed for Integrating Complex Coastal and Ocean Information SystemsGovernment agencies, non-governmental organizations, commercial enterprises, and academic researc... more Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, commercial enterprises, and academic research programs have established a vast array of environmental databases for programmatic and research purposes. Most of these use different data management infrastructures that prevent repurposing or integrating information to serve other uses. Creating capacity to integrate and access disparate data streams enormously increases their value and application potential. Building on existing environmental information management expertise, USC has launched a Southeast Regional Integration Testbed (SRIT), and used this new capacity to implement an end-to-end decision support application that links monitoring data with predictive models in order to provide advance warning of impending beach contamination. The Water Quality Portlet project design reported herein serves as an exemplar toward establishing a sustained Center for Integrated Information Systems and Coastal Ocean Observations (CIISCOO) that will promote flexible, real-time data interoperability, across a wide user base, to efficiently meet evolving future needs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In a breathtaking sweep across disciplines, Dr. Jennifer Pournelle, Research Assistant Professor, Environment & Sustainability Program, University of South Carolina, will share her ground-breaking research on the marshes of southern Iraq, showing profound interconnections among their anthropology, archaeology, agriculture, biology, ecology, geology, literature, law, history, and politics. It is at once a tale of the world’s oldest, longest-lived city (Uruk), and its most recent successor (Basra), their watersheds, and the underpinnings of the trade that made them both wealthy.  The lecture will visit stunning marsh settings, and provide a preview of southern Iraq's environmental future.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
High Risk: Deltaic Resilience and the Genesis of Mesopotamian Cities (Iraq)The Tigris-Euphrates delta of southern Iraq is the locus of continuous, sedentary human occupatio... more The Tigris-Euphrates delta of southern Iraq is the locus of continuous, sedentary human occupation for at least eight millennia. The flourit of early Sumerian civilization there at the onset of the 4th millennium BC marked a degree of economic differentiation, socio-political complexity, and urbanization theretofore unseen elsewhere in the ancient world. Discussions of the economic foundations of early Mesopotamian urbanism posit that populations in this landscape had access to three sustainable pillars of complementary resources : (1) irrigable plains in the northern reaches of the alluvium; (2) pasture lands within the alluvium and in the surrounding mountain foothills of the Zagros; and (3) levee back swamps, alluvial marshes, and estuaries. Following a quarter-century hiatus in foreign archaeological field research in Iraq, this paper will report preliminary results of the first explicit geo-archaeological / geo-environmental reconnaissance of the Mesopotamian delta, aimed at explicitly investigating the relative contribution of these pillars to the emergence, growth, and reproduction of cities in southern Mesopotamia through time and space. Funded by an NSF High Risk Research in Anthropology and Archaeology award, ground investigation was initiated by the authors in Fall, 2010.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Deltaic Resilience and Early Urbanism in MesopotamiaThe marshlands of the Tigris-Euphrates delta at the southern reaches of ancient Mesopotamia were ... more The marshlands of the Tigris-Euphrates delta at the southern reaches of ancient Mesopotamia were once the largest wetland ecosystem in the Middle East. Despite (or because of) their past embodiment in popular imagination, central place in the world geopolitical eye, and essential role in securing the regional water supply, by 2003 they had been all but destroyed by engineering interventions that precipitated ecological disaster, collapsed local economies, and sent hundreds of thousands of refugees across international borders and into urban slums. This catastrophic loss of heritage, habitat, landscape, and livelihood invites open examination of the multi-millennial-scale longue durée of human habitation in that region. This paper argues that, through deep time, deltaic resilience has been inextricably intertwined with urban resilience there. It explores the integral role of the delta in fostering the birth of cities, and in mediating the reach of imperial aspirations across a landscape that saw the emergence of Sumer, the passage of Rome, and the rise of Islam. Recent evidence suggests that the contribution of marshes and estuaries was fundamental to the growth and sustainability of early southern Mesopotamian urban zones, and thus essential to the emergence of early Sumerian civilization. The durable presence of a succession of complex societies in what is now southern Iraq was sustained over millennia by the deltaic ecology that provided polities both a hedge against environmental instability, and a mechanism for obtaining and circulating labor, building materials, food, fodder, and preciosities not readily available to societies away from the deltaic core.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Smith, PhD, has just returned from a trip to the Tigris-Euphrates marshlands in the south and east of Iraq. The marshlands, which once supported a unique culture based on the marshes' natural resources, were drained after the first Gulf War in 1991 to punish the Marsh Arabs for participating in a failed Shia uprising against Saddam Hussein. Although the marshes have been partially reflooded, the ecosystem and the Marsh Arabs have yet to recover from this catastrophe.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Early Bronze Age Urbanism in Southeastern Anatolia and Upper Mesopotamia. Recent Analyses from Titriş HöyükAnatolica,  2021Controlling access to an important ford of the Upper Euphrates River in southeastern Anatolia, Ti... more Controlling access to an important ford of the Upper Euphrates River in southeastern Anatolia, Titriş Höyük, was one of the many city-state capitals that emerged across Upper Mesopotamia in the Mid to Late Early Bronze Age, roughly dated to the second half of the third millennium BC. Like many other such capitals at the time, Titriş consisted of a central citadel surrounded by an extensive lower city. Millennia of later accumulation made exposures of the city&amp;#39;s EBA citadel impracticable. However, much of the lower city was never reoccupied after the end of the Early Bonze Age and broad horizontal exposures and remote sensing surveys of this sector of the city help us understand the nature of urbanism at the site in its Late Early Bronze Age phase, dated to the last quarter of the third millennium BC. In what follows, we place the ebb and flow of the Mid to Late EBA city at Titriş in the context of wider contemporary regional and climatic developments. Additionally, we clarify aspects of the production of commodities at scale in the city during its initial Mid EBA Phase. Finally, we explore several aspects of the nature of the city in its final Late EBA incarnation, including (1) what is known about its physical layout at that time, (2) the diet of its inhabitants, and (3) the distribution of crops, animals, and material wealth within city households outside of its citadel.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This emphasis on the importance of transforming &quot;waste&quot; marshes for &quot;useful&quot; agricultural endeavor was especially operative during the formative period of Mesopotamian archaeology. Through the mid-twentieth century, it was embedded in research paradigms that viewed the birth of Mesopotamian civilization as inherently tied to drying of primordial lands, accompanied by state (or temple, or household) administration of irrigated plow agriculture. During the final quarter of the twentieth century, Robert McC. Adams insisted that any characterization of Mesopotamian civil complexity must include due consideration of both cities and their surrounding ruralized zones.
