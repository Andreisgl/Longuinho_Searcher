Jose Luis Rodriguez HernandezPushover Analysis+4I am Luis Rodríguez, a Civil Engineer from UNAM.I have more than 6 years of related experience in BIM, I have two professional certifications in Revit Architecture and Revit Structure in addition to the certification in Management of Building Information Modeling offered by AGC. He worked in more than 10 large-scale BIM projects adding more than 1,000,000 m2 modeled. Within the Structural Engineering area, he collaborated in two structural designs of vertical projects over 30 levels and one belonging to a commercial park of more than 300,000 m2.I am currently researching new technologies dedicated to the improvement of construction, in addition to being a co-author of technical articles related to BIM and its improvement in construction processes.He also gave lectures on the improvement of processes in the area of ​​structural design in construction. I am looking to share my knowledge of new tools, methodologies, and technologies that help improve construction processes.INNOVATION PROJECTSProject in the Philippines by Autodesk to automate processes within an ONG.Pilot automation project in health and safety reviews in infrastructure projects applying BIM.Generation of H-BIM models with an introduction to the bridge management system.RECOGNITIONS AND AWARDSAcceptance in the youth program at the Mexican Academy of Engineering (Academy of Engineering) August 2017.Academic Achievement in the 2017 Municipal Youth Award (Municipal Institute of Youth of Irapuato) August 2017.less83 Followers6 Following2 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall3 Papers2 Thesis ChaptersPapersGenerative Design for Constructability Improvements with Bim|Lean ApproachSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Structural Grid Predesign using Generative Design for Residential Building with Steel Structure on BIM Models Structural grid predesign using generative designby Jose Luis Rodriguez Hernandez, Juan Pedro Cortés, and Bruno FigueiredoEcAADe,  2021Due to the more significant architectural complexity, it is helpful to include structural analysi... more Due to the more significant architectural complexity, it is helpful to include structural analysis studies in the early design stages. An architectural team typically carries out the structural grid fit in this phase. This limitation may lead to the structural distribution in the initial phase not being the most appropriate. This work aims to provide a tool for architects oriented design by optimising the cost of the structure, making an initial layout for residential buildings with the regular shape of steel structures using the generative design, which allows the creation of structural BIM models that comply with the requirements of stability and resistance for gravity design specified in the American code ASCE 360 as starting point on the conceptual design. The paper describes the computational design development for the structural building grid using multi-criteria optimisation solved by a genetic algorithm.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a consequence, construction is among the least productive industries across various sectors. The researchers often point out that the critical issue is the lack of integration throughout the building project life cycle. Lack of information integration causes reworks unexpected changes, lower construction quality, delays, and on-site conflicts, which could be addressed in advance by a proper constructability study executed already in the design phase. Constructability is a technique that examines the logic of construction from the beginning to the end, seeking technical solutions that reduce project cost, time, and waste. The central part of the thesis provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of non-technical and technical constructability issues. Special attention is given to Lean and BIM approaches, which may serve as driving mechanisms that substantially improve constructability. The presented work tries to identify the value and integration of mechanisms for the improvement of constructability issues. Among the technical issues, the rationalization of the design plays an essential role in improving the execution and reducing project costs and delays.The final part of the thesis focuses on the rationalization of design addressing constructability issues by employing Generative Design. This approach is demonstrated in a case study of a complex building –Stožice Arena. The Arena case study shows the design rationalization techniques using generative design and machine learning, enabling informed shaping and clustering of the building envelope. The presented solution contributes to the evolving field of future architectural-structural design methods.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
