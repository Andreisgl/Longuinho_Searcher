As it becomes typical for an individual to mix and/or switch languages in everyday interaction, there is certainly room for more in-depth investigation, especially in determining the pattern of code choices among multilingual families. Using a descriptive qualitative approach, we observed how code choices occur in the family of two multilingual young adult speakers in Universitas Negeri Malang. The data of this current study were collected from two interview videos as a part of a larger project (Family Language Policy) we carried out in 2021 with a focus on how language selection processes work in their families. The results showed that there were different code choice patterns practiced in these two families; for example, the first family used Javanese as a primary communication code among family members,...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Specifically, we ask whether home language practice is shaped by parents’ education level, ethnicity, and occupation, particularly in parent-child interaction. Our analysis draws from an online survey of 1.344 multilingual parents from different parts of Indonesia, with the survey being mainly distributed to over 28 provinces, including NAD, North Sumatra (North & West), Lampung, Bangka Belitung, Jambi, Bengkulu, Jakarta, West Java, Central, and East Java, Yogyakarta, Maluku, Kalimantan (North, South, West, East, and Central), Riau, Sulawesi (North, South, and Southeast), Bali, Nusa Tenggara (West and East), West Papua, and Papua.

The present study aims to look into first-year EFL students&#39; preferences for using metacognitive reading strategies as part of an extensive reading (ER) program at one of the public universities in Malang, Indonesia. The data were acquired from both quantitative and qualitative data sources. The fundamental data were garnered from a quantitative online survey, and the results were counted using descriptive statistics. Semi-structured interview sessions with six participants were carried out to collect qualitative data, and the results served as a means to strengthen the primary data. The results revealed that the problem-solving reading strategy proved to be the most commonly used in the ER program, followed by global and support reading strategies. ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Addressing Information Overload in Smart Environment: Framework for Critical Media Literacy Integration in EFL ContextEducational Media InternationalAs media and technology advance and the environment grows smarter, information can spread more qu... more As media and technology advance and the environment grows smarter, information can spread more quickly and extensively, with fewer filters. In the face of the abundance of diverse multimodal and interactive digital resources, many EFL teachers still lack confidence in their ability to implement critical media literacy (CML) instructions. Meanwhile, the myriad informational media provides EFL teachers with a unique opportunity to teach CML to their students. Using a descriptive qualitative analysis of group discussions and interview data, this study proposes a practical framework to aid teachers in navigating the intricacies of CML practice in an EFL setting. The framework comprises three critical literacy practice resources: theoretical basis and critical media literacy principles, student characteristics and language level, and material and media selection. The framework also includes some competencies, comprising skills to analyse credible information sources, the ability to analyse and critique text or process information, and the ability to produce and distribute information.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Five YouTube videos containing 19 targeted words uttered by three Singlish speakers became the data source. The auditory analysis method was used to find distinctive vowels between Singlish and Standard English. The descriptive qualitative method was then used to determine the factors influencing the Singlish phonological differences. The results show that Singlish speakers tended to change the /ə/ to /ɜː/, not be able to distinguish the /ə/ and /e/ and have no rules in long and short vowel systems. All these differences are likely a result of contact language situations in Singapore that has been in place for years.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Focusing on the case of Javanese, the largest ethnic group, this study examines the role of the HL as an ethnic marker and its interplay with factors such as ethnic self-identification, proficiency, and usage frequency. The data were collected via parental surveys of 183 primary school children in East Java. The findings indicate that the Javanese language is still highly valued as ethnic marker and that Javanese people view its maintenance as central to their identity construction. However, inconsistencies are identified between attitudes and practices, with use of Javanese as a home language decreasing, and children’s production showing extensive influence from Indonesian. Taken together, positive attitudes regarding the Javanese as identity marker and the apparent ethnolinguistic vitality of Javanese is not nece...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Involving teachers and students of ICP-Grade 3, we collected data by analyzing the school documents, interviewing teachers, and distributing an English proficiency test to students. Our findings indicate that this particular program is put into a place under six frameworks, namely the implementation of (1) bridging course, (2) blended curriculum, (3) English-immersion in English, Science, and Math classes, (4) restricted learning hours for English, Science, and Math subjects, (5) communicative teaching and learning, and (6) the involvement of certified teachers...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is undeniable that the society has long been structured vertically hierarchical. There is always upper to lower social relationship among social practices. Hence it is manifested in the form of Javanese speech levels illustrating that a speaker should consider both role and circumstance. The levels of speech presumably fall into some smaller linguistic features, one of which is address term particularly maintaining kinship relationship. Javanese culture considers ascending generation as the polar asserting that father’s/mother’s big brothers/sisters, father’s/mother’s big brother’s/sister’s sons/daughters, father’s/mother’s big brother’s/sister’s son’s/daughter’s sons/daughters would be addressed as all terms equivalent to big or older sibling.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The extent of these effects may depend upon a speaker’s region and social background, as well as age of acquisition and proficiency in various languages. This study investigates the impact of these factors on the Javanese production among multilingual children in East Java. Specifically, we analyze the distinction between dental and retroflex coronal stops (/t̪/ /d̪̥ /, /ʈ/, /ɖ̥/), which phonemically contrast in Javanese, but not in Indonesian. The data were elicited from 95 children in Malang, a large urban center, and Blitar, a smaller city. The findings indicate that Javanese is shifting to a two-way contrast comparable to that of Indonesian; female and Malang speakers lead in this change. These findings highlight the significance of social factors in children’s language acquisition, and illustrate ongoing changes in Javanese.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
