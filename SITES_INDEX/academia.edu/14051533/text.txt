The most common, serious manifestation of Chagas&#39; disease is a progressive inflammatory cardiomyopathy, which occurs decades after primary infection. The inability to consistently demonstrate T. cruzi by histologic techniques in inflammatory cardiac lesions has suggested that the parasites&#39; persistence may not be required for the pathology of the chronic phase. In this report we further analyze the persistence and localization of T. cruzi DNA in the hearts of seven patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, along with four indeterminate patients and seven control patients seronegative for T. cruzi infection. In the seven patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, we extracted DNA from selected inflammatory foci-positive (IFP) and inflammatory foci-negative (IFN) areas of&#39; hematoxylin and eosin-stained cardiac tissue. We then used polymerase chain reaction methodology to amplify three...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWorld Journal of Clinical Infectious DiseasesPathogenesis of Chagas disease cardiomyopathy2012 • Luciana NogueiraDownload Free PDFView PDFPutting Infection Dynamics at the Heart of Chagas DiseaseGema LiconaDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational ImmunopharmacologyImmunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic effects of ganglioside therapy on the cardiac chronic form of experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection2011 • Tomas PoklepovichDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of tropical medicineBiologic and genetics aspects of chagas disease at endemic areas2012 • Maria Tercilia Vilela Azeredo-OliveiraThe etiologic agent of Chagas Disease is the Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted through blood-sucking insect vectors of the Triatominae subfamily, representing one of the most serious public health concerns in Latin America. There are geographic variations in the prevalence of clinical forms and morbidity of Chagas disease, likely due to genetic variation of the T. cruzi and the host genetic and environmental features. Increasing evidence has supported that inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are responsible for the generation of the inflammatory infiltrate and tissue damage. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms, protein expression levels, and genomic imbalances are associated with disease progression. This paper discusses these key aspects. Large surveys were carried out in Brazil and served as baseline for definition of the control measures adopted. However, Chagas disease is still active, and aspects such as host-parasite interactions, genetic mechanisms of cellular interaction, genetic...Download Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesInducible Nitric Oxide Synthase in Heart Tissue and Nitric Oxide in Serum of Trypanosoma cruzi-Infected Rhesus Monkeys: Association with Heart Injury2012 • Renato MarchevskyDownload Free PDFView PDFAutoimmunityInduction of cardiac autoimmunity in Chagas heart disease: A case for molecular mimicry2006 • Simone FonsecaDownload Free PDFView PDFVeterinary Immunology and ImmunopathologyDevelopment of chronic cardiomyopathy in canine Chagas disease correlates with high IFN-γ, TNF-α, and low IL10 production during the acute infection phase2009 • Carlos Chiari MDownload Free PDFView PDF…Induction of cardiac autoimmunity in Chagas heart disease: a case for molecular …2006 • Edecio Cunha-NetoDownload Free PDFView PDFClinical Microbiology ReviewsCardiac Involvement with Parasitic Infections2010 • Anis RassiDownload Free PDFView PDFCirculationPathogenesis of Chronic Chagas Heart Disease2007 • Edecio Cunha-NetoBackground—Chagas disease remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Latin America.
