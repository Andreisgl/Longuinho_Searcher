In this book, I address that void by examining the academic, personal, and professional experiences and multicultural competence of the people who work in diversity services in higher education. I examined the impact of their demographics and experiences on individual multicultural competence as measured by the Multicultural Competencies for Student Affairs-Preliminary Form (MCSA-P2) created and validated by Raechele Pope and John Mueller (2000). Data were collected from 182 respondents classified as diversity staff through a web based survey using the MCSA-P2 and a demographic information form. In order to gather feedback from a wide range of respondents working at a variety of institutional types, the survey instrument was sent to diversity staff around the USA who were eligible to be members of the Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education organization (NASPA).

Using qualitative research methods, the authors collected and analyzed written reflections from students throughout twelve sections of an educational foundation course. The authors found evidence that pre-service teachers had little understanding of the culture and behavior of African-American school children and were at a disadvantage when working with this group. We call this “white disadvantage.” On the basis of these findings, the authors make recommendations to increase the students’ exposure to diverse environments (in which they are not the majority), in their academic programs or through professional development in their teac...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
