Management accounting tools like target costing, kaizen costing, competitor analysis, balanced scorecard, value chain analysis, quality costing, just in time and others got great responses from the academicians. But when the issue of practical applicability came, it was found that, in so many cases, these revolutionary new tools and techniques of management accounting did not get much importance from the part of the practitioners. Another important matter that was found is that the popularity of these tools varied across the countries. The monograph concludes that there is a divergence in the use of management accounting practices among the industries and among the national cultures because of the fact that these contemporary management accounting tools demand some prerequisites to get applied and these prerequisites are not available in the same level in different countries."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Particularly, it requires an intense investigation of the accounting records to find out the underlying reasons for the fraud and take necessary legal action. On this backdrop, we see the emergence of forensic accounting as a sub-discipline within accounting and legal studies. This paper provides a conceptual understanding of forensic accounting and fraud investigation in the accounting discipline. Drawing evidence from literary, the paper briefly illustrates few critical issues: first, it defines forensic accounting and contrasts it with regular auditing function; second, it describes the role of forensic accountants and the skills needed for forensic accountants; third, it shows different categories of fraud and how forensic accounting is engaged with a fraud investigation; finally, it reports on the forensic accounting education with examples from different countries. The paper has important implications for accounting professionals, auditors, fraud investigators, and national policymakers. The paper is limited to the extent that it does not provide empirical evidence from an institutional context. Nevertheless, the paper could be used as an important guide to carry out empirical work in the context of Bangladesh and its corporations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
EXPLORING THE NATURE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RELATED CLIMATE CHANGE DISCLOSURE OF THE MALAYSIAN COMPANIESLABUAN E-JOURNAL OF MUAMALAT AND SOCIETY,  2020The objective of this paper is to explore the governance related climate change disclosure in the... more The objective of this paper is to explore the governance related climate change disclosure in the corporate reports of award nominated Malaysian companies. For this, the corporate reports of twenty two (22) Malaysian companies (shortlisted for ACCA Malaysia Sustainability Reporting Award 2016) were analyzed. Content analysis was conducted on the sustainability award nominated reports of the companies under consideration. The findings were explained from legitimacy perspective. It was found that though these award-nominated Malaysian companies are reporting on climate change issues, the extent of governance related disclosure is less. The format of reporting varies from company to company. Also, few governance related climate change issues were reported by these companies. Reporting was mostly done in narrative form. However, through strategic presentation styles, these companies tried to legitimize their activities. This study seeks to contribute to the scant literature on climate change disclosure from the perspective of developing economies (in particular, Malaysia). Another important contribution of this study is that, here, the 'governance related' climate change disclosures were taken under consideration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Specifically, it focuses on the trend of SMA research since the publication of Langfield-Smith’s (2008) influential paper “Strategic management accounting: how far have we come in 25 years?” which raised the question of relevance of further SMA research.Design/methodology/approachThe study reviewed articles published on SMA as a whole (comprising a set of advanced management accounting techniques) and its specific techniques for the period of 2008 to 2019 in 23 leading accounting journals.FindingsThe review finds that research on SMA has focused on the contingencies influencing the adoption and implementation of SMA techniques and the effects of such adoption on various aspects of firm and employee performance. The renovation and modification of existing practices in attempt to match with the organizational context has also attracted the attention of several SMA scholars. In addition, a noticeable shift to the strategic management theory and case study method was observed during the study period.Originality/valueThe study focuses on the trend of SMA research in an attempt to revisit the relevance of further research in this arena, particularly as a response to the criticism raised by Langfield-Smith (2008).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Organisations are not onlyreporting their financial information (in the form of financial statements) to thestakeholders, they are also reporting on many relevant issues in the form ofnarratives. Risk reporting is a kind of narrative disclosure that is increasinglydrawing attention from the accounting researchers. Drawing on theinterpretations from an impression management perspective, this study appliesdiscourse analysis on the risk related corporate narratives in the annual reportsof the pharmaceutical companies listed in the Dhaka Stock Exchange,Bangladesh. It was found that the risk disclosures of these companies aremainly generic, rhetorical, selective and in many cases, repetitive in nature.Through an impression management theory lens, we argue that such disclosuresare mostly serving as the tools of impression management and may not beuseful for the readers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The ultimate objective is to redesign the interiors of the existing public buses in Dhaka city to suit the needs of both genders. Several interior design aspects, their problems, and alternative solutions were discussed in three focus group discussions (FGDs). A customized service quality model based on SERVQUAL and RESCA models was used as the instrument for the FGDs which eventually led to the design of the AHP study. Results of pairwise comparison surveys based on the AHP model suggest the dire need for restructuring of the interiors of the existing buses, especially for female passengers. Finally, sketches of the most popular redesign alternatives are presented followed by a discussion of the policy implications of such reforms.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This intellectual movement involves a desecularisation of knowledge to show the Muslim Ummah the true path of leading life. A major objective of this article is to identify the problems and prospects in the implementation of Islamisation of Knowledge on human sciences. This article first highlights the proposed methodologies of Islamisation of Knowledge suggested by different prominent Muslim scholars. Then a critical evaluation of all these models is presented. The study concludes that though many scholars suggested many models of Islamisation of Knowledge, implementation of these models is still passing through an early stage with some irregularities to consolidate between Islamic component and human sciences. The article proposes a time-bound project-based approach for the implementation of Islamisation of Knowledge at educational institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The second limitation is the study neglects to focus on companies in environmentally-sensitive sectors which have more substantial adverse impacts. The third limitation is that the study did not examine all types of impression management strategies, limiting itself only to strategies which provide a favourable view of the firm. Finally, the study did not attempt to investigate the different levels of impression management strategies.Practical implicationsA major practical implication is for regulators to consider mandatory climate change reporting at least for the sectors which contribute adversely to global warming.Originality/valueThis is a first attempt to examine climate change discourses in a developing country.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Women travellers these days generate a substantial number of trips on regular basis even in the developing world where they enjoy less freedom. Hence, it is important to ensure that the available public transportation system can attract female travellers. This study combines and customizes two well-known service quality assessment models - SERVQUAL and RESCA to explore the perceptions of female university students regarding the public bus services in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. The study is qualitative in nature and follows an interpretive paradigm involving interviews of 20 female university students. Their perceptions are evaluated based on seven attributes i) reliability, ii) comfort, iii) service, iv) responsiveness and empathy, v) safety and security, vi) affordability, and vii) vehicle access. The findings postulate that the existing public bus service is unpleasant for both the genders. However, the situation is more hostile for the female passengers. Several interesting suggestions also came forward. It is expected that these recommendations shall help improving the public bus service for female users.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Political Corporate Social Responsibility (PCSR): The State-like Role of Business to Address Governance Gapby DEWAN MAHBOOB  HOSSAIN and Mohammed MehadiThis article focuses on a novel idea newly introduced in the domain of Corporate Social Responsib... more This article focuses on a novel idea newly introduced in the domain of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) popularly known as Political Corporate Social Responsibility (PCSR). In today's globalized world, business organizations are voluntarily addressing various socio-political concerns and engaging in activities that previously were considered as the responsibilities of the government such as eradication of poverty, supply of public goods, protection of environment, and reduction of gender, racial or ethnic inequality. It is generally perceived that governments of different countries (in particular, developing and underdeveloped countries) fail to perform these responsibilities in an efficient manner because of 'governance gap'. As business organizations have enough resources and money, they can contribute in narrowing the governance gaps by performing state-like functions. By presenting evidences extracted from CSR or sustainability reports of few Fortune 500 companies, this paper sheds light on the way these corporations are performing PCSR and helping the governments to mitigate those gaps.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Companie... more These days, corporate risk management has become a major concern in the corporate world. Companies in the global environment are exposed to diverse kinds of risks that are affecting the decisions of investors and other stakeholders. Therefore, companies are expected to not only identify and manage risks but also voluntarily report the same to the stakeholders. Increasingly, standard setters and regulators are requiring firms to disclose such information. On the contrary, there also exists a perception that risk reporting can create a negative impression among the stakeholders about the future of the company. In line with such growing dilemma for risk disclosures, the issue of corporate risk reporting (CRR) has been receiving immense emphasis from the accounting academicians. The main objective of this article is to conduct a comprehensive literature review on corporate risk disclosures. In order to fulfill this objective, at first, a summary of the relevant available literature is presented to identify the current regulations on risk reporting, existing trends of CRR research and theories applied in research. Then, through analysis, several research avenues are identified. It is expected that if these dimensions are explored by the future researchers, a better and broader understanding of the risk reporting practices can be achieved.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For thispurpose fifty two companies from the 2013 Fortune top 100 list were selected.Critical discourse analysis (CDA) was conducted on the basis of Fairclough’s(1989) framework. Fairclough suggested analysing the language from threedimensions: text, process and social. Through CDA the notions of power andhegemony were identified and explained with the help of Bourdieu’s culturalcapital as suggested by Everett (2004) and Aaken et al. (2012). The researchconcludes that discourses on women and gender carry the traditional patriarchalnotions and reflect traditional ideas about women prevailing in most of thesocieties. Women were presented as a distressed species and companies tried toportray themselves as the saviours of women. The findings of this researchcontribute to the critical accounting literature by highlighting the strategic useof language in relation to gender issues by large global corporations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities focus on the welfare of the society at large and can also serve the objectives of the Shariah. This research focuses on the CSR activities of the leading Islamic bank in a developing country – Bangladesh. The study is based on the CSR activities of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL) – the oldest and largest Islamic bank of Bangladesh. The analysis is done on the basis of the requirements of maqasid al-Shariah. The study is based on secondary data. It conducted content analysis of eight year annual reports (2009 to 2016) of the bank. The main areas where the bank is performing its CSR activities are identifi ed. Then an analysis is done according to the levels of maqasid al-Shariah (necessities, complements and embellishments). Itis found that most of the CSR activities and expenditures of the bank are dedicated to the necessities. And, activities representing embellishments receivedslightly more importance than the activities representing complements. The contribution of the study is unique in nature since there is no prior empirical study that assesses the CSR in light of maqasid al-Shariah in the Bangladeshi context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Maqasid al-Shariah in CSR Practices of the Islamic Banks: A Case Study of IBBLMaqasid al-Shariah (the objectives of Islamic law) are meant to guide and benefi t mankind in thi... more Maqasid al-Shariah (the objectives of Islamic law) are meant to guide and benefi t mankind in this world and the Hereafter. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities focus on the welfare of the society at large and can also serve the objectives of the Shariah. This research focuses on the CSR activities of the leading Islamic bank in a developing country – Bangladesh. The study is based on the CSR activities of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL) – the oldest and largest Islamic bank of Bangladesh. The analysis is done on the basis of the requirements of maqasid al-Shariah. The study is based on secondary data. It conducted content analysis of eight year annual reports (2009 to 2016) of the bank. The main areas where the bank is performing its CSR activities are identifi ed. Then an analysis is done according to the levels of maqasid al-Shariah (necessities, complements and embellishments). Itis found that most of the CSR activities and expenditures of the bank are dedicated to the necessities. And, activities representing embellishments receivedslightly more importance than the activities representing complements. The contribution of the study is unique in nature since there is no prior empirical study that assesses the CSR in light of maqasid al-Shariah in the Bangladeshi context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, it is also true that child labour is a common phenomenon in the developing as well as underdeveloped countries where poor families send their children to work for the economic sustenance. This article is an attempt to understand whether child labour is acceptable in the eyes of a religion – Islam. This conceptual paper makes an attempt to find solution of this ethical dilemma by analysing Islamic teachings derived from the Qur'an, the Sunnah, the comments of the Islamic scholars, and several historical evidences such as the case of the Prophet's young companion-Anas and the case of fetus in uterus of Ghamidiyyah-the adulteress women. From the context of the economic conditions of citizens from poor Islamic countries, the issue of child labour arises as an ethical dilemma. This paper makes an attempt to provide a solution in the light of Islamic teachings. The paper concludes that Islam allows child labour that is not hazardous and unethical. In order to eliminate hazardous child labour, initiatives should be taken from four levels: individual level, family level, employment level, and state level.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The article builds this argument on the basis of Marxist feminism which highlights that the capitalistic mode of production is one of the reasons for women's oppression and second category status in society. Thus, they face discrimination in many aspects of their lives. The paper also borrows the idea of Hazelton (2013) that access to specific information is a human right. The paper argues that a company's stakeholders have a right to know about its gender practices and matters related to gender equality as the companies around the world are the representatives of the capitalistic mode of production and thus somewhat liable for the inferior status of women. A content analysis of the 2013 sustainability reports of selected Fortune 500 companies was undertaken to examine the gender disclosures. The content analysis was based on the six dimensions of gender disclosures as suggested by the GRI (2009) and disclosures were categorised into " hard " and " soft " disclosures (Clarkson et al. 2008). It was found that even though GRI had proposed gender disclosure guidelines in 2009, still the sample companies are not disclosing many of these suggested issues. Given recent developments in public concerns for increased transparency and accountability and the movement covering social, economic and environmental aspects of corporate performance, the paper argues that gender disclosures are also necessary.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
