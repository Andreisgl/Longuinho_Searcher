Results[edit]
This section documents only those result sections where there are numerous or non-obvious return values.
Results like those found in namespacealiases or libraries, where the meaning of each item can be readily inferred, are not listed here.
Extensions[edit]
type: The extension type. The same extension can be registered in more than one type, in which case the results will be repeated for each different type. Default values include specialpage, parserhook, variable, media, antispam, skin, api, and other.

writeapi: Emitted if the API can be used to perform data-modifying actions like editing or deleting pages. See $wgEnableWriteAPI . 1.13+
Interwikimap[edit]
The attributes provided in each iw element include:
prefix: Is the prefix of the interwiki link; this is used the same way as a namespace is used when editing. 1.11+
local: Whether the interwiki prefix points to a site belonging to the current wiki farm. The value is read straight out of the iw_local column of the interwiki table . 1.11+
trans: Whether transcluding pages from this wiki is allowed. Note that this has no effect unless crosswiki transclusion is enabled on the current wiki. 1.23+
language: If the interwiki prefix is a language code defined in Language::fetchLanguageNames() from $wgExtraLanguageNames , this will be the name of that language. 1.13+
localinterwiki: Whether the interwiki link points to the current wiki, based on Special:MyLanguage/Manual:$wgLocalInterwikis. 1.24+
extralanglink: Whether the interwiki prefix is to be considered a language link, despite the prefix not matching a known language code. 1.24+
linktext: If the interwiki prefix is an extra language link, this will contain the display text used for the links. 1.24+
sitename: If the interwiki prefix is an extra language link, this will contain the friendly site name used in the tooltip text of the links. 1.24+
url: The URL of the wiki, with "$1" as a placeholder for an article name. 1.11+
protorel: Whether the value of url can be treated as protocol-relative. Note, however, that the URL actually returned will always include the current protocol. 1.24+
wikiid: The internal name of the database. Not filled in by default; it may be missing for you. The value is read straight out of the iw_wikiid column of the interwiki table . 1.18+
api: The URL of the file api.php on that wiki. Not filled in by default; it may be missing for you. The value is read straight out of the iw_api column of the interwiki table . 1.18+
Namespaces[edit]
Each namespace is given within its own element, which contains several attributes:
id: An integer identification number which is unique for each namespace.
case: Either "first-letter" or "case-sensitive". If the first letter of the namespace name is capitalized (the default), then the value of this attribute will be "first-letter". Otherwise, the value will be "case-sensitive" in order to indicate that the namespace name in question intentionally does not use a capital first letter. Note: "case-insensitive" is reserved for future use 1.16+
name: The displayed name for the namespace. In XML formats, this is the value for the ns element, not a property, and therefore has no name. In JSON, prior to MediaWiki 1.25, the parameter name was *.
subpages: This attribute indicates that subpages are allowed within the namespace. Type: boolean 1.13+
canonical: Provides the canonical namespace name of the namespace, which may or may not be the same as the actual namespace name. For example, all wikis have a "Project:" namespace, but the actual namespace name is normally changed to the name of the wiki (on Wikipedia for example, the "Project:" namespace is "Wikipedia:"). 1.14+
content: This attribute indicates that pages within this namespace should be treated as the main content of the wiki. Pages within namespaces with the content value set are counted for statistical purposes, among other things. Type: boolean 1.16+
nonincludable: Whether or not pages in this namespace can be transcluded. Type: boolean 1.20+
defaultcontentmodel: The default content model for the namespace 1.21+
Restrictions[edit]
Provides information about the various forms of page protection available.
types: Actions that can be restricted. See $wgRestrictionTypes .
levels: Levels that pages can be restricted to. See $wgRestrictionLevels .
cascadinglevels: Restriction levels that can be used with cascading protection. See $wgCascadingRestrictionLevels .
semiprotectedlevels: Restriction levels that are considered equivalent to "semi-protected". See $wgSemiprotectedRestrictionLevels .
Rightsinfo[edit]
In the best case this will provide:
url: A URL for the license applied to the wiki. If $wgRightsPage  is set, this will be the external link to that page; otherwise, $wgRightsUrl  is used.
text: The text to display for the license link (usually the license name). If $wgRightsText  is set, that value will be used; otherwise, the title of $wgRightsPage  is used. Prior to version 1.23, the license text (only) was also provided in the general section.
Statistics[edit]
This section provides similar info to Special:Statistics, along with the number of jobs in the job queue, in the following elements:
pages: The total number of pages on the wiki, including talk pages, redirects, etc. 1.11+
articles: The number of content pages on the wiki. 1.11+
edits: The number of edits since the wiki began. 1.11+
images: The number of files in File space. 1.11+
users: The number of registered users. 1.11+
activeusers: The number of users who have performed an action in the last $wgActiveUserDays  days. 1.14+
admins: The number of administrators on the site. 1.11+
jobs: The number of jobs remaining in the job queue. This number may be estimated. See Job queue  for more information. 1.11+
Other statistics may be included via the APIQuerySiteInfoStatisticsInfo hook.
Usergroups[edit]
This retrieves a list of all groups on the wiki, along with their rights and possibly other statistics.
name: The internal name of the group. 1.13+
rights: The internal name of the rights for the group. For a description of each right, look at the same group on Special:ListGroupRights. 1.13+
number: The number of users in this group. This will not be emitted for the all-users (*) group or autopromoted groups. Requires sinumberingroup parameter to be set. 1.16+
add: Groups that members of this group can add other users to. 1.17+
remove: Groups that members of this group can remove other users from. 1.17+
add-self: Groups that members of this group can add themselves to. 1.17+
