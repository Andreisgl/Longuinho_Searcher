It provides a mechanism for trialling different scenarios for urban heat island mitigation. Only recently, urban land surfaces have been included in global and regional climate models. Often they represent a trade-off between the complexity of the biophysical processes of the urban canopy layer and the computational demands in order to be workable on regional climate time scales. This study employs the Community Land Model (CLM) which was recently extended with a single layer urban canopy scheme (CLM-U). And although it is primarily developed as a tool for regional climate scales, we intent to extend its reach and use it for local (neighborhood) scales in a changing climate context. Hence, an off-line validation is performed using meteorological observations for Toulouse (France) and multiple medium density urban areas in Melbourne (Australia). Model results are evaluated against observations of the surface energy balance from flux towers, including evapotranspiration, and show that the model is able to correctly address (urban) energy partitioning including high urban heat storage, and low evapotranspiration rates. Furthermore an investigation was undertaken to explore first of all the capacity of the model to incorporate Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) features, mimicking vegetated and non-vegetated infiltration systems, open water bodies and other green infrastructure. In a second step, the effectiveness of WSUD integration scenarios are also compared with other common mitigation strategies such as increasing albedo and controlling urban morphology.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Multiple individual-, cohort- and canopy- based approaches are being deployed and, as a result, many common challenges in the representation of ecological principles in a predictive, global framework are being identifying and confronted. In this talk we introduce the implementation of the Ecosystem Demography framework into the Community Land Model (CLM) and test the response of the model to a set of residual ecological uncertainties that must be represented during the simulation of coexisting plant communities. In particular, we focus on the intensity of competition for light resources, the density dependence of seedling recruitment, and the impact of sub-grid heterogeneity on below-ground competition. All of these processes alter the tendency of the model to generate high-diversity ecosystems, with subsequent impacts on the resilience to climate. Appropriate benchmarks of community resilience to climate change are sparse, but slowly emerging, and we analyse how the alternative simulations of plant community structure alter the ability of the model to predict regional-scale observations of ecosystem vulnerability to drought stress.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We call these routines the HumanIndexMod. We limit the algorithms of the HumanIndexMod to meteorological inputs of temperature, moisture, and pressure for their calculation. All metrics assume no direct sunlight exposure. The goal of this project is to implement a common framework for calculating operationally used heat stress metrics, in climate models, offline output, and locally sourced weather data sets, with the intent that the HumanIndexMod may be used with the broadest of applications. The thermodynamic quantities use the latest, most accurate and efficient algorithms available, which in turn are used as inputs to the heat stress metrics. There are three advantages of adding these metrics to CLM4.5: (1) improved moist thermodynamic quantities; (2) quantifying heat...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As global warming patterns continue, researchers anticipate increases in the severity, frequency and duration of extreme heat events, especially in the southern and western US Many cities in these regions may have amplified vulnerability due to their rapidly evolving socioeconomic fabric (for example, growing elderly populations). This raises a series of questions about the increased health risks of urban residents to extreme heat, ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Modeling the integrated ecology, biogeochemistry, and hydrology of the global terrestrial biosphere in the Community Land Model (CLM4) (Invited)Agu Fall Meeting Abstracts,  Dec 1, 2010Terrestrial ecosystems influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes tha... more Terrestrial ecosystems influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. Much of our understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems affect climate comes from numerical models of Earth’s climate and their representation of the terrestrial biosphere. These models initially simulated only hydrometeorological processes at the land surface. They have since evolved to simulate the coupled ecology, biogeochemistry, and hydrology of terrestrial ecosystems so that the biosphere and atmosphere form a coupled system. As such, the simulated hydrologic cycle is an emergent property of the ecology and biogeochemistry represented in the model. Here, we use the Community Land Model (CLM4), the land component of the Community Earth System Model, to examine interactions among hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry with respect to energy, water, and carbon fluxes. Specifically, carbon uptake during gross primary production (GPP) is linked to water loss during evapotranspiration (ET). Model functional errors in the parameterization of canopy radiative transfer, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and canopy scaling lead to substantial errors in simulated GPP and ET. Improvements to these parameterizations gained from theoretical considerations and empirical studies reduce biases in GPP, with concomitant improvement in ET. Most of the bias reduction comes from the revised photosynthesis-stomatal conductance formulation; improved canopy radiation has lesser effect; and changes to canopy scaling have minor effect. A key model parameter is the maximum rate of leaf carboxylation, which is highly uncertain for large-scale climate models and for which various disparate estimates have been published. The effect of model parameter errors on GPP and ET is of comparable magnitude to that of model functional errors and offset bias reductions from improved model parameterizations. Our results imply that this key leaf-level physiological parameter cannot be defined independent of model-specific parameterizations. Our analyses suggest that we still have much to learn about the biochemistry of photosynthesis, the biophysics of evapotranspiration, their interdependencies, and how to represent these processes in models of the terrestrial biosphere for climate simulation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
