This study investigates the influence of satisfaction, trust, and price on tourist visit behavior in Bengkulu. Using a sample of 340 tourists and employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the study tests the relationship between these variables. Results indicate that both satisfaction and trust have a significant positive impact on visit behavior. However, the price does not significantly influence visit behavior. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing tourist satisfaction and building trust to improve visit behavior in Bengkulu. The findings also suggest that price, in this particular context, might not be a crucial determinant for tourists&#39; decisions to visit. This study contributes to the literature on tourist behavior and provides practical implications for destination marketing in Bengkulu and similar emerging tourist destinations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Idham Lakoni•Measuring the Impact of Promotion Campaigns Intended to Educate Tourism Services Consumers from Romania Using Kelly's TheorySave to LibraryDownloadby Lia Contiu•  8  Sociology, Perception, Principal Component Analysis, TourismSensitivity analysis of travel and tourism competitiveness Index to changes in component weightingSave to LibraryDownloadby Vesna Jankovic-Milic•  4  Business, Tourism, Directive, weightingA Satisfação e o Retorno às Festividades Locais: O Caso da Festa das Cruzes, BarcelosA medição da satisfação dos visitantes com um evento possibilita às entidades organizadoras obter informações sobre o que aqueles entendem que correu melhor e menos bem, assim como compreender as suas necessidades e motivações, ajudando... moreA medição da satisfação dos visitantes com um evento possibilita às entidades organizadoras obter informações sobre o que aqueles entendem que correu melhor e menos bem, assim como compreender as suas necessidades e motivações, ajudando os diferentes setores envolvidos a melhorar a qualidade dos produtos e serviços, e a promover e posicionar o evento. A satisfação dos visitantes contribui para a fidelização a um determinado evento/destino, através das intenções de voltar a visitar e a recomendálo a outros potenciais visitantes. Desta forma, se as entidades organizadoras compreenderem os fatores que afetam a visita e revisita, estão a contribuir para o sucesso do evento/destino, bem como para a satisfação e fidelização dos visitantes. Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo analisar a satisfação e a fidelização dos participantes da Festa das Cruzes (visitantes e residentes).

Especially in the tourism sector, where people are in constant communication and interaction, negative effects have been seen excessively. This situation also affected tourism employees economically, psychologically and physically. Therefore, paper is aimed to reveal the relationship among resilience, perceived vulnerability and mental health perceptions within the scope of hotel employees. This study examines the effects of psychological and employee resilience on hotel employees’ mental health perceptions. In this context, “psychological resilience has a signifant positive influence on hotel employees’ mental health perceptions” and “employee resilience has a significant positive influence on hotel employees’ mental health perceptions” have been developed. The study also examines the mediating the role of perceived vulnerability in the effect of individual-level resilience on hotel employees’ mental health perceptions.

Data were collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online consumer panel comprised of people residing in the US with an Amazon. com account and willing to participate in the surveys. The results revealed that higher awareness of the 2022 World Cup being hosted in Qatar improved host destination image perceptions, selective regional country perceptions, country character and relevant behaviors to either travel to Qatar for vacation, for interest to travel to attend the event, or to watch the event on TV. Implications involve strategies to create higher awareness for the destination using the mega-sport event platform for promotions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael Sagas•  8  Economics, Perception, Advertising, Destination ImageThe future of computing and foodSave to LibraryDownloadby Patrizia Marti•  2  Computer Science, TThe Effect of Sharia Destination Image on Developing Post-Visit Behavior: A Case Study in IndonesiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Abdul Lubis•  4  Business, Advertising, Sharia, Image Analysis (Mathematics)The tourist and the city: on orientation in unknown urban spaceThis paper concentrates on the spatial dimension of a city and human perceptive abilities in its reality.

A tourist is an exceptional person in a space which is unknown to him. He usually has a very general and virtual image of the place he wants to visit, often seen as a mosaic of fragmented pieces. He also has some quite well-defined targets and a limited timetable. Do our cities help him to orient himself in its space, unknown but desired and targeted? This paper formulates several rules which are helpful for better exploration of an unknown space in a city. They are based upon the theory of Orientation in Urban Space /A.A.

The aim of this research is precisely to assess the influence of stereotypes and prejudices (S&P) in the system of other attractors of tourist visits, on the loyalty and willingness of foreign visitors to revisit Serbia as a tourist destination. It is known that Serbia possesses large natural and anthropogenic resources as a basis for tourism development, but it is also known for numerous prejudices and stereotypes, which can potentially dictate loyalty to the destination and the behavior of tourists.

Tourism infrastructure includes a large number of services, necessary to meet the needs of tourists and increase satisfaction during their stay at the destination. The subject of this paper is the consideration of relationship between the available infrastructure and the achieved level of tourism development. The paper suggests that future tourism development depends on intensive investment in infrastructure and its modernization, as an important factor of development of the tourism sector. The aim of the paper is to analyze the correlation between tourism competitiveness in the Southeast Europe (SEE) countries and the level of competitiveness of tourism infrastructure. It is noted that increase in the number of hotel rooms is a factor that largely contributes to increase in the level of tourism competitiveness of the observed group of countries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sonja Jovanovic•  4  Business, Tourism Geography, Tourism, Modernization theoryAnalysis of Cultural Resources of Southeast European Countries as a Factor of Tourism Competitiveness / Analiza Kulturnih Resursa Zemalja Jugoistočne Evrope Kao Faktora Konkurentnosti U TurizmuThe former role of tourism in terms of provision of accommodation and food has become outdated.

Tourist offer increasingly includes additional activities, such as visits to various tangible and intangible cultural sites, and events that tourists perceive visually. In the contemporary tourism trends, cultural resources of Southeast European countries have become an important factor that maintains the competitiveness under conditions of the growing competition on a world scale. Cultural resources directly affect tourism, but there is also an inverse relationship reflected in the impact of tourism on cultural resources that are becoming an important factor for the choice of tourist destinations.

For the purposes of this research, factors (the so-called, pillars and subindexes) of the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) have been analyzed by applying proper statistical models (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis). Considering the fact that there is a high level of correlation between the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and TTCI, the influence of TTCI factors on GCI in SEE countries has been analyzed within this paper. This research points out the fact that human resources represent significant factor SEE countries should pay more attention to, when building up new strategies and programs of tourism sector development in function of increasing the competitiveness level and the growth of that sector.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sonja Jovanovic•  3  Business, Regional Science, TourismCompetitive positioning of winter tourism destinations: A comparative analysis of demand and supply sides perspectives–Cases from TurkeySave to LibraryDownloadby Savas Evren•  6  Business, Economic Geography, Tourism, Destination Management and MarketingUnderstanding The Marketing Mix Of Smartphone Market From The Consumer Point Of ViewSave to LibraryDownloadby Rahul Singh•  8  Marketing, Engineering, History, TechnologyA utilização das redes sociais na perspetiva das empresas de turismo em espaço ruralSave to LibraryDownloadby Carlos Fernandes•  4  Sociology, Humanities, Political Science, TourismElectronic Word of Mouth, Destination Image, and Satisfaction toward Visit Intention: an Emperical Study in Malioboro Street, YogyakartaSave to LibraryDownloadby Mustika Hati•  8  Business, Computer Science, Advertising, Destination ImageExamination of travel and tourism competitiveness contribution to national economy competitiveness of sub-Saharan Africa countriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Bojan Krstic•  4  Business, Applied Economics, Tourism, RoutledgeExamining urban tourists’ attitudes: The case study of Belgrade (Serbia)Personal characteristics have an important role in shaping tourists’ attitudes.

The purpose of this study is to examine tourists’ attitudes to elements of the tourist offer of the city of Belgrade, the main urban destination in the Republic of Serbia. The primary research aim is to examine the influence of these personal characteristics on such attitudes. A survey was conducted on a sample of 319 tourists, who visited the city. The collected data were processed in the statistical program SPSS25 while the formed hypotheses were tested using appropriate statistical tests. The research results indicated that tourists highly rated the diversity of the gastronomic offer and the quality of nightlife, while organized tours for visiting tourist attractions and the quality of traffic infrastructure were ranked as elements in which there are opportunities for improvement.

This bias is an important determinant of their behavior. Drawing on seminal research from marketing and psychology, the authors provide the first investigation of the tourism ethnocentrism (TE) phenomenon that captures tourists’ and residents’ motivation to support the domestic tourism economy. The research reported herein develops the parsimonious, reliable, and valid TE scale, and provides an empirical test thereof. The results show that TE is an important means to investigate both tourists’ and residents’ behavior. It drives tourists’ willingness to engage in and recommend domestic tourism, as well as residents’ support for domestic tourism development. The results further reveal that higher levels of tourists’ “perceived self-efficacy to contribute to the domestic economy” and lower levels of “perceived economy support of others” strengthen TE’s effect.

Para tal, é analisado com mais detalhe um dos principais eventos de cultura pop realizados no país, a Comic Con Experience (CCXP) em São Paulo que abrange todos os tipos de cultura pop e é uma forma de promover o turismo deste gênero e solo nacional. A CCXP se consolidou no mercado de eventos brasileiros ainda em suas primeiras edições nos anos de 2015 e 2016. Os eventos de cultura pop, já bastante elaborados e difundidos em outros países, iniciaram no Brasil no momento em que o mundo viveu a era de recordes das maiores bilheterias da história do cinema, isto é, desde 2008. O objetivo geral deste trabalho é compreender o Turismo de Cultura Pop no mercado de eventos brasileiro, mais especificamente por meio do evento CCXP realizado em São Paulo. O estudo é exploratório descritivo de caráter qualitativo, realizado com pesquisa bibliográfica e levantamento de dados secundários.

The ever-increasing competition within the tourism industry makes it vital for destinations to address their target group by tailored marketing measures. Furthermore social media channels are changing the interaction between Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) and customers. With the aim of exploring España Verde&#39;s image, a three components approach—cognitive, affective and conative was applied. Related to the measurement of the cognitive component, the study also focuses on España Verde&#39;s touristic potential ranging from a rich and diverse culture as well as a unique natural heritage to a suitable infrastructure for touristic purposes.

Moreover, recommendation from family and friends are considered to be the most credible source of information in the process of choosing a holiday destination, becoming relevant that studies on destination loyalty focus on this variable. Therefore, this research aims to identify the attributes which contribute to tourists‟ willingness to recommend a destination. The first stage of this study involved identifying the attributes to measure the image of Lagos in the Algarve region, an important Portuguese destination, through open-ended questions.

Despite the expanding focus on global sustainable tourism, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the potential factors that build momentum for revenge travel. The aim of the present study was to develop and test a conceptualized model of revenge travel under the influence of pandemic fatigue, COVID-19-branded destination safety, and travel stimulus incentives. Drawing on the study data of international expats (N = 422) and using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM), the findings provide new evidence that revenge travel is significantly and positively influenced by pandemic fatigue.

Numerous destination brands are now stimulating tourism demand through realigned travel incentives specifically for fully vaccinated travelers.

In many recent studies it has been emphasized that the culinary culture of the destination is an important part of the travel experience. Individuals who participate in gastronomy tourism represent a high educational level and a high income. Besides, it has as a positive effect on the local economy and the development of the region, because gastronomic tourism helps destination to preserve its sustainability. This paper aims to examine the role of gastronomy in the marketing of destinations, evaluate the gastronomic potential of Turkey and the marketing of the rich culinary culture of Turkey, so that it can be used more effectively. In the research, a qualitative approach has been adopted and Turkey's promotion posters, catalogs and other promotional materials have been examined and evaluated.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gülden KURT DEMİRCAN•  3  Tourism Studies, Gastronomy, TourismPredicción del comportamiento del consumidor en destinos turísticosLa presente investigación tiene como objetivo proponer un modelo teórico, partiendo de la literatura previa, que incluya los antecedentes de la intención de comportamiento del consumidor hacia un destino turístico y explore las relaciones... moreLa presente investigación tiene como objetivo proponer un modelo teórico, partiendo de la literatura previa, que incluya los antecedentes de la intención de comportamiento del consumidor hacia un destino turístico y explore las relaciones entre variables.
