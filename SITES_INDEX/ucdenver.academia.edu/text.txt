As Pugh says, the expectations-as-coloring books means workers ‘‘invoke those prefabricated shapes that demand narratives of personal accountability and fill them in with their own stories’’ (p. 30). Those interviewed convey acceptance, resignation, and a privatized responsibility for making the best, working hard, and not expecting too much. This ‘‘one-way honor system’’ names a key feature of U.S. employment that stretches from the top to the bottom of the labor market. Pugh considers how these expectations and emotional experiences vary by gender and by class, with recognition of the specific experiences of African American women and other women of color as well. The interview sample deliberately includes three groups: 1) professionals and managers who have faced relocation or job disruptions but are highly paid and seem confident in their opportunities, 2) people who work intermittently and insecurely in low-wage jobs and face all the stresses of barely making ends meet, and, in between those groups, 3) a moderate-income group who have steadier jobs, often in the public sector or helping professions such as social work or teaching. Pugh also acknowledges variation among women and among men, reflecting ‘‘gender innovations’’ rather than portraying simplified gender differences. Some mothers are fiercely committed to all their family members and engage in intensive caring and self-sacrifice. Other women carefully manage how much time or emotional intimacy or how many resources or second chances they will give to other adults they love (including spouses or partners), though these women still prioritize the practical and emotional needs of their children. Some men respond to felt betrayals by leaving their family members or cutting emotional ties while staying around, but other men have a ‘‘care work ethic’’ and dive into primary caregiver roles deeply. All of this variation feels accurate and important to acknowledge, but it also makes the middle chapters somewhat complicated. For that reason, instructors will want to guide students (with a schematic or orienting questions) to help them see the big picture of who responds to insecurity in what ways. Still, this is an important analysis of insecurity today and so well worth that effort. Instructors can also use the book to illustrate what thoughtful interview analysis looks like. I was inspired by Pugh’s interviews and what she helps us see from a close reading of those exchanges. Pugh has recent articles on interviews and cultural analysis that might be paired with the book in a methods course as well. Pugh has provided a gripping, if depressing, portrayal of the ways the realities of work today affect our emotional lives and our family commitments. The book is only more relevant now that we are in the Trump era, where we are engaged in debates every day about who owes whom what, what we can expect of U.S. companies and of each other, and how social solidarity can be supported in the face of economic insecurity. The Tumbleweed Society foregrounds the intimate—the work and family lives of women and men navigating this landscape—but Pugh’s thoughtful analysis connects their stories and discourse to these broader concerns.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter takes two disparate cases from public health – vaccines and family planning –that reveal patterns of inequality in who has access to individual choice and who requires state support to exercise choice. Looking specifically at dynamics of funding and compulsion, this chapter elucidates how reliance on the rhetoric of individual choice as an expression of freedom rewards those with the greatest access to resources and fails to make sure that all members of the community have the resources to shape their own outcomes or to make sure collective health is protected.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nowhere is this more evident than in pregnancy management and childhood vaccination. This chapter examines how women encounter discourses of risk during pregnancy as well as when they consider childhood vaccination and make decisions for themselves and their children. Using two case examples from a larger qualitative study of perceptions of risk and vaccine refusal, this chapter shows how women’s decisions reflect the ways their pregnancy and parenting decisions are driven by perceptions of risk that are embodied, subjective, and contextual, and that reflect different social locations and processes of management.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 34 parents who rejected some or all vaccines for their children, this article examines the strategies they use to pharmaceutically manage their children’s health, even when espousing a larger rejection of pharmaceutical interventions like childhood vaccines. Rather than treating decision-making as solely an internal process, this article shows how medication use results from individual, interactional, and institutional contexts, with different mechanisms of encouragement and enforcement. Using three illustrative cases, I show how parents manage ambivalence, which allows them to accept medication for their children as a tool to be deployed as deemed necessary in particular contexts while at the same time communicating their reje...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

“I Have to Write a Statement of Moral Conviction. Can Anyone Help?”: Parents’ Strategies for Managing Compulsory Vaccination LawsSociological Perspectives,  2018Laws requiring evidence of vaccination before children can enter schools or child care have been ... more Laws requiring evidence of vaccination before children can enter schools or child care have been key to public health. However, as parents increasingly reject vaccines for their children, they rely on legal exemptions that allow children to access these settings without vaccination. Using qualitative data from interviews, ethnographic observations, and analyses of online forums, this article traces parents’ understandings of legal regulation and their strategies for navigating vaccine laws. Specifically, it shows how parents resent the lack of information about vaccine exemptions available, how they laboriously manage information about their children’s care to protect access to exemptions, and how they strategize how to use exemptions in ways they see as in their children’s best interests, but not necessarily as the laws were intended. It then shows how these efforts represent a way to challenge state power, which parents see as limiting individual freedoms. It concludes by consider...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Teaching women to question and control: public pedagogies of birth and vaccine refusalBioSocieties,  2019In the US, birth has become a carefully planned experience for those with the greatest access to ... more In the US, birth has become a carefully planned experience for those with the greatest access to resources. Pregnancy preparations, including prenatal care, childbirth education, and peer interactions, encourage women to act as informed consumers, to communicate their own values, beliefs, and preferences in labor and delivery, and to challenge healthcare systems and medical providers. Simultaneously, there has been a growth in the number of mothers who reject medical recommendations for infant vaccination and newborn interventions. These challenges are presented by women with higher levels of education and resources, a group that is also most likely to insist on control over birth. In this article, I draw on qualitative data from mothers who reject vaccination recommendations for their children to highlight the interconnected experiences of childbirth self-advocacy and vaccine refusal. I suggest prenatal education toward self-advocacy may serve as a pedagogical process that mirrors the rhetoric of vaccine refusal. I conclude by showing how this new pedagogy of patient empowerment is nurtured and respected by pediatricians who administer vaccines and provide wellness care, even as they struggle with mothers who reject this core public health intervention.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The author explores how social media affect efforts to recruit participants, gain informed consent, collect data, leave the field, and disseminate results, particularly as participants have greater ability to respond to those findings. In examining the dilemmas ethnographers increasingly encounter, this article points to the shifts of power between participants and researchers and suggests that this might promise greater equity between participants and researchers, while also potentially introducing new pitfalls.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using interviews with 25 mothers who reject recommended vaccines, this article examines the gendered discourse of vaccine refusal. First, I show how mothers, seeing themselves as experts on their children, weigh perceived risks of infection against those of vaccines and dismiss claims that vaccines are necessary. Second, I explicate how mothers see their own intensive mothering practices—particularly around feeding, nutrition, and natural living—as an alternate and superior means of supporting their children’s immunity. Third, I show how they attempt to control risk through management of social exposure, as they envision disease risk to lie in “foreign” bodies outside their networks, and, therefore, individually manageable. Finally, I examine how these mothers focus solely on their own children by evaluating—and often rejecting—assertions that their...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article examines the reasons parents offer for doing so. It argues that parents construct a dichotomy between the natural and the artificial, in which vaccines come to be seen as unnecessary, ineffective, and potentially dangerous. Using qualitative data from interviews and observations, this article shows first, how parents view their children&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s bodies, particularly from experiences of birth and with infants, as naturally perfect and in need of protection. Second, parents see vaccines as an artificial intervention that enters the body unnaturally, through injection. Third, parents perceive immunity occurring from illness to be natural and superior and immunity derived from vaccines as inferior and potentially dangerous. Finally, parents highlight the ways their own natural living serves to enhance their children&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s immunity rendering vaccines unnecessary. Taken together, this dichotomy allows parents to justify rejection of vaccines as a form of protecting children&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s health. These findings expose perceptions of science, technology, health, and the meanings of the body in ways that can inform public health efforts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
