This  2020 virtual concert, created in collaboration with The Friends of the Erben Organ and described in this article allowed for a wide-ranging presentation about the harmonium and reed organ and its relationship to the pipe organ. In addition to introducing music world-wide that was written for important restored antique instruments, the virtual format allowed for technological/cultural narrative analysis via the insertion of spoken clips. Functioning like program notes of old, the extensive narrative clips do not disturb the flow of the concert because they can be electively clicked on by the viewer at any time. The concert featured music for a 1903 Mustel Art Harmonium, a Mason & Hamlin Liszt Organ from 1887, a 1925 portable preacher's organ and the historic Erben Organ. Composers included Kodaly, Bizet, Widor, Karg-Elert, Harry T. Burleigh, George Templeton Strong, Dudley Buck and Carson Cooman.Save to LibraryDownloadby Artis Wodehouse•  18  Historic Pipe Organ, Zoltan Kodaly, Virtual Learning, Virtual ConcertsSynthesis of Framework of Virtual Immersive Learning Environments (VILEs) Based on Digital Storytelling to Enhance Deeper Learning for Undergraduate StudentsThis study aimed to synthesize theoretical and designing framework of Virtual Immersive Learning Environments (VILEs) based on digital storytelling to enhance deeper learning for undergraduate students.

E dukacja zdalna ma długie tradycje. Kształcenie przy wykorzystaniu edu-kacji korespondencyjnej (listy tradycyjne), radia, telewizji, gazet, a więc starych mediów, stało się wymuszoną koniecznością w szczególności w krajach o niskiej gęstości zaludnienia. Równie istotnym powodem wprowadzenia metod uczenia się i nauczania na odległość był brak dostępu do instytucji edukacji formalnej i pozaformalnej w siedliskach oddalonych od więk-szych skupisk ludzkich. Wraz z rozwojem społeczeństwa informacyjnego wzro-sły techniczne możliwości przesyłania danych, lecz jednocześnie w wielu krajach nie zniknęły ograniczenia uniemożliwiające powoływanie nowych instytucji edu-kacyjnych, które zniwelowałyby brak dostępu do placówek oświatowych. Owa zależność spowodowała wzrost popularności platform służących kształceniu zdalnemu przede wszystkim w krajach rozwijających się. Z opisanymi wcześniej wyzwaniami od wielu lat zmagają się organizatorzy edukacji formalnej w krajach afrykańskich, Australii, Azji, Ameryce Łacińskiej, krajach wyspiarskich. Jednakże należy na wstępie wyraźnie podkreślić, że w większości państw nauczanie zdal-ne jest traktowane jako jeden z alternatywnych środków dydaktycznych. Jest to atrakcyjna, multimedialna forma przekazywania wiedzy stosowana głównie w nurcie działań uzupełniających tradycyjne formy edukacji (zob. Pegrum, Oakley, Faulkner, 2013).

Before the pandemic, the world had a harder time understanding the importance of touchless technology, and even then it was not imagined in this context. The gesture-based technologies and hand interaction that have been adopted in research have thus far not been popular outside of research labs. There are several issues in the design, development, and adoption of such technologies that should be addressed in the near future.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Zahid Iqbal•  7  Human Computer Interaction, Educational Technology, Interaction Design, Augmented RealityEducación mediada por Tecnología: alternativas digitales y virtualesPresentación de número Temático de la Revista Electrónica de Transformación EducativaSave to LibraryDownloadby Rubén Edel•  6  Educational Technology, Virtual Environments, Educational Research, ICT in EducationO real, o virtual e a prova no processo: fragmentos iniciais sobre as implicações da cibercultura no direito processual civilThe experience for the use of technology has generated new social involvements, especially through the "network society" and "cyberculture".

This study aims to analyze the influence of these virtual experiences for civil procedure, especially by the use of the virtual means for the formation of the probative set. It is fundamental to realize that in this association probatory there may be an antagonism that guides the truthful and the untrue, especially in the face of the plurality of meanings that the word " virtual reality" involves through "cyberculture and that is also contextualized in the intercommunication and virtualization of information .In this context, the work is organized in sections that are inclined to elucidate: reality and virtuality; evidence and truth; and the use of virtual evidence in the context of civil proceedings.For that, we applied the comparative and historical methods, using bibliographic and exploratory revision techniques to understand the use and validity of the virtual evidence as a probative source.KEYWORDS: REALITY, VIRTUALITY, EVIDENCE, PROCEDURE CIVIL.ResumoA convivência com o uso da tecnologia tem gerado novas experiências sociais, especialmente por meio da “sociedade em rede” e da “cibercultura”. Assim, o presente trabalho visa analisar as influencias dessas experiências virtuais para o processo civil, especialmente pelo uso dos meios virtuais para formação do conjunto probatório. É fundamental que se perceba que nesta associação probatória pode haver um antagonismo que norteia o verídico e o inverídico, principalmente diante da pluralidade de significados que envolve a palavra “realidade virtual” por meio da “cibercultura e que também está contextualizada na intercomunicação e na virtualização da informação. Nesse sentido, o trabalho está organizado em seções que propendem explorar: realidade e virtualidade; prova e verdade; e a utilização da prova virtual no contexto do processo civil. Para tanto, se aplicou os métodos comparativo e histórico, com a utilização de técnicas de revisão bibliográfica e exploratória para compreender uso e a validade das provas virtuais como fonte probatória.PALAVRAS-CHAVE: REALIDADE, VIRTUALIDADE, PROVA, NOVO SISTEMA PROCESSUAL CIVIL.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carina Barbosa Gouvêa•  7  Law of evidence, Comparative Civil Procedure, Civil Procedure, CiberculturaArt History 101 (course documents) Museum offered courseSave to LibraryDownloadby Lauren  Puzier•  25  Art History, Instructional Design, Educational Technology, Museum learningVirtual Voice Assistant Applications Improved Expressive Verbal Abilities and Social Interactions in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Single-Subject Experimental StudyChildren with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to have communication and social 17 interaction deficits.

Their impaired communication is derived from difficulties in acquiring 18 language. The use of interactive technologies has been demonstrated to enhance verbal and 19 non-verbal communication, as well as the social interaction tendencies of children with ASD. 20 Artificial intelligence has played a growing role in the habilitation of children with ASD. 21 However, little research exists on the possible roles and effectiveness of virtual voice 22 assistants in developing language and social skills in children with ASD. This study 23 examined the effects of using a voice assistant in children with ASD on two outcomes: 24 speech skills (expressive verbal vocabulary and production of short phrases) and social 25 interaction skills (playing/sharing). An interventional single-case design study was used to 26 explore this concept in three children with ASD between the ages of 4 and 11 years. The 27 participants used an accessible virtual voice assistant, Apple's Siri, for three months. Pre-and 28 post-intervention questionnaires and semistructured interviews with mothers were 29 administered to measure the communication and social interaction skills of the participating 30 children. Results showed that the virtual voice assistant had positive effects on the speech and 31 social interaction skills of children with ASD. The findings of this study implied that children 32 with ASD can use readily available voice assistant software to improve their speech and 33 social interaction skills. Furthermore, this study's findings could be used to develop strategies 34 to increase the availability of artificial intelligence infrastructure in schools and homes to 35 help children with ASD. 36Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohammed Safi and +1Ashraf Mustafa•  3  Artificial Intelligence, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Virtual LearningThe Value in Using Virtual Reality Immersion to Teach the Historical Middle PassageSave to LibraryDownloadby Yovanna Pineda•  3  Virtual Reality, Virtual Learning, Middle Passage, Atlantic World Slavery, African Diaspora, Slavery and Medicine, Black Women's History, Violence Studies, Caribbean HistoryVirtual Classroom Extension for Effective Distance EducationWe present the design, implementation, and initial results of a system for remote lecture attendance based on extending on-campus classrooms to accommodate remotely located students.

A remote student is modeled with a real-time video sprite. The sprites are integrated into a geometric model that provides a virtual extension of the classroom. The virtual extension is rendered and projected onto the back wall of the classroom. The remote students are displayed at a natural location within the field of view of the instructor, who can conveniently get a sense of their body language and of their facial expression. The system has been deployed in a first classroom and a pilot study indicates that the system promises to deliver quality education remotely. The system relies exclusively on commodity components, therefore it can be deployed in any classroom to allow any course to offer distance education seats. Figure 1. Distance education system deployed in first classroom (top), and photographs of the back-wall screen showing remote students integrated into a virtual extension of the classroom (bottom). 2Save to LibraryDownloadby Cindy S York and +1Melissa Dark•  2  Distance Education, Virtual LearningINNOVATIVE APPROACH TO TEACHING ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN WITH THE UTILIZATION OF VIRTUAL SIMULATION TOOLSToday’s society is growing, moving, pushing and pulling in so many different directions.

Society has moved from the invention of electricity in the 1800’s to the invention of the iPhone, which has changed the way we use, and perceive technology today. The survival of an architectural student depends on being able to communicate multiple drawings, graphics, images, diagrams and more in the most productive method. Each phase in design requires a clear and concise conversation between the designer and the observer. Schematic Designs generate some of the most creative ideas during a projects progression. With this understood, this section of this paper will analyze the introduction of Second life to students, professionals, and clients of architecture in a virtual simulated environment. The ability to demonstrate a design solution to a professor or another student across the world will truly increase the effectiveness of collaboration, critic, and cooperation. This applied research paper will analyze the application of Second Life in architectural education, communication, and creative design solutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maurice Dawson•  18  Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical EngineeringTitle: The Use of Eye Tracking Technology in the Evaluation of e- Learning: A feasibility studyAbstract: Higher Education is increasingly relying on e-learning as a means of providing students with teaching and learning resources.

Almost inevitably, this means that students interact with these learning resources through the medium of the computer screen. Although there have been significant advances in the design and implementation of online resources, exactly how students interact with these resources is a relatively new field of research. In this feasibility study students were asked to interact with a virtual learning environment, i.e. Blackboard, as well as Internet based resources, i.e. Ingenta and Wikipedia. Specifically, the students were asked to find the answer to a question provided, e.g. “what is classical conditioning?”orto locate a body of research related to a given topic, e.g. “theories of forgetting”.

The whole world is moving towards the 3D content platform, 3D printers, 3D TV sets, 3D mobiles etc. no exception to that is the web and all things in it. AquaFlux and Epsilon are two of our state of the art skin measurement instruments. Originally developed by our research group as research projects, AquaFlux and Epsilon have now been commercialised and used in more than 70 organisations worldwi de. However, due to the nature of the technologies, they often require on-site intensive training, which is expensive and time-consuming. There is a genuine need for an interactive virtual training environment that users can be trained whenever and wherever they want. This pa per demonstrates the development of a web-based interactive 3D virtual environment for these two skin measurement instruments to serve this demand. The new system contains detailed virtual user manuals, step by step interactive instructions that will direct the users on how to use these two skin measurement devices. The virtual environment will benefit users by giving users a very realistic feel about how these instruments work. VR (Virtual Reality) is an essential technology that will deliver to users the experience and knowledge in this regard.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr Omar Al Hashimi•  11  E-learning, Virtual Environments, Online Learning, Virtual WorldsImpacto del uso de objetos interactivos de aprendizaje en la apropiación de conocimiento y su contribución en el desarrollo de competencias matemáticas: un resultado de experiencia de investigaciónLa necesaria innovación en los procesos de enseñanza aprendizaje de las Matemáticas, teniendo como referente el vertiginoso avance de las Tecnologías de la Información y de la Comunicación TIC, que evolucionan los ambientes escolares,... moreLa necesaria innovación en los procesos de enseñanza aprendizaje de las Matemáticas, teniendo como referente el vertiginoso avance de las Tecnologías de la Información y de la Comunicación TIC, que evolucionan los ambientes escolares, obliga a indagar sobre nuevos modelos de intervención pedagógica en el aula, mediante recursos digitales, muchos de ellos disponibles en repositorios virtuales, a la manera de Objetos Interactivos de Aprendizaje, OIA,  como los puestos al servicio del sistema educativo en el área de las Matemáticas, por la Red Educativa Digital Descartes.

Beaudoin reasoned that online students sometimes engage and learn even when not taking part in online discussions. The context of this study was an online course on web-based education for a Masters degree in computer-integrated education at the University of Pretoria. We used a mixed methodology approach to investigate how online activity and discussion postings relate to learning and course completion. We also investigated how student collaborative behaviour and integration into the community related to success. Although the quantitative indices measured showed highly significant differences between the stratifications of student performance, there were notable exceptions unexplained by the trends. The class harboured a well-functioning online learningcommunity. We also uncovered the discontent students in the learning community felt for invisible students who were absent without reason from group assignments or who made shallow and insufficient contributions. Student online visibility and participation can take many forms, like read-only participants who skim over ordeliberately harvest others’ discussions. Other students can be highly visible without contributing. Students who anticipate limited access due to poor connectivity, high costs or other reasons can manage their log-in time effectively and gain maximum benefit. Absent and seldom contributing students risk forsaking the benefits of the virtual learning community. High quality contributions rather than quantity builds trust among mature students. We suggest how to avoid read-only-participation:communicate the required number of online classroom postings; encourage submission of high quality, thoughtful postings; grade discussions and give formative feedback; award individual grades for group projects and rotate members of groups; augment facilitator communication with Internet-independent media toconvey important information. Read-only-participants disrupt the formation of a virtual community of learners and compromise learning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lynette Nagel and +1Seugnet  Blignaut•  8  Instructional Design, Educational Technology, Distance Education, Instructional TechnologyTim Rittmann: MMORPGs als virtuelle Welten: Immersion und RepräsentationMit diesem Titel liegt eine veröffentlichte Magisterarbeit vor, deren redaktioneller Beschreibungstext auf dem Buchrücken einen „Blick über den Tellerrand hinaus“ verspricht.

This paper is an attempt to address this issue by proposing a new metric so that the educational potential when using robots can be further developed. Tasks in which students in Japan and UK interact in a 3D virtual space to collaboratively program robots to navigate mazes have resulted in quantitative data of immersion, Circuit Task Complexity and Robot Task Complexity. The data has subsequently been collated to create a proposed new metric for tasks involving robots, which we have termed Task Fidelity. The paper proposes that Task Fidelity is a quantitative measure of a set robot task in relation to a learner’s solution. By quantifying Task Fidelity educators utilizing robots in schools and in Higher Education will be able to provide tasks commensurate with the expected successful outcomes achieved by the learners.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stewart Martin and +1Michael Vallance•  7  Robotics, Educational Technology, Learning and Teaching, MetricsCaracteres.

In addition, since many LMS products require expensive licensing agreements or support teams, these tools are not necessarily the best models for users who may wish to implement their own online learning initiatives. In this paper, an evaluation of the use of Google Sites and Google+ in place of several LMS components for an online graduate-level course will be reported. Data were gathered from students over multiple offerings of a course that utilized Google tools for information presentation and discussion. Participants provided personal perceptions and reactions to using the Google platform, in general, as well as feedback and comparative opinions between the Google platform and previous experiences using the institutionally supported LMS.Save to Libraryby Charles  Hodges•  11  Educational Technology, Instructional Technology, ICT in Education, Online EducationInnovative Teaching Using Simulation and VirtualSave to LibraryDownloadby Ramesh Sharda•  5  Cognitive Science, Learning and Teaching, Virtual Environment, Virtual LearningDyslexia and learning computer programmingSave to LibraryDownloadby Norman J Powell•  15  Cognitive Science, Teaching and Learning, Higher Education, Special Educational NeedsVirtual Learning Environments: Another Barrier to Blended and E-LearningWith online and blended learning now commonplace, it is surprising that the research regarding the accessibility of virtual learning environments and other collaborative learning management systems is relatively sparse.

For the prototype system, a Facebook Group was utilised as a repository for learning content and the Open Wonderland platform was selected as a mixed reality intelligent environment for 3D virtual collaborative activities. Since tacit knowledge can be gained via collaborative group-based activities and discussions, a new Wonderland module was developed to integrate this platform with the Facebook group. Similarly, explicit knowledge can be learned directly via the prepared materials which are provided within the group repository. We hope to demonstrate that this approach can provide greater accessibility to the learning content since it can be accessed from both the 3D world and the 2D Facebook Group. In other words, this system can support both synchronous interaction as well as asynchronous data retrieval. Finally, the prototype system was evaluated by means of a two-hour task-based assessment and user-satisfaction questionnaire. We present the key findings from this pilot study (which were very encouraging), and propose further ideas for the future refinement of the concepts presented in this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadby Victor Callaghan and +1Shaya Pourmirza•  32  Human Computer Interaction, Social Networks, E-learning, Social NetworkingSerious Instructional Design: ID for Digital Simulations and GamesDigital simulations and games constitute a distinct category of learning intervention that calls for a tailor-made instructional design approach.

About one in four adults suffers from some form of mental illness in a given year (Holmes, 1/14/2015).This level of occurrence is even higher for college students—perhaps as high as one in two according to the article, Delivering Cognitive Behavior Therapy to Young Adults with Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety Using a Fully Automated Conversational Agent (Woebot): A Randomized Controlled Trial (Fitzpatrick, et al., April-June, 2017.) In a related article, Depression and College Students, Michael Kerr points out that financial worries due to high debt and poor employment prospects coupled with failed relationships, lack of sleep, poor eating habits, and not enough exercise frequently result in the development of depression (Kerr, 3/29/2012). There are also many life transitions and challenges to a student’s identity. In their effort to overcome this fear of stigma, Stanford researchers developed a virtual therapist, or conversational agent (often called a chatbot). The chatbot employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing to deliver cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to college students self-identified as suffering from significant depression and/or anxiety.Stanford's virtual therapist is named Woebot. Like many chatbots, Woebot uses Natural Language Programming to process student responses to questions posed by the virtual therapist, then guides the conversation to an appropriate node of a decision tree to provide suggested actions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mary  Harrsch•  6  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Cognitive Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, DepressionLearning Through Projects in Virtual Environments Designed for Adult TrainingSave to LibraryDownloadby Olimpius Istrate and +1Simona Velea•  5  Adult Education, Virtual Environment, Virtual Learning, Project Based LearningVocational Course DEI MTP101_U5 Block Printing"Block Printing is the process of using an object to make an inked impression upon a plain surface.

The authors of similar studies confirm increases in psychomotor skills of the subjects while utilizing VR simulation. This study relates to proficiency skills through a series of set proficiency checks. The goal for this study was to identify cost efficiency and faster training of welders in a single welding process, Flux Core Arc Welding (FCAW); with two different positions horizontal fillet weld position (2F) and flat groove weld (1G). This study also assists in developing a new teaching model to produce welders in or-der to the industry demands. This study was conducted in a regular training lab, and the utilized the Vrtex 360 and the Vrtex Mobile. Neither the researcher nor the study endorses Lincoln Electric Co. or the Vrtex equipment; the Vrtex avail-ability was the reason why it was chosen to use be used throughout this study.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gerald F Bickerstaff•  3  Cognitive Psychology, Virtual Learning, Virtual WeldingRemote Supervision Of Group Practice Projects During A Lockdown: A Pedagogical And Experiential PerspectiveThe current global Coronavirus pandemic has created a number of problems for the teaching and supervision of media-related practice (such as broadcast production) in Higher Education contexts.

This paper presents challenges facing the supervision of group projects involving media production and explores possible solutions drawn from various parts of the feedback nexus, ICT tools; and new approaches to supervisorial intervention. Ideas and solutions developed now under the current lockdown context can be used or adapted for future contexts of supervision involving various levels of restriction on movement or physical interaction.Save to LibraryDownloadby Don Duncan•  9  Media Studies, Journalism, VLE, ICT in EducationEasing anxiety through the use of social media among the youth: how Thomasians cope during the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 Pandemic which began in the first quarter of 2020 has significantly changed the way of education to the tertiary level.

Physical or face to face classes were suspended and the semester was ended online via different learning platforms of different Higher Educational Institutions. This study provides the different perspectives of students of the University of Santo Tomas and how they are utilizing social media as a means of coping up during the Pandemic and the community quarantines that were issued by both the Local and National government. A total of 279 student respondents were gathered based from the student population last Academic Year 2019-2020. Results show that there is dependence in utilizing social media in terms of communication and entertainment but a 'neutral' decline in terms of mental health and being a safe-space. The study also recommended that there is a need to conduct it on a larger scale basis and include not only Tertiary education, but also primary and secondary. State Universities and Colleges are also recommended for further study regarding the same topic.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jazztin Jairum Manalo•  6  Youth Studies, Social Media, Online Learning, Virtual LearningPlease sir, I want some moreIn this article, Dr. Samiramis Sarkardei IBDP Biology and Chemistry teacher discusses her teaching response to the virtual teaching and learning as a result of the 2020 Covid19 pandemic and questions to shift focus on one big summative... moreIn this article, Dr. Samiramis Sarkardei IBDP Biology and Chemistry teacher discusses her teaching response to the virtual teaching and learning as a result of the 2020 Covid19 pandemic and questions to shift focus on one big summative exam at the end of the year to skill-based learning that can be demonstrated by students throughout their learning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Samiramis Sarkardei•  3  Approaches to Learning, Virtual Learning, High School StudentsThe virtual learning futureSave to LibraryDownloadby Vivienne Westbrook•  9  Ethics, Student Engagement, Learning And Teaching In Higher Education, Cultural DifferencesRemesal, A.

Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 64 university students (55 females, 9 males) and analyzed to assess attitudes towards the virtual lab. Students reported that the virtual lab made skill acquisition easier and faster, helped them prepare for hands-on laboratory sessions, and was a tool they would use again. The key benefits of the virtual lab was that it enabled students to visualize procedures and reactions outside of the traditional laboratory setting. Student visualization enhanced preparedness and performance in the laboratory environment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Robin Kay and +2Helene GouldingJia  Li•  5  Health Sciences, Health Care Education, Online Learning, Virtual Laboratory3D Printing and Immersive Visualization for Improved Perception and Interaction with Ancient ArtifactsThis paper investigates the use of 3D immersive virtual environments and 3D prints for interaction with past material culture over traditional observation without manipulation.

Our work is motivated by studies in heritage, museum, and cognitive sciences indicating the importance of object manipulation for understanding present and ancient artifacts. While virtual immersive environments and 3D prints have started to be incorporated in heritage research and museum displays as a way to provide improved manipulation experiences, little is known about how these new technologies affect the perception of our past. This paper provides first results obtained with three experiments designed to investigate the benefits and tradeoffs in using these technologies. Our results indicate that traditional museum displays limit the experience with past material culture, and reveal how our sample of participants favor tactile and immersive 3D virtual experiences with artifacts over visual non-manipulative experiences with authentic objects.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carlo Camporesi and +3Paola  Di Giuseppantonio Di FrancoFabrizio GaleazziM.
