These protocols abstract from details of distribution and synchronisation. This makes them suitable for use early in the design process, before the details of hardware network and software design deployment are finalised. The specifications are given in CSP, and are shown by model-checking to be valid abstractions of various distributed and local implementations. The utility of the protocols is demonstrated by showing that important properties can be established of designs which employ them, such as whether data must be processed once, or whether it may be processed more than onceSave to LibraryDownloadby Steve Paynter•  4  Distributed Computing, Formal Methods (Formal Verification), Software Design, Asynchronous CommunicationLe réseau ville-hôpital: une nouvelle forme de communication entre professionnels de santéSave to LibraryDownloadby Alexandre SOUF•  14  Information Technology, Technology, Public sector, Biological SciencesThe computational complexity of scenario-based agent verification and designWe first advocate that the AUML (Agent Unified Modeling Language) notation, even in its new version, is not precise enough to adequately describe protocols.

The existing problem is the inability to know the status of a remote sensor or tracking device that is connected to the internet from a moving vehicle or a device fixed in a remote industrial location where there is lack of access to good quality internet. The other area where a remote speed test is useful is for service providers to monitor the status of their Internet Servers to enable them to provide better quality services to their clients. This project focuses on the use of Node.js, Express and Socket.IO to solve this very specific problem. Through the Remote Internet Speed Test (RIST) application, we resolve this issue by enabling the administrators of these devices to always know the quality and status of the internet connected to it irrespective of where they are and where the devices are located. Specifically, it does not matter even if the device and the person trying to remotely test the speed of the device are behind NAT or Firewalls as long as they both have access to the internet. The ability to connect to each other across routers and firewalls is enabled by the Socket IO server. Devices register to the server using their unique device id’s. The results of the application enable the administrators to improve their services as faster speed equates to better performance.Save to LibraryDownloadby GRD  JOURNALS•  5  The Internet of Things, Asynchronous Communication, Remote speed test, Socket IOPerformance analysis of spread spectrum packet radio network with channel load sensingSave to LibraryDownloadby Tarek Saadawi•  15  Distributed Computing, Modeling, Performance, Packet SwitchingModeling reactive systems in JavaSave to LibraryDownloadby Roberto  Passerone•  15  Computer Aided Engineering, Computer Aided Design, Computer Hardware, Java ProgrammingProject Gitta: Building a Virtual Campus for Higher Education in Geographic Information TechnologySave to LibraryDownloadby Eric Lorup•  20  Education, Higher Education, XML, Web TechnologiesExploring NoC mapping strategies: an energy and timing aware techniqueSave to LibraryDownloadby Cesar augusto Saavedra.R•  14  Computer Architecture, Computational Modeling, Energy Consumption, SocOnline Student Satisfaction: An Examination of Preference, Asynchronous Course Elements and Collaboration Among Online StudentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Marmon•  6  Technology, Statistical Analysis, Cooperative Learning, InterviewsA Guide to Real-Time Networks and Associated Literature: A Computational Model for Concurrent SoftwareThis paper is an introduction to Real-Time Networks (RTNs) and to the literature on them.

RTNs are a fundamental model of computation that consists of a collection of parallel 'activities' (i.e. single-threaded processes with internal state) which only communicate along explicit paths, each of which imposes a specific protocol. RTNs have underpinned various software design notations, such as MASCOT and DORIS, and RTNs are still often used by software architects when designing real-time software in other notations, such as UML. Important transferable concepts from MASCOT-3 and DORIS are introduced , including a rich family of predefined formalised RTN protocols. Sophisticated asynchronous implementations have been developed for the 'pool' protocol, making implementations of it possible which minimise the temporal interference between different parts of a system. Various formal analysis techniques have been taxed in showing the validity of these implementations. In particular, Simpson's 4-Slot asynchronous communication mechanism (ACM) has received extensive academic attention, and the conflicting results of this work have led to insights into how to classify ACMs; the importance, when modelling ACMs, of taking into account the way that the metastability phenomenon in asynchronous circuits is min-imalised; and the dangers and limitations of the 'atomicity' abstraction when specifying asynchronous protocols. Other formalisation and analysis techniques that have been developed for RTNs are described, including: ADL, a activity formal specification language; and SHARD, a hazard analysis technique for RTNs. It is explained why notations based on the synchrony hypothesis (such as Statecharts) are inadequate for specifying the behaviour of arbitrary RTN systems, and alternative proposals are introduced, including: Mode-machines; Transactions; and Interactions. Finally, RTNs are compared with the currently reigning 'OO' design paradigm, and it is argued that RTNs embody a sophisticated concurrent object-oriented computational paradigm that has yet to be fully appreciated by many OO software architects. RTNs and dynamic reconfigurable systems are briefly discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Steve Paynter•  13  Real-time Systems, UML, Real Time Embedded Systems, Asynchronous CommunicationModeling reactive systems in JavaSave to LibraryDownloadby Jonathan Martin•  17  Computer Aided Engineering, Computer Aided Design, Computer Hardware, Java ProgrammingAsynchronous and synchronous online teaching: Perspectives of Canadian high school distance education teachersThis paper presents the results of an inductive, interpretive analysis of the perspectives of 42 Canadian high school distance education (DE) teachers on asynchronous and synchronous online teaching.

The paper includes a conceptual overview of the affor-dances and constraints of each form of teaching. Findings provided insight into the following aspects of asynchronous and synchronous online teaching: degree of use; the tools used; the contexts in which each occur; students' preferences; and limitations. Pedagogy emerged as more important than media for both asynchronous and synchronous online teaching. Synchronous online teaching relied on teacher-rather than student-centred approaches. Asynchronous online teaching provided support for self-paced, highly independent forms of secondary DE supplemented by synchronous online teaching for answering questions and troubleshooting.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Murphy and +1Michael Barbour•  4  Online Learning, Distance Learning, Asynchronous Communication, Synchronous CommunicationUsing Webcasts in Education: Evaluation of its EffectivenessSave to LibraryDownloadby Michail Giannakos•  3  Educational Technology, Asynchronous Communication, Comparative AnalysisUsing a Generalized Checklist to Improve Student Assignment Submission Times in an Online CourseSave to LibraryDownloadby Terence Cavanaugh•  6  Statistical Analysis, Online Learning, Asynchronous Communication, Time ManagementProblem-Based Learning Online: Perceptions of Health Science StudentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ruta Valaitis•  28  Communication, Decision Making, Graduate Education, Problem Based LearningThe Role of the Individualism-Collectivism Dimension in Distance Learning Environments: An Empirical StudyWith increasing reliance on outsourcing, cross-cultural teams, distributed knowledge workers, and other international collaborations distance learning (DL) has become a key agent of strategic competitive advantage and organisational... moreWith increasing reliance on outsourcing, cross-cultural teams, distributed knowledge workers, and other international collaborations distance learning (DL) has become a key agent of strategic competitive advantage and organisational renewal. This study stresses the importance of culture to DL success. To effectively use DL, we must understand the role culture plays in conceptualizing, inventing, and adapting this technology. We focused on Hofstede's individualism-collectivism dimension and asked whether it impacts perceived satisfaction and learning climate, known measures of DL effectiveness. We find that collectivistic groups enjoy more than individualistic groups the learning climate of a DL environment yet are not as Satisfied as individualistic groups with the overall results. We contend that this is because the open-endedness of asynchronous communication gives collectivistic groups simultaneously a sense of connectedness to their peers and a sense of disconnectedness from the instructor. Organizations will increase the benefits of DL by providing choices that embrace cultural differences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Leonardo Legorreta and +1Anastasia Gaspay•  9  Distance Learning, Competitive advantage, Asynchronous Communication, Cultural differenceLost in Translation: Importance of Effective Communication in Online EducationSave to LibraryDownloadby Kristen Betts•  13  Information Technology, Communication, Higher Education, Voice over IPTHE BIGGS AND MOORE MODEL IN E-LEARNING: The role of motivation and collaboration as moderatorsSave to LibraryDownloadby Matti Haverila•  7  Statistical Analysis, Computer Mediated Communication, Cooperation, ModelsFirst-class user-level threadsSave to LibraryDownloadby Thomas Leblanc•  4  Operating Systems, OPERATING SYSTEM, Asynchronous Communication, Shared memoryTeam-based learning in asynchronous online settingsSave to LibraryDownloadby Carolyn Awalt•  6  Education, Instructional Design, Educational Technology, Cooperative LearningEXPLORING THE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY OF ONLINE ASYNCHRONOUS SUPPORT TOOLSABSTRACT This paper is concerned with evaluating the characteristics of asynchrono popular asynchronous tools; email, discussion boards and online asses ed to engineer and sustain asynchronous support proc educational value for lecturers... moreABSTRACT This paper is concerned with evaluating the characteristics of asynchrono popular asynchronous tools; email, discussion boards and online asses ed to engineer and sustain asynchronous support proc educational value for lecturers and students, using techniques to explore the onomic value of reusable online support, thus enhancing online asynchronous support. ywords: quality, asynchronous support, email, discussion board, online sessmentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Noel Carroll•  9  Instructional Design, Educational Technology, E-learning, Distance EducationPrime osservazioni sulla grammatica dei gruppi di discussione telematici di lingua italianaSave to LibraryDownloadby Vera Gheno•  5  Sociolinguistics, Computer-Mediated Communication, Young People and The Internet, Italian languageTeam awareness in personalised learning environmentsIn most of today&#x27;s campus-like learning settings, students are frequently confronted with e-learning systems that do not only deliver and display learning content, but are equipped with a number of integrated tools for file sharing,... moreIn most of today&#x27;s campus-like learning settings, students are frequently confronted with e-learning systems that do not only deliver and display learning content, but are equipped with a number of integrated tools for file sharing, communication, personalisation (personal annotations, text marking, etc) and cooperation.

Not only is there a need for trainees to engage in critical reflection on relevant literature, observations and one’s own teaching experiences, but also to share such thinking with their peers. The importance of collaborative reflectivity has been continuously highlighted as a means to foster teacher development among trainees, and computer-mediated communication has become a powerful tool in facilitating such reflectivity over the past decade. This study ex- plores asynchronous discussion forums (ADFs) as a tool for foster- ing teacher development through online reflectivity among teacher trainees at The University of Siena by analysing the types of reflec- tion present. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied to the study to observe the potential of the tool in order to recognise its importance in teacher training. An analysis of the ADFs revealed that during their first year, a supportive online community had developed, and trainees’ reflections progressed from a descrip- tive form to a more deliberative form, demonstrating a marked usage of specific terminology related to English language teaching.Save to LibraryDownloadby Meg Cassamally•Asynchronous CommunicationA re-examination of the community of inquiry framework: Social network and content analysisSave to LibraryDownloadby Jason Vickers•  19  Discourse Analysis, Social Networks, Higher Education, Evaluation ResearchA real-time extension of creol for modelling biomedical sensorsSave to LibraryDownloadby Marcel  Kyas•  3  Asynchronous Communication, Real Time Systems, Real TimeAsynchronous Videoconferencing: A Hybrid Communication PrototypeSave to LibraryDownloadby Joseph Walther•  9  Multimedia Communication, Communication System, Asynchronous Communication, IndexingPolyphonic/Pseudo-synchronic: Animated Writing in the Comment Feed of Nicovideo (2013)Nicovideo is a popular video-sharing site in Japan that incorporates several aspects of social media into its design.

Key among these is the projection of user-made comments into the video display by having text scroll across the screen like an animated subtitle-track. The movement of comments across the screen and the ‘pseudo-synchronicity’ created by the way they are projected produces a feeling of ‘live’ viewing via a sense of virtual time shared between users. In this article I argue that the feeling of movement and time on the site directs users toward a certain kind of vision that, when considered alongside the modes of counter-transparent communication taken up by its user base through things like orthographic ‘mistypes’, is part of a shift between denotational and pictorial forms of text production that troubles the distinction between reading and other modes of vision. The article conceptualizes what kind of vision Nicovideo’s interface suggests and its relationship to a distinct kind of polyphonic, anonymous communication that intersects with ideas of animation and performance. It is particularly through the intensity of textual representation that I will pursue these questions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Johnson•  15  Japanese Studies, Media Studies, New Media, Internet StudiesImproving online social presence through asynchronous videoOnline learning has become a reality for many students in higher education.

Unfortunately, something that has also become a reality is a sense of isolation in online courses, and Moore (1980) has warned that students’ sense of distance can threaten their ability to learn. The community of inquiry framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000) has provided insight into ways that online interactions can improve students’ and instructors’ social presence and learning. Emerging video technologies may be able to improve these interactions and thus more easily support the development of communities of inquiry. In this study we interviewed students in three distinct courses using different video-based instructional strategies. Many students indicated feeling that the video-based communication made their instructors seem more real, present, and familiar, and several students indicated that these relationships were similar to face-to-face instruction. Video communication impacted students’ social presence in similar ways, although to a lesser degree than they believed it impacted instructor social presence. We conclude with discussion for future research and practice. 2Save to LibraryDownloadby Richard West•  4  Distance Education, Online Learning, Social Presence, Asynchronous CommunicationAsynchronous Decision-Making In Distributed TeamsSave to LibraryDownloadby James Howison•  9  Decision Making, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Open Source Software, Software DevelopmentSoompi and the "Honorary Asian": Shifting Identities in the Digital AgeSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephanie Parker•  20  Social Sciences, Social Networking, Online Communities, Virtual CommunitiesUsing Computer-Mediated Communication to Establish Social and Supportive Environments In Teacher EducationSave to LibraryDownloadby Nike Arnold•  16  Teacher Education, Computer Mediated Communication, Qualitative Research, LinguisticsProblem-Based Learning Online: Perceptions of Health Science StudentsThis qualitative study explored health sciences students' perceptions of their experiences in online problem based learning (PBL) and focused on their views about learning and group process in the online environment.

Participants were novices to online learning and highly experienced in PBL, therefore, they could reflect on past face-to-face PBL experiences. Three groups of learners were involved, including undergraduate nursing and midwifery students and graduate students in a neonatal nurse practitioner program. Findings are presented using the six steps of the PBL process (Rideout & Carpio, 2001). Results indicated that it is feasible to conduct PBL online. Students felt that it increased their flexibility for learning, enhanced their ability to deeply process content, and provided access to valuable learning resources. Students experienced a period of adaptation to the online environment, perceived a heavy workload, and had difficulties making group decisions online. In addition to using asynchronous communication, chats (synchronous communication) were valued to support group decision-making online. Students appreciated validation of their online contributions from their peers and wanted clear expectations of what constituted successful tutorial participation from their tutors. Although online PBL can work effectively, tutors and students need to develop online literacy skills to smooth their transition to an online PBL environment.Save to LibraryDownloadby bob jones•  31  Obstetrics, Communication, Decision Making, Graduate EducationConnecting critical reflection and group development in online adult education classroomsThis qualitative multi-case study explored the space where critical reflection and group development met within the online environment for the adult learner.

However, the... moreThe effective use of electronically-mediated communication (EMC) is fundamental to digital literacy and, therefore, a high-demand competency in professional communities of practice, business, society, and online education. However, the use of EMC can be challenging in educational contexts; given that EMC tends to rely heavily on text-based formats, meaning and intent may be lost in translation from thought to posted message. Thus, online educators value techniques that have the potential to improve the quality and effectiveness of text-based communication. One such technique is the use of emoticons to represent emotional andpersonality nuances present in face-to-face communication. In this chapter, we present a review of the literature on emoticons used in support of online learning—with the goal of improving futurepractice and research of online teaching and learning—and then provide some specific instructional recommendations for online educators.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patrick Lowenthal and +4Joanna  DunlapCindy S YorkMichael AtkinsonJim Murtagh•  14  Emotion, Instructional Design, E-learning, Distance EducationAgile vs. Structured Distributed Software Development: A Case StudySave to LibraryDownloadby Carlo Alberto Furia•  11  Software Engineering, Economics, Project Management, Empirical Software EngineeringControlo do Oxigénio Dissolvido em Fermentadores para Minimização de Energia ConsumidaA strategy for adaptive control and energetic optimization of aerobic fermentors was implemented, with both air flow and agitation speed as manipulated variables.

This strategy is separable in its components: control, optimization, estimation. We optimized parameter’s estimation (from the usual KLa correlation) using sinusoidal excitation of air flow and agitation speed. We have implemented parameter’s estimation trough recursive least squares algorithm with forgetting factor. We carried separate essays on control, optimization and estimation algorithms. We carried our essays using an original computational simulation environment, with noise and delay generating facilities for data sampling and filtering. Our results show the convergence and robustness of the estimation algorithm used, improved with use of both forgetting factor and KLa dead-band facilities. Control algorithm used in our work compares favorably with PID using the integrated area criteria for deviation between oxygen molarity and critical molarity (set point). Optimization algorithm clearly reduces energetic consumption, respecting critical molarity. Integration of control, optimization and adaptive algorithms was implemented, but future work is needed for stability. Methods were defined and implemented for stability improvement. We have implemented data acquisition and computer manipulation of air flow and agitation speed for actual fermentors.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carlos Araújo  Queiroz•  1425  Information Systems, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Communication EngineeringDesign Opportunities and Challenges in Indian Urban Slums - Community Communication and Mobile Phones"The aim of this master’s thesis is to identify design challenges and opportunities for mobile based community communication services for marginalized communities belonging to Indian urban slums.

While the benefits of discussion are commonly accepted in face-to-face learning, engaging students in effective asynchronous discussion can often be 'hit or miss', due in part to the shift to interacting asynchronously. This hybrid mode of spoken-like/written-like communication demands skills which are rarely made explicit, often with the assumption that students (and lecturers) are proficient. The combined framework presented here enabled macro-and micro-understandings of discussion forums through an array of resources in the SFL model and the talk type descriptors to map linguistic features of knowledge constructing talk in an Australian postgraduate HE context. The notion of 'listening' (or attending to others) is proposed as a crucial condition for whether discussion progresses beyond simply 'posting'. Consequently, this article provides much needed insight into the murky space of asynchronous discussion forums.Save to LibraryDownloadby Janine Delahunty•  7  Discourse Analysis, Higher Education, Systemic Functional Linguistics, Learning And Teaching In Higher EducationNextLast »Related TopicsSocial PresenceFollowFollowingAsynchronous online forums in educationFollowFollowingDistance EducationFollowFollowingLecturers Attitude Towards the Use of Media Resources for Teaching and LearningFollowFollowingPreservice TeachersFollowFollowingOnline LearningFollowFollowingGroup CreativityFollowFollowingOnline CommunitiesFollowFollowingCognitive developmentFollowFollowingBadgesFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
