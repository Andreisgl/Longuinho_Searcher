Indian agriculture has seen a lot of changes in its structure. India, predominantly an agricultural economy, has healthy signs of transformation in agriculture and allied activities. India has seen agriculture as a precious tool of economic development as other sectors of production depend on it. Efficient backward and forward integration with agriculture has led to globally competitive production system in terms of cost and quality. Cooperatives seem to be well positioned to coordinate product differentiation at the farm level and to integrate forward into value added processing activities.. Indian agriculture can be balanced and made efficient through proper and better management practices.

El estudio se realizo en una region de tradicion migratoria de alta productividad agricola, donde se ha presentado la continuidad del fenomeno migratorio en tres o hasta cuatro generaciones de ejidatarios, quienes constituyeron los sujetos de estudio. La metodologia se baso en el enfoque cualitativo y cuantitativo, en los que se aplicaron encuestas y entrevistas a profundidad. Se concluye que entre las nuevas generaciones de ejidatarios la migracion favorecio mas la renta que la venta de tierras ejidales al tiempo que reconfiguro y contrapuso la apreciacion y la valoracion de la tierra; para los jovenes la tierra va perdiendo valor economico, historico y cultural.

Global environmental changes coupled with socio-economic changes are a major food security issue and challenge. The main findings show that all four key elements of food security, namely availability, stability, use and access are significantly affected by changes in the environment. The most vulnerable segment of the population is those whose living conditions and livelihoods are strictly dependent on climate change and their ability to adapt is the lowest due to household income. This category includes children and women, poor people, the elderly and all those who depend on agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing and other natural resources. Climate change and its impact on demographic patterns, urbanization, population movements, and changes in food consumption patterns are intensifying food system risks globally.Save to LibraryDownloadby andrea feher•  8  Climate Change, Food Systems, Agriculture, UrbanizationIn vitro Regeneration of Wedelia calendulacea Less. - A Valuable Endangered Medicinal PlantDirect plant regeneration from shoot tips and nodal explants of Wedelia calendulacea Less. was carried out in MS with different concentrations and combinations of BAP, Kn and NAA.

To this end, we examined definitions of seasonal and local food, the methodological approaches adopted to study the impact of seasonal consumption on sustainability, and sustainability dimensions investigated in journal articles. Highlighting what seasonal and local means, it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the consumption of these foods on sustainability. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Scopus and Clarivate’s Web of Science database in line with the recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

This study was carried out in rural kebeles in the Kebri Dahar district, and it focuses on livelihood diversification strategies and the factors that affect livelihood diversification. The collected types of data were from primary and secondary sources based on a qualitative and quantitative basis. Multistage sampling techniques were employed in selecting the representative households of 119 respondents. Furthermore, multinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze and achieve the objective. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 was used to analyze the collected data. The results revealed that 33.6%, 3.30%, 10.1%, and 52.9% of the respondents participated in the on-farm, off-farm, nonfarm, and combinations of livelihood activities, respectively.

Understanding the potential as well as constraints of these production systems in terms of nutrient supplies is thus a critical step to design interventions to improve nutrient intakes. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the usual total intakes of vitamin A, iron and zinc among rural children and (2) to investigate whether the intakes these nutrients are associated with differences in the dominant farming systems between spatial clusters. Using nationally representative intake data of 4,902 children 6–35 months of age, usual intake and the proportion of inadequate intakes of vitamin A, iron and zinc were calculated. A multi‐level model was used to examine the association between individual‐level and cluster‐level variables with the usual total dietary intakes of these nutrients.

This paper presents the application of a genetic programming scheme to obtain normalized curves of annual agricultural production for each state in Mexico as a function of the return period of drought events and, from them, compute the normalized value of the yearly production. This value, multiplied by the historic mean production of the state, gives the production expressed in Mexican pesos for a specifi ed return period. Two techniques were used for this data analysis, the fi rst one is general and considers each state separately; for the second technique the country was divided into six groups, depending on the value of the agricultural production variation coeffi cient.

However, intensive use of these synthetic chemicals significantly affects the environment and sustainable agriculture production. Moreover, direct or indirect exposure to these synthetic chemicals may cause acute or chronic toxicity in humans and animals. Due to their biodegradability, low toxicity, and being environmentally friendly, secondary metabolites derived from plant sources are being studied as a sustainable approach. Apiaceae family crops are a good source of bioactive phytochemicals. Many studies have found that Apiaceae extracts and essential oils possess various biocidal activities: antibacterial, antifungal, herbicidal, insecticidal or repellent, and larvicidal activities, among others. These various potent bioactivities make the Apiaceae an excellent alternative source for synthetic chemicals.

The study area was selected because it experiences dry spells on a regular basis. The major contribution of this study is the construction of the Drought Resilience Index (DRI), which was used as a measure of drought resilience, and its use to determine the effect of resilience on the welfare of the farming families. Realising that smallholder farmers are not passive but active in responding to events that threaten their livelihoods, the study was aimed at identifying how factors such as household assets, social capital, size of land held by the farming household, among other factors help the farmers to absorb effects resulting from the effects of prolonged dry spells and droughts.

Conservation agriculture (CA) is perceived as an approach that can help arrest or reverse the processes of soil degradation, improve soil fertility, pest management, and promote water conservation. However, results on the role of CA in pest management are contradictory. They show spatial and temporal variations due to the agroecosystem’s complex interactions among biotic and abiotic components. This study employed the approach of the component omission to investigate the probable effects of crop residue management on insect pest populations in a maize-based cropping system. Field experiments were carried out at ongoing CA trials at the University of Fort Hare farm (UFH) (32o 47′ S and 27o 50′ E) and Pandulwazi High School (32o 39′ S and 26o 55′ E).
