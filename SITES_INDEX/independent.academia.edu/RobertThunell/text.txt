While there are well-documented millennial scale Δ14C changes during the most recent deglaciation, most marine records lack the resolution needed to identify more rapid ventilation events. Furthermore, potential age model problems with marine Δ14C records may obscure our understanding of the phase relationship between inter-ocean ventilation changes. Here we reconstruct changes in deep water and thermocline radiocarbon content over the last deglaciation in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) using benthic and planktonic foraminiferal 14C. Our records demonstrate that ventilation of EEP thermocline and deep waters occurred synchronously during the last deglaciation. In addition, both gradual and rapid deglacial radiocarbon changes in these Pacific records are coeval with changes in the Atlantic records. This in-phase behaviour suggests that the Southern Ocean overturning was the dominant driver of changes in the Atlantic and Pacific ventilation during deglaciation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Planktonic foraminiferal area density as a proxy for carbonate ion concentration: A calibration study using the Cariaco Basin Ocean Time Seriesby Robert Thunell, Michael Henehan, and Yrene AstorPaleoceanography,  Jun 2013Biweekly sediment trap samples and concurrent hydrographic measurements collected between March 2... more Biweekly sediment trap samples and concurrent hydrographic measurements collected between March 2005 and October 2008 from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela are used to assess the relationship between [CO32-] and the area densities (ρA) of two species of planktonic foraminifera (Globigerinoides ruber (pink) and Globigerinoides sacculifer). Calcification temperatures were calculated for each sample using species-appropriate oxygen isotope (δ18O) temperature equations that were then compared to monthly temperature profiles taken at the study site in order to determine calcification depth. Ambient [CO32-] was determined for these calcification depths using alkalinity, pH, temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentration measurements taken during monthly hydrographic cruises. ρA, which is representative of calcification efficiency, is determined by dividing individual foraminiferal shell weights (± 0.43 µg) by their associated silhouette areas and taking the sample average. The results of this study show a strong correlation between ρA and ambient [CO32-] for both G. ruber and G. sacculifer (R2 = 0.89 and 0.86 respectively), confirming that [CO32-] has a pronounced effect on the calcification of these species. Though the ρA for both species reveal a highly significant (p < 0.001) relationship with ambient [CO32-], linear regression reveals that the extent to which [CO32-] influences foraminiferal calcification is species-specific. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that other environmental parameters (temperature and [PO43-]) do not confound the use of G. ruber and G. sacculifer ρA as a predictor for [CO32-]. This study suggests that G. ruber and G. sacculifer ρA can be used as reliable proxies for past surface ocean [CO32-].Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The influence of rapid, millennial scale climate change on nitrogen isotope dynamics of the Cariaco Basin during marine isotope stage 3by Eric Tappa and Robert ThunellUnderstanding changes to the marine nitrogen cycle on millennial and shorter time scales can help... more Understanding changes to the marine nitrogen cycle on millennial and shorter time scales can help determine the influence of rapid climate change on the fixed N pool and its sources and sinks. Rapid changes in denitrification have been observed in the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) and Arabian Sea; however, millennial scale δ 15 N records in regions influenced by N 2 fixation are sparse. We present a sedimentary δ 15 N record from the Cariaco Basin during marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 (~35–55 ka). The δ 15 N record displays a pattern of millennial scale variability that tracks the Greenland ice core Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, with higher values observed during interstadial periods, lower values during stadial periods, and abrupt transitions in between. Conditions during interstadials are similar to those at present in the Cariaco Basin, with the sedimentary δ 15 N signal reflecting a combination of local processes and an imported regional signal. If interpreted to reflect regional processes, the interstadial δ 15 N values (average ~5.1‰) support the argument that N 2 fixation did not increase in the tropical North Atlantic during the last glacial. The lower δ 15 N values during stadials, when lower sea level resulted in increased physical isolation of the basin, can be explained primarily by local processes. In spite of the importance of local processes, striking similarity is observed between the Cariaco record and millennial scale δ 15 N records from the ETNP and Arabian Sea. The apparent synchronicity of changes observed in all three regions suggests an atmospheric teleconnection between the three sites and high-latitude climate forcing during MIS 3.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The acceleration of oceanic denitrification during deglacial warmingby Robert Thunell, Ana Luiza Albuquerque, and Sergio Contrerasthe NICOPP working group members † Over much of the ocean's surface, productivity and growth are ... more the NICOPP working group members † Over much of the ocean's surface, productivity and growth are limited by a scarcity of bioavailable nitrogen. Sedimentary δ 15 N records spanning the last deglaciation suggest marked shifts in the nitrogen cycle during this time, but the quantification of these changes has been hindered by the complexity of nitrogen isotope cycling. Here we present a database of δ 15 N in sediments throughout the world's oceans, including 2,329 modern seafloor samples, and 76 timeseries spanning the past 30,000 years. We show that the δ 15 N values of modern seafloor sediments are consistent with values predicted by our knowledge of nitrogen cycling in the water column. Despite many local deglacial changes, the globally averaged δ 15 N values of sinking organic matter were similar during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene. Considering the global isotopic mass balance, we explain these observations with the following deglacial history of nitrogen inventory processes. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the nitrogen cycle was near steady state. During the deglaciation, denitrification in the pelagic water column accelerated. The flooding of continental shelves subsequently increased denitrification at the seafloor, and denitrification reached near steady-state conditions again in the Early Holocene. We use a recent parameterization of seafloor denitrification to estimate a 30–120% increase in benthic denitrification between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago. Based on the similarity of globally averaged δ 15 N values during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene, we infer that pelagic denitrification must have increased by a similar amount between the two steady states. N itrogen is a critical component of all living matter. But despite the ubiquity of dissolved N 2 gas in the ocean, its bioavailable forms (N bio , most of which is NO 3 −) are scarce in the sunlit surface layer, and its limited supply exerts the primary nutritional constraint on the marine ecosystem. Within the oceans, N 2 is fixed to N bio almost entirely by microorganisms near the ocean surface, and returned to N 2 by denitrification (including anammox) in suboxic zones of the water column and sediment, turning over the N bio inventory on a timescale of ∼3 kyr (ref. 1). The nitrogen cycle can alter the radiative properties of the atmosphere, through the generation of N 2 O (ref. 2) and by supporting the biological sequestration of CO 2 in the ocean 3,4. Humans are transforming the nitrogen cycle by approximately doubling the pre-industrial rate of terrestrial N 2 fixation and by supplying N bio to the ocean surface through rivers and the atmosphere 1. Meanwhile, anthropogenic warming is expected to increase the rate of denitrification, by expanding water column oxygen minimum zones 1,5 , and to modify the supply routes of nitrate by changing ocean circulation 6. However, the observational record of oceanic nitrate concentrations is much shorter than the residence time of N bio and is barely able to resolve decadal fluctuations in nitrate availability 7 , preventing the identification of climatic trends. In contrast, the geological record spans vast timescales and documents large climate shifts, such as the glacial/interglacial cycles. The nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ 15 N = ((15 N/ 14 N sample)/ (15 N/ 14 N ref) − 1) * 1,000, where 15 N/ 14 N ref refers to atmospheric N 2) of sinking organic matter is preserved in marine sediments 8 , providing a window on past changes in the nitrogen cycle. Over recent decades, an understanding of nitrogen isotope systematics has developed from field and laboratory studies, and nitrogen isotope records have been generated from seafloor sediments extending back thousands (or in some cases millions) of years. The sedimentary record of the last ice age cycle is particularly well † A full list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper sampled, and has revealed signs that pelagic denitrification was less active during cold periods 3,9. Meanwhile, the subaerial exposure of continental shelves during glacial sea-level low-stands would have eliminated the most active regions of benthic denitrification 10 , leading to a further reduction in the loss rate of N bio. Efforts to reconstruct past denitrification rates have, to date, proceeded piecemeal, focusing on small numbers of records. Here we present the first global analysis of available δ 15 N observations, starting with a synoptic picture of the present day seafloor, and proceeding to a quantitative analysis of the last deglaciation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A significant component of the subsurface waters (-• 100-400 m) that presently fill the Santa Barbara Basin is derived from the low-oxygen,j denitrifying zone in the ETNP, and the nitrate in these waters has a • SN value of 8-9%0. During the last glacial, the • SN values of Santa Barbara Basin sediments were typically 6-7%0, indicating decreased denitrification in the ETNP and a better oxygenated intermediate water mass in the Santa Barbara Basin at this time. This reduced denitrification during the last glacial would have increased the pool of fixed nitrogen and may have contributed to the higher productivity previously reported for various regions of the global ocean during this period. At the onset of deglaciation, sediment • SN values increase by more than 2%0, indicating increased denitrification in the ETNP. During Younger Dryas time, • SN values decreased by 3%0 and record a brief return to better ventilated conditions in the subsurface waters of the ETNP. This is followed by an increase in • SN to over 99/oo at-• 10,000 years ago, indicating intense denitrification at the beginning of the Holocene.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This model allows us to quantify the isotopic response of different oceanic nitrate pools to deglacial increases in water column and sedimentary denitrification, given a range of possible feedbacks between nitrate concentration and N 2 fixation/denitrification. This response is compared to the available paleoceanographic data, which suggest an early deglacial maximum in nitrate 15 N/ 14 N in suboxic zones and no significant glacial-to-late Holocene change in global ocean nitrate 15 N/ 14 N. Consistent with the work of Brandes and Devol [2002], we find that the steady state 15 N/ 14 N of oceanic nitrate is controlled primarily by the fraction of total denitrification that occurs in the water column. Therefore a deglacial peak in the ratio of water column-to-sediment denitrification, caused by either a strong feedback between water column denitrification and the N reservoir or by an increase in sediment denitrification due to sea level rise, can explain the observed deglacial 15 N/ 14 N maximum in sediments underlying water column denitrification zones. The total denitrification rate and the mean ocean nitrate concentration are also important determinants of steady state nitrate 15 N/ 14 N. For this reason, modeling a realistic deglacial 15 N/ 14 N maximum further requires that the combined negative feedbacks from N 2 fixation and denitrification are relatively strong, and N losses are relatively small. Our results suggest that the glacial oceanic N inventory was at most 30% greater than today's and probably less than 10% greater.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using Mg/Ca ratios from ostracodes and oxygen isotopes from benthic foraminifera as proxies for temperature and precipitation-driven estuarine hydrography, results show that warmest temperatures in CB reached 16–17 °C between 600 and 950 CE (Common Era), centuries before the classic European Medieval Warm Period (950–1100 CE) and peak warming in the Nordic Seas (1000–1400 CE). A series of centennial warm/cool cycles began about 1000 CE with temperature minima of ~ 8 to 9 °C about 1150, 1350, and 1650–1800 CE, and intervening warm periods (14–15 °C) centered at 1200, 1400, 1500 and 1600 CE. Precipitation variability in the eastern US included multiple dry intervals from 600 to 1200 CE, which contrasts with wet medieval conditions in the Caribbean. The eastern US experienced a wet LIA between 1650 and 1800 CE when the Caribbean was relatively dry. Comparison of the CB record with other records shows that the MCA and LIA were characterized by regionally asynchronous warming and complex spatial patterns of precipitation, possibly related to ocean–atmosphere processes.

Precipitation-driven river discharge and regional temperature variability are the primary influences on Chesapeake Bay salinity and water temperature, respectively. We first calibrated modern d 18 O water to salinity and applied this relationship to calculate trends in paleosalinity from the d 18 O foram , correcting for changes in water temperature estimated from ostracode Mg/Ca ratios. The results indicate a much drier early Holocene in which mean paleosalinity was $28 ppt in the northern bay, falling $25% to $20 ppt during the late Holocene. Early Holocene Mg/Ca-derived temperatures varied in a relatively narrow range of 13° to 16°C with a mean temperature of 14.2°C and excursions above 16°C; the late Holocene was on average cooler (mean temperature of 12.8°C). In addition to the large contrast between early and late Holocene regional climate conditions, multidecadal (20–40 years) salinity and temperature variability is an inherent part of the region's climate during both the early and late Holocene, including the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age. These patterns are similar to those observed during the twentieth century caused by NAO-related processes. Comparison of the midlatitude Chesapeake Bay salinity record with tropical climate records of Intertropical Convergence Zone fluctuations inferred from the Cariaco Basin titanium record suggests an anticorrelation between precipitation in the two regions at both millennial and centennial timescales.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Such processes condition patterns of their de-position and burial within marine sediments. Our understanding of these processes can be used to hindcast environmental conditions in the past from the sedimentary record. Here we report the major, minor and trace element compositions of a small subset of samples of sinking material collected at four depths (225, 410, 810, 1200 m) in the Cariaco Basin (10.5° N, 64.67° W), which is anoxic below ~ 275 m depth. We compare these data with the composition of the most recent basin floor sediment at the same location. The sediment trap samples examined represent material collected during both a high-and a low-productivity season, during a short-period flood event in coastal Venezuela, and immediately following an earthquake that induced a gravity flow. Our results show that the lithogenous composition of all four groups of trap samples and the basin floor sediment is uniform. This indicates that the source of siliciclastic detritus is largely from the local rivers draining the coastal region to the south of the Cariaco station. Enrichments of Ba relative to a model lithogenous background are found in the opal-rich high productivity samples from all depths; enrichments of Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, directly associated with the flux of phytoplankton organic matter from the photic zone, are found not only in the high productivity samples, but also in the low productivity samples that have higher CaCO 3 contents and lower organic matter and opal contents. In addition, modest particle and sediment enrichments of some redox-sensitive trace elements that are known to be removed from solution and sequestered in suboxic and anoxic sediments, namely Cr, V and Re are observed. However, barely detectable enrichments of U and Mo are present in all trap samples. In contrast with the trap sample compositions, the modern laminated basin-floor sediment exhibits significantly higher contents of Re, Mo and U than a solely lithogenous contribution, confirming studies that have found greater sub-sea floor fixation of these elements. Finally, the high settling flux of Ba observed in the high productivity trap samples is not preserved in the bottom sediment.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Mg/Ca measured on the planktic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides from a Cariaco Basin sediment core strongly correlate with spring (March–May) instrumental SSTs between A.D. 1870 and 1990. A Mg/Ca SST equation is derived and a paleo-SST record is presented spanning the last 8 centuries, an interval that includes the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The long-term record displays a surprising amount of variability. The temperature swings are not necessarily related to local upwelling variability but instead represent wider conditions in the Caribbean and western tropical Atlantic. The Mg/Ca SST record also captures the decadal and multidecadal variability observed in records of global land and sea surface temperature anomalies and Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane frequency over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A divergence between the SST proxy record and Atlantic storm frequency around 1970 appears to reflect a fundamental change in Atlantic hurricane behavior noted in historical data. On average, twentieth-century temperatures are not the warmest in the entire record, but they do show the largest increase in magnitude and fastest rate of SST change over the last 800 a.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A strong, broad spatial pattern of correlation exists between foraminiferal d 18 O and SSTs over the period of instrumental overlap, but the correlations weaken as they are extended back in time and instrumental SST records become discontinuous. A long-term trend in the Globigerinoides ruber d 18 O record can be explained by two different but equally plausible scenarios. First, the increase in d 18 O may indicate that tropical summer-fall SSTs have cooled by as much as 2°C over the last 2000 years, possibly as a result of a long-term increase in upwelling intensity. Alternately, comparisons to other studies of ITCZ and regional evaporation/precipitation variability suggest that much of the d 18 O record is influenced by decadal-to centennial-scale variations in the mean annual position of the ITCZ and associated rainfall patterns. Similarities between the G. bulloides d 18 O record and the 11-year sunspot cycle support prior studies that suggest solar variability plays a role in influencing the hydrologic balance of the circum-Caribbean.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Planktonic foraminifera census counts were performed on biweekly sediment-trap samples collected over the interval spanning late summer 1995 through early spring 1998, a period that captured the transition from ''normal'' conditions in 1996 to full El Niñ o conditions during early 1997 through early 1998. Intra-annual variations in the foraminifera assemblage reflect changes in seasonal climate variability, significant differences occurring in both foraminiferal relative abundance and flux values between non–El Niñ o and El Niñ o years. Warmer waters in the basin during late 1997 were reflected by a significantly increased presence of warmer-water species generally absent under normal conditions. Surprisingly, despite greatly reduced upwelling conditions, foraminiferal flux values during the spring 1997 up-welling season were more than four times greater than the year before. The contrast between normal and El Niñ o foraminifer populations has important implications for reconstructing the past history of both El Niñ o events and more general climate histories from the Santa Barbara Basin varved sediment record.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The major removal mechanism of P from marine systems is via the transformation of dissolved P into sinking particulate P pools. Although most particulate P is remineralized before it reaches the seafloor, little is known about the processes that control its breakdown into dissolved phases. In this study, the P composition of sinking particles captured by five sediment traps distributed through the oxic and anoxic water column of the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela is examined. Samples were collected from January 1996 to December 2004. Total particulate P (TPP), particulate inorganic P (PIP), and particulate organic P (POP) fluxes varied considerably over the course of the nine year study, yet there were no significant seasonal differences in the overall flux of POP. In contrast, PIP, which comprises a major portion of TPP (averaging 52 ± 19% across all depths) had fluxes that were 30% higher during non-upwelling periods. Poor relationships between PIP and biologically derived constituents, e.g. particulate organic carbon (POC), suggest that most of this material was derived from non-biological sources, namely terrestrial runoff from rivers. Rapid remineralization of POP occurred relative to POC and PIP in oxic surface waters, whereas PIP was quickly remineralized relative to POC and POP in subsurface anoxic waters. This suggests a significant and alternating source of particulate P to the dissolved P pool that depends on oxygen availability. Thus, particulate P release to the dissolved phase and the upwelling of dissolved P into the euphotic zone is a potentially important positive feedback mechanism for enhanced primary production and carbon sequestration in continental margin sediments regardless of oxic versus anoxic conditions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

During the Last Glacial Maximum, the nitrogen cycle was near steady state. During the deglaciation, denitrification in the pelagic water column accelerated. The flooding of continental shelves subsequently increased denitrification at the seafloor, and denitrification reached near steady-state conditions again in the Early Holocene. We use a recent parameterization of seafloor denitrification to estimate a 30–120% increase in benthic denitrification between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago. Based on the similarity of globally averaged δ 15 N values during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene, we infer that pelagic denitrification must have increased by a similar amount between the two steady states. N itrogen is a critical component of all living matter. But despite the ubiquity of dissolved N 2 gas in the ocean, its bioavailable forms (N bio , most of which is NO 3 −) are scarce in the sunlit surface layer, and its limited supply exerts the primary nutritional constraint on the marine ecosystem. Within the oceans, N 2 is fixed to N bio almost entirely by microorganisms near the ocean surface, and returned to N 2 by denitrification (including anammox) in suboxic zones of the water column and sediment, turning over the N bio inventory on a timescale of ∼3 kyr (ref. 1). The nitrogen cycle can alter the radiative properties of the atmosphere, through the generation of N 2 O (ref. 2) and by supporting the biological sequestration of CO 2 in the ocean 3,4. Humans are transforming the nitrogen cycle by approximately doubling the pre-industrial rate of terrestrial N 2 fixation and by supplying N bio to the ocean surface through rivers and the atmosphere 1. Meanwhile, anthropogenic warming is expected to increase the rate of denitrification, by expanding water column oxygen minimum zones 1,5 , and to modify the supply routes of nitrate by changing ocean circulation 6. However, the observational record of oceanic nitrate concentrations is much shorter than the residence time of N bio and is barely able to resolve decadal fluctuations in nitrate availability 7 , preventing the identification of climatic trends. In contrast, the geological record spans vast timescales and documents large climate shifts, such as the glacial/interglacial cycles. The nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ 15 N = ((15 N/ 14 N sample)/ (15 N/ 14 N ref) − 1) * 1,000, where 15 N/ 14 N ref refers to atmospheric N 2) of sinking organic matter is preserved in marine sediments 8 , providing a window on past changes in the nitrogen cycle. Over recent decades, an understanding of nitrogen isotope systematics has developed from field and laboratory studies, and nitrogen isotope records have been generated from seafloor sediments extending back thousands (or in some cases millions) of years. The sedimentary record of the last ice age cycle is particularly well † A full list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper sampled, and has revealed signs that pelagic denitrification was less active during cold periods 3,9. Meanwhile, the subaerial exposure of continental shelves during glacial sea-level low-stands would have eliminated the most active regions of benthic denitrification 10 , leading to a further reduction in the loss rate of N bio. Efforts to reconstruct past denitrification rates have, to date, proceeded piecemeal, focusing on small numbers of records. Here we present the first global analysis of available δ 15 N observations, starting with a synoptic picture of the present day seafloor, and proceeding to a quantitative analysis of the last deglaciation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Nitrogen isotope variations in Santa Barbara Basin sediments: Implications for denitrification in the eastern tropical North Pacific during the last 50,000 yearsNitrogen isotope variations preserved in Santa Barbara Basin sediments are used to evaluate chang... more Nitrogen isotope variations preserved in Santa Barbara Basin sediments are used to evaluate changes in denitrification in the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) during the last 50,000 years. A significant component of the subsurface waters (-• 100-400 m) that presently fill the Santa Barbara Basin is derived from the low-oxygen,j denitrifying zone in the ETNP, and the nitrate in these waters has a • SN value of 8-9%0. During the last glacial, the • SN values of Santa Barbara Basin sediments were typically 6-7%0, indicating decreased denitrification in the ETNP and a better oxygenated intermediate water mass in the Santa Barbara Basin at this time. This reduced denitrification during the last glacial would have increased the pool of fixed nitrogen and may have contributed to the higher productivity previously reported for various regions of the global ocean during this period. At the onset of deglaciation, sediment • SN values increase by more than 2%0, indicating increased denitrification in the ETNP. During Younger Dryas time, • SN values decreased by 3%0 and record a brief return to better ventilated conditions in the subsurface waters of the ETNP. This is followed by an increase in • SN to over 99/oo at-• 10,000 years ago, indicating intense denitrification at the beginning of the Holocene.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Isotopic constraints on glacial/interglacial changes in the oceanic nitrogen budget[1] We investigate the response of the 15 N/ 14 N of oceanic nitrate to glacial/interglacial chan... more [1] We investigate the response of the 15 N/ 14 N of oceanic nitrate to glacial/interglacial changes in the N budget, using a geochemical box model of the oceanic N cycle that includes N 2 fixation and denitrification in the sediments and suboxic water column. This model allows us to quantify the isotopic response of different oceanic nitrate pools to deglacial increases in water column and sedimentary denitrification, given a range of possible feedbacks between nitrate concentration and N 2 fixation/denitrification. This response is compared to the available paleoceanographic data, which suggest an early deglacial maximum in nitrate 15 N/ 14 N in suboxic zones and no significant glacial-to-late Holocene change in global ocean nitrate 15 N/ 14 N. Consistent with the work of Brandes and Devol [2002], we find that the steady state 15 N/ 14 N of oceanic nitrate is controlled primarily by the fraction of total denitrification that occurs in the water column. Therefore a deglacial peak in the ratio of water column-to-sediment denitrification, caused by either a strong feedback between water column denitrification and the N reservoir or by an increase in sediment denitrification due to sea level rise, can explain the observed deglacial 15 N/ 14 N maximum in sediments underlying water column denitrification zones. The total denitrification rate and the mean ocean nitrate concentration are also important determinants of steady state nitrate 15 N/ 14 N. For this reason, modeling a realistic deglacial 15 N/ 14 N maximum further requires that the combined negative feedbacks from N 2 fixation and denitrification are relatively strong, and N losses are relatively small. Our results suggest that the glacial oceanic N inventory was at most 30% greater than today's and probably less than 10% greater.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using Mg/Ca ratios from ostracodes and oxygen isotopes from benthic foraminifera as proxies for temperature and precipitation-driven estuarine hydrography, results show that warmest temperatures in CB reached 16–17 °C between 600 and 950 CE (Common Era), centuries before the classic European Medieval Warm Period (950–1100 CE) and peak warming in the Nordic Seas (1000–1400 CE). A series of centennial warm/cool cycles began about 1000 CE with temperature minima of ~ 8 to 9 °C about 1150, 1350, and 1650–1800 CE, and intervening warm periods (14–15 °C) centered at 1200, 1400, 1500 and 1600 CE. Precipitation variability in the eastern US included multiple dry intervals from 600 to 1200 CE, which contrasts with wet medieval conditions in the Caribbean. The eastern US experienced a wet LIA between 1650 and 1800 CE when the Caribbean was relatively dry. Comparison of the CB record with other records shows that the MCA and LIA were characterized by regionally asynchronous warming and complex spatial patterns of precipitation, possibly related to ocean–atmosphere processes.

Precipitation-driven river discharge and regional temperature variability are the primary influences on Chesapeake Bay salinity and water temperature, respectively. We first calibrated modern d 18 O water to salinity and applied this relationship to calculate trends in paleosalinity from the d 18 O foram , correcting for changes in water temperature estimated from ostracode Mg/Ca ratios. The results indicate a much drier early Holocene in which mean paleosalinity was $28 ppt in the northern bay, falling $25% to $20 ppt during the late Holocene. Early Holocene Mg/Ca-derived temperatures varied in a relatively narrow range of 13° to 16°C with a mean temperature of 14.2°C and excursions above 16°C; the late Holocene was on average cooler (mean temperature of 12.8°C). In addition to the large contrast between early and late Holocene regional climate conditions, multidecadal (20–40 years) salinity and temperature variability is an inherent part of the region's climate during both the early and late Holocene, including the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age. These patterns are similar to those observed during the twentieth century caused by NAO-related processes. Comparison of the midlatitude Chesapeake Bay salinity record with tropical climate records of Intertropical Convergence Zone fluctuations inferred from the Cariaco Basin titanium record suggests an anticorrelation between precipitation in the two regions at both millennial and centennial timescales.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Such processes condition patterns of their de-position and burial within marine sediments. Our understanding of these processes can be used to hindcast environmental conditions in the past from the sedimentary record. Here we report the major, minor and trace element compositions of a small subset of samples of sinking material collected at four depths (225, 410, 810, 1200 m) in the Cariaco Basin (10.5° N, 64.67° W), which is anoxic below ~ 275 m depth. We compare these data with the composition of the most recent basin floor sediment at the same location. The sediment trap samples examined represent material collected during both a high-and a low-productivity season, during a short-period flood event in coastal Venezuela, and immediately following an earthquake that induced a gravity flow. Our results show that the lithogenous composition of all four groups of trap samples and the basin floor sediment is uniform. This indicates that the source of siliciclastic detritus is largely from the local rivers draining the coastal region to the south of the Cariaco station. Enrichments of Ba relative to a model lithogenous background are found in the opal-rich high productivity samples from all depths; enrichments of Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, directly associated with the flux of phytoplankton organic matter from the photic zone, are found not only in the high productivity samples, but also in the low productivity samples that have higher CaCO 3 contents and lower organic matter and opal contents. In addition, modest particle and sediment enrichments of some redox-sensitive trace elements that are known to be removed from solution and sequestered in suboxic and anoxic sediments, namely Cr, V and Re are observed. However, barely detectable enrichments of U and Mo are present in all trap samples. In contrast with the trap sample compositions, the modern laminated basin-floor sediment exhibits significantly higher contents of Re, Mo and U than a solely lithogenous contribution, confirming studies that have found greater sub-sea floor fixation of these elements. Finally, the high settling flux of Ba observed in the high productivity trap samples is not preserved in the bottom sediment.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Mg/Ca measured on the planktic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides from a Cariaco Basin sediment core strongly correlate with spring (March–May) instrumental SSTs between A.D. 1870 and 1990. A Mg/Ca SST equation is derived and a paleo-SST record is presented spanning the last 8 centuries, an interval that includes the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The long-term record displays a surprising amount of variability. The temperature swings are not necessarily related to local upwelling variability but instead represent wider conditions in the Caribbean and western tropical Atlantic. The Mg/Ca SST record also captures the decadal and multidecadal variability observed in records of global land and sea surface temperature anomalies and Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane frequency over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A divergence between the SST proxy record and Atlantic storm frequency around 1970 appears to reflect a fundamental change in Atlantic hurricane behavior noted in historical data. On average, twentieth-century temperatures are not the warmest in the entire record, but they do show the largest increase in magnitude and fastest rate of SST change over the last 800 a.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A 2000-year record of Caribbean and tropical North Atlantic hydrographic variabilityby Eric Tappa and Robert Thunell[1] Here we present near-annually resolved oxygen isotope records from two species of planktic fo... more [1] Here we present near-annually resolved oxygen isotope records from two species of planktic foraminifera from the Cariaco Basin that reflect sea surface temperature (SST) and Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) precipitation-related salinity variations over the Caribbean and tropical North Atlantic spanning the last 2000 years. A strong, broad spatial pattern of correlation exists between foraminiferal d 18 O and SSTs over the period of instrumental overlap, but the correlations weaken as they are extended back in time and instrumental SST records become discontinuous. A long-term trend in the Globigerinoides ruber d 18 O record can be explained by two different but equally plausible scenarios. First, the increase in d 18 O may indicate that tropical summer-fall SSTs have cooled by as much as 2°C over the last 2000 years, possibly as a result of a long-term increase in upwelling intensity. Alternately, comparisons to other studies of ITCZ and regional evaporation/precipitation variability suggest that much of the d 18 O record is influenced by decadal-to centennial-scale variations in the mean annual position of the ITCZ and associated rainfall patterns. Similarities between the G. bulloides d 18 O record and the 11-year sunspot cycle support prior studies that suggest solar variability plays a role in influencing the hydrologic balance of the circum-Caribbean.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Planktonic foraminifera census counts were performed on biweekly sediment-trap samples collected over the interval spanning late summer 1995 through early spring 1998, a period that captured the transition from ''normal'' conditions in 1996 to full El Niñ o conditions during early 1997 through early 1998. Intra-annual variations in the foraminifera assemblage reflect changes in seasonal climate variability, significant differences occurring in both foraminiferal relative abundance and flux values between non–El Niñ o and El Niñ o years. Warmer waters in the basin during late 1997 were reflected by a significantly increased presence of warmer-water species generally absent under normal conditions. Surprisingly, despite greatly reduced upwelling conditions, foraminiferal flux values during the spring 1997 up-welling season were more than four times greater than the year before. The contrast between normal and El Niñ o foraminifer populations has important implications for reconstructing the past history of both El Niñ o events and more general climate histories from the Santa Barbara Basin varved sediment record.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The major removal mechanism of P from marine systems is via the transformation of dissolved P into sinking particulate P pools. Although most particulate P is remineralized before it reaches the seafloor, little is known about the processes that control its breakdown into dissolved phases. In this study, the P composition of sinking particles captured by five sediment traps distributed through the oxic and anoxic water column of the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela is examined. Samples were collected from January 1996 to December 2004. Total particulate P (TPP), particulate inorganic P (PIP), and particulate organic P (POP) fluxes varied considerably over the course of the nine year study, yet there were no significant seasonal differences in the overall flux of POP. In contrast, PIP, which comprises a major portion of TPP (averaging 52 ± 19% across all depths) had fluxes that were 30% higher during non-upwelling periods. Poor relationships between PIP and biologically derived constituents, e.g. particulate organic carbon (POC), suggest that most of this material was derived from non-biological sources, namely terrestrial runoff from rivers. Rapid remineralization of POP occurred relative to POC and PIP in oxic surface waters, whereas PIP was quickly remineralized relative to POC and POP in subsurface anoxic waters. This suggests a significant and alternating source of particulate P to the dissolved P pool that depends on oxygen availability. Thus, particulate P release to the dissolved phase and the upwelling of dissolved P into the euphotic zone is a potentially important positive feedback mechanism for enhanced primary production and carbon sequestration in continental margin sediments regardless of oxic versus anoxic conditions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
