Pp. 153-175 ABSTRACT: In this essay, the Universal Basic Income (UBI) is analyzed as a feasible measure of social policy to fight the strains of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus pandemic efficiently in Mexico. The text develops its arguments in four sections. The first one presents the multilateral emergency situation originated by the COVID-19, which pushes for appropriate and contextualized measures. The second one is a reflection on the characteristics, benefits and obstacles of an UBI as a tool for strengthening social policy. The third one studies the possibility of implementing the UBI in Mexico, presenting its advantages, challenges and suggesting schemes for its execution. The essay closes with a final reflection in order to support the implementation an UBI in Mexico.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLocally Universal : Universal Basic Income Policies in the Post-Pandemic World-Order2020 • Julio Lucchesi MoraesRampant disparities within the capital/labor share, increased pressure on climatically vulnerable communities and mass international migration due to economic hardship or violence. All that without mentioning the ever-haunting specter of automation-induced unemployment and, finally, the outbreak of a world-reaching pandemic: these are some of the ongoing cataclysmic trends that are making an everincreasing number of academics, policymakers and multilateral organizations revisit the adoption of Universal Basic Income (UBI) models. The idea of furnishing guaranteed, unconditional and universal basic income for people within an assigned geographical locality – and potentially the entire globe – has ebbed and flown from the pages of authors of all walks of the political spectrum for over two centuries. It appears, though, that such an idea is regaining momentum at this point in history, a somewhat unexpected moment, given the worldwide rise of nationalistic and illiberalism worldviews. ...Download Free PDFView PDFGJ #2020, 2:  Locally Universal: Universal Basic Income Policies in the Post-Pandemic World-Order, by Julio Lucchesi Moraes and Carlos FreireGlocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and InnovationDownload Free PDFView PDFCIPPECBlofield Filgueira 2020 COVID 19 and social protection in Latin America2020 • merike blofieldTo sustain the epidemiological strategy of social distancing, social assistance must reach fast and far in the Latin American social structure. With the immediate and still-to-come economic effects, close to half the population in the region is facing an impending humanitarian crisis. While the population most vulnerable to COVID from a medical point of view are the elderly, socially a large part of the most vulnerable population are children and women (especially young families with children). In part A, we outline the reach of existing social protection systems in the region. Almost half of the economically active population gains its living in the informal sector, and much of this employment is concentrated in the sectors that are coming to a complete halt with the pandemic. In more than two-thirds of Latin American countries, more than two-thirds of children on average live in households without access to social security. Given this, the extension of non-contributory cash transfers to households with children in the last 15 years has become a life-line for low-income families, reaching about 20% of the population in the region by 2016. Moreover, almost all Latin American households have gained access to electricity, drinking water and cell phones over the last fifteen years and now depend on these services. This existing infrastructure can now be mobilized to confront the social crisis, to put in place basic income guarantees and to ensure continued access to basic utilities. In part B, we outline the social assistance efforts of nine Latin American countries over the past two weeks, in response to COVID19. Governments are quickly moving to provide emergency assistance; however, the amount and coverage promises to date are not generous and broad enough. In part C, we estimate the fiscal cost of guaranteeing each child and elderly person in a vulnerable household an income up to the poverty line for three months (an estimate of the duration of the COVID crisis), in eighteen Latin American countries. In the most developed countries, the effort represents less than 0.5% of GDP; only in two countries does it cost more than 2% of GDP. We urge governments to provide a broad emergency social protection floor.Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal perspectives on universal basic incomeMehdi ShivaDownload Free PDFView PDFUniversity of Belgrade Faculty of Political ScienceUniversal Basic Income as an Instrument of Social Policy - Master's Thesis Abstract2020 • Miroslav BudimirThe main objective of the research is the analysis of the universal basic income as an instrument of social policy, a basis of real freedom for all, and a basic human right. The analysis of universal basic income proposals is conducted on the basis of several criteria: (1) interrelationship between universal basic income and the other two models of social protection: public assistance and social insurance; (2) the effects of the UBI on (un)employment and work incentives; (3) possible legitimate ways of financing the universal basic income: (a) through fiscal public revenues like taxes and other charges; (b) through non-fiscal public revenues from public capital funds; (4) the question of the universality of basic income: is it an universal human right of every human being or a right limited to citizens of a country, federal state or province. Unlike two other models of social protection, public assistance and social insurance, universal basic income is not based on charity toward the poor (like public assistance) where “the hand that gives is always above the hand that receives”, or state-supported solidarity among employees and their employers (like social insurance) which is selective and limited to those who are already privileged enough to be employed, but on a human right to dignified life, work, health, well-being and free development of every person, regardless of their work or property status. However, a reform that introduces an universal basic income could either increase or decrease social security and freedom of people in the worst social position. If the introduction of universal basic income implies abolishment of the existing social benefits and services, for the most deprived persons of the community it would be a worse scheme than the existing one. Only in sensible combination with the other universal and conditional components of the social protection system, universal basic income can increase the income and property, powers and prerogatives, and social bases of self-esteem of the people in the worst social position. In its constructive function, universal basic income is a floor beneath the overall income distribution that includes wages and conditional social benefits and services as well as universal health care and universally accessible education. Universal basic income would allow all people to move more freely between more or less paid work, lifelong education and training, and voluntary activities in the community, because they could at any time decide to quit job or shorten working hours, without losing the right to a basic income. The combination of three unconditionalities of the universal basic income – an individual basis, no means-test or work requirement – would eliminate the unemployment trap or exclusion of the poor and marginalized part of the population from working and social life, and the employment trap or exploitation and burnout of people in work. The Finnish national UBI experiment (2017–2018) proved that basic income increases work motivation and overall life satisfaction: the experimental group of unemployed people who received a basic income during the experiment were mentally healthier, felt more self-confident, had less stress and more autonomy in life, did more meaningful work, and had more trust in other people and social institutions compared with the control group. It is a proof that universal basic income is not an instrument of a passive welfare state that would be introduced so that some people would choose to do nothing for the rest of their lives, but an instrument of an active welfare state by which people can freely choose a meaningful way to best contribute to society. American economist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon estimated that approximately 90 per cent of the salary of an employee in the formal economy is not earned by personal effort, but is a gift from accumulated social wealth to which current employees have contributed nothing. Thus, the introduction of an universal basic income is only a way to distribute a part of that natural, social, cultural and technological heritage of humanity among all members of society. Therefore, a fairly legitimate way of financing the universal basic income is to ensure the property right of every person over an equal part of social wealth that is created due to natural resources and scientific, technological, organizational and cultural achievements of previous generations of mankind. However, in the absence of such public capital fund, the universal basic income would have to be financed by fiscal public revenues. A compromise solution would be a sensible combination of fiscal and non-fiscal public revenues for the financing of basic income. Macro-regional or world basic income is necessary for a fairer distribution of the inherited social wealth of humanity, which is now distributed in extremely unequal proportions between and within states. World or macro-regional basic income is one of the necessary social and economic preconditions for the safe opening of borders between countries at the European and global level. The wider the supranational level at which the universal basic income is introduced, the weaker would be the motivation for selective opportunistic economic migrations which is now significantly boosted by national transfer programs in the affluent countries of the Global North. Moral law is obviously on the side of universal basic income. Just as slavery, racial and gender discrimination have been finally recognized as the intolerable infringements of the basic human rights, so the non-recognition of a right to basic means of subsistence or the conditioning of that right by economic extortion and coercion based on illegitimate ownership and control over the labor and social wealth will finally be recognized as an unbearable violation of a right to dignified life and freedom of every individual and family regardless of their work or property status. Humanity is unstoppably moving towards the realization of that natural right. Universal basic income would only partially restore or compensate people for the enormous social wealth that some individuals and groups illegitimately appropriated for themselves as exclusive private property, while the state confirmed and protected that illegitimate private appropriation with its coercive apparatus and legislation. It is impossible to restore the dignity and freedom of the individual, family and work without reclaiming the natural right to basic means of subsistence. Key words: universal basic income, social policy, social protection, social security, social insurance, public assistance, social model, social state, work incentives, means test, social wealth.Download Free PDFView PDFCEPAL ReviewCOVID-19 and social protection of poor and vulnerable groups in Latin America: A conceptual framework2021 • Mariano TommasiDownload Free PDFView PDFCambridge Quarterly of Healthcare EthicsEmergency Basic Income during the Pandemic2021 • Jurgen De WispelaereThis paper focuses on an emergency basic income (EBI) as a tool for avoiding financial insecurity during the time of pandemic. The authors argue that paying each resident a monthly cash amount for the duration of the crisis would serve to protect them from the economic fallout.They suggest three reasons why the EBI proposal is particularly well-suited to play an important role in a comprehensive public health response to COVID-19: it offers an immediate and agile response; it prioritizes the most vulnerable in the affected population; and it promotes a solidaristic response to the pandemic crisis. To go beyond the need to shut down and restart an EBI assistance scheme each time a pandemic hits, the authors propose considering turning the program into a permanent feature.Download Free PDFView PDFThe need for a federal Basic Income feature within any coherent post-COVID-19 economic recovery plan2021 • Evelyn ForgetCOVID-19 has shone a harsh light on the extent of poverty in Canada.

The methodology is based on a probit model to identify individuals at risk of employment loss, whose earnings are set to zero in ENIGH 2018 to match changes in employment and earnings observed in between December 2019 and the May 2020 according to ENOE and ETOE surveys, respectively. MEXMOD, Mexico’s microsimulation model, is used to simulate tax-benefit policies based on the pre-COVID and COVID-scenarios. The results show that there was a loss of 12.1 million jobs. Poverty reached 60.16% and extreme poverty reached 29.73%; inequality grew 8.2%. It is recommended to strengthen social policy with extra funding (taxing the rich) to achieve greater redistribution. The limitation is that income distribution is held constant as we do not have ENIGH 2020.

Our purpose in this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about the economic impact of the pandemic in Mexico and to evaluate social policy options to mitigate its effects. We do so based on a multisectoral-multiplier model and the most recent Social Accounting Matrix for Mexico, with which we estimate the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 as well the likely effects of two alternatives for mitigating them: an unconditional cash transfer scheme for households living in poverty, and the establishment of an unemployment insurance program for workers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. We find that the first alternative alleviates more value added and loss of income, and thus has a greater effect in reducing inequality and the incidence of poverty.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
