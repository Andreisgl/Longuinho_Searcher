Strategies to help conserve local food wisdom and increase its value could facilitate a reduction in the burden of all forms of malnutrition and achieve global goals. Our objectives were to: (1) investigate the variety of local foods and food preparation methods in Loei province, Thailand; (2) investigate ways of increasing the nutritional, social, and economic value of local food in this province; and (3) construct a local food database to catalogue and conserve the local food wisdom. Nine out of fourteen districts in Loei province were purposively selected. All were designated key sustainable tourist destinations and represented a range of terrains. There were 423 interview participants, representing all villages in one subdistrict of each of the nine selected districts. We also conducted nine focus group discussions with a total of 90 participants.

This research aimed to determine which education delivery medium, Facebook or leaflet, was most successful at increasing knowledge of folate and neural tube defects (NTD) in female university students. This quasi-experimental study (pre-test post-test comparison group design) involved three groups: Facebook folate and NTD education group (FBed) (n=53), leaflet folate and NTD education group (LFed) (n=49) and comparison group (n=47). Socio-demographic information was collected via a questionnaire at pre-test, and participants completed a folate and NTD knowledge quiz at pre-test and post-test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine within-group pre-test post-test differences in folate and NTD knowledge score. Between-group differences in knowledge were determined using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test.

In Phase 1, the questionnaire was developed based on literature review and tested for content validity. Older residents were interviewed using this questionnaire to identify potential PEM risk factors. A 24-h recall was used to collect dietary data, and body composition and serum albumin were measured. In Phase 2, practicality of new PEM screening tool was evaluated by intended users. Data were analysed by χ2 test, Fisher’s exact test, t-test, Mann–Whitney U test and multiple logistic regression. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to estimate the best fit model.Setting:Four public residential homes in central region, Thailand.Participants:249 older residents residing in public reside...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This was a comparative cross-sectional study of adolescents (n 121 OW/OB and n 102 NW) aged 12-14 years, attending a secondary school in Nonthaburi province, Thailand. Socio-demographic data were obtained from participants&#39; parents using a questionnaire. Participants recorded their intakes for 3 non-consecutive days, using a prospective food record. Compared with NW adolescents, OW/OB adolescents consumed more total protein and animal protein after adjustment for energy intake (both p = 0.047). OW/OB adolescents whose mothers were less educated consumed more total iron and available iron after adjustment for energy intake, compared with their OW/OB peers whose mothers were more educated (p = 0.045 and p = 0.040).

Although... more The connection between iron and excessive adiposity has received much research interest. Although children and adolescents have unique developmental phases and nutritional demands, to date, reviews of iron in the overweight (OW) and obese (OB) have combined studies of children and adults or have focussed on adults. The aim of this review was to critically evaluate studies of the relationship between iron and OW and obesity in children and adolescents, with emphasis on iron status, oral iron response, dietary intake and systemic inflammatory markers. A PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant articles published up to December 2015. Combinations of the following keywords were used: iron, OW, OB, children, adolescents, diet, hepcidin, inflammation, fortification, supplementation, weight loss, trace elements, obesity, iron deficiency (ID), minerals. A higher prevalence of ID, or risk of ID, among OW and OB children and adolescents has been consistently observed. Chronic inflammation caused by excessive adiposity offers a plausible explanation for this finding, rather than dietary factors. However, future studies must employ screening for the presence of both acute and chronic infections and inflammatory conditions and report other factors such as pubertal status. Intervention studies, although few, indicate that OW and OB children and adolescents have reduced response to oral iron. Further trials are needed to explore the connection between body fat mass, inflammatory proteins and iron absorption, together with the effect of weight loss on iron status in iron-deficient OW and OB children and adolescents.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Iron requirements based upon iron absorption tests are poorly predicted by haematological indices in patients with inactive inflammatory bowel diseaseBritish Journal of Nutrition,  2011Fe deficiency and Fe-deficiency anaemia are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I... more Fe deficiency and Fe-deficiency anaemia are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Traditional clinical markers of Fe status can be skewed in the presence of inflammation, meaning that a patient&#39;s Fe status can be misinterpreted. Additionally, Fe absorption is known to be down-regulated in patients with active IBD. However, whether this is the case for quiescent or mildly active disease has not been formally assessed. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between Fe absorption, Fe requirements and standard haematological indices in IBD patients without active disease. A group of twenty-nine patients with quiescent or mildly active IBD and twenty-eight control subjects undertook an Fe absorption test that measured sequential rises in serum Fe over 4 h following ingestion of 200 mg ferrous sulphate. At baseline, serum Fe, transferrin saturation, non-transferrin-bound Fe (NTBI), ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor were all measured.

The present study set out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32 % CD patientsv. 42 % controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by 2·3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0·26 mg/MJ (1·1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with controls (bothP&lt;0·001).

Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer&#39;s patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn&#39;s disease (CD). However, whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general practice-based controls (ninety-one per group) completed 7d food diaries. Intake data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controls. All foods, pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups.
