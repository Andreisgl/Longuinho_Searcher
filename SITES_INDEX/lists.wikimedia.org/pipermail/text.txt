Dear Wikimedians,
On the recommendation of the Wikimania 2015 selection Jury Committee, we have accepted the
proposal from Mexico DF to host. The proposal will be further vetted by the WMF staff in
the coming month, after which time we hope to confirm the award. Please join us in
congratulating Wikimedia Mexico!
We would also like to thank the teams from Cape Town and Monastir as well for all their
effort in putting together excellent proposals for our consideration. As a volunteer-led
movement, it is hugely encouraging to have so many who want to support Wikimania. The
bidding process requires a substantial time investment, and we are most grateful for every
team’s hard work.
For those of you who are considering hosting in future years, we expect to issue the
Request for Proposals  for 2016 by September this year.
Sincerely,
Ellie Young, WMF Conference Coordinator
On behalf of the Wikimania Steering Committee
