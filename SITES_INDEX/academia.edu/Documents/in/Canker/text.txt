However, phytosanitary problems are beginning to threaten the production of this timber species. An example is teak canker, caused by the fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae (Lt), which has only recently been reported in Brazil, and for which, therefore, there are no recommended control methods. Thus, this study evaluated the control of this pathogen, investigating the potential of the biocontrol agents (BCAs) Trichoderma spp., Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp., initially through in vitro assays and, subsequently, with in vivo tests. According to the in vitro assay results, the Trichoderma isolates CEN162 and CEN1153 and the strain of Bacillus sp. (UnB1366) were the treatments that stood out, as they were able to completely inhibit mycelial growth of some isolates of Lt. When these isolates were tested in a pr...Save to LibraryDownloadby Sueli C M Mello and +1Jose Getulio da Silva Filho•  5  Horticulture, Biology, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Forestry SciencesA multi-locus phylogenetic evaluation of Diaporthe (Phomopsis)Save to LibraryDownloadby Eric McKenzie•  14  Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology, Mycology, Molecular SystematicsDevelopment of a viability digital PCR protocol for the selective detection and quantification of live Erwinia amylovora cells in cankersFire blight is a devastating disease of apple and pear caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora.

One of its main symptoms is canker formation on perennial tissues which may lead to the death of limbs and/or the entire tree. E. amylovora overwinters in cankers which play an important role in initiating fire blight epidemics. However, knowledge of pathogen biology in cankers is scarce, in part due to limitations of classical microbiology methods and the inability of most molecular techniques to distinguish live from dead cells. In this work, a viability digital PCR (v-dPCR) protocol using propidium monoazide (PMA) was developed, allowing for the first time the selective detection and absolute quantification of E. amylovora live cells in apple and pear cankers collected in two time periods. Some key factors affecting the v-dPCR performance were the maceration buffer composition, the target DNA amplicon length, the thermal cycle number and the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate or PMA enhancer for Gram-negative bacteria to improve the effect of PMA. In the future, this methodology could shed light on E. amylovora population dynamics in cankers and provide clues on the effect of management practices, host cultivar, host water/nutritional status, etc., on bacterial survival.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ricardo Delgado Santander and +1Srđan G Aćimović•  8  Microbiology, Biology, DNA (Forensic Science), Digital PCRMetabolomic Patterns of Septoria Canker Resistant and Susceptible Populus trichocarpa Genotypes 24 Hours PostinoculationSphaerulina musiva is an economically and ecologically important fungal pathogen that causes Septoria stem canker and leaf spot disease of Populus species.

To bridge the gap between genetic markers and structural barriers previously found to be linked to Septoria canker disease resistance in poplar, we used hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify metabolites involved with signaling and cell wall remodeling. Fluctuations in signaling molecules, organic acids, amino acids, sterols, phenolics, and saccharides in resistant and susceptible P. trichocarpa inoculated with S. musiva were observed. The patterns of 222 metabolites in the resistant host implicate systemic acquired resistance (SAR), cell wall apposition, and lignin deposition as modes of resistance to this hemibiotrophic pathogen. This pattern is consistent with the expected response to the biotrophic phase of S. musiva colonization during the first 24 h postinoculatio...Save to Libraryby Katherine Louie•  7  Microbiology, Phytopathology, Plant Biology, BiologyA multi-locus phylogenetic evaluation of Diaporthe (Phomopsis)Save to LibraryDownloadby Eric McKenzie•  14  Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology, Mycology, Molecular SystematicsRelated TopicsPhomopsisFollowFollowingMultilocus-phylogenyFollowFollowingPlant PathologyFollowFollowingMycologyFollowFollowingDiaportheFollowFollowingPlant pathogen systematicsFollowFollowingWheat rustsFollowFollowingBotryosphaeriaFollowFollowingSporulationFollowFollowingDiseases of AppleFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
