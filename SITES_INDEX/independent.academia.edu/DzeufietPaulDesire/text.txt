The aim of this study was to evaluate the antidiabetic, antioxidant activities and the potential toxicity of aqueous extract of Annona muricata in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Oral administration of Annona muricata aqueous extract (100mg/kg or 200mg/kg) was studied in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In long term treatment, 2 weeks after streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, animals received plant extract during 28 consecutive days. For a protective effect, extract was administered 3 days prior to streptozotocin exposure and animals were observed 2 weeks without treatment. The plant extract was not effective in normal rats. In diabetic rats, single administration of the extract significantly reduced blood glucose levels by 75% and 58.22% respectively at the dose of 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg as compared to the initial value. Treatment of normal rats 3 days prior to diabetes induction showed that, Annona muricata extract has no effect within 72h following STZ injection. However, after 14 days post-treatment, the extract at the dose of 100mg/kg significantly reduced blood glucose levels as compared with initial value and diabetic control rats. Immunohistochemical staining of pancreatic β-cells of diabetic rats treated with the dose of 100mg/kg expressed strong staining for β-cell compared to diabetic control. In a long-term study daily administration of Annona muricata aqueous extract for 28 days to diabetic rats, reduced blood glucose levels, serum creatinine, MDA, AST, ALT activity, and nitrite levels LDL-cholesterol. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, SOD, and CAT activity contents were restored. These different results show that the antidiabetic activity of Annona muricata aqueous extract can be explained by its hypolipidaemic effect, its antioxidant and protective action on pancreatic β-cells, which in turn improve glucose metabolism.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Protective effects of Nymphaea lotus Linn. on ED and tissular oxidative stress in the N (ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) hypertensive male rats were investigated in this study. Materials and Methods: Fifty adult male Wistar rats were randomly classified into five groups; control, L-NAME (10 mg/kg), L-NAME + losartan (10 mg/kg), L-NAME + N. lotus at the dose of 75 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. L-NAME was administered during 8 weeks, but others treatment started from the 4th week and was administered continuously with L-NAME (10 mg/kg) during 4 additional weeks. Results: L-NAME administration caused marked hit of sexual behavior, specifically failure of penile insertion or difficulty to ejaculate during the test interval. Further L-NAME causes a significant decrease in antioxidant products as reduced gluthatione (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO) in aorta and penile tissues,...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Methods: Fifty adult male Wistar rats were randomly classified into 5 groups; Control, L-NAME (10 mg/kg), L-NAME + losartan (10 mg/kg), L-NAME + N. lotus at the dose of 75 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. L-NAME was administered during 8 weeks, but others treatments started from the 4th week and were administered continuously with L-NAME (10 mg/kg) during 4 additional weeks. Results: L-NAME administration caused marked hit of sexual behaviour, specifically failure of penile insertion or difficulty to ejaculate during the test interval. Further L-NAME causes a significant decrease in antioxidant products as reduced gluthatione (GSH) and nitrites (NO) in aorta and penile tissues, as compared to control group. N. lotus co-treatment for 4 weeks increased markedly the erectile index and the ejaculation rates contrarily to losartan in comparison to negative control receiving only L-NAME. N. lotus, but not the positive drug losartan, induced a significant increase in the anti-oxidant enzymes activities and GSH and NO levels, as well as a significant decrease in MDA levels compared to L-NAME group. These results suggests N. lotus may provide significant protection against L-NAME-induced tissular oxidative damages by up-regulation of antioxidant systems and promotion of the vasodilator factors in chronic NO-deficient rats. These alleviating effects of Nymphaea lotus denote a pro-sexual, antioxidant and vasodilatatory properties that was more appreciated after histological examination where remodeling of aorta were visibly reduced. Conclusion: N. lotus may be considered as a potentially useful strategy to limit erectile dysfunction and toxicity associated with hypertension.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

People in central region of Cameroon have used, for many years, Allanblackia floribunda (Oliver), because of their belief that it improves fertility and sexual desire. The phytochemical constituents of aqueous extract of Allanblackia floribunda (Oliver) stem bark and its effect on male rat sexual behaviour were evaluated for 8 days. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, triterpenoids, phenols, polyoses, tannins and flavonoids. Administration of the extract at the dose of 150 mg/kg body weight resulted in the significant increase (p ˂ 0.001) of mount frequency, intromission frequency, ejaculatory latency, penile licking frequency, computed indices of sexual behaviour and wiring-touch frequency whereas the mount latency, intromission latency and post-ejaculatory interval were significantly decreased (p ˂ 0.001) throughout the experimental period.

However, despite this use, the estrogenic properties of Gouania longipetala (G. longipetala) have not been studied until now. The present study was aimed to assess estrogenic activities of the stem bark aqueous (GLA) and ethanolic (GLE) extracts of G. longipetala in post menopause-like model of ovariectomized (Ovx) Wistar rats. Animals were either sham-operated or Ovx. 84 days after ovariectomy, animals were divided into seven groups of five animals and were daily treated for 28 days with distilled water (10mL/kg) for group 1, 2% solution of Tween 80 (10mL/kg) for group 2, estradiol valerate (1mg/kg) for group 3, GLA (45 or 180mg/kg) and GLE (40 or 160mg/kg) for groups 4 to 7 respectively. Sham-operated animals daily received distilled water (10mL/kg). During the experimental period, the body weight was registered every week. At the day 29, blood pressure was registered by invasive method while uterine and vagina morphometry as well as body, uterine and abdominal fat weights changes were analyzed. Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were determined. Moreover, oxidative stress markers such as nitrites, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in homogenized liver and aorta. Compared with the sham control, vagina and uterine dystrophy and elevated blood pressure were observed in Ovx rats treated with vehicles. Biochemical parameters showed a significant increase of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and MDA as well as a significant decrease of nitrites and GSH in Ovx animals treated with vehicle as compared to sham group. GLA and GLE displayed estrogen-like effects on vagina and did not affect uterine wet weight and epithelial height compared with vehicle groups. Both extracts displayed anti-atherogenic properties by reducing AI, AIP and LDL-cholesterol level as compared to vehicles groups. GLA and GLE significantly prevented the increase of MDA induced by ovariectomy as compared to rats treated with vehicles. This study showed that GLA and GLE exhibited estrogenic effects by providing vaginal lubrication, by modulating blood pressure and improving lipid profile, oxidative status and endothelial function and may not have an undesirable influence on the endometrium in ovariectomized rats.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
