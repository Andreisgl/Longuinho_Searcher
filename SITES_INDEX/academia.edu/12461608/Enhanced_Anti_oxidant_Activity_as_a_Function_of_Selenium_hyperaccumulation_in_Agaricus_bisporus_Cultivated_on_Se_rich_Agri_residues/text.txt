Extraction of the freeze-dried and pulverized fruiting bodies and mycelia with methanol and water (8:2, v/v), followed by evaporation of the solvent under a vacuum, created their extracts, which were analyzed for their AOXC and TPC using a DPPH· scavenging assay and the Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. The fruiting bodies and the culture mycelia of all the mushroom species exhibited varied antioxidant capacity; however, the fruiting bodies had more ...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of NutritionMushrooms and Health Summit Proceedings2014 • Van HubbardDownload Free PDFView PDF1324561208-Khatunetal 2011AJEA492Yuvraj RathoreDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE NUTRITIONAL AND MEDICAL BENEFITS OF AGARICUS BISPORUS : A REVIEWFunda  Atila, Mustafa N OwaidDownload Free PDFView PDFIn: Incredible World of Biotechnology OYSTER MUSHROOM: A RICH SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS Complimentary Contributor CopyDr. Vivek K . Chaturvedi, ankita kushwaha, ravi pathakRecently, studies in various types of free radicals have gained attention around the globe as it causes oxidative stress, which may lead to aging and numerous diseases. A balance between free radicals and antioxidants is necessary for appropriate physiological function. At moderate concentrations, free radicals (ROS/RNS) play a significant role as regulatory mediators in cell signaling processes; whereas at high concentration, they are deleterious to the cell, as they modify lipids, proteins, and DNA followed by a number of diseases. Antioxidants play an important role in maintaining human health by performing the action of scavenging free radicals. The human body has its own defense system against free radicals, such as superoxide dismutase enzyme, glutathione enzyme and catalase, but they are insufficient to prevent damage entirely. Synthetic antioxidants such as BHA, TBHQ and BHT are radical scavengers but are usually associated with adverse side effects.Download Free PDFView PDFBioactive Compounds of Fresh and Dried Pleurotus ostreatus MushroomEman Mostafa MohamedChemical composition of the fresh and dried mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus and their bioactive secondary metabolic products were studied. The ethanolic extracts of the P. ostreatus cultivated on rice straw supplemented by wheat bran were studied by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. A total of hundred and seven metabolites were detected in tested samples. These include 56 metabolites only detected in fresh sample, 37 metabolites only detected in dry sample, and 14 metabolites were detected in the both samples. The detected metabolites could be classified into nine chemical groups including 2 metabolites related to acids, 5 alcohols, 27 alkane, 3 amides, 27 esters, 8 fatty acids, 4 terpenoids, 29 heterocyclic and 2 phenols. The bioactivity of the metabolic products could be classified: anticholesterol, anticancer and essential fatty acids which support human health. On comparison between fresh and dried P. ostreatus samples, we found that the high number of metabolites was recorded in the fresh extract. Fifty five aroma compounds were recorded and including (27 esters, 9 ketones, 7 thiols, 5 alcholos, 4 terpenoids, 2 phenols and 1 aldehyde). The selenium content in P. ostreatus samples was measured by using ACAL –APR -51-00 test methods and showed that the fresh sample has 58.24 mg/kg but the dry sample has 100.31 mg/kg.Download Free PDFView PDFMushrooms: Natural factory of anti-oxidant, anti- inflammatory, analgesic and nutritionSadiur Rahman Sajon, Samiron SanaMushrooms have been consumed as food items and medications since earliest history; old Greeks had a strong faith that mushrooms gave strength to warriors in fight and the Romans saw them as the "Food of the Gods". For hundreds of years, the Chinese culture has treasured mushrooms as a wellbeing nourishment, an "elixir of life." They have been a piece of the human culture for thousands of years and had been the item of considerable interest for the most essential civic establishments in history on account of their sensory attributes. Likewise, they additionally incorporate numerous bioactive metabolites which make mushrooms and truffles regular parts in medication, particularly in Africa, the Middle East, China and Japan. It is accounted for and in some cases have demonstrated that mushrooms have numerous pharmacological and remedial activity including anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, nutraceutical and numerous others. However, this attempt has been made to concentrate on the short reviews of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and food values of mostly used mushrooms all over the world.Download Free PDFView PDFRole of Mushroom as Dietary Supplement on Performance of PoultrySohail H Khan, Nasir MukhtarThe objective of this review is to summarize the effect of commonly used mushrooms (particularly Pleurotus ostreatus or oyster mushroom, Agaricus bisporus or Button mushroom, Lentimula edodes or shiitake mushroom, and Ganoderma lucidum or reishi mushroom) in poultry diets on performance of broilers and layers. It can be concluded from different studies that mushrooms and their polysaccharides can play important roles in poultry production: (1) Polysaccharides in mushrooms may act as immune enhancers or immunomodulators and show antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic bioactivities; (2) phenolic compounds of mushrooms may act as antioxidants; (3) mushrooms in broiler’s diet may be used as growth promoters as an alternative to antibiotics; (4) mushrooms in the diet may improve egg production and quality; (5) mushrooms may be used as a safe and effective alternative for inducing molt, enhancing immunity, reducing Salmonella growth, and returning to egg production. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of mushrooms to improve productive performance in chickens and to illuminate the possible modes of action related to the gut ecosystem and the immune response.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
