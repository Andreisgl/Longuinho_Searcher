Welcome to Wikimedia’s Volunteer Response Team wiki!
This wiki is used as a private workspace for the volunteers working on the Volunteer Response Team System (VRTS), which is used to answer queries, complaints, and comment emails received from the public. You can chat with us on IRC in the public channel #wikimedia-vrt connect. We are always looking for volunteers so if you'd like to help, please see the recruiting page on meta.
The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia, one of the 10 most visited websites in the world. You can find more information on us and our projects at our public website, wikimediafoundation.org.
