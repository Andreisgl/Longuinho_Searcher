They try to respond to many questions about representations of war:what is warrior iconography and on what basis it can be defined? Did the war scenes follow a specific directory whereby they adopted the most varied forms? Can we determine the most usual conditions for the creation of pictures of wartime (such as periods of great change)? Were the war scenes referring to specific historical events or were they generic representations? What can a society accept from the representations of war? What did war images silence and why? What is a «just» punishment for enemies and thus the «just» representation of it? Who has control of the representation and therefore also the memory of war? Who is the real subject of war representations?What emerges from the articles published here is the relevance of textual data in any analysis of iconological material. And this is not only true for iconology, but for all the archaeological material discovered at historical sites.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The volume consists of two parts. The studies in the fi rst part analyse the body as a biological entity as well as a social, sexual and cultural identity (persona).They show the emotional power of images, the means and media used to achieve this suggestive power, and the diff erent audiences that are the privileged recipients of the diff erent types of production. They also investigate the emotions as they are expressed through the gestures and attitudes of the characters represented. The second part includes articles that are more closely related to the themes that Pierre Amiet has tackled. Two articles deal with his favourite research theme, glyptics. One article takes up the problem of the formation of the state which Pierre Amiet had dealt with in several of his glyptic studies. Other papers are concerned with the organisation of craftsmen and statuary.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The 18 chapters are organized in three thematic sections: Architecture as Archive of Social Space; The Active Household; and Ritual Space at Home.Chapters in the first section, ‘Architecture as Archive of Social Space,’ profile houses as records of the lives of inhabitants, changing and adapting with residents; many offer a background focus on how human behavior is shaped by the walls within one’s own home. All of the chapters in this section are united in their quest to answer two questions: ‘what is the nature of a house and household’ and ‘who lived in these household spaces?’The middle section, ‘The Active Household,’ focuses on the evidence for how residents carried out household activities including work and food preparation. Chapters include the “heart of household archaeology” in their application of activity area research, but also drill down to the social significance of what residents were doing or eating, and where such actions were taking place.The final section, “Ritual Space at Home,” features studies on the house as ritual space. Material culture and materialized household religion is adding important data and theory to this subfield of household archaeology, as the studies in this section demonstrate. This research fills important gaps in our knowledge of the archaeology of religion in various regions and time periods across the Near East.TO BUY: https://www.archaeopress.com/Archaeopress/Products/978180327156916 € ebook, 48€ paperback and pdfSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The analysis of their reliefs allows, on the one hand, to understand criteria other than size which are used to characterize children. And on the other, it makes us understand the complex links between family, society, gender and age.The boy is a half man and the little girl a half woman, since they wear the same clothes and headgear as adults and only their size is smaller. But the importance of the child is demonstrated by the textual sources and the number of his representations. In Sennacherib’s reliefs, age differences are reflected in height, attitudes and a few gestures. Assurbanipal only set one standard size for all children, 2/3 of an adult. Thus, in his reliefs, it is above all attitudes that suggest differences in age. Finally, a careful study of the bas-reliefs reveals family ties complicated by the sex and age of the children and by the more (female) or less important (male) social role of the parents.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The choice of topics and the location of bas-reliefs in Neo-Assyrian palaces seeks to arouse the maximum of emotions and to keep the memory longer, as suggested by neuroscientists. Light plays an important role in emphasising the emotional power of images. The analysis of the light – natural and artificial – in the royal palaces of the 1st mill. BCE highlights also some difficulties in reading bas-reliefs, captions, and inscriptions. It also opens the way to the problem of the ‘babanu-bitanu’ and the audience for whom the bas-reliefs were intendedSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We can distinguish several types of destruction (objects, monuments, cities). The aim was to punish the guilty king byinflicting the same penalties as those provided in the codesof laws (talion); and to inflicts upon him the torment of dishonor. Through this condannation it is all the people of the vanquished king and  that of the victorious king who learn the "just behavior" and thereby a rewriting of history is possible.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Moreover, there is no idea of human historical development : artificial division of parts, exclusion of prehistoric times as well as from Perses to Sassanians, absence of a more regional archaeology. Finally the book is largely unusable for students : approximate quotations from sources, ideas not questioned, lack of basic bibliography for beginners, of a single geographical plan, of history of excavations, no the deciphering of cuneiform, no reliable sources of images, no example of how analysis can be do in iconographic and architectural items of the past, no scale nor basic data of objects, no list of figures and finally images too small and insufficient in number  ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Born about thirty years ago, it is more and more applied in the comprehension of ancient societies. In this new field, researchers analyse animals as a subject and not as an object, employing various theoretical perspectives and a variety of disciplines. But can normative and epistemic ambitions of Animal/Human Studies concert with militancy?

ASOR 2023 Figuring Violence: Images of Terror and Terror of ImagesViolence as a destructive impulse that turns outside itself characterizes human societies today a... more Violence as a destructive impulse that turns outside itself characterizes human societies today as well as in the past. Whether it is innate or socialized, it is a constant component of history. It is concretized in various forms that this workshop attempts to clarify for the Ancient Near East. After a first session devoted to violence in the 3rd mill. BCE (2022), the next sessions will be more thematic: the human violence expressed in texts through imaged metaphors and in iconographic representations is a justified and accepted violence. The 2023 session targets this type of violence and its justifications. It can take different forms: to be expressed by the images and the official texts, by the destructions of biological bodies, to be preserved in the archaeological remains (osteological, bullets, destruction of city walls, fights). It can also be used against the gods and the dead, in both cases especially those of the enemies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Various methods have been employed including household archaeology and textual studies, viewed through frameworks of anthropological and social theories. This three year session tries to activate real discussions between archaeologists, historians and anthropologists on some problems still debated on houses: how do we identify the uses of domestic spaces and what does use of space tell us? What kind of ritual practices were carried out in the houses? Which are the best manners to vizualize ancient houses? Themes are not limited, but may include culture, economy, gender, ethnicity, and religion taking a bottom-up approach to understanding the ancient world. Varied methodologies, including household archaeology, domestic micro-archaeology, 3-D reconstructions, etc. welcome.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They are represented using different techniques, such as bas relief, round bump, intaglio, incision, drawing and different materials, such as stone, terracotta, inlays, metal, faience... Letters, popular proverbs, ominal texts and even royal inscriptions give information about animals. And the lexical series HAR-ra = hubullu can be considered as the first treaty on animals, well before Aristotle and Pliny the Elder. From the birth (amulets) to the death (clay figurines in tombs), man is always accompanied by animals, wild, domesticated and also pets. This session aims to analyse the complex relationships between men and animals, especially WILD ANIMALS. Papers that make use of iconological and textual data are encouraged.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Specialists of images often are fascinated by theories coming from different fields and sometimes they adapt them quite late in relationship at other fields. For example, the last modish one, the “agency” theory, is having a lot of success in the Ancient Near East at the same moment when it is becoming criticized in other fields. How is the better manner to study and understand the ancient productions? The exploitation of so different theories risks to prevent the understanding of the historical context in which the objects were created for a particular kind of public. The workshop intends to stimulate discussions and confrontations on this major problem.Workshop organizers:Laura Battini: laura.battini@college-de-france.frTallay Ornan: tallay.ornan@mail.huji.ac.ilSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This fruition more immediate and comprehensive of the images actually makes them the preferred vehicle of political and religious power for the transmission of specific messages executed by artists. And in an almost completely illiterate society, images are understood by everyone, even if at different reading levels. On the other hand, artisans and artists ‘indipendant’ (not working for the political and religious power) used the power of images to hit their public and so have a better and larger diffusion of human messages.   The individuation of the differences in public, in techniques, in messages between official work (artistic ) and unofficial (arts and crafts) will be an important goal of this event.    Four themes have been selected to facilitate discussions on the human image:1 ) differences in status (divine/human, royal/human/servil);2) gender differences (male/ female);3) differences in age (children/ adults/older);4) "different body" (beaten, humiliated, dismembered, grotesque…).  The analysis of these four themes will result in a vision of the "perfect" body and its opposites, for the different sexes, ages and status in a restricted geographical (Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine) and historical (III-I mill. BC) context.                       November, 4-5, 2016, LyonSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
