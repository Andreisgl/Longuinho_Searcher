"U.S. Immigration Officers of Mexican Ancestry as Mexican  Americans, Citizens, and Immigration Police" (download available)2002 • Josiah HeymanA pdf is available by request to jmheyman@utep.edu . U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officers of Mexican ancestry do not identify with Mexican and other Latin American immigrants. Instead, they understand themselves as U.S. citizens who reject both domestic racism and ethnic loyalties that cross national borders. Their self understandings emerge from processes that include U.S. citizenship ideology and social mobility into primary labor market jobs with stability, benefits, and progressive careers. These processes insulate them from the experience of immigrants in casual and insecure labor markets devoid of social benefits. Thus they differ from immigrants not only in being on opposite sides of the bureaucratic encounter but also in being at opposite poles of bureaucratized social citizenship. This suggests that a cause of opposition to immigration in advanced capitalist societies is that citizenship based job and benefit systems restrict the scope of empathy.Download Free PDFView PDFInverting the Telescope on Borders that Matter: Conversations in Café EuropaMarie Sandberg, Dorte Andersen, Olivier KramschProposing an ‘inverted telescope’ for border studies, we problematized existing calls to ‘see like a border’, arguing that such moves miss an opportunity to define what is properly political about b/ordering space. Inverting the telescope on borders that matter reveals an ontologically grounded politics of bordering, one that illuminates an inherent multiplicity to borders that can best be captured in those contact zones that resist our conventional understanding of where European borders lie. Focusing on localized bordering practices that contest demarcation and reappropriation within the logics of global, European and state-centered geopolitical designs, we canvas the ontological politics emerging from the furnace of three spatio-temporal European horizons: the Istrian peninsula connecting Slovenia and Croatia; the historical, path-dependent trajectory of a seasonal labor force crossing Polish and Danish borders; and a ‘European’ borderlocated deep in Amazonı´a. We name the space produced by the tensions in each of these theaters Cafe´ Europa, designating both a material location of border praxis as well as a collective intellectual project in which the authors are themselves self-reflexively implicated.Download Free PDFView PDFBorders re/make Bodies and Bodies are made to make Borders: Storying Migrant Trajectories2017 • Sutapa ChattopadhyayThe concept of borders continues to be notoriously obscure, due to its conceptual complexity, historicity and political situatedness. Equally contestable are concepts such as migrant and migration. Conceptually, I draw from Harsha Walia’s (2013) Border Imperialism and border studies that center on the context-particular histories of European colonialism and imperialism. Central to the article is the interlacing of geopolitics and the everyday in ways that show the explosion of borders and peculiar dissection of borders on particular migrants. Borders re/make bodies and bodies are made to make borders in the variety of ways across different sites. In the first half of the manuscript, I argue that these compelling conceptual and methodological approaches are pivotal to challenging Eurocentric representations of migrants and positivist research traditions, while in the second half I forge an understanding of the biopolitics of borders. My research findings are developed from 10 in-depth narratives mainly collected from Bangladeshi migrants in Madrid and Rome. Alongside participatory (action) research (P(A)R) methods and migrant narratives, I recall my own precarious work experiences and identity as a migrant, in Europe, which are parallel but quite distinct from the experiences of the participants. This research has deepened my understanding of migrants and borders and de-centered my conceptualizations prior to this field work. Notably, I strive to meet two challenges: provide a critical discussion on my use of feminist-informed methodology, and forward an analysis of the situation of migrants from the Global South in Europe through their voices by emphasizing the need for ethnographically-informed works to foreground significant aspects of migrant trajectories and their everyday lives.Download Free PDFView PDFEstudios Fronterizos,Guatemalan young domestic female workers in Soconusco, Chiapas: Their experiences and imaginaries2019 • Aki KuromiyaI describe the subjectivities of Guatemalan female workers who participate in the domestic sector of the region Soconusco, Chiapas, México. Especially, I will focus on their motivations to work in foreign country as domestic worker. Through ethnographic dates and the analysis of their narratives, I will present the imaginaries they have as a representation of their subjectivities and have a bearing on the migration and labor practices of young Guatemalan worker. There are three imaginaries that I analyze: the urban life, family and about their future, which explain the particular character of this border dynamics what I will define as micro-social and temporary mobility. My objective is to evidence that migratory and labor dynamic of female young is not economic phenomenon, but is the social process in which they seek their particular forms to be young and to make youngness.Download Free PDFView PDFCurrent AnthropologyU.S. Immigration Officers of Mexican Ancestry as Mexican Americans, Citizens, and Immigration Police2002 • Ralph GrilloDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Politics, Culture and SocietyThe Day the Sun Rises in the West—Ethnography of a Peace Process2009 • Meirav Aharon - GutmanBoth politicians and academic researchers have focused on the Oslo peace agreements, generally emphasizing the “New Middle East” and “Transnationalism.” Less attention has been paid to social and economic changes affected by the process of peace-making. This paper examines the reality that was created from below and asks what the peace process meant to migrant Palestinian workers in Israel. Three years of ethnography challenge accepted theories of borders and borderland in the case of Israel and Palestine by asking what can be learned about the cultural identity of people from the ways they cross, understand, and move between geopolitical and cultural boundaries. In the last years of the Oslo Agreements, it became clear to the workers that “peace” meant preserving national borders: it involved a policy of separation, whereas their very livelihood depended on their ability to move between Tel Aviv and the Gaza Strip. Torn between their national identity and their class–cultural identity, they formulated a demand for a dialectical reorganization: a state without borders. This demand stood in opposition to the national aspirations of Israel and the Palestinian state-in-being alike.Download Free PDFView PDFTransnational CinemasOn no man's (Is)land: futurities at the border2018 • Bhaskar SarkarFocusing on communities that, displaced by riverbank erosion, relocate to the islands formed by silt sedimentation in the middle of the Ganga, along the stretch of the river that coincides with the international border between Bangladesh and India, this paper examines the constitutive contradictions of citizenship and alienness. Analyzing Sourav Sarangi’s documentary …Moddhikhane Char (aka No Man’s Island, 2012) along with its conditions of production, the paper isolates an aesthetic of precarity that enables the filmmaker to challenge a statist spectacle of border control while participating in a global documentary humanitarianism. The paper also engages in more speculative contemplations on environmental shifts, the beleaguered status of the common, and the futures of frontier communities. At stake is a nuanced understanding of emergent forms of political agency that subvert, and threaten to displace, classical paradigms of citizenship and political participation.Download Free PDFView PDFDushanbe "Irfon"GENDER ASPECTS OF MIGRATORY PROCESSES IN TAJIKISTAN: CHALLENGES OF THE TIME AND CHOICES // Introduction 20202020 • Sophia R.  KasymovaThe migration processes in the modern Tajikistan are viewed through the gender perspective and in conjunction with the social structure, institutions and processes in the context of globalization. Such forms and types of migration mobility of the population of Tajikistan as cross-border labor migration, education-related migration of young people, marriage-related migration among the women and internal migration of a "village-city" direction based on the example of the rural women to Dushanbe city, have become a subject of the research. The main focus of the author is on analysis of the changes in the social structure of the rural population, such social institutions as marriage and family as well as gender status of the Tajik women in the public sphere, which take place under influence of migration and globalization factors. The book is intended for sociologists and all those interested in the gender and migration issues in Tajikistan.Download Free PDFView PDF" No One Cares if You Can't Work " : Injured and Disabled Mexican-Origin Workers in Transnational Life Course PerspectiveAlayne UnterbergerWhat happens to injured immigrant workers as they age? What effects do their return migrations have on families, communities, and labor dynamics back home? This paper takes a composite of five immigrant families who participated in a long-term binational study between Mexico and Florida, along with a separate cohort of Latino immigrant workers engaged in construction and warehousing in order to contextualize workers' health through Life Course Theory (LCT). This article specifically explores the lives of injured im/migrant workers and demonstrates the syndemic effects of Florida's lax workers' compensation (WC) system and intersecting health and labor policies and practices that exacerbate structural vulnerabilities on both sides of the U.S.– Mexico border. Syndemics combined with LCT highlights the intersecting and synergistic effects of place/environment, timing, timeline, and equity on health over the lifespan. Work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities across different sectors of Florida's pro-business economy exacerbate vulnerabilities and traumas, creating disability, and further inequalities in both the sending and receiving communities. The lack of effective workplace safety and health regulations perpetuate cycles of injury, illness, addiction, and precarity in both the United States and Mexico. These phenomena, combined with existing morbidities, fuel a binational disability syndemic that robs communities on both sides of the border of their economic, human, and social capital. Suggestions for different kinds of engagement and involvement by anthropologists and other social and health scientists are proposed, including discussions and examples of promising social movements attempting to hold Florida's food and agribusinesses accountable.Download Free PDFView PDFContributions of US Mexico Border Studies to Social TheoryJosiah HeymanThe study of borders draws on, and is a significant contributor to, important theoretical developments in the social sciences. We have moved away from envisioning societies and cultures as pure, bounded units, for which we identified inner essences (cultural patterns, social structures), toward envisioning them as internally and externally varied webs of relations, for which we trace connections and changes over time (Wolf 1982). Borders present precisely such mixtures and interactions. The agenda of this chapter, then, is to draw out theoretical lessons from work done on the U.S.-Mexico border. While grounded in a review of the literature on this region, the theoretical lessons are clear and transportable, both to other borders and to complex social and cultural situations generally. My approach derives from place-based science, which rejects abstract, timeless, and placeless theorizing in favor of building theory upward from particular places and times via nested generalizations; those generalizations can be transported and recontextualized for other places and times. I likewise draw on non-dogmatic Marxian theory, attending to the constitutive role of unequal relationships unfolding across historical time. No one border can do justice to all borders, and different lessons would be drawn from other sites; the point is not to hold this region as quintessential but to ask if ideas suggested here are informative and helpful as we range about the social world.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
