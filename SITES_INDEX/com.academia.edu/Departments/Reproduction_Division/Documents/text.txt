This effect is due toincorporation of cholesterol in membrane ofsperm which maintained the membraneintegrity which resulted in higher survival ratebefore and after freezing and thawing. It isconcluded that CLC can be a substitute of eggyolk in Tris-based extender. Further studies areneeded to observe interactive effect of CLC andegg yolk for better protection of sperm duringcryopreservation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mehboob Ahmed and +2Muhammad Hammad  FayyazQaisar  Shahzad•Sperm CryopreservationDystocia Due to Perosomus Elumbis (Acaudatus) in a BuffaloSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad•ZoologyDystocia Due to Perosomus ElumbisPerosomus elumbis (Acaudatus) is an occasionally found congenital anomaly characterized by partial or complete agenesis of lumbar, sacral and coccygeal vertebrae and ankylosis of the hind limbs.

Aseven years old BCS 3.5±0.5 pluriparousbuffalo with dystocia due to malformed fetuswas presented at Theriogenology clinic. Thecalf had a shortened trunk and weighed roughly32.5 kg. There was an absence of the dorsal partof the vertebrae in the fetus and misshapenedsacral vertebrae with the squeezed perinealregion. Small and ankylosed limbs of the fetuswere loosely attached to the trunk. The monstercalf was forcefully extracted with partialfetotomy result in successfully resolveddystocia of a buffalo. The malformations weremostly confined to the abdominal region.

There is no tool through which reproductive performance of buffalo can be phenotyped. Therefore, aim of thepresent study was to develop a method on the basis of which reproductive performance of buffaloes can bephenotypically assessed. For this purpose two experiments were designed. In first experiment, ten Nili-Ravi buffaloheifers were used in the study to measure repeatability of follicular count. Each heifer was scanned on alternate day,from day 1 to day 9 of the successive estrous cycle. Antral follicles and repeatability was assessed in different follicularwaves. In 2nd experiment, 4 lactating buffaloes were selected to count antral follicles from day 1 to day 10 of the estrouscycle and super-stimulated by using FSH hormone. Follicular count after FSH injection was examined by ultrasound.Follicular count is highly repeatable in different follicular waves within (r = 0.83) and between (r = 0.85) differentestrous cycles. Follicular count and super stimulatory response are positively correlated (r = 0.95). In conclusion,animals with high antral follicular count can be selected for super stimulation and embryo transfer to get optimumresponse.Save to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad•Buffalo reproductionBiometric Assessment of the Testis in Pakistani Adult Male Goats (Capra hircus)The biometric analysis of the testes of adult male of the local breeds of goat is reported.

The mean length, breadth, thicknessand circumference of right testicle with epididymis recorded was 8.42±0.91 cm, 4.58±0.56 cm, 4.19±0.53 cm and 12.53±1.23cm and those of left testicle with epididymis were 8.44±1.06 cm, 4.62±0.57 cm, 4.24±0.51cm and 12.66±1.32 cm, respectively. The measurement of circumference of left testicle with epididymis were significantly (P < 0.05)higher than those of right testicle with the epididymis. The mean length, breadth, and circumference of right testicle without epididymis were 6.62±0.83 cm, 4.38±0.55 cm, and 12.36±1.16 cm, whereas those of the left testicle without epididymis were 6.65±0.84cm,4.41±0.56 cm and 12.47±1.18 cm, respectively. The mean weight of right and left testicle without epididymis was 59.36±16.86 g and 60.35±17.16 g, respectively. The breadth,circumference and weight of left testicle without epididymis were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of right testicle without epididymis. Key words: Biometry, Capra hircus, testiclemeasurements.Save to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad and +1Muhammad Usman Mehmood•Animal reproductionGross Morphometric Features of the Epididymis in Adult Male Pakistani Goats (Capra hircus)The current study was carried out to grossly measure the different parts of the epididymis in local nondescript breed of goat in Pakistan.

A total of 100 male goats (body weight 20-40kg, age 1-3 years), slaughtered at different slaughter houses in Hyderabad were included in this study. The epididymis had the following mean measurements: left epididymis– length, breadth and thickness of head, body and tail were 3.49±0.75, 6.61±0.72, 1.68-0.26, 1.94±0.38, 0.54±0.11, 1.49±0.22, 0.67±0.18,0.25±0.05, 1.27±0.20 cm, respectively. The circumference and weight of the tail was 4.78±0.64 cm and 2.46±0.91g. The rightepididymis–length, breadth and thickness of the head, body and tail were 3.49±0.70, 6.58±0.70, 1.68±0.28, 1.94±0.41,0.55±0.12, 1.47±0.22, 0.67±0.18, 0.25±0.05, 1.26±0.19 cm, whereas circumference and weight of the tail was 4.76±0.64 cm and 2.45±0.92 g, respectively. The current study demonstrated statistically no significant difference in the right and left epididymis parameters of the male goat.

The semen was collected from three mature regular donor buffalo bulls, ejaculates were pooled and semen evaluated initially. In Experiment 1, the ejaculates were extended in tris-citric acid diluter supplemented with different RJ concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4%). The diluted semen was cooled to 4°C, packaged into 0.5mL straws and frozen using standard procedure. The straws were thawed and assessed for sperm progressive motility, viability, plasma membrane, acrosome, and chromatin integrity. The results indicated that sperm progressive motility was significantly greater (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05) in 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% RJ than 0.4% RJ supplemented and control groups. The sperm viability, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity were significantly improved (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05) in 0.1% RJ supplemented group the compared to other treatment groups. In Experiment 2, cryopreserved sperm with 0.1% RJ supplementation and control (without RJ supplementation) were used to observe the in vitro fertilizing potential and in vivo fertility. In vitro fertilization method was applied to assess the cleavage rate; whereas, AI was performed in buffalo during in vivo fertility trial. The buffaloes were inseminated 12h after standing estrus and pregnancy diagnosis was performed through ultrasonography. The results revealed that the cleavage rate was higher (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05) in 0.1% RJ as compared to control group. However, the pregnancy rate was similar (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;0.05) between 0.1% RJ supplemented and control groups. It is concluded that supplementation of RJ in freezing extender can improve the cryosurvival rate and in vitro fertilizing capacity of buffalo bull sperm.Save to Libraryby Zahid Naseer and +2Muhammad Usman MehmoodQaisar  Shahzad•Biological SciencesPaper 4.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Hamayun Khan and +1Qaisar  Shahzad•Paper 3.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad•Paper 5.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad•Paper 1.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad•Paper 7.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad•Biometric Assessment of the Testis in Pakistani Adult Male Goats (Capra hircusSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar  Shahzad• 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
