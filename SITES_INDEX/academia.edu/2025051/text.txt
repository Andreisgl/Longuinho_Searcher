L'Avventura portrays a bourgeois class alienated by an all-consuming prison-house of selfhood. Members of a dying and useless social class, the director's wealthy, narcissistic protagonists are resigned to their fates. Rootless, decadent, and indolent, they have no special social role or function, except to make and spend money.

In our view, the different hypotheses that spectators may be encouraged to formulate while watching the film are central to their aesthetic and critical experience. Our analysis of the whole set of narrative disruptions points to the conclusion that films achieves a convergence and interaction between the elicitation of active aesthetic reflection and the elicitation of active social reflection in a way that had never been done before.Download Free PDFView PDFHitchcock Annual 18 (2013): 149-194.Hitchcock and The Wandering Woman--The Influence of Italian Art Cinema on The Birds2013 • Richard  AllenDownload Free PDFView PDFL'Avventura: Temporal AdventuresMatilda MrozDownload Free PDFView PDFWide AngleThe Architectonics of Alienation: Antonioni's Edifice Complex1993 • Frank P Tomasulo, Ph.D.Download Free PDFView PDFTemporality and Film AnalysisAudreena CochranDownload Free PDFView PDFMORE THAN A METHOD: TRENDS AND TRADITIONS IN  CONTEMOPORARY FILM PERFORMANCE"The Sounds of Silence": Modernist Acting in Michelangelo Antonioni's BLOW-UP2004 • Frank P Tomasulo, Ph.D.Download Free PDFView PDFIDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN.pdfFrank P Tomasulo, Ph.D.Download Free PDFView PDFCineasteIDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1982)2012 • Frank P Tomasulo, Ph.D.Download Free PDFView PDFPurdue University Seventh Annual Conference on Film. …The Rhetoric of Anti-Closure: Antonioni and the Open Ending1983 • Frank P Tomasulo, Ph.D.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
