Let me begin by indicating the territory I shall not explore. I shall have little or nothing to say about the history of psychoanalysis, a hotly contested terrain that over the past decade has seen the outbreak of a new series of "Freud Wars" . Historians (and psychoanalysts) working on Freud and his successors have pursued a different set of intellectual agendas from those I shall discuss later, and few scholars have written extensively on both psychoanalysis and other branches of the psychiatric enterprise. My second major self-imposed restriction is essentially geographical: I shall con-1 centrate heavily upon the Anglo-American historiography, and for the most part upon works that deal with...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMedical HistoryBethlem Demystified?

Prior to this, treatment of the incarcerated was a barbaric and unjust exercise in human welfare. Facilities provided were often unsanitary, with dozens of people sharing dormitories; many sharing beds with up to four others, or held captive to the floor with shackles. Although the days where the common misconception was that 'a lunatic can be cured only in an institution' have generally passed over its six hundred year history, it is still widely considered that facilities offered by psychiatric hospitals and centres are a contributing factor in the treatment of patients with mental disorders. From the early 'lunatic asylums' of Bethlem Hospital, to the 19th century investments in construction of healthcare buildings in England, addressing the need for psychiatric facilities has been a daunting task for both clinical practitioners and architects alike. Since the advent of the NHS in 1948, there have been calls for reform in public institutions; however, it wasn't until the late 1950s that a call for a new architecture was implemented by the World Health Organisation. Through analysis of existing scholarship on asylum design theory from the eighteenth-century to the present day, and the creation of a therapeutic environment through the manipulation of space and its location, this thesis aspires to discuss the importance and need to develop a safe and healing environment in the creation of architecture for the mentally ill.Download Free PDFView PDFHealthy Minds in the Twentieth Century: In and Beyond the AsylumIntroduction to Healthy Minds: Mental Health Practice and Perception in the Twentieth Century2020 • Alice BrumbyDownload Free PDFView PDFChapter VI: Melancholia between the Casebook and the Textbook: Knowledge Production in the Victorian AsylumÅsa JanssonDownload Free PDFView PDF'A Curious Dance Round a Curious Tree': Agency and Amusement in Victorian AsylumsUte OswaldThe perception of the Victorian asylum is dominated by images of manacles, leeches and padded cells. Yet this obfuscates a very different side of these institutions; throughout the nineteenth century a vast array of entertainment was offered in line with new treatment options. This paper will shed light on these activities by discussing Charles Dickens’s article ‘A Curious Dance Round a Curious Tree’ (Household Words, 17 January 1852) alongside an illustration of Christmas celebrations at St Luke’s Hospital (Illustrated Times, 19 January 1861) to investigate whether these embodied a real opportunity to exercise agency or whether they merely represented another tool of social control.Download Free PDFView PDFThe civilian and soldier patient in the Scottish asylum, 1914-1934 (PhD Thesis).7.
