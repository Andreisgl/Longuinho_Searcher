Health literacy disparities among Community Health Center Patients in Suffolk CountyABSTRACT Background: Health literacy (individuals&amp;#39; health-related skills and knowledge) i... more ABSTRACT Background: Health literacy (individuals&amp;#39; health-related skills and knowledge) is a strong predictor of health outcomes. The present study assessed the health literacy of adult patients attending 8 community health centers in Suffolk County, New York, particularly focusing on identifying disparities in health literacy among patient subgroups. Methods: After completing written surveys in waiting rooms, 1061 patients 18 and older were given the verbally-administered Newest Vital Sign (NVS), a validated and quickly administered measure of health literacy designed for clinical settings. 82% of participants completed the English version and 18% the Spanish version. Results: 75% of participants were female and 60% were U.S.-born. 26% were non-Hispanic white, 31% were non-Hispanic black, and 34% were Hispanic. While 82% of participants had at least a high school diploma or GED, 66% of participants had scores on the NVS indicating limited health literacy. There was a significant difference between the health literacy of white patients (mean score 3.8 1.8 on a scale from 0-6) and non-white patients (mean score 2.4 1.7). Age, race, education, country of birth, and language of administration were significant predictors of NVS score in the multivariable linear regression model (all p-values &amp;lt;0.0001). Conclusions: These findings indicate that educational attainment overestimates actual health literacy skills in this patient population. Public health practitioners serving community health center patients in Suffolk County need to be aware of the prevalence of limited health literacy, particularly among patients from minority racial and ethnic groups, so that they can tailor health education messages and materials accordingly.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Assessing the impact and lag time of racial disparities in colorectal cancer screening on disparities in mortalityABSTRACT Background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer cause of death in America.... more ABSTRACT Background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer cause of death in America. Blacks have disproportionately higher mortality rates of any racial group in the U.S. There has been a divergence in colorectal cancer mortality rates between Whites and Blacks due to earlier and larger reductions of mortality in Whites. Colorectal cancer mortality rates have decreased for each stage in both races, but the stage-specific decreases were smaller in Blacks, particularly in distant-stage disease. This results in an increase in racial disparity for each stage of disease. We are interested in assessing impact and lag time of screening disparities on mortality disparities. Methods: This analysis uses state-level 1999-2009 screening data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and incidence and mortality data from the National Program of Cancer Registries. The risk difference between Blacks and Whites was calculated for screening, incidence, and mortality rates by state. Data is summarized with descriptive statistics. Time series analysis was conducted to identify lag time between screening and mortality and assess the impact of screening disparities on mortality disparities. Results: In all 26 states with complete data, Blacks had higher mortality rates while Whites had higher screening rates. The trend continues with incidence rates, except for New York, where Whites had a higher incidence of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: These results have major implications for health policy. Understanding the lag time and impact of colorectal cancer screening disparities on mortality disparities will be useful in the development of goals and targets for primary prevention programs.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Racism at the intersections: Gender and socioeconomic differences in the experience of racism among African AmericansAmerican Journal of Orthopsychiatry,  2015Several studies investigating the health effects of racism have reported gender and socioeconomic... more Several studies investigating the health effects of racism have reported gender and socioeconomic differences in exposures to racism, with women typically reporting lower frequencies, and individuals with greater resources reporting higher frequencies. This study used diverse measures of socioeconomic position and multiple measures and methods to assess experienced racism. Socioeconomic position included education and financial and employment status. Quantitative racism measures assessed individual experiences with day-to-day and with major lifetime incidents and perceptions of the extent to which African Americans as a group experience racism. A brief qualitative question asked respondents to describe a racist incident that stood out in recent memory. Participants comprised a probability sample of N = 144 African American adults aged 19 to 87 residing in New York City. Results suggested that women reported fewer lifetime incidents but did not differ from men on everyday racism. These differences appear to be partly because of scale content. Socioeconomic position as measured by years of education was positively associated with reported racism in the total sample but differently patterned across gender; subjective social status showed a negative association. Qualitative responses describing memorable incidents fell into 5 key categories: resources/opportunity structures, criminal profiling, racial aggression/assault, interpersonal incivilities, and stereotyping. In these narratives, men were more likely to offer accounts involving criminal profiling, and women encountered incivilities more often. The findings highlight the need for closer attention to the intersection of gender and socioeconomic factors in investigations of the health effects of racism.

Using Small-Area Analysis to Estimate County-Level Racial Disparities in Obesity Demonstrating the Necessity of Targeted InterventionsInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,  2013Data on the national and state levels is often used to inform policy decisions and strategies des... more Data on the national and state levels is often used to inform policy decisions and strategies designed to reduce racial disparities in obesity. Obesity-related health outcomes are realized on the individual level, and policies based on state and national-level data may be inappropriate due to the variations in health outcomes within and between states. To examine county-level variation of obesity within states, we use a small-area analysis technique to fill the void for county-level obesity data by race. Five years of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data are used to estimate the prevalence of obesity by county, both overall and race-stratified. A modified weighting system is used based on demographics at the county level using 2010 census data. We fit a multilevel reweighted regression model to obtain county-level prevalence estimates by race. We compare the distribution of prevalence estimates of non-Hispanic Blacks to non-Hispanic Whites. For 25 of the 26 states included in our analysis there is a statistically significant difference between within-state county-level average obesity prevalence rates for non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. This study provides information needed to target disparities interventions and resources to the local areas with greatest need; it also identifies the necessity of doing so.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Does “off-hours” admission affect burn patient outcome?Burns,  2009Previous critical care and cardiology studies find that critically ill patients have worse outcom... more Previous critical care and cardiology studies find that critically ill patients have worse outcomes when admitted to the hospital during off-hours as compared to those admitted during weekdays. As severe burn is equally emergent we hypothesized that this disparity in outcomes would exist for burn patients as well. Secondary analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) version 7.1. The NTDB is a national registry of hospital admissions for traumatic injury administered by the American College of Surgeons. 700 trauma facilities nationwide contributing to the NTDB between 2002 and 2006. All trauma patients included in the dataset with the injury mechanism of burn divided into &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;off-hours&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; admits (nights from 6pm to 6am and weekends) and weekday admits. Time and day of admission, demographics, ISS score, injury characteristics (+/-inhalational injury, TBSA, and full thickness injury), facility characteristics (number of burn beds, teaching status).

Of the 25,572 burn patients, 17,625 (68.9%) arrived during off-hours. There was no difference in ICU length of stay (LOS) (p=0.233), hospital LOS (p=0.82), or mortality (p=0.546) for those admitted during off-hours compared with weekday admits. In multivariate analysis when controlling for age, gender, burn characteristics (inhalation injury, full thickness injury, and TBSA &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;30%), and hospital type, off-hours admission was not predictive of mortality (OR=1.06, 95% CI 0.91-1.23). Contrary to studies in other critically ill patient populations, off-hours admission is not predictive of worse outcomes in burn patients.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Survey Study of Anesthesiologistsʼ and Surgeonsʼ Ordering of Unnecessary Preoperative Laboratory TestsAnesthesia & Analgesia,  2011Nearly 20 years ago it was shown that patients are exposed to unnecessary preoperative testing th... more Nearly 20 years ago it was shown that patients are exposed to unnecessary preoperative testing that is both costly and has associated morbidity. To determine whether such unnecessary testing persists, we performed internal and external surveys to quantify the incidence of unnecessary preoperative testing and to identify strategies for reduction. The medical records of 1000 consecutive patients scheduled for surgery at our institution were examined for testing outside of our approved guidelines. Subsequently, 4 scenarios were constructed to solicit physician views of appropriate testing: a 45-year-old woman for a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, a 23-year-old woman for right inguinal herniorrhaphy, a 50-year-old man for a hemithyroidectomy, and a 50-year-old man for a total hip replacement. One or more of these scenarios were sent to directors of preoperative clinics (all), United States anesthesiologists (all), gynecologists (cystectomy), general surgeons (herniorrhaphy), otolaryngologists (thyroidectomy), and orthopedists (hip replacement). Potential predictors of ordering and demographic information were collected. More than half of our patients had at least 1 unnecessary test based on our testing guidelines (95% lower confidence limit = 52%). The 17 responding preoperative directors were unanimous for 36 of the 72 combinations of test or consult (henceforth &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;test&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;) and scenario as being unnecessary.

Anesthesiologists were 53% less likely to order at least 1 unnecessary test relative to gynecologists for the cystectomy scenario, 64% less likely than general surgeons for the herniorrhaphy scenario, 66% less likely than otolaryngologists for the thyroidectomy scenario, and 67% less likely than orthopedists for the hip replacement scenario.

The percentage of patients with at least 1 unnecessary test is a suitable end point for monitoring providers&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; ordering. The incidence can be high despite efforts at improvement, but may be reduced if anesthesiologists rather than surgeons order presurgical tests and consults. However, anesthesia groups should be cognizant of potential heterogeneity among them based on time since training.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In multivariate analysis when controlling for age, gender, burn characteristics (inhalation injury, full thickness injury, and TBSA &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;30%), and hospital type, off-hours admission was not predictive of mortality (OR=1.06, 95% CI 0.91-1.23). Contrary to studies in other critically ill patient populations, off-hours admission is not predictive of worse outcomes in burn patients.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Survey Study of Anesthesiologistsʼ and Surgeonsʼ Ordering of Unnecessary Preoperative Laboratory TestsAnesthesia & Analgesia,  2011Nearly 20 years ago it was shown that patients are exposed to unnecessary preoperative testing th... more Nearly 20 years ago it was shown that patients are exposed to unnecessary preoperative testing that is both costly and has associated morbidity. To determine whether such unnecessary testing persists, we performed internal and external surveys to quantify the incidence of unnecessary preoperative testing and to identify strategies for reduction. The medical records of 1000 consecutive patients scheduled for surgery at our institution were examined for testing outside of our approved guidelines. Subsequently, 4 scenarios were constructed to solicit physician views of appropriate testing: a 45-year-old woman for a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, a 23-year-old woman for right inguinal herniorrhaphy, a 50-year-old man for a hemithyroidectomy, and a 50-year-old man for a total hip replacement. One or more of these scenarios were sent to directors of preoperative clinics (all), United States anesthesiologists (all), gynecologists (cystectomy), general surgeons (herniorrhaphy), otolaryngologists (thyroidectomy), and orthopedists (hip replacement). Potential predictors of ordering and demographic information were collected. More than half of our patients had at least 1 unnecessary test based on our testing guidelines (95% lower confidence limit = 52%). The 17 responding preoperative directors were unanimous for 36 of the 72 combinations of test or consult (henceforth &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;test&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;) and scenario as being unnecessary. Among the 175 anesthesiologists responding to the survey, 46% ordered 1 or more of the tests unanimously considered unnecessary by the preoperative directors for the given scenario. Among 17 potential predictors of anesthesiologists&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; unnecessary ordering, only training completed before 1980 significantly increased the risk of ordering at least 1 unnecessary test (by 48%, 95% confidence limits &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;29%). Anesthesiologists were 53% less likely to order at least 1 unnecessary test relative to gynecologists for the cystectomy scenario, 64% less likely than general surgeons for the herniorrhaphy scenario, 66% less likely than otolaryngologists for the thyroidectomy scenario, and 67% less likely than orthopedists for the hip replacement scenario. The 95% lower confidence limits were all &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;40%. The percentage of patients with at least 1 unnecessary test is a suitable end point for monitoring providers&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; ordering. The incidence can be high despite efforts at improvement, but may be reduced if anesthesiologists rather than surgeons order presurgical tests and consults. However, anesthesia groups should be cognizant of potential heterogeneity among them based on time since training.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Diagnostic accuracy of self-reported racial composition of residential neighborhoodAnnals of Epidemiology,  2015To examine the diagnostic accuracy of self-reported measures of individuals&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;a... more To examine the diagnostic accuracy of self-reported measures of individuals&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; perceptions of the racial and ethnic composition of their communities with objective data (i.e., census) as the criterion standard and assess differences in concordance in subjective and objective measures of segregation by race and ethnicity. We examined data from 943 adult community health center visitors in Suffolk County, New York to assess differences between self-reported racial composition of current neighborhood and 2010 U.S. Census data. A cross-sectional convenience sample was obtained; questionnaires were used to compare participant responses about the racial composition of their current neighborhood and their town of residence. Respondents who self-identified as white were more likely to self-report racial composition of their neighborhood consistent with 2010 Census estimates. Relative to census estimates, 93.1% of blacks overestimated the proportion of their current neighborhood that was black, and 69.8% of Hispanics overestimated the proportion that was Hispanic. There were statistically significant differences between the participants&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; self-reported neighborhood racial composition and census data across race and ethnicity groups. Future studies are needed to validate self-reported measures of individuals&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; perceptions of the racial and ethnic composition of their communities to examine the association between individual segregation experience and health.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
