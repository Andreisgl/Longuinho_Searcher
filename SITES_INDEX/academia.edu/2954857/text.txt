We shall do this by examining federal intervention in three states which have had a notable history of confrontations with Kuala Lumpur: Kelantan in Peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. Although the centre-state relationships of these states can be considered exceptions to the norm, some general conclusions about the types of federal interventions can be learnt from their experiences.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCentralised Federalism in Malaysia (book chapter)Chin-Huat Wong 黄进发Download Free PDFView PDFA 'New Sabah' and the spell of development': resolving federal-state relations in MalaysiaFrancis Kok Wah LohDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Southeast Asian StudiesSabah Politics Under Pairin2013 • Mohammad Agus YusoffThis paper will examine the political events and issues that led to the deterioration of the relations between Kuala Lumpur and the state of Sabah after it came under PBS control in April 1985. In so doing, it will firstly examine the causes of Berjaya's disastrous performance in the 1985 state elections and the reactions of the federal leaders when the Berjaya party they supported lost power so dramatically. Secondly, it will discuss the development of centre-state relations during the period from 1986 to 1990, when PBS was not in opposition to the centre (as it joined the BN immediately after the 1986 elections). I will then analyse the Sabah state elections in May 1990 and the development of Sabah politics in their aftermath-particularly in the light of the defection of the PBS from the ruling BN coalition the following October at a highly sensitive stage during the 1990 federal parliamentary election campaign.Download Free PDFView PDFDemocratizationMalaysia towards a topology of an electoral one-party state2010 • Chin-Huat Wong 黄进发Download Free PDFView PDFAsian forms of the nationNations-of-intent in Malaysia1996 • Shamsul ABDownload Free PDFView PDFRound TableThe Rise, Resilience and Demise of Malaysia’s Dominant Coalition2018 • Chin-Huat Wong 黄进发In May 2018, Malaysia’s Barisan Nasional (BN) lost power for the first time since the country’s independence. Although the opposition finally succeeded in assuming the reins of government after three failed attempts since 1990, the aspired for ‘two-coalition system’ did not emerge. Like previous opposition coalitions that disintegrated after electoral defeat, BN is fast melting down and is now reduced to a rump of its Malay nationalist core, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Officially born in 1974, BN was expanded from its centrist forerunner Alliance, which suffered an electoral setback in 1969 under centrifugal competition. As a permanent grand coalition designed to contain opposition, BN had resiliently survived on a crafty manipulation of communal anxieties of ethnic Malays and Chinese. As unintended consequences, BN had, however, radicalised opposition in first-past-the-post elections and become vulnerable to implosion after electoral landslides. Pakatan Harapan now seemingly emerges as the new dominant coalition, with centrifugal competition from ethno-religious and regional-nationalists.

In the 2013 election, the component parties of BN in the state delivered a substantial number of parliamentary seats and helped the BN hold the government, despite losing the national popular vote. This paper argues that the changing political dynamics in Sabah will not have a significant impact on the Malaysian political landscape. The paper will examine the socio-political history of Sabah and analyse the impact of this history on contemporary Sabah politics. Further, the paper will study recent political developments, such as the Lahad Datu incursion and the issue of illegal immigrants in Sabah, and how these developments will shape the political landscapes of both Sabah and the larger state. The paper concludes by drawing a trajectory of Sabah's politics. It is concluded that despite Sabah's growing political importance for the BN, the political developments in Sabah will not significantly alter the landscape of Malaysian politics and that Sabah as a state will remain marginal in the larger context of Malaysian politicsDownload Free PDFView PDFMalaysia: From Political Ferment to Restructuring FederalismFrancis Kok Wah LohIn Klaus Detterbeck, Wolfgang Renzsch and John Kincaid (eds) Political Parties and Civil Society in Federal Countries, Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2015, chapter 6, pp 147-170Download Free PDFView PDF2013 “The New Economic Policy and the identity Question of the Indigenous Peoples of  Sabah and Sarawak”.

Defined by its inter-disciplinarity and covering the fields of urban studies, political economy, international relations, political sociology and anthropology, film studies, literature, law and strategic studies, Misplaced Democracy is a path-breaking analysis of Malaysian politics and society during a period of contestation in which many Malaysians seek to re-orient the flow of history which has been going in favour of the ruling party since the country's independence. What is at stake here is the nature of Malaysian democracy itself. Covering topics as diverse as Syariah family law, muslim student activism, connivance militancy, maritime piracy and ownership of Malaysia's corporate sector, Misplaced Democracy seeks to untangle the complexities of contemporary Malaysian politics and society and, through original and unique analyses, tries to unveil the many realities of an emerging democracy embedded in authoritarian practices and rules, describe its ambiguities and its strengths, and contribute to the reinvention of Malaysia.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
