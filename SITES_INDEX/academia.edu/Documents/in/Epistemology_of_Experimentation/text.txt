Digital technologies have effected a process of redistribution of social science research by which non-experts and lay people are increasingly using and developing tools for the production of sociological knowledge. Under these circumstances we argue that such a redistribution of social science research is an opportunity to renew the epistemic practices of social scientists. With the proposal of experimental collaborations we invoke a twofold displacement for social research: From a merely observational to an experimental mode or research; and from individualistic or merely engaged conceptions of research to a collective exploration of problems yet unknown.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adolfo Estalella•  4  Social Research Methods and Methodology, Collaboration, Experimentation (Anthropology of Science), Epistemology of ExperimentationUne critique pragmatiste de l’expérimentation.

Les auteurs partent d’une typologie des modes d’expérimentation pour privilégier un « expérimentalisme profond », associé au pragmatisme philosophique de Dewey et à la sociologie écologique de Park. Ils entreprennent alors un récit autocritique du Metrolab, un laboratoire de recherche urbaine, interdisciplinaire et appliquée, installé à Bruxelles. En examinant les pratiques d’expérimentation qui en ont jalonné l’expérience, ils rendent comptede certaines situations problématiques, à différentes phases du projet, qui ont entravé l’enquête et éloigné les chercheurs de leur ligne pragmatiste. À la lumière de ce parcours fait de revers, qui illustre les difficultés d’une application pratique de l’expérimentalisme deweyen,les auteurs concluent par l’esquisse d’une critique expérimentale du pragmatisme. Ils visent ici en particulier une rhétorique de l’action présente chez Dewey, et amplifiée par certains commentaires, qui conçoit sur un mode majeur tant les situations problématiques soumises à l’enquête, que ses possibles effets pratiques. À distance de ce pragmatisme héroïque, les auteurs défendent un pragmatisme modeste, dont l’enquête s’accommode du caractère parfois mineur des troubles qui la suscitentet du caractère indirect, différé et imprévisible de ses conséquences pratiques.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mathieu Berger•  11  Pragmatism, Applied Research, John Dewey, Urban SociologyGoethe, anotaciones sobre la planta originariaPlaquette que reúne tres textos en los que el autor alemán reflexiona sobre la observación científica y la dimensión creativa de la experimentación.

The importance of exploration to science has recently been emphasized by a number of historians and philosophers of science writing on scientific experimentation, and the chapter begins by reviewing this lively debate. Following a clarification of the meaning of ‘exploration’ by distinguishing between a ‘convergent’ and a ‘divergent’ sense, the concept is then applied to the case of scientific models. In particular, four different functions of exploratory models are distinguished: they may function as a starting point for future inquiry, feature in proof-of-principle demonstrations, generate potential explanations of observed (types of) phenomena, and may lead to reassessments of the suitability of the target. These functions are neither mutually exclusive, nor are they thought to exhaust the spectrum of possible exploratory uses to which models may be put. Examples for each of the four types of exploratory uses are provided and range from models in sociodynamics (traffic flow models) to proposed mechanisms of molecular rearrangements in physical organic chemistry. The chapter closes with a discussion of the prospects and limitations of exploratory modeling and concludes that exploration deserves a place alongside explanation and prediction as one of the core functions of scientific modeling.Save to LibraryDownloadby Axel Gelfert•  13  Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Biology, Physical Organic Chemistry, Modeling and SimulationJudging Mechanistic Neuroscience: A preliminary conceptual-analytic framework for evaluating scientific evidence in the courtroomThe use of neuroscientific evidence in criminal trials has been steadily increasing.

Despite progress made in recent decades in understanding the mechanisms of psychological and behavioral functioning, neuroscience is still in an early stage of development and its potential for influencing legal decision-making is highly contentious. Scholars disagree about whether or how neuroscientific evidence might impact prescriptions of criminal culpability, particularly in instances in which evidence of an accused’s history of mental illness or brain abnormality is offered to support a plea of not criminally responsible. In the context of these debates, philosophers and legal scholars have identified numerous problems with admitting neuroscientific evidence in legal contexts. To date, however, less has been said about the challenges of evaluating the evidence upon which integrative mechanistic explanations that bring together evidence from different areas of neuroscience are based. As we explain, current criteria for evaluating such evidence to determine its admissibility in legal contexts are inadequate. Appealing to literature in the philosophy of scientific experimentation and theoretical work in the social, cognitive and behavioral sciences, we lay the groundwork for reforming these criteria and identify some of the implications of modifying them.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan and +1Emily Baron•  6  Criminal Law, Criminal Justice, Philosophy Of Law, Epistemology of Experimentation"Le dialogue entre science et foi à l’épreuve de l’observation et de l’expérimentation"Save to LibraryDownloadby Philippe Gagnon•  5  Cosmology (Physics), Research Methodology, Theology and Science, Epistemology of ExperimentationMaking Social Psychology Experimental: A Conceptual History, 1920-1970 (2000)Making social psychology experimental: A conceptual history, 1920-1970.

Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 2000, 36, 329-347.Abstract: The historical emergence of a ﬁeld devoted to the experimental investigation of effects identiﬁed as “social” required a radical break with traditional conceptions of the social. Psychological experimentation was limited to the investigation of effects that were proximal, local, short-term, and decomposable. A viable accommodation to these constraints occurred in the closely related programs of Moede’s experimental crowd psychology and Floyd Allport’s experimental social psychology. Later, Kurt Lewin attempted to provide a different conceptual foundation for the ﬁeld by drawing on certain precepts of Gestalt psychology and the philosophy of scientiﬁc experimentation developed by Ernst Cassirer. These ideas were poorly understood and were soon replaced by a methodological regime in which a new generation of statistical procedures and experimental design shaped implicit conceptions of the social in social psychological experiments through such procedures as randomization and the additive combination of variables.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kurt Danziger•  3  History of Social Psychology, History Of Psychology, Epistemology of ExperimentationA role for representation in cognitive neurobiologySave to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan•  2  Epistemology of Experimentation, Philosophy of NeuroscienceHeuristics versus norms: On the relativistic responses to the Kaufmann experimentsThe aim of this article is to provide a historical response to Michel Janssen's (2009) claim that the special theory of relativity establishes that relativistic phenomena are purely kinematical in nature, and that the relativistic study... moreThe aim of this article is to provide a historical response to Michel Janssen's (2009) claim that the special theory of relativity establishes that relativistic phenomena are purely kinematical in nature, and that the relativistic study of such phenomena is completely independent of dynamical considerations regarding the systems displaying such behavior. This response will be formulated through a historical discussion of one of Janssen's cases, the experiments carried out by Walter Kaufmann on the velocity-dependence of the electron's mass. Through a discussion of the different responses formulated by early adherents of the principle of relativity (Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and Max von Laue) to these experiments, it will be argued that the historical development of the special theory of relativity argues against Janssen's historical presentation of the case, and that this raises questions about his general philosophical claim. It will be shown, more specifically, that Planck and Einstein developed a relativistic response to the Kaufmann experiments on the basis of their study of the dynamics of radiation phenomena , and that this response differed significantly from the response formulated by Minkowski and Laue. In this way, it will be argued that there were, at the time, two different approaches to the theory of relativity, which differed with respect to its relation to theory, experiment, and history: Einstein's and Planck's heuristic approach, and Minkowski's and Laue's normative approach. This indicates that it is difficult to say, historically speaking, that the special theory of relativity establishes the kinematical nature of particular phenomena. Instead, it will be argued that the theory of relativity should not be seen as a theory but rather as outlining an approach, and that the nature of particular scientific phenomena is something that is open to scientific debate and dispute.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jan Potters•  4  Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Physics, History and Philosophy of Physics, Epistemology of ExperimentationSensible Atoms: A Techno-aesthetic Approach to RepresentationThis essay argues that nano-images would be best understood with an aesthetical approach rather than with an epistemological critique.

For this aim, I propose a ‘techno-aesthetical’ approach: an enquiry into the way instruments and machines transform the logic of the sensible itself and not just the way by which it represents something else. Unlike critical epistemology, which remains self-evidently grounded on a representationalist philosophy, the approach developed here presents the advantage of providing a clear-cut distinction between image-as-representation and other modes of existence of images, such as the one of ‘imaginaction’ that I draw from a comparison between far-field and near-field microscopies. Once this regime of imaginaction is distinguished from representation, I focus on nanotechnological percepts and argue that they follow a transmodal logic. I then draw the implications of this enquiry in terms of a new sensible condition that changes the way we think of non-living objects. Finally, I conclude that if techno-aesthetics dares to posit and articulate sensibility beyond the privileged sphere of subject/object relationships, it simultaneously engages us to consider the political character of our responsibilities towards the design of nano-engineered sensorial spaces.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sacha  Loeve•  15  Aesthetics, Gilbert Simondon, Gilles Deleuze, Henri BergsonExperimentation and the Meaning of Scientific ConceptsSave to LibraryDownloadby Theodore  Arabatzis•  5  Theories of Meaning, Conceptual change, History of concepts, Conceptual HistoryVitalism and the resistance to experimentation on life in the eighteenth century  There is a familiar opposition between a ‘Scientific Revolution’ ethos and practice of experimentation, including experimentation on life, and a ‘vitalist’ reaction to this outlook.

The former is often allied with different forms of mechanism – if all of Nature obeys mechanical laws, including living bodies, ‘iatromechanism’ should encounter no obstructions in investigating the particularities of animal-machines – or with more chimiatric theories of life and matter, as in the ‘Oxford Physiologists’. The latter reaction also comes in different, perhaps irreducibly heterogeneous forms, ranging from metaphysical and ethical objections to the destruction of life, as in Margaret Cavendish, to more epistemological objections against the usage of instruments, the ‘anatomical’ outlook and experimentation, e.g. in Locke and Sydenham. But I will mainly focus on a third anti-interventionist argument, which I call ‘vitalist’ since it is often articulated in the writings of the so-called Montpellier Vitalists, including their medical articles for the Encyclopédie. The vitalist argument against experimentation on life is subtly different from the metaphysical, ethical and epistemological arguments, although at times it may borrow from any of them. It expresses a Hippocratic sensibility – understood as an artifact of early modernity, not as some atemporal trait of medical thought – in which Life resists the experimenter, or conversely, for the experimenter to grasp something about Life, it will have to be without torturing or radically intervening in it. I suggest that this view does not have to imply that Nature is something mysterious or sacred; nor does the vitalist have to attack experimentation on life in the name of some ‘vital force’ – which makes it less surprising to find a vivisectionist like Claude Bernard sounding so close to the vitalists.Save to LibraryDownloadby Charles Wolfe•  6  History of Medicine, History and Philosophy of Biology, Intellectual History of Enlightenment, Epistemology of ExperimentationLes formes religieuses de la recherche expérimentale: Expérimenter et croire dans la science anglaise du XVIIe sièclePublié dans l'ouvrage "Science et religion", sous la direction de Claude Dargent, Yannick Fer et Raphaël Liogier, CNRS Éditions, 2017.Save to LibraryDownloadby Laetitia Ogorzelec•  21  Religion, History, Sociology, Sociology of ReligionCall for papers: Knowing by SingingCan song be a way of knowing for anthropologists, rather than an ethnographic object?

In this article I will contribute to his research by means of a discussion of one very famous example of case-based philosophy of science, namely the debate on the London & London model of superconductivity between Cartwright, Suárez and Shomar on the one hand, and French, Ladyman, Bueno and Da Costa on the other. This debate has been going on for years, without any satisfactory resolution. I will argue here that this is because both sides impose on the historical case a particular philosophical conception of scientific representation that does not do justice to the historical facts. Both sides assume, more specifically, that the case concerns the discovery of a representational connection between a given experimental insight-the Meissner effect-and the diamagnetic meaning of London and London's new equations of superconductivity. I will show, however, that at the time of the Londons' publication, neither the experimental insight nor the meaning of the new equations was established: both were open 2 Jan Potters for discussion and they were stabilized only later. On the basis of this historical discussion, I will then propose an alternative approach to the case study: the case should not be seen as a site of confrontation between pre-existing philosophical accounts, but rather as a way to historically elaborate and develop philosophical concepts. I will then show how approaching the historical episode in this way suggests an alternative approach to the philosophical study of representation, according to which it involves the establishment, over time, of a stable connection between constellations of different elements that, through discussion and engagement with alternative views and approaches, come to constitute phenomenon and meaning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jan Potters•  4  Philosophy of Science, History of Science, History and Philosophy of Physics, Epistemology of ExperimentationNeuroscientific Kinds Through the Lens of Scientific PracticeSave to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan•  3  Natural Kinds, Epistemology of Experimentation, Philosophy of NeuroscienceExperimenting with the concept of experimentSave to LibraryDownloadby Astrid Schwarz•  2  Philosophy of Science, Epistemology of ExperimentationReconsidering 'spatial memory'and the Morris water mazeSave to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan•  3  Learning & Memory, Epistemology of Experimentation, Philosophy of NeuroscienceScientific models, simulation, and the experimenter’s regressAccording to the "experimenter's regress", disputes about the validity of experimental results cannot be closed by objective facts because no conclusive criteria other than the outcome of the experiment itself exist for deciding whether... moreAccording to the "experimenter's regress", disputes about the validity of experimental results cannot be closed by objective facts because no conclusive criteria other than the outcome of the experiment itself exist for deciding whether the experimental apparatus was functioning properly or not. Given the frequent characterization of simulations as "computer experiments", one might worry that an analogous regress arises for computer simulations. The present paper analyzes the most likely scenarios where one might expect such a "simulationist's regress" to surface, and, in doing so, discusses analogies and disanalogies between simulation and experimentation. I conclude that, on a properly broadened understanding of robustness, the practice of simulating mathematical models can be seen to have sufficient internal structure to avoid any special susceptibility to regress-like situations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Axel Gelfert•  10  Philosophy of Science, Sociology Of Scientific Knowledge, Modeling and Simulation, Epistemology of ExperimentationOptogenetics, Pluralism and ProgressOptogenetic techniques are described as " revolutionary " for the unprecedented causal control they allow neuroscientists to exert over neural activity in awake behaving animals.

In this paper, I demonstrate by means of a case study that optogenetic techniques will only illuminate causal links between the brain and behavior to the extent that their error characteristics are known and, further, that determining these error characteristics requires (1) comparison of optogenetic techniques with techniques having well known error characteristics (methodological pluralism) and (2) consideration of the broader neural and behavioral context in which the targets of optogenetic interventions are situated (perspectival pluralism).Save to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan•  6  Philosophy of Science, Epistemology of Experimentation, Philosophy of Neuroscience, OptogeneticsThe Functional Complexity of Scientific EvidenceI sketch the main features of traditional philosophical models of evidence, indicating idealizations in such models that I regard as doing more harm than good.

I then proceed to elaborate on an alternative model of evidence that is functionalist, complex, dynamic, and contextual, a view I call dynamic evidential functionalism (DEF). This alternative builds on insights from philosophy of scientific practice, Kuhnian philosophy of science, pragmatist epistemology, philosophy of experimentation, and functionalist philosophy of mind. Along the way, I raise concerns about the total evidence condition, requirements of certainty or incorrigibility on evidence, and accounts that restrict the type of things that can serve as evidence (to, e.g., sense-data, facts about particulars). DEF can also help us see the special value of novel predictions and experiments as evidence, as well as help us think about how to critically evaluate the putative evidence to determine wither it is evidence.Save to LibraryDownloadby Matthew J.

I argue that two-variable experiments, where both the initial conditions and a component postulated by the mechanism are simultaneously manipulated on an independent basis, are usually required in order to differentiate between correlating or causally relevant factors and constitutively relevant ones.

In the following paper, we show that these components may be part of the intrinsic capacities of experimental systems themselves. We study a case of non-exploratory and theory-oriented research in experimental neuroscience that concerns the construction of free-viewing as an experimental system to test one particular pre-existing hypothesis, the Temporal Correlation Hypothesis (TCH), at a laboratory in Santiago de Chile, during 2002-2008. We show that the system does not take well-formulated pre-existing predictions or hypotheses to test them directly, but re-creates them and re-signifies them in terms that are not implied by the theoretical background from which they originally derived. Therefore, we conclude that there is a sui generis way in which experimental systems produce proper theoretical knowledge.Save to Libraryby Nicolás Alejandro  Trujillo Osorio•  16  Computer Science, Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, Epistemology of ExperimentationAre there model behaviours for model organism research?Save to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan•  3  Model organisms, Epistemology of Experimentation, Animal ExperimentationReconsidering ‘spatial memory’ and the Morris water mazeSave to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Sullivan•  17  Philosophy, Spatial Memory, Cognition, Epistemology of ExperimentationRelated TopicsEnseñanza de la EcologíaFollowFollowingHistory and Philosophy of ChemistryFollowFollowingSCIENCE TEACHINGFollowFollowingInterdisciplinary Higher EducationFollowFollowingHistory of Philosophy of ScienceFollowFollowingPhilosophy of PsychologyFollowFollowingPhilosophy of MindFollowFollowingPhilosophy of NeuroscienceFollowFollowingPhilosophy of ChemistryFollowFollowingHistory of ExperimentationFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
