Baldisseri2004, Physical Review CThe PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured charged hadron yields at mid-rapidity over a wide range of transverse momentum (0.5 < p T < 10 GeV/c) in Au − Au collisions at √ s N N = 200 GeV.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPhysical Review CHigh pT charged hadron suppression in Au+Au collisions at &surd;(sNN )=200 GeV2004 • Meiji PTThe PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured charged hadron yields at midrapidity over a wide range of transverse momenta ( 0.5< pT <10 GeV/c ) in Au+Au collisions at √(sNN )=200 GeV . The data are compared to π0 measurements from the same experiment. For both charged hadrons and neutral pions, the yields per nucleon-nucleon collision are significantly suppressed in central compared to peripheral and nucleon-nucleon collisions. The suppression sets in gradually and increases with increasing centrality of the collisions. Above 4 5 GeV/c in pT , a constant and almost identical suppression of charged hadrons and π0 ’s is observed. The pT spectra are compared to published spectra from Au+Au at √(sNN )=130 in terms of xT scaling. Central and peripheral π0 as well as peripheral charged spectra exhibit the same xT scaling as observed in p+p data.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CHeavy-quark production in p + p and energy loss and flow of heavy quarks in Au + Au collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=200 GeV2011 • Xiaochun He, A.

InabaDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CSingle identified hadron spectra from sNN=130GeV Au+Au collisions2004 • Wen UosTransverse momentum spectra and yields of hadrons are measured by the PHENIX collaboration in Au + Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 130 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The time-of-flight resolution allows identification of pions to transverse momenta of 2 GeV/c and protons and antiprotons to 4 GeV/c. The yield of pions rises approximately linearly with the number of nucleons participating in the collision, while the number of kaons, protons, and antiprotons increases more rapidly. The shape of the momentum distribution changes between peripheral and central collisions. Simultaneous analysis of all the p_T spectra indicates radial collective expansion, consistent with predictions of hydrodynamic models. Hydrodynamic analysis of the spectra shows that the expansion velocity increases with collision centrality and collision energy. This expansion boosts the particle momenta, causing the yield from soft processes to exceed that for hard to large transverse momentum, perhaps as large as 3 GeV/c.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review LettersCentrality Dependence of Direct Photon Production in &surd;(SNN)=200 GeV Au+Au Collisions2005 • Chi Ra Ya SantosThe first measurement of direct photons in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV is presented.
