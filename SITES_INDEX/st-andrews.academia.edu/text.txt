Its author, Sir Kenneth Dover, whose academic publications included the pathbreaking book Greek Homosexuality, conceived of it as an 'experimental' autobiography-unflinching in its attempt to analyse the entanglements between the life of the mind and the life of the body. Dover's distinguished career involved influential writings, prominent positions of leadership, and several high-profile controversies, including the blocking of an honorary degree for Margaret Thatcher from Oxford University, and a bitter debate in the British Academy over the fellowship of Anthony Blunt after his exposure as a former Soviet spy. This edition of Marginal Comment is much more than a reprint: it includes a substantial introduction by Stephen Halliwell which discusses both the book's genesis and its controversial reception, as well as numerous annotations based in part on materials originally excluded by Dover but left in his personal papers at his death. Now newly available, the memoir provides a rich case-study in the intersections between an intellectual life and its social contexts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sul Sublime, a cura di S. Halliwell, con un saggio di M. Fusillo, traduzione di L. Lulli,  Milano 2021by Laura Lulli, Stephen  Halliwell, and Massimo Fusillo"Sul Sublime", a cura di S.

Lulli,  Milano 2021,  2021I cavalli degli dèi balzano in aria d’un colpo quanto lontano abbraccia con gli occhi un uomo che... more I cavalli degli dèi balzano in aria d’un colpo quanto lontano abbraccia con gli occhi un uomo che da un’altura scruta il mare colore del vino: Omero, nel­l’Iliade, misura «il loro slancio su distanze rapportate all’universo intero», e se quei cavalli saltassero due volte non ci sarebbe più spazio al mondo. Nell’Odissea quello stesso Omero, ora vecchio, è come un sole al tramonto, «simile all’Oceano che retrocede in sé stesso e si isola nei propri confini». L’Iliade è capace di rappresentare il divino come grande, immacolato, puro. Allo stesso modo il libro biblico della Genesi, raccontando «Dio disse: sia la luce. E la luce fu», fa mostra della medesima sublime potenza. Chi parla così è l’autore, al quale non riusciamo a dare un nome, del breve trattato Sul sublime, quello che, dopo la Poetica di Aristotele, ha conosciuto maggior fortu﻿na nella cultura occidentale; colui che ha consacrato per sempre la nozione di tutto ciò che è elevato, possente di sentimento, agonistico, vibrante nel cuore stesso degli esseri umani, e nella letteratura: nell’epica, nella tragedia, nella lirica, nell’oratoria – in Omero, Saffo, Sofocle, Platone, Demostene. «Una sorta di apice e perfezione dei discorsi», e «un punto di partenza grazie a cui i massimi poeti e prosatori primeggiarono e abbracciarono l’eternità con la loro fama», ecco cos’è il sublime per questo scrittore: il quale sostiene altresì che sua caratteristica precipua è l’appagare il pubblico «con la sensazione che gli ascoltatori stessi abbiano creato quello che hanno ascoltato», perché il sublime predispone alla grandezza del pensiero e richiede, ma anche restituisce, una «contemplazione reiterata». La Fondazione Valla ha affidato la cura dello scritto Sul sublime al maggiore studioso del campo, Stephen Halliwell, il quale ha composto una introduzione e un commento che faranno scuola. Lo affianca Massimo Fusillo, redigendo un saggio ispirato che racconta, in parole e immagini, l’eredità del sublime attraverso i due millenni successivi: dal Medioevo al Rinascimen­ to, da Burke a Kant, da Coleridge a Shelley, da Caspar David Friedrich a Turner, sino alle «epifanie moderni­ste» e alle «contaminazioni postmoderne».

S. Halliwell and C. Stray] supplements the book’s treatments of Dover’s substantive scholarship, as well as the biographically orientated pieces, by examining how his intellectual values informed his conception of Classics (especially the Greek half of the subject) as a discipline. It offers close readings of four pieces which Dover wrote for, roughly speaking, non-specialist audiences: his 1976 Presidential Address to the Classical Association; a 1979 lecture (published in 1984, and overlapping with material in his book The Greeks) to the 7th congress of FIEC (International Federation of Associations of Classical Studies) in Budapest; a 1985 lecture entitled ‘What are the “Two Cultures”?’; and a short article from 1988 in an Italian magazine, L’humana avventura (this last piece is translated in an appendix to his chapter). Among the strands of thought drawn out from these publications are Dover’s life-long rejection of many standard ‘defences’ and educational-cum-cultural justifications of Classics (especially those which posit the supposed uniqueness of Greco-Roman civilisation, its special status as the ‘origin’ of the modern West, the canonical standing of its literature, and its value as the basis of a normative humanism) and his replacement of these by a conception of ‘history’ which embraces all the main intellectual activities of the humanities. On the basis of this conception of history, which he thought of as anthropologically inflected, Dover maintained that there is ‘smooth continuity’ between past and present, allowing the present to learn from the past even across gulfs of time. The chapter carefully explores the ramifications of these and related convictions of Dover’s.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Aesthetics [Author's typescript]Oxford Classical Dictionary [5th edition, online],  2023The nature and scope of aesthetics have been a subject of debate ever since the eighteenthcentury... more The nature and scope of aesthetics have been a subject of debate ever since the eighteenthcentury coinage of the term. Application of aesthetics as a theoretical or experiential category to the study of earlier periods therefore needs to be dialectical and pluralistic. But the contribution made by Greco-Roman antiquity to the evolution of ideas such as beauty, creative inspiration, and sublimity is indisputable; it reaches back to issues and values already salient in the pre-philosophical culture of archaic Greece, many of them associated with the uniquely Greek symbolism of the Muses. The early Greek association between song, music, and dance was consolidated and expanded, first by intermedial comparisons and subsequently by the concept of mimesis, into a standard grouping of the 'mimetic arts' which bracketed musico-poetic forms together with visual forms of artistic representation and expression. It was this cluster of activities which provided a frame of reference for philosophical theorizing. In Plato, representational and figurative art-forms are seen as carrying great cultural and psychological power, but consequently as in need of educational and political control in an ideal society. Aristotle moves nearer to a recognition of a qualified degree of aesthetic autonomy, while stressing the cognitive and emotional aspects of responses to mimetic art. In Hellenistic philosophy, Stoicism regarded the whole cosmos as imbued with divinely sustained and quasi-moral beauty, while Epicureanism's simplified standards of pleasure narrowed the valuation of mimetic art. [Longinus], On the Sublime is a prime instance of the way that new thinking could emerge from modifications of older ideas; its own model of creativity entails rivalrous emulation between present and past writers. Plotinus's Enneads offers a revaluation of mimetic art through an intellectualized conception of beauty whose influence can be seen at work in Renaissance aesthetics and beyond.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

After some preliminary remarks on the intricate implications of the Republic’s Cave allegory in this respect, I focus first on difficulties of interpretation raised by mimesis vocabulary in the Sophist, including the much-discussed dichotomy of eikastikê and phantastikê, whose complications make it a provisional and ultimately discarded attempt to distinguish between reliable and unreliable forms of representation. In the Republic, the semantics of mimesis expand and contract according to the needs of different stages of the argument, as well as shifting between negative and positive evaluations. Part of my analysis concerns the Republic’s series of comparisons between philosophers and painters, comparisons which are at odds with Socrates’ reductive treatment of painting in Book 10. The Sophist calls mimesis a ‘multifarious class’ of entities: no single argument in Plato supplies a definitive way of theorising its conceptual ramifications; we should abandon talk of ‘Plato’s doctrine’ of mimesis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Pavlou (Leiden, Brill),  2020This paper approaches the subject of Platonic beginnings and endings primarily from the perspecti... more This paper approaches the subject of Platonic beginnings and endings primarily from the perspective of the Phaedrus, the only dialogue in which questions of discursive form and unity, including the function of beginnings and endings, provide part of the work’s own theoretical subject-matter. After noting some neglected evidence for ancient sensitivity to the philosophical symbolism of the very first words of the Phaedrus, I offer selective observations on how the beginnings and endings of the dialogues are notable in general for their avoidance of strongly closed form and instead frequently dramatise a kind of tension between the contingency of life and the hoped for determinacy of philosophy. I then examine in detail the way in which the beginnings and endings of the dialogue’s own three set-piece logoi are drawn into a larger discussion of discursive form, including Socrates’ remarks on the desirable ‘organic unity’ of a good logos. But I reject the almost universal assumption that we can extract from the Phaedrus a definitive set of principles of discursive form which can be directly applied to the practices of Plato’s dialogues themselves. Platonic writing manifests a complexity which exceeds Socrates’ theorisation of discursive form in the Phaedrus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Justifying the world as an aesthetic phenomenon [AUTHOR'S FINAL MS: published in Cambridge Classical Journal 64 (2018) 91-112]This article scrutinises one of the most challenging theses of Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, that... more This article scrutinises one of the most challenging theses of Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, that only as an aesthetic phenomenon can existence and the world be (or appear to be) 'justified'. Through a close examination of the work's frequently masked revaluation of a series of Greek sources of thinking, not least its 'inversion' of both the metaphysics and the aesthetics of Plato's Republic, the article shows how the thesis of aesthetic 'justification' is caught up in a tension between Apolline and Dionysian interpretations, the first entailing a quasi-Homeric sense that the Olympians justify human existence by living a transfigured form of it themselves, the second involving a tragic insight into reality as itself the creative work of a 'world-artist', the latter allusively associated by Nietzsche with the philosophy of Heraclitus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Imagining Divine Laughter in Homer and Lucian [AUTHOR'S FINAL MS]M. Alexiou and D. Cairns, eds., Greek Laughter and Tears: Antiquity and After (Edinburgh University Press).,  2017This paper employs a historicising approach to laughter, of the kind elaborated more fully in my ... more This paper employs a historicising approach to laughter, of the kind elaborated more fully in my book Greek Laughter: a Study of Cultural Psychology from Homer to Early Christianity (2008), in order to investigate some important but elusive aspects of the Greek mythico-religious imagination. My central focus is on depictions of divine laughter at opposite ends of the spectrum of ancient Greek culture, in Homeric epic and Lucianic satire. What does it mean to imagine gods who can laugh at and/or with one another, as well as at and/or with humans? Is such laughter a marker of distance between divine and human conditions of existence, or does the idea of laughter serve to limit the gods by subjecting them to inescapably human evaluation? I reject models of explanation (both ancient and modern) which treat the laughter of the Olympians either as a contamination of an originally purer conception of the gods or as consistently expressing a serenely detached state of immortality. I argue, instead, that divine laughter reflects tensions between the literal and the symbolic which are intrinsic to anthropomorphising Greek religious sensibilities, and that far from conveying blissful detachment divine laughter characterises gods who are heavily invested in the conflicts of the human world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Could/did Aristotle himself conceive of something like 'literary history'? If he had, would it have involved modifications to what are widely taken to be his own restrictions on the nature of history as an intellectual practice?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Julia Pfefferkorn, Antonino Spinelli (eds.): Platonic Mimesis Revisited. Baden-Baden: Academia 2021 (= International Plato Studies, vol. 40).by Julia Pfefferkorn, Antonino  Spinelli, Stephen  Halliwell, Irmgard Männlein-Robert, Lidia Palumbo, Francesco Fronterotta, Laura Candiotto, Anna Pavani, and Jose Antonio GimenezFew other semantic fields pervade Plato’s oeuvre, from the earliest to the latest works, in such ... more Few other semantic fields pervade Plato’s oeuvre, from the earliest to the latest works, in such a definitive and ambivalent way as that of mimesis. From the philosophy of language to aesthetics and moral psychology, from metaphysics to cosmology and theology: in a strikingly large array of philosophical subject areas, the semantics of mimesis have crucial significance in Plato. The conference volume “Platonic Mimesis Revisited” offers a comprehensive and context-sensitive re-examination of mimesis in all relevant dialogues. Unlike earlier monographic studies, it brings together a considerable variety of scholarly perspectives from Philosophy and Classics, thus providing a broad tableau of modern approaches to the topic. Reviewed by Lloyd Gerson in BMCR 2022.06.09: "As Pfefferkorn and Spinelli note in their introduction, a central aim of this collection is to broaden the study of imitation in Plato beyond aesthetic questions. Indeed, one way that this book succeeds, in my view, is by showing how even aesthetic questions, including those relating to music, painting, theatre, and dance, for example, cannot be effectively addressed in regard to Plato without reference to the widest possible metaphysical context. [...] All of the essays [...] taken together, bring into focus a concept, that of mimesis, that one might have supposed is not as central as it in fact is in the dialogues."https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2022/2022.06.09/Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
"Diegesis - Mimesis" — Stephen Halliwell  (çev. Melike Saba Akım)by Stephen  Halliwell and Melike Saba AkımARTS: Artuklu Sanat ve Beşeri Bilimler Dergisi,  2022Bu makale, Stephen Halliwell'in The Living Handbook of Narratology'de yer alan 2014 tarihli "Dieg... more Bu makale, Stephen Halliwell'in The Living Handbook of Narratology'de yer alan 2014 tarihli "Diegesis-Mimesis" isimli makalesinin Türkçe çevirisidir. Anlatıbilim alanının anlatmak/göstermek (telling/ showing) olarak karşıladığı diegesis/mimesis terimleri ilk kez Platon'un Devlet'indeki bir pasajda bir arada kullanılmıştır. Sonrasında Aristoteles, Poetika adlı eserinde terimleri kendi bağlamınca yeniden kullanır; fakat bu kullanım kimi noktalarda Platoncu izler taşıyor olmakla birlikte, kimi bakımlardan münferit yeni bağlamlarıyla Devlet'deki kullanımdan ayrışır. Günümüzde bu dikotomi, anlatıbilim alanının tayin ettiği dar karşılıklarıyla dolayıma girmiştir. Öte yandan Platon'un Devlet'i referans alındığında Sokrates tarafından çizilen temel ayrımın standart modern kullanımdaki gibi tümüyle "göstermek" ve "anlatmak" arasında olmadığı görülmektedir. Dahası, Antik Çağ'daki bu ilk kullanımlarından itibaren, eleştirel düzlemde kategorik bir çift olarak terimlerin uzun ve kimi zaman ziyadesiyle karmaşık kullanımlarının tarihi, günümüze kadar uzanmaktadır. Bu makalede Stephen Halliwell, söz konusu bu karmaşayı, Sokrates'in görüşlerinin aktarıldığı/yorumlandığı Platon'un Devlet'ine ve Aristoteles'in Poetika'sına odaklanarak ortaya koymakta, terimlerin Orta Çağ ve Rönesans'taki kullanımlarına değinmekte, modern anlatıbiliminin indirgemeci kategorizasyonu kaynaklı açmazlara dikkat çekmekte, ve son olarak, konu üzerine çalışmak isteyen araştırmacılara alanda gördüğü boşlukları işaret etmektedir.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
