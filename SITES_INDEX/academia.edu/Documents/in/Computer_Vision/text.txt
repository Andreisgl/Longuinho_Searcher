This includes making sure that technology is readily available and accessible to as large of a population as possible. Current consumer virtual reality (VR) headsets typically utilize two controllers to navigate a virtual environment, leading to accessibility issues for potential users that cannot effectively operate a controller. We propose NaVRgate, a proof of concept idea that removes the need for controllers in which a user uses expressions to navigate a virtual environment. The system utilizes the computer webcam and computer vision face and eye position tracking to capture the nature of expression tracking, with certain positional thresholds representing different facial expressions. To test this system, We design a game environment where a user navigates with either a controller or the face position tracker, collecting a set of orbs scattered around the map as quickly as they can, comparing the efficiency between navigation through the novel computer vision and traditional controller methods. Users are also questioned on the difficulty of use and experience with each control input method. This paper details the process of the development and drafts, to the statistical experiment constructed to determine the efficiency of head gestures.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shreyas Rana•  12  Computer Science, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, Machine LearningA Review of Visual Descriptors and Classification Techniques Used in Leaf Species IdentificationPlants are fundamentally important to life.

Key research areas in plant science include plant species identification, weed classification using hyper spectral images, monitoring plant health and tracing leaf growth, and the semantic interpretation of leaf information. Botanists easily identify plant species by discriminating between the shape of the leaf, tip, base, leaf margin and leaf vein, as well as the texture of the leaf and the arrangement of leaflets of compound leaves. Because of the increasing demand for experts and calls for biodiversity, there is a need for intelligent systems that recognize and characterize leaves so as to scrutinize a particular species, the diseases that affect them, the pattern of leaf growth, and so on. We review several image processing methods in the feature extraction of leaves, given that feature extraction is a crucial technique in computer vision. As computers cannot comprehend images, they are required to be converted into features by individually analyzing image shapes, colors, textures and moments. Images that look the same may deviate in terms of geometric and photometric variations. In our study, we also discuss certain machine learning classifiers for an analysis of different species of leaves.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr Thyagharajan K K•  8  Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Clustering and Classification Methods, Plant BiologyCall For Papers - 7 th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and  Applications (AI 2021)7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Applications (AI 2021) will provide an excellent international forum for sharing knowledge and results in theory, methodology and applications of Artificial Intelligence and its... more7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Applications (AI 2021) will provide an excellent international forum for sharing knowledge and results in theory, methodology and applications of Artificial Intelligence and its applications.

The whole idea inspired by MagicToon App [1]. As 3D video viewing becomes important and virtual reality market started, the request for 3D devices and contents is growing faster. Producing 3D videos, still remains as a big challenge. In this paper we presented a mobile app that uses a 3D deep neural networks algorithm to automatically convert 2D video and images to a stereoscopic 3D format [2]. In comparison to other mobile apps that doesn’t use automatic 2D-to-3D conversion algorithms, our mobile app uses method that trained end-to-end automatically on stereo pairs extracted from existing 3D videos. This novel mobile app approach outperforms baselines in human evaluations and quantitative.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rami Obead•  7  Computer Vision, Virtual Reality (Computer Graphics), Motion estimation, iOS Application DevelopmentRobot Obstacle Avoidance using the KinectSave to LibraryDownloadby Rasoul Mojtahedzadeh•  2  Robotics, Computer VisionDigital Image Based Tree Measurement for Forest InventorySave to LibraryDownloadby Jukka Heikkonen•  15  Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Segmentation, CalibrationTop 10 Cited Articles of AI 2021 - International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications (IJAIA)The International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications (IJAIA) is a bi monthly open access peer-reviewed journal that publishes articles which contribute new results in all areas of the Artificial Intelligence & Applications... moreThe International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications (IJAIA) is a bi monthly open access peer-reviewed journal that publishes articles which contribute new results in all areas of the Artificial Intelligence & Applications (IJAIA).

Design/methodology/approach-Real-time parking availability using specific infrastructure requires a high cost of installation and maintenance cost, which is not affordable to all urban cities. The authors present statistical block matching algorithm (SBMA) for real-time parking management in small-town cities such as Bhavnagar using an in-built surveillance CCTV system, which is not installed for parking application. In particular, data from a camera situated in a mall was used to detect the parking status of some specific parking places using a region of interest (ROI). The method proposed computes the mean value of the pixels inside the ROI using blocks of different sizes (8 Â 10 and 20 Â 35), and the values were compared among different frames. When the difference between frames is more significant than a threshold, the process generates "no parking space for that place." Otherwise, the method yields "parking place available." Then, this information is used to print a bounding box on the parking places with the color green/red to show the availability of the parking place. Findings-The real-time feedback loop (car parking positions) helps the presented model and dynamically refines the parking strategy and parking position to the users. A whole-day experiment/validation is shown in this paper, where the evaluation of the method is performed using pattern recognition metrics for classification: precision, recall and F1 score. Originality/value-The authors found real-time parking availability for Himalaya Mall situated in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, for 18th June 2018 video using the SBMA method with accountable computational time for finding parking slots. The limitations of the presented method with future implementation are discussed at the end of this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadby JANAK TRIVEDI•  16  Computer Vision, Statistical Analysis, Real-time Systems, Digital Signal ProcessingComputing optical flow from an overconstrained system of linear algebraic equationsA method is presented for the recovery of optical flow.

This method combines the advantages of the approaches based on split&amp;merge and region growing, and the use of the RGB and HSV colour representation models. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by the implementation of the algorithm using three different testing images with homogeneous regions, spatially compact and continuous. It was observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other analysed techniques requiring shorter processing time when compared with the other analysed methods.Save to Libraryby Gaston  Lefranc•  4  Mathematics, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Image segmentationWhy is real-world visual object recognition hardSave to LibraryDownloadby Nahuel Pinto•  10  Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, BiomimeticsOptical Character Recognition Based Hand-Held Device for Printed Text to Braille ConversionIn this paper we propose to develop a device that can be used by the visually challenged to read normal English books.

Here we focus on letter-by-letter segmentation, recognition and transliteration to the Braille format. The device would use on board software to do the recognition and conversion. The recognized characters are transmitted to the interface which converts the characters to the Braille format which can be felt-read by the visually challenged. The device would be cheaper among its counterparts.Save to LibraryDownloadby amala deepan•  6  Computer Vision, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Embedded SystemsMRF Energy Minimization and Beyond via Dual DecompositionSave to LibraryDownloadby Georgios Tziritas•  20  Information Systems, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Computer VisionOnline computation of exterior orientation with application to hand-eye calibrationSave to LibraryDownloadby Eric Mjolsness•  13  Applied Mathematics, Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, Object RecognitionBayesian Finite Element Model Updating Using Static and Dynamic DataFinite element models of current structures often behave differently than the structure itself.

Model updating techniques are used to enhance the capabilities of the numerical model such that it behaves like the real structure. Experimental data is used in model updating techniques to identify the parameters of the numerical model. In civil infrastructure these model updating techniques use either static or dynamic measurements, separately. This paper studies how a Bayesian updating framework behaves when both static and dynamic data are used to updated the model. Displacements at specific structure locations are obtained for static tests using a computer vision method. High density mode shapes and natural frequencies are obtained using a moving accelerometer structure. The static data and the modal characteristics are combined in a Bayesian modal updating technique that accounts for the incompleteness and uncertainty of the data as well as the possible nonuniqueness of the solution. Results show how the posterior probability density function changes when different type of information is included for updating.Save to LibraryDownloadby Johannio Marulanda and +1Boris Zárate•  8  Computer Vision, Model Updating, Natural Frequency, Dynamic Panel DataConoscopic holography: toward three-dimensional reconstructions of opaque objectsSave to LibraryDownloadby Laurent Mugnier•  12  Mechanical Engineering, Computer Vision, Image Analysis, Optical FlowEffective MultiPath Vector Channel Simulator for Antenna Array SystemsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alex Stephenne•  18  Engineering, Computer Vision, Technology, Computational ModelingMonocular Depth Ordering Using T-Junctions and Convexity Occlusion CuesSave to LibraryDownloadby Philippe  Salembier•  2  Computer Vision, Binary Partition TreeFood recognition using statistics of pairwise local featuresSave to LibraryDownloadby Dean Pomerleau•  5  Computer Vision, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Local Features, Multi DimensionalHead pose estimation using adaptively scaled template matchingSave to LibraryDownloadby Miki YAMADA•  7  Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Template matchingA 2D image motion detection method using a stationary cameraSave to LibraryDownloadby Đặng Khải Thành•  12  Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Image ProcessingOff-line Nepali handwritten character recognition using Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function neural networksSave to LibraryDownloadby Ashok K Pant•  9  Computer Vision, Image Processing, Natural Language Processing, Machine LearningAQUA: an aquatic walking robotSave to LibraryDownloadby Gregory Dudek•  17  Engineering, Robotics, Computer Science, Computer VisionLCPP: Low Computational Processing Pipeline for Delivery RobotsPerception techniques in novel times have enormously improved in autonomously and accurately predicting the ultimate states of the delivery robots.

The precision and accuracy in recent research lead to high computation costs for autonomous locomotion and expensive sensors and server dependency. Low computational algorithms for delivery robots are more viable as compared to pipelines used in autonomous vehicles or prevailing delivery robots. A blend of different autonomy approaches, including semantic segmentation, obstacle detection, obstacle tracking, and high fidelity maps, is presented in our work. Moreover, LCPP comprises low computational algorithms feasible on embedded devices with algorithms running more efficiently and accurately. Research also analyzes state-of-the-art algorithms via practical applications. Low computational algorithms have a downside of accuracy, which is not as proportional as computation. Finally, the study proposes that this algorithm will be more realizable as compared to Level 5 autonomy for delivery robots.Save to LibraryDownloadby Soofiyan Atar and +1Amit Kumar•  3  Robotics, Computer Vision, PerceptionDemons based tracking for non-rigid transformed Region of InterestSave to LibraryDownloadby Amol Patil•  10  Computer Vision, Image Registration, Optical Imaging, Target TrackingMeasuring Customer Behavior with Deep Convolutional Neural NetworksIn this paper, we propose a neural network model for human emotion and gesture classification.

We demonstrate that the proposed architecture represents an effective tool for real-time processing of customer&#39;s behavior for distributed on-land systems, such as information kiosks, automated cashiers and ATMs. The proposed approach combines most recent biometric techniques with the neural network approach for real-time emotion and behavioral analysis. In the series of experiments, emotions of human subjects were recorded, recognized, and analyzed to give statistical feedback of the overall emotions of a number of targets within a certain time frame. The result of the study allows automatic tracking of user’s behavior based on a limited set of observations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Veaceslav Albu•  4  Computer Science, Computer Vision, Music Emotion Classification, Deep Neural NetworksCreepy Tracker Toolkit for Context-aware InterfacesSave to LibraryDownloadby João António  Madeiras Pereira and +1Alberto Raposo•  7  Computer Science, Computer Vision, Surfaces and Interfaces, Interaction DesignGabor filter-based edge detectionIt is common practice to utilize evidence from biological and psychological vision experiments to develop computational models for low-level feature extraction.

Visual information is the basis for most navigational tasks, so visually impaired individuals are at disadvantage because appropriate information about the surrounding environment is not available. With the recent advances in inclusive technology it is possible to extend the support given to people with visual impairment during their mobility. In this context we propose a system, named SmartVision, whose global objective is to give blind users the ability to move around in unfamiliar environments, whether indoor or outdoor, through a user friendly interface. This paper is focused mainly in the development of the computer vision module of the SmartVision system.Save to LibraryDownloadby Leontios Hadjileontiadis•  10  Computer Vision, Blindness, Stereo Vision (Computer Vision), NavigationA prototype system for computer vision based human computer interactionSave to LibraryDownloadby Y.
