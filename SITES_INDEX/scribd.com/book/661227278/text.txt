Neville, 1948 Table of Contents: Lesson 1 - Consciousness is the only Reality Lesson 2 - ASSUMPTIONS CONSOLIDATE IN FACTS Lesson 3 - THINKING QUADS-DIMENSIONALLY Lesson 4 - NO ONE TO CHANGE EXCEPT YOURSELF Lesson 5 - STAY TRUSTFUL TO YOUR IDEA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Lesson 1 - CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE ONLY REALITY This will be a very practical Course. Therefore, I hope that each of you will have a clear picture of what you desire, because I am convinced that with the technique you will receive here this week, in these five lessons, you can realize your desires. So that you may receive maximum benefit from these instructions, I want to state now that the Bible has no reference to people who never existed or events that never occurred on earth. The ancient storytellers did not write a story but a great lesson, in the form of allegorical images, of some basic principles, which they clothed in the garb of history, and adapted these stories to the limited capacity of an ignorant and gullible people. Over the centuries we have mistakenly mistaken the personifications of the Bible for people, the allegory for the story, the vehicle that conveyed instruction for instruction, and the most obvious gross sense for the ultimate intended sense. The difference between the form of the Bible and its substance is as great as the difference between a grain of wheat and the germ of life within the grain. Just as our organs of assimilation discriminate between food to be incorporated into our bodies and food that must be eliminated, so our awakened intuitive faculties discover, behind the allegory and the parable, the psychological germ of life in the Bible, and by feeding on it, we too discard the form that conveyed the message. The rebuttal on the historicity of the Bible is too long, and unsuitable for inclusion in this practical psychological interpretation of its stories. Therefore, I will not waste time in trying to convince you that the Bible is not about historical facts. Tonight I will take four stories and show you what the ancient storytellers wanted us to see in these stories. The ancient storytellers attached psychological truths to them with phallic and solar allegories. They did not know the physical structure of man as well as our modern scientists, nor did they know as much about the heavens as our modern astronomers. But they wisely used the little they knew, and constructed phallic and solar frames to which they attached the great psychological truths they had discovered. The Old Testament is full of phallic worship. Since it is of no use, I do not intend to emphasize it, but will only show you how to interpret it. Before we get to the first of the psychological dramas that you and I can use in a practical sense, I would like to name the two prominent names in the Bible, namely GOD or JEHOVAH and the one we call his son, JESUS. The ancients wrote these names using small symbols. Ancient Hebrew was not a language that could be pronounced with the breath. It was a mystical language, never pronounced by man. Those who understood it, understood it as a mathematician understands the symbols of higher mathematics. It was not something that people used to convey thought the way I use the English language now. For the ancients the name of God (Jehovah) was written JOD HE' VAU HE'. I will take these symbols and explain them in our normal earthy language. The first letter JOD is a hand or a seed. Not simply a hand, but the hand of the director. If there is one organ of man that discriminates and distinguishes him from the whole world of creation, it is his hand. What we call a hand, in the anthropoid ape is not a hand; it is used only to bring food to the mouth or to swing from branch to branch. Man's hand, on the other hand, shapes, creates. We cannot truly express ourselves without the hand. It is the hand of the builder, the hand of the director; it directs, shapes and builds his world. Ancient storytellers called this first letter JOD, the absolute hand or seed from which the entire creation comes. The second letter, HE' has the symbol of a window. The window is an eye; it is to the house what the eye is to the body. The third letter, VAU, is symbolized as a nail, since it binds things together. The conjunction e in the Hebrew language is precisely this third letter VAU. To say man and woman, I have to put VAU in the middle to bind things together. The fourth and final letter HE', is another window or eye. To understand these symbols you must forget the words eyes, windows, hands and think of JOD HE 'VAU HE' in this way. The first letter JOD is your I AM, your awareness from which all states of consciousness come. The second letter HE', the eye, is your ability to perceive, to imagine something that seems to be other than Self. As if you are lost in reverie and contemplate mental states in a detached manner, making the thinker and his thoughts separate entities. The third letter VAU, is your ability to feel that you are what you wish to be. By feeling that you are, you become aware that you are. The ability to persist in your imaginal act and walk as if you were what you want to be, means pulling your desire out of the imaginal world and putting VAU on it. You have completed the scene of creation. I become aware of something. Then I become aware of actually being what I was aware of. The fourth and final letter is another HE', another eye, symbolizing the objective visible world that constantly bears witness to what I am conscious of being. You do nothing about your objective world; it always shapes itself in harmony with what you are conscious of being. We are told that this is the name by which all things are made, and without which there is nothing made that is made. The name is simply what you have now as you sit here. You are aware that you are, are you not? Certainly I am. You are also aware of something that is other than you: the room, the furniture, the people. JOD HE' VAU HE'. The name represents your consciousness, to which you can nail or bind anything. Now you can become selective. You may not wish to be other than what you are, or to own what you see. But you have the ability to feel what it would be like if you were now other than what you are. The moment you assume that you are what you want to be, you have completed the name of God, or JOD HE' VAU HE'. The end result, the materialization of your assumption, is none of your business. It will automatically come into view when you assume the consciousness of being that thing. Let us now turn to the name of the Son, to whom dominion over the world is given. You are that Son, the great Joshua or Jehoshua of the Old Testament, whose name has been Westernized in the New Testament with Jesus. In the Hebrew language, the Son's name is almost like the Father's name. The first three letters of the Father's name, are the same as the Son's name JOD HE 'VAU, then the symbols SHIN and AYIN are added, making the Son's name read JOD HE' VAU SHIN AYIN. We have seen what the meaning of the first three letters is. JOD means you are aware; HE means you are aware of something; VAU means you become aware of being what you were aware of. You have dominion because you have the ability to conceive and become what you conceive. This is the power of creation. But why is a SHIN put in the Son's name? Because of the infinite mercy of the Father. Mind you, the Father and the Son are one. But when the Father becomes aware that He is His creation (Man), He puts into the condition called man that which He does not give to Himself. He places a SHIN for this purpose, the symbol of which is a tooth. A tooth is that thing that consumes, that devours. I must have within me the power to devour what I now dislike. For example, in my ignorance, I have given birth to certain things that I now dislike and would like to leave behind. If there were not within me the flame to consume them, I would be doomed to live forever with my mistakes. But within the Son's name there is a SHIN, or flame, that enables the Son to detach Himself from the states He has previously expressed in the world. Man can see nothing but the content of his consciousness. If now in consciousness I detached myself from this room, turning my attention away from it, then I would no longer be aware of it. There is something in me that devours it within me. This room can live in my objective world only if I keep it alive within my consciousness. It is the SHIN, or tooth, in the Son's name that gives it absolute dominion. It cannot be in the Father's name, for the simple reason that in the Father nothing can cease to be. Not even unpleasant things can cease to be. That which has once been given expression remains forever locked in our dimensionally greater Self, which is the Father. But, not wishing to keep all my errors alive in my world, I, the Father, in my infinite grace, when I became Man gave myself the power to detach myself from these things that, in my ignorance, I gave birth to in my world. These are the two names that give you dominion over your world. You have dominion if, as you walk the earth, you are aware that your consciousness is God, the one and only reality. You become aware of something that you would like to express or possess. You have the ability to feel that you are and possess what only a moment before was imaginary. The end result, the embodiment of your assumption, is completely outside the powers of your three-dimensional mind. It will come to birth in a way that no man knows. If these two names are clear in your mind's eye, you will see that they are your eternal names. As you sit here, you are this JOD HE VAU HE; you are JOD HE VAU SHIN AYIN. The Bible stories deal exclusively with the power of imagination. They are true dramatizations of the technique of prayer, because prayer is the secret to changing the future. The Bible reveals the key by which man accesses a dimensionally larger world in order to change the conditions of the smaller world in which he lives. An answered prayer implies that, thanks to prayer, something has been done that otherwise would not have been done. Therefore, man is the spring of action, the directing mind and the grantor of prayer. The stories of the Bible contain a powerful challenge to man's ability to think. The underlying truth -- namely, that they are psychological dramas and not historical facts -- requires reiteration, as it is the only justification for the stories. And with a little imagination we can easily trace the psychological meaning of all the stories in the Bible. In Genesis chapter 1 we read that: God said, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness; and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the reptiles that creep upon the earth.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him (Genesis 1:26,27). In this 1st chapter of the Bible, the ancient teachers laid the foundation that God and man are one and that man has dominion over the whole earth. If God and man are one, then God can never be so far away as not even to be near, because even nearness implies separation. The question then arises: who is God? God is man's consciousness, his awareness, his I AM. Life is a psychological drama in which we bring circumstances to pass by our attitudes rather than by our actions. The foundation on which all things are based is man's conception of himself. He acts as he does and experiences what he has because his conception of himself is what it is. If he had a different self-conception, he would Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksBody, Mind, & SpiritFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
