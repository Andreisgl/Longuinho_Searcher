The first beta release of the 1.16 branch is now available for
download. Please try it and tell us if it works for you. This beta
release is not recommended for use in a production environment.
Selected changes since MediaWiki 1.15 that may be of interest:
* Watchlists now have RSS/Atom feeds. RSS feeds generally are now
hidden, since Atom is a better protocol and is supported by virtually
all clients.
* It's now possible to block users from sending email via
Special:Emailuser.
* The maintenance script system was overhauled. Most maintenance
scripts now have a useful help page when you run them with --help.
* AdminSettings.php is no longer required in order to run maintenance
scripts. You can just set $wgDBadminuser and $wgDBadminpassword in
your LocalSettings.php instead.
* The preferences system was overhauled. Preferences are stored in a
more compact format. Changes to site default preferences will
automatically affect all users who have not chosen a different preference.
* Support for SQLite was improved. Some broken features were fixed,
and it now has an efficient full-text search.
* The user groups ACL system was improved by allowing rights to be
revoked, instead of just granted.
* A new localisation caching system was introduced, which will make
MediaWiki faster for almost everyone, especially when lots of
extensions are enabled.
By default, this new system makes a lot of database queries. If your
database is particularly slow, or if your system administrator limits
your query count, or if you want to squeeze as much performance as
possible out of Mediawiki, set $wgCacheDirectory to a writable path on
the local filesystem. Make sure you have the DBA extension for PHP
installed, this will improve performance further.
