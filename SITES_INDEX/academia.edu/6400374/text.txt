Traditional models of aphasia and language organization in the brain have especially focused on Broca's area in the pars opercularis and triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and Wernicke's area in the posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). According to the well-known Wernicke-Geschwind model (e.g., , Wernicke's area houses auditory word representations, and damage to this area would cause deficits understanding, repeating, and producing spoken and written language. Broca's area is considered to be containing the set of articulatory forms, so that its lesion would disrupt the articulation of language.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHuman Brain MappingDisentangling syntax and intelligibility in auditory language comprehension2009 • Sonja KotzDownload Free PDFView PDFCommon and distinct neural substrates for the perception of speech rhythm and intonation2010 • Ping LiAbstract The present study examines the neural substrates for the perception of speech rhythm and intonation.Download Free PDFView PDFNeuroimageHemispheric roles in the perception of speech prosody2004 • Yisheng XuDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroImageNeural networks of emotional discourse comprehension2009 • G.

Brain Networks and Mechanisms for Identifying IndividualsCatherine PerrodinSocial animals can identify conspecifics by many forms of sensory input. However, whether the neuronal computations that support this ability to identify individuals rely on modality-independent convergence or involve ongoing synergistic interactions along the multiple sensory streams remains controversial. Direct neuronal measurements at relevant brain sites could address such questions, but this requires better bridging the work in humans and animal models. Here, we overview recent studies in nonhuman primates on voice and face identity-sensitive pathways and evaluate the correspondences to relevant findings in humans. This synthesis provides insights into converging sensory streams in the primate anterior temporal lobe (ATL) for identity processing. Furthermore, we advance a model and suggest how alternative neuronal mechanisms could be tested.Download Free PDFView PDFThe language skeleton after dissecting meaning: A functional segregation within Broca's AreaTomás Goucha, Angela D FriedericiBroca's area is proposed as a crucial brain area for linguistic computations. Language processing goes beyond word-level processing, also implying the integration of meaningful information (semantics) with the underlying structural skeleton (syntax). There is an on-going debate about the specialisation of the subregions of Broca's area—Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45—regarding the latter aspects. Here, we tested if syntactic information is specifically processed in BA 44, whereas BA 45 is mainly recruited for semantic processing. We contrasted conditions with sentence structure against conditions with random order in two fMRI experiments. Besides, in order to disentangle these processes, we systematically removed the amount of semantic information available in the stimuli. This was achieved in Experiment 1 by replacing meaningful words (content words) by pseudowords. Within real word conditions we found broad activation in the left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45/47), the anterior temporal lobe and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and sulcus (pSTS). For pseudowords we found a similar activation pattern, still involving BA 45. Among the pseudowords in Experiment 1, we kept those word elements that convey meaning like un- in unhappy or -hood in brotherhood (i.e. derivational morphology). In Experiment 2 we tested whether the activation in BA 45 was due to their presence. We therefore further removed derivational morphology, only leaving word elements that determine syntactic structure (i.e. inflectional morphology, e.g. the verb ending -s in he paints). Now, in the absence of all semantic cues, including derivational morphology, only BA 44 was active. Additional analyses showed a selective responsiveness of this area to syntax-relevant cues. These findings confirm BA 44 as a core area for the processing of pure syntactic information. This furthermore suggests that the brain represents structural and meaningful aspects of language separately.Download Free PDFView PDFCerebral CortexAuditory-Motor Expertise Alters "Speech Selectivity" in Professional Musicians and Actors2011 • Howard NusbaumDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroImageSong and speech: Brain regions involved with perception and covert production2006 • Daniel CallanDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuropsychologiaProbing category selectivity for environmental sounds in the human auditory brain2008 • Oliver Doehrmann, Marcus Naumer, Christian AltmannDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
