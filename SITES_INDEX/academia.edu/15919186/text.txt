Students charted the ups and downs of their English learning histories and then completed a questionnaire in which they explained the causes of their demotivation and the pathways, unintentional or intentional, by which they became remotivated. This data was analyzed in terms of the affective and attitudinal conditions which students brought with them into the classroom. Students with positive antecedent conditions were found to have experienced fewer periods of demotivation in the past and exhibited more dynamic use of a wide range of strategies in their attempts to remotivate themselves. There is evidence to suggest that these learners also had more exposure to such strategies in use. Based on this hypothesis, we compiled and returned the strategies they reported to seed their self-motivational practices.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHelping students repack for remotivation and agency (2009)Tim Murphey, Tetsuya Fukuda, M.

Possible selves are future-projected identities that can generate goal-oriented behaviors. The study investigated how possible selves might be used in the classroom by examining the interrelationships between the motivations of past-projected and future projected identities, and effort in learning within social networks inside and outside the classroom. This paper focuses on activities for eliciting possible selves, expanding social networks, developing aspirations, and increasing motivation.Download Free PDFView PDFHolistic timing and group framing of motivationTim Murphey, Tetsuya FukudaDownload Free PDFView PDFReference List政志 田口Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Participatory Looping: An Agencing Process for Mass Customization in Language EducationTim MurpheyCritical Participatory Looping (CPL) (cf. Falout and Murphey 2010; Murphey and Falout 2010) involves returning processed data from surveys or assignments back to students for further reflection and analysis in small groups. CPL affords dialogical interaction among class members (including the teacher), which can encourage them all as agents developing their own self-determination through action—otherwise known as agencing (cf. Murphey 2010, Nelson and Murphey, 2011). In this paper we first describe the kinds of customization that invite agency, then for CPL provide three examples of teaching and researching with it, theorize on its processes and potential, and discuss its correlates with other domains and mass customization.Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Participatory Looping: Dialogic Member Checking With Whole ClassesTim MurpheyResults from research about language learners can be strengthened by including the learners themselves in the data analysis, and inviting them to check researcher interpretations to confirm the validity of the data, to search for alternative interpretations, and to delve deeper into their beliefs. Using critical participatory looping (CPL), we give compiled results, gathered from surveys or assignments, back to the original participants. We developed CPL based on Freire’s (2007/1970) participatory principles and Dewey’s (1910) pedagogy of reflective thinking for motivating learners, the four phases of which are experience, description, analysis, and intelligent action. In this article, we outline a rationale for practicing CPL and relate it to past research and preexisting teaching methods that we discovered bearing relevancy. Then we provide two examples of our own research with CPL and discuss how it strengthens the credibility of our interpretations, and how it has increased learner engagement and motivation.Download Free PDFView PDFWhole-Class Self-Referential Feedback from University EFL Contexts to the World: Extending the Social Life of Information by Looping it Forward Tim Murphey, Tetsuya FukudaEducational systems endemic of demotivation might signify a stagnating rather than nurturing ecology of learning, due in part to an obstruction in the loops of shared information between the organisms within these systems, i.e., teachers, educational researchers, teacher educators, school administrators, and educational policymakers. Working within the ecology of English as a foreign language education in Japan, we have been endeavoring over several years to open loops of communication with students through a learning-teaching-researching process we call critical participatory looping (CPL). We reported successes in various publications about how CPL has improved our students’ motivations, and this paper elaborates upon two recent examples to provide a grounding of CPL in practices that support activating ecological adaptability. First, we theorize that individuals and groups (classes) can be seen as socially intelligent dynamic systems, and examine this perspective in relation to intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamics of students needing nurturing loops of open communication in order to foster greater self-awareness and mutual care. Then we suggest that through soft assembling expansive learning, students and teacher-researchers might open communications explicitly about themselves and their contexts, deepen mutual appreciation and understandings, and act purposefully as agents toward promoting healthy qualities in themselves. Finally, we show with two examples that the social life of valuable information can be extended by looping it not only back to those that created it but also by looping it forward (similar to paying it forward) across expanding networks that might benefit from it with ecological adaptability.Download Free PDFView PDFJALT JournalDevelopment of the L2 Motivational Self System: English at a University in Japan2014 • Scott AubreyThis paper reports on a study investigating changes in L2 motivation for Japanese learners of English as they completed their first communicative English language course at university. I aim to describe the strength and structure of students’ motiva- tion and the degree to which these changed over one semester. A 36-item question- naire was used to measure components of the L2 Motivational Self System and In- ternational Posture. The questionnaire was administered twice to 202 second-year university students in Japan: during the first week of the semester and 11 weeks later. Structural equation models were created to describe the causal relationships between motivational variables for the two time periods. Paired t tests revealed that both motivated learning behavior and ought-to L2 self significantly increased over the semester. A comparison of the two models indicated that there was a change in the motivational structure from Week 1 to Week 12.Download Free PDFView PDFEFL students’ educational preferences in Korea and JapanTim MurpheyLife, J., Falout, J., & Murphey, T. (2009). EFL students’ educational preferences in Korea and Japan.In A. M. Stoke (Ed.), JALT2008 Conference Proceedings. Tokyo: JALT. This study invited 373 university students studying English in Korea and Japan to express their preferences concerning learning and teaching methods, and what they see as the principle problems in their educational environments. We invited comments directly from the students in response to the first set of results of the questionnaire to examine and reflect on the potential similarities and differences between those studying in Korea and Japan, males and females, and English and non-English majors.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
