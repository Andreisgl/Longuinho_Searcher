RunkleClimate change projections show that there will be continuing increases in the occurrence and severity of some extreme events by the end of the century, while for other extremes the links to climate change are more uncertain. Some regions of the United States have already experienced costly impacts—in terms of both lives lost and economic damages (see Figure ES5)—from observed changes in the frequency, intensity, or duration of certain extreme events (see Table 1 in Ch 4: Extreme Events). While it is intuitive that extremes can have health impacts such as death or injury during an event (for example, drowning during floods), health impacts can also occur before or after an extreme event, as individuals may be involved in activities that put their health at risk, such as disaster preparation and post-event cleanup. Health risks may also arise long after the event, or in places outside the area where the event took place, as a result of damage to property, destruction of assets, loss of infrastructure and public services, social and economic impacts, environmental degradation, and other factors. Extreme events also pose unique health risks if multiple events occur simultaneously or in succession in a given location. The severity and extent of health effects associated with extreme events depend on the physical impacts of the extreme events themselves as well as the unique human, societal, and environmental circumstances at the time and place where events occur.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational journal of critical illness and injury scienceWind disasters: A comprehensive review of current management strategies2013 • Stephanie GordyWind disasters are responsible for tremendous physical destruction, injury, loss of life and economic damage. In this review, we discuss disaster preparedness and effective medical response to wind disasters. The epidemiology of disease and injury patterns observed in the early and late phases of wind disasters are reviewed. The authors highlight the importance of advance planning and adequate preparation as well as prompt and well-organized response to potential damage involving healthcare infrastructure and the associated consequences to the medical response system. Ways to minimize both the extent of infrastructure damage and its effects on the healthcare system are discussed, focusing on lessons learned from recent major wind disasters around the globe. Finally, aspects of healthcare delivery in disaster zones are reviewed.Download Free PDFView PDFCEDIM FDA-Report on Hurricane Sandy 22-30 October 2012Bernhard MührDownload Free PDFView PDFCEDIM FDA-Report on Hurricane Sandy 22-30 Oct 302012, 2nd Report: Information as of 8 November 2012, 18 UTCBernhard MührDownload Free PDFView PDFCritical Infrastructure Systems: A case study of the interconnectedness of risks posed by Hurricane Sandy for New York CityMasahiko HaraguchiThe goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of Hurricane Sandy from the perspective of interdependence among different sectors of critical infrastructure in New York City and to assess the interconnected nature of risks posed by such a hurricane. Critical areas and sectors where interdependent risks led to a catastrophic cascading effect are identified. This study uses indirect damages of each sector to estimate the degree of interdependence among the sectors. The study examines the impact of the hurricane on different critical infrastructures by combining hazard maps of actual inundation areas with maps of critical infrastructure. The direct damages of each sector are calculated from the inundation areas in the flood map. The indirect damages are estimated by considering the areas that were not inundated but affected by Sandy through the interconnected infrastructure. The electricity sector was the key sector to propagate risks to other sectors. The examination of new initiatives to increase the resilience of critical infrastructures in New York City after Sandy reveals that these initiatives focus primarily on building hard infrastructures to decrease direct damages. They understate the importance of interdependent risk across sectors. Future disaster risk reduction strategies must address interdependent infrastructures to reduce indirect damages.Download Free PDFView PDFA Tale of Two Sandys.

From the Crescent City down to the bayou, the communities most vulnerable to floodwaters suffer not simply because of geography and topography, but because of multiple social vulnerabilities. As policymakers in Louisiana and throughout the Gulf Coast region grapple with climate change adaptation, they must do so in a way that deliberately and effectively engages vulnerable communities in the planning process. This paper explores a number of community-level strategies for adaptation, with a special focus on ensuring the individuals and communities they are meant to protect have a say in their design and implementation. It identifies best practices for engaging individuals and their communities in initiatives like elevating structures, revising zoning laws, flood-proofing homes, and pre-disaster planning, to ensure policymakers understand and account for their needs.
