Sundanese or simply Sunda (known natively as Basa Sunda) is a language spoken predominantly by the Sundanese people, native to the western part of the Indonesian island of Java. Virtually all native Sundanese speakers are also able to speak Indonesian, so learning Sundanese is not necessary to communicate. Nevertheless, attempting to communicate in Sundanese is virtually guaranteed to endear you to the locals since so few foreigners make the effort.
Understand[edit]
Sundanese has several honorific speech which is a variety of vocabulary used to respect the interlocutor depending on the rank or position of the interlocutor, this honorific speech usually call as tatakrama basa Sunda (ᮒᮒᮊᮢᮙ ᮘᮞ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ, literally "Sundanese Manners"). There are at least two types, which are ordered by formality. There is substantial difference in the vocabularies of each type:
Hormat, used for announcements & speeches. This variety is further divided into two, namely:
hormat ka batur, characterized by the use of words that respect the circumstances, events, and actions taken by third parties or interlocutors.
hormat ka sorangan, characterized by the use of vocabulary that demeans circumstances, events, and actions taken by oneself.
Loma does not use any form of respect and is used as a neutral language variety.
