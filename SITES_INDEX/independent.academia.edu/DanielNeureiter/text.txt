Here, immune checkpoint modulating drugs alone or in combination with local ablative techniques could open a new and attractive therapeutic “door” to improve outcome and response rate for patients with HCC. Methods: Published data on HCC experimental to pre-(clinical) treatment strategies from standard of care to novel immunomodulatory concepts were summarized and discussed in detail. Results: Overall, our knowledge of the role of immune checkpoints in HCC is dramatically increased in the last years. Experimental and pre-clinical findings could be translated to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and became standard of care. Local ablative techniques of HCC could improve the effectivity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in situ.

Alpha 1-Proteinaseninhibitormangel und isolierte Leberzirrhose ohne Lungenemphysem bei einer 53-jährigen PatientinDMW - Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift,  2005A 53 year-old woman presented with an elevated serum aminotransferase and cirrhosis of the liver ... more A 53 year-old woman presented with an elevated serum aminotransferase and cirrhosis of the liver of unknown cause. She reported neither alcohol nor drug abuse and had no previous serious illness. She had smoked about 10 pack years of cigarettes in the past. Serological markers were negative for infectious agents, hemochromatosis, Wilson&amp;#39;s disease and autoimmune diseases. Serum electrophoresis showed a decrease of the alpha1-globulin fraction (1 %; normal: 1.5 - 4.0); serum alpha1-antitrypsin was very low at 0.25 ng/l (normal: 0.9 - 2.0). The histology revealed liver cirrhosis due to alpha1-proteinase-inhibitor deficiency. Genetic testing proved a PiZZ type of proteinase-inhibitor deficiency. The patient had normal lung functions. Because of the increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, future sonographic monitoring and alpha-fetoprotein measurements every 6 months were recommended. As lung functions were normal there was no indication for administering alpha1-antitrypsin. Although proteinase-inhibitor deficiency is a rare cause of liver cirrhosis, especially without any sign of emphysema, it should be considered when other, more common causes of liver cirrhosis are excluded.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Spatial Heterogeneity in Large Resected Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Bulks Analysed by Massively Parallel Sequencing of Multiple Synchronous BiopsiesSimple Summary Substantial genetic heterogeneity was described within large tumour masses of seve... more Simple Summary Substantial genetic heterogeneity was described within large tumour masses of several cancer entities. However, this topic has not been addressed in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Therefore, we collected multiple biopsies of twelve patients who had diagnostic or therapeutic resections of large lymphoma bulks and analysed 213 genes known to be important for lymphoma biology. The biopsies of each patient were compared to investigate the spatial heterogeneity in DLBCL. Ten out of twelve patients had discordant mutations which were not present in all of their biopsies and similar results were seen by the analysis of copy number variants. Some of the involved genes have a known prognostic and therapeutic relevance in DLBCL. This shows that single biopsies underestimate the complexity of the disease and might overlook possible mechanisms of resistance and therapeutic targets.

The ongoing discovery, characterization and functional categorization of lncRNAs has led to a better understanding of the involvement of lncRNAs in diverse biological and pathological processes including cancer. Aberrant expression of specific lncRNA species was demonstrated in various cancer types and associated with unfavorable clinical characteristics. Recent studies suggest that lncRNAs are also involved in the development and progression of biliary tract cancer, a rare disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. In this review, we summarize current findings regarding the manifold roles of lncRNAs in biliary tract cancer and give an overview of the clinical and molecular consequences of aberrant lncRNA expression as well as of underlying regulatory functions of selected lncRNA species in the context of biliary tract cancer.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Two epigenetic key players are miRNAs and histone deacetylases (HDACs). As previously shown by own theoretical databank analysis, the crosstalk between miRNAs and HDACs is relevant in different human chronic diseases and cancerogenic pathways. We aimed to investigate a potential connection between the expression of a well-defined subset of “proliferation-associated” miRNAs and the expression of HDACs as well as clinical parameters in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). Materials and Methods: Expression levels of miRNA132-3p, miRNA145-5p, miRNA183-5p, miRNA34a-5p, and miRNA449a in 57 pNETs resected between 1997 and 2015 were measured and linked to the immunohistochemical expression pattern of members of the four HDAC classes on human tissue microarrays. All pNET cases were clinically and pathologically characterized according to published guidelines.

Analysis of expression patterns in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) indicated HDAC5 to be a potential target for future therapies. As a first step towards a possible treatment, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cellular and molecular effects of HDAC5 inhibition in pNET cells. Two pNET cell lines, BON-1 and QGP-1, were incubated with different concentrations of the selective class IIA HDAC inhibitor, LMK-235. Effects on cell viability were determined using the resazurin-assay, the caspase-assay, and Annexin-V staining. Western Blot and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed to assess the effects on HDAC5 functionality. LMK-235 lowered overall cell viability by inducing apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, acetylation of histone-H3 increased with higher LMK-235 concentrations, ind...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Napabucasin is a previously described cancer stem cell inhibitor that is currently being used in clinical trials. However, data regarding napabucasin and biliary tract cancer are not available yet. We tested the general cytotoxic effect of napabucasin on a comprehensive biliary tract cancer in vitro model, using resazurin assay and Annexin V/7-AAD staining. The effect of napabucasin on functional cancer stem cell characteristics was analyzed via soft agar assay, aldehyde-dehydrogenase-1 assay, measurement of surface CD326 expression, and measurement of clonogenic growth. The evaluation of the effect of napabucasin on cancer stem cell protein and gene expression was performed using Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR-based human cancer stem cell array.

Here, ... more Cellular migration is essential in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes. Here, we present a protocol for quantitative analysis of migration using confluence detection allowing continuous, non-endpoint measurement with minimal hands-on time under cell incubator conditions. Applicability was tested using substances which enhance (EGF) or inhibit (cytochalasin D, ouabain) migration. Using a gap-closure assay we demonstrate that automated confluence detection monitors cellular migration in the 96-well microplate format. Quantification by % confluence, % cell free-area or % confluence in cell-free area against time, allows detailed analysis of cellular migration. The study describes a practicable approach for continuous, non-endpoint measurement of migration in 96-well microplates and for detailed data analysis, which allows for medium/high-throughput analysis of cellular migration in vitro.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Role of histone deacetylases in pancreas: Implications for pathogenesis and therapyWorld journal of gastrointestinal oncology,  Jan 15, 2015In the last years, our knowledge of the pathogenesis in acute and chronic pancreatitis (AP/CP) as... more In the last years, our knowledge of the pathogenesis in acute and chronic pancreatitis (AP/CP) as well as in pancreatic cancerogenesis has significantly diversified. Nevertheless, the medicinal therapeutic options are still limited and therapeutic success and patient outcome are poor. Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression is known to contribute to development and progression of AP and CP as well as of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the selective inhibition of aberrantly active epigenetic regulators can be an effective option for future therapies. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that remove an acetyl group from histone tails, thereby causing chromatin compaction and repression of transcription. In this review we present an overview of the currently available literature addressing the role of HDACs in the pancreas and in pancreatic diseases. In pancreatic cancerogenesis, HDACs play a role in the important process of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, ubiquitin-proteasome ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study we investigated the cytotoxic effects of PTC-209, a recently developed inhibitor of BMI1, in BTC cells. PTC-209 reduced overall viability in BTC cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion (0.04 - 20 µM). Treatment with PTC-209 led to slightly enhanced caspase activity and stop of cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis revealed that PTC-209 caused cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint. A comprehensive investigation of expression changes of cell cycle-related genes showed that PTC-209 caused significant down-regulation of cell cycle-promoting genes as well as of genes that contribute to DNA synthesis initiation and DNA repair, respectively. This was accompanied by significantly elevated mRNA levels of cell cycle inhibitors. In addition, PTC-209 reduced sphere formation and, in a cell line-dependent manner, a...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
