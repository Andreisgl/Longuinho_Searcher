These khipus contain a formulaic arrangement of numerical values not encountered on khipus from elsewhere in Tawantinsuyu (the Inka Empire). The formula includes first, a large number, hypothesized to record the sum total of produce included in a deposit, followed by a "fixed number," and then one or more additional numbers. The fixed number plus the additional number(s) sum to the original large number. It is hypothesized that the fixed number represents an amount deducted from the deposit to support storage facility personnel. As such, it represented a tax assessed on deposits, the first evidence we have for a system of taxation on goods in the Inka Empire. It is proposed that the size and complexity of the storage facility at Inkawasi prompted the "invention" of a kind of financing instrument-taxation-not known previously from Inka administration. We also consider , but provisionally set aside, the alternative hypothesis that the fixed values recorded on the Inkawasi khipus could have represented amounts of seeds set aside from deposits for the next year's planting. Durante las excavaciones de un complejo de almacenamiento (Qolqawasi) del sitio de Inkawasi, en la costa sur del Perú, se hallaron varios khipus-instrumentos de registro Inkas empleando cordeles anudados-asociados a diferentes cultivos agrí-colas (e.g., ají, maní y frijoles negros). Estos khipus presentan una disposición de valores numéricos que no se ha encontrado en otras partes del Tawantinsuyo (el Imperio Inka). Esta secuencia incluye un valor alto, el cual correspondería a la cantidad total de un determinado producto depositado en un almacén (qolqa), seguido de un "valor fijo" y uno o más números adicio-nales. Si se suman el valor fijo y los números adicionales, se obtiene al valor alto. Proponemos que el valor fijo representa un monto que era deducido de los productos almacenados en las qolqas para el mantenimiento del personal encargado y el fun-cionamiento de los almacenes. Ante esta evidencia de un posible impuesto a los productos almacenados, estaríamos ante las primeras manifestaciones de un sistema tributario sobre bienes en el Imperio Inka. Proponemos que, ante el tamaño y com-plejidad de las instalaciones de almacenamiento, en Inkawasi existió la necesidad de "inventar" un tipo de instrumento finan-ciero-el impuesto-desconocido previamente en estudios de la administración Inka. También podemos considerar como hipótesis alternativa que los valores fijos de los khipus de Inkawasi representen una cierta cantidad de semillas no depositadas en los almacenes que habrían sido empleadas para la siembra de la siguiente cosecha.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gary Urton•  20  History, Economic History, Latin American Studies, EconomicsUna civiltà di ragionieri.

Why are more account books preserved between Florence and Prato for the 13th-16th centuries than in the whole of Europe put together? And finally, how can we explain that the family archives of the Florentine nobles conserved, still in the late Grand Duke's age, ledgers, cashbooks and journals written a few centuries ago, whose practical usefulness was apparently zero? Working on multiple fronts, that of economic history, that of the history of techniques and cultural formation, that of political-social history, the author compares the Florentine case with that of the other great Italian mercantile cities, finally proposing an image of Florence slightly different from the stereotyped image of the cradle of Humanism.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sergio Tognetti•  5  Archivística, Renaissance Italy, Medieval Economic and Social History, Renaissance FlorenceMuhasebenin Tarihsel Gelişimi - Doğu ve Batı.docxSave to LibraryDownloadby Volkan Koç•  3  Accounting History, Financial Accounting, History of AccountancyThe Accounts of the Buda Court of Hungarian And Bohemian King Vladislaus II Jagiellon (1494-1495)Full version of the book.Save to LibraryDownloadby Petr Kozák•  20  Economic History, Medieval History, Medieval Studies, Environmental HistoryThe Social History of the Archive (FREE DOWNLOAD in link)Download for free here: https://academic.oup.com/past/issue/230/suppl_11 This Supplement builds on a burgeoning body of research that approaches the archive not merely as the object, but as the subject of enquiry.

It explores the phenomenon of record keeping in the early modern period in the context of significant ecclesiastical, political, intellectual and cultural developments that served as a stimulus to it: state formation, religious reformation, and economic transformation; the advent of the mechanical press, the spread of educational opportunity, and the expansion of literacy; changing epistemological conventions, shifting attitudes towards history and memory, and new modes of self-representation. The essays that comprise it focus attention on the impulses behind the surge in public and private documentation in Europe between 1500 and 1800 and place the process by which individual, collective and institutional records were created, compiled, authorised, and used under the microscope. They examine the activities of curators and scribes and analyse the issues of credibility and authenticity to which their endeavours gave rise, alongside the role of textual, pictorial, material and financial records in managing knowledge and giving expression to senses of identity. Stretching traditional, technical definitions of the record and archive, they investigate how writing and document-making of various kinds was shaped by dynamic interactions between ordinary people and by the quotidian circumstances and politics of everyday life. They also illuminate some of the multiple ways in which archives mediate and construct the past, preserving some traces of it for posterity while consigning others to permanent oblivion.Save to LibraryDownloadby Liesbeth  Corens and +5Hannah MurphyMarkus FriedrichFrederik  BuylaertTom  HamiltonMary Laven•  135  Information Systems, History, Cultural History, Archival StudiesYour tally is full!

It is evident that some of their contents were stricter than the framework of official law and even went against merchants’ practices and common dealings. Ympyn’s treatise and others contain prescriptive parts that were advice, however, rather than a reflection of rules set forth by legislation or custom. Merchant guidebooks must be considered for the individual thoughts and choices of their authors, as a consequence, and are not always paraphrasing ideas of a merchant community. This chapter, then, provides a clear warning against viewing this ars mercatoria-literature as a historical source of conduct and of normative ideas concerning trade. In fact, the limited value of mercantile guidebooks in this respect adds to other evidence pointing in the direction of limited juridification of commerce, even in the sixteenth century. Not only was official law rather minimal, it seems that even normative practices of merchants were not abundant. Antwerp records dating from the 1500s demonstrate that customs of merchants were seldom mentioned in court-related documents and inquiries into customs; also academic literature does not mention them very often. Both the nature of commerce as well as a mercantile culture that carefully administered business provide arguments for this legal situation. An overarching academic and local law, which were imposed through judgments and by legal professionals, offers a possible explanation for the low amount of customs found in official documents; however, the latter were not brought forward, not even by merchants, in a setting that was generally custom-friendly. One can speculate that the historiography concerning trade norms in the later Middle Ages and early modern period will benefit from a more modest approach towards normative practices of merchants, which have often been inflated to transnational legal levels. In this regard, pursuing a broad perspective on the features of interactions in commerce clearly seems to be a prescription for modesty.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dave De ruysscher•  5  Economic History, Legal History, Social History, History of Accounting ThoughtTexts and Labels: A Case Study from Neo-Sumerian Umma"The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach to Neo-Sumerian documents as archaeological artifacts.

In his editio princeps of 1985, Alan Johnston interpreted the record as relating to a group of slaves - recording either misthos (a rent paid to the slave's owner in return for leasing the slave) or apophora (a fixed and regular payment made from the slave to his or her owner from their earnings). I argue that the amounts of money recorded in this document are too minute to make sense on either of these scenarios, and that it is more likely that this text emanates from a private association, perhaps recording income that would be put towards a sacrifice, and which may have included (but was probably not wholly composed of) slaves. The file is under embargo from the press until 2024, so if you'd like a copy please email me.Save to LibraryDownloadby David  Lewis•  6  Ancient Greek History, Ancient Greek Epigraphy, Ancient Greek Economy, History of AccountancyPerformance of the Florentine Economy, 1494-1512: Moneys and AccountancyThis is the first in a series of studies of the Florentine economy from 1494 to 1512, a period of considerable political instability both at home and abroad.

The series begins in 1327-1328 and is the oldest in Friuli. The analysis of the codicological and linguistic characters shows the progressive evolution of the quaterni towards an increasingly organized model, even if not devoid of adaptations. The quaterni were part of a larger set of administrative documents used by the churchwardens: inventories, rolls, baptismal registers. The overall analysis of the documentation makes it possible to understand some social and religious implications of the life of Gemona in the Middle Ages. The churchwardens were all laymen and officers of the commune, while the clerics were excluded from office. The church was considered as one of the fundamental elements of organization of community life. The documentation of the churchwardens was one of the expressions of the public administration.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrea Tilatti•  20  Economic History, Medieval History, Manuscript Studies, Medieval Church History2016-El control del “Ministro de Hacienda” de Indias: el Marqués de Ensenada, las cuentas y las cajas americanas (1743-1754), De Computis, Revista Española de Historia de la Contabilidad, Diciembre 2016, núm. 25, pp. 35-64.El texto estudia las reformas iniciadas por el Marqués de Ensenada en el control contable de las Indias.

Det ble skilt mellom begrepene regnskapsmangel og malversasjon.

Beside this body of literature, the rich medieval documents written in Latin also contain abundant analysis on the keeping of these records. The legalists of this time have not written specific manual about the art of keeping these Accounts books or about a law that would have been special to them. Unfortunately, their numberless recommendations are scattered and contained in manuscripts very various and sometimes rare. However these sources are significant enough to try to limit them to those prior to 1494, date of the famous formalisation of the double entry Accounting proposed by Luca Pacioli. From this documentation still untapped by Accounting historians, we can try to identify a possible influence of the art of the double entry.Facing an efficient bookkeeping, the medieval jurists, foreign to the world of num- bers and to the one of commerce, felt some embarrassment. Bookkeeping impressed these intellectuals to the point of encouraging them to justify its origin, of deter- mining its rules, of defining its legal status and of establishing litigation concerning those records. The medieval legalists had just one reference model; which was the Ancient Rome one. So, they were going to use Roman law as a basis for thinking about Accounting technique that they observed in their own time. They will use both their own observations of practice and Roman law to legitimate uses of contemporary Merchants in order to measure, record and store their trade flows.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gérard MINAUD•  6  History of Medieval Accounting, Medieval Italy, History of Accounting Thought, Medieval EconomyNicolas Carrier, "Local Communities and Fiscal Reform in Late Medieval Savoy: Lords, Peasants, and Subsidies (transl.

The board of directors was essentially prudent and even pessimistic in presenting the accounts, so as to ensure an increased stability when the company had to face troubled times: in practical terms, the often very substantial hidden resources allowed to reduce volatility in results (and in dividends) and, at least in limited downturns, allowed the management to renounce practicing brutal disinvestments or lay-off of employees; the very prudent, systematically pessimistic way of presenting accounts protected also creditors' interests. In general, it gave rather good results, from the point of view of long-term entrepreneurial successes of companies. Also, this did not lead to significant misuses in terms of remuneration of top-managers: pessimistic presentations of annual results do not justify claims for excessive bonuses. It was not a perfect system: the hidden character of such reserves, quite typical for the Swiss cult of secret and confidentiality in business, does not comply with modern ideas on transparency. It is probably possible today to reach the same results as hidden reserves led to, if the boards of directors decide to build up visible (disclosed) provisions, what they should be allowed to do, for example, for contingent liabilities even of a low probability and for probable future expenses. Swiss accounting law permits such provisions as a principle. To the extent that " modern " accounting standards like IFRS and their followers do not allow such provisions, they may be considered to be detrimental and dangerous; principles other than the principle of prudence, like the religion of an allegedly “true and fair view”, are finally not scientific; they are largely illusory. Of course, building up visible provisions requires from the board – in contrast to hidden reserves – the courage to defend them towards impatient shareholders and tax authorities with their respective short-term appetites for high dividends and revenue. Prudence requires courage. This courageous prudence is a very practical and efficient instrument for companies that wish to implement the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility.

Peu après l’érection du duché de Gérone (janvier 1351), le roi d’Aragon dote en effet l’hôtel de son nourrisson d’administrateurs qui forment d’une part l’embryon de sa chancellerie, et d’autre part d’actifs services comptables sous la direction du dispenser et du scrivà de ració. Soumis aux mêmes procédures d’administration que l’hôtel royal, ils se livrent à un suivi bureaucratique des affaires princières, qui concerne aussi certains officiers domestiques. Comptes et inventaires produits en masse permettent un contrôle étroit des serviteurs de l’hôtel, par ses administrateurs mais aussi par le souverain.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexandra Beauchamp•  5  Courts, History of Medieval Accounting, Medieval Crown of Aragon, BureaucracyFiscal and legislative pressures on behalf of regulating private accounting in FranceSave to LibraryDownloadby Béatrice Touchelay•  4  Economic History, History of Social Policy and the Welfare State, History of Accountancy, History of taxationEcritures grises.

Les instruments de travail administratif en Europe méridionale (XIIe-XVIIe siècle) », cet atelier examine les usages des instruments répertoriés lors de la première rencontre tels que les formulaires, les listes, les inventaires, les questionnaires, les tablettes de compte, etc. En nous dégageant d’une vision utilitariste qui n’interrogerait que les fonctions abstraites assignées à ces instruments (information, réglementation, contrôle etc.), nous veillerons à partir de leurs usages concrets, différenciés, et parfois imprévus.Quatre axes seront privilégiés, pour autant d’actions administratives : compter, archiver/mémorialiser, enquêter/informer, et décider.L’objectif consiste à dévoiler les coulisses, longtemps délaissées par l’historiographie de l’État « moderne », des appareils de gouvernement que sont la Curie romaine, les chancelleries impériale, épiscopales, royales, mais aussi urbaines, qui peuplent l’Europe méridionale de la fin du Moyen Âge et de la première modernité. Il s’agira ainsi de faire ressortir la dimension la plus pragmatique du gouvernement et de l’administration, en nous focalisant sur les ressources et les techniques qui, à l’époque, en instrumentent l’action.Save to LibraryDownloadby Johann  Petitjean and +2Arnaud FossierClémence Revest•  36  Public Administration, Medieval History, Decision Making, Early Modern HistoryOltre la tavoletta: documenti archivistici dall’amministrazione mesopotamica del III millennio[Keywords: assyriology, Mesopotamia, cuneiform, neo-sumerian, Ur III, administrative texts, Umma, archaeology]Save to Libraryby Romina  Laurito•  14  Near Eastern Studies, Assyriology, Accounting, Accounting HistoryA Preliminary Examination of the Leeuwengroot as Mentioned in Medieval Accounts Part Two: Heynric de RodeAn examination of the 14th century accounts of Heynric de Rode and mentions of the leeuwengroot found therein.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul Torongo•  20  Late Middle Ages, Medieval History, Medieval Studies, MedievalThe Cistercian monk and the casting-counterSave to Libraryby William Day•  8  Economic History, Numismatics, History of Florence, Ecclesiastical Historyaccountants in discussion with economic theory and practical examination - a case study of balance sheet audit after the banking crisis in 1931As a consequence of the big economic crisis and banking crisis in 1931, german stock corporations were under legal obligation to carry out balance sheet audits by the new created professional group of accountants named... moreAs a consequence of the big economic crisis and banking crisis in 1931, german stock corporations were under legal obligation to carry out balance sheet audits by the new created professional group of accountants named “Wirtschaftsprüfer”. Analysing a balance sheet audit report of the Dresdner Bank of the financial year 1932, the author researchs how the audit and trust company Deutsche Revisions- und Treuhand Aktiengesellschaft realized the legal instructions in discussion with the economic auditing-literature making high demands. The accountants examined the report systematically and offered many important information to the supervisory board, while withholding own judgements.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ute Pothmann•  8  Economic History, Business History, Accounting, BankingCOST AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING IN PRE-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION SPAINIn traditional Anglo-Saxon accounting historiography the birth of sophisticated management accounting practices was dated at the end of the 19th century [Jonhson and Kaplan, 1987].

However, some more recent investigations have questioned this idea and demonstrate the existence of sophisticated management accounting and control techniques before the industrial revolution in differing contexts such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain. Fleischman and Parker [1991] have demonstrated that these practices were present in a significant number of British companies. However, evidence for Spain is based on isolated case studies. While case studies are essential to explain how these techniques were used, there has been no research to assess their frequency in Spain before the industrial revolution. By examining files concerning 13 large and mediumsized 18th century Spanish companies, this paper corroborates Fleischman and Parker's [1991] thesis. It reveals that knowledge of sophisticated cost accounting methods was fairly widespread in Spain during the 18th century. Interestingly, however, the knowledge and use of these techniques were not connected to economic success and to the industrial revolution, as was the case in the United Kingdom.Save to Libraryby Miriam Núñez Torrado•  2  History of Accountancy, History of Business Management    A Synopsis on Americanization of AccountingSave to LibraryDownloadby Asif Reza Akash•  2  Accounting, History of AccountancyRelated TopicsBankruptcy LawFollowFollowingEntrepreneurship and Management of InnovationFollowFollowingInsolvency LawFollowFollowingHotel and Restaurant ManagementFollowFollowingPersianFollowFollowingMughal HistoryFollowFollowingMultinational EnterprisesFollowFollowingMultinational CorporationsFollowFollowingMedieval Indian HistoryFollowFollowingAsianFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
