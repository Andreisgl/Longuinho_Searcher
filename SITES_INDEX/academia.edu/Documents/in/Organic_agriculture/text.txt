The present paper identifies for the first time the 111 attendees of that course. The list reveals that 'Koberwitzers', as they called themselves, were a well credentialed and capable group of individuals, some of whom went on to champion and develop Rudolf Steiner's ideas about agriculture and other fields. The present paper revises a prior analysis of the Koberwitzers. For each Koberwitzer, the list reveals, the name, hometown, occupation, and accommodation during the course. Thirty one percent of Koberwitzers were women. Thirty eight percent were associated directly with agriculture (including farmer, estate manager, and estate owner), 6% of attendees were creatives (including writer, author, artist and editor), and a further 6% were priests. These three occupational categories, viz. Agriculture, Creative and Priest, together account for 50% of Koberwitzer occupations (and 72% of the known occupations). There remains for further scholarship to populate gaps in the listing: the gender of one Koberwitzer remains unidentified; one hometown (and country) remains unidentified; 33 occupations remain unidentified; and 51 accommodations remain unidentified. At the time of the Koberwitz course, Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was mortally ill. The course was never repeated,. It was up to the Koberwitzers to progress Rudolf Steiner's call for the development of a differentiated natural agriculture without synthetic chemicals. The Koberwitzers met the call. There are now 251,842 certified biodynamic hectares in 55 countries, included in the 71,514,583 certified organic hectares in 186 countries.Save to LibraryDownloadby John  Paull, PhD•  20  History, Environmental Science, Anthroposophy, Organic agricultureDavranışsal Ekonomide Karar Verme Süreçlerinin AnaliziKamu politikalarıyla Türkiye’de bireylerin davranışlarını iyi yönde değiştirmek; refah düzeyini yükseltmek; daha sağlıklı bireyler olmalarını sağlayacak bir yaşam tarzı ve alışkanlıklar kazandırmaktır. - Tüketici davranışlarını... moreKamu politikalarıyla Türkiye’de bireylerin davranışlarını iyi yönde değiştirmek; refah düzeyini yükseltmek; daha sağlıklı bireyler olmalarını sağlayacak bir yaşam tarzı ve alışkanlıklar kazandırmaktır.- Tüketici davranışlarını değiştirmeye yönelik geliştirilen politikalar,- Toplumda sigara kullanımını azaltmaya yönelik önlemler,- Tarımsal alanlarda aşırı kimyasal girdi kullanımını engellemeye yönelik tedbirler,Save to LibraryDownloadby rizkina aulawiah•  7  Organic agriculture, Consumer Behavior, Behavioral Economics, Tüketici DavranışlarıMETHODS OF GRAIN DRYINGSo far, drying systems have not been classified systematically.

However, drying methods can be broadly classified on the basis of either the mode of heat transfer to the wet solid or the handling characteristics and physical properties of the wet material. The first method of classification reveals differences in dryer design and operation, while the second method is most useful in the selection of a group of dryers for preliminary consideration in a given drying problem. According to the mode of heat transfer, drying methods can be divided into: (a) conduction drying, (b) convection drying, and (c) radiation drying. There are other methods of drying also, namely, dielectric drying, chemical or sorption drying, vacuum dryi ng, freeze drying, etc. Of them, convection drying is commonly used for drying of all types of grain and conduction drying can be employed for drying of parboiled grain. Conduction drying When the heat for drying is transferred to the wet solid mainly by conduction through a solid surface (usually metallic) the phenomenon is known as conduction or contact drying. In this method, conduction is the principal mode of heat transfer and the vaporised moisture is removed independently of the heating media. Conduction drying is characterised by: (a) Heat transfer to the wet solid takes place by conduction through a solid surface, usually metallic. The source of heat may be hot water, steam, flue gases, hot oil, etc.; (b) Surface temperatures may vary widely; (c) Contact dryers can be operated under low pressure and in inert atmosphere; (d) Dust and dusty materials can be removed very effectively; and (e) When agitation is done, more uniform dried product and increased drying rate are achieved by using conduction drying. Conduction drying can be carried out either continuously or batch-wise. Cylinder dryers, drum dryers, steam tube rotary dryers are some of the continuous conduction dryers. Vacuum tray dryers, freeze dryers, agitated pan dryers are the examples of batc h conduction dryers. Convection drying In convection drying, the drying agent (hot gases) in contact with the wet solid is used to supply heat and carry away the va porised moisture and the heat is transferred to the wet solid mainly by convection. The characteristics of convection drying are: (a) Drying is dependent upon the heat transfer from the drying agent to the wet material, the former being the carrier of vaporis ed moisture; (b) Steam heated air, direct flue gases of agricultural waste, etc., can be used as drying agents; (c) Drying temperature varies widely; (d) At gas temperatures below the boiling point, the vapour content of the gas affects the drying rate and the final moisture content of the solid; (e) If the atmospheric humidities are high, natural air drying needs dehumidification; and (f) Fuel consumption per kg of moisture evaporated is always higher than that of conduction drying. Convection drying is most popular in grain drying. It can be carried out either continuously or batch-wise. Continuous tray dryers, continuous sheeting dryers, pneumatic conveying dryers, rotary dryers, tunnel dryers come under the continuous system, wherea s tray and compartment dryers, batch through circulation dryers are the batch dryers. Convection drying can be further classified as follows: Pneumatic or fluidised bed drying: When the hot gas (drying agent) is supplied at a velocity higher than the terminal velocity of the wet solid, the drying of the wet solid occurs in a suspended or fluidised state. This phenomenon is known as fluidised bed drying. Drying may be carried out in a semi-suspended state or spouted bed condition also. Generally, the convection drying is conducted under ordinary state, i.e., drying agent is supplied at a velocity much lower than the terminal velocity of the wet m aterial. In natural air drying, the unheated air as supplied by the nature is utilized. In drying with supplemental heat just sufficient amount of heat (temperature rise within 5 to 10°C) only, is supplied to the drying air to reduce its relative humidity so that drying can ta ke place. In heated air drying, the drying air is heated to a considerable extent. The natural air drying and drying with supplemental heat methods which may require one to four weeks or even more to reduce the grain moisture content to safe levels, are generally used to dry grain for short-term storage in the farm. Heated air drying is most useful when large quantity of grain is to be dried within a short time and marketed at once. It is used for both short and long-term storage. Comparative advantages and disadvantages of the three convective drying methods are given as follows: NATURAL AIR DRYING: Advantages: (1) Lowest initial investment and maintenance cost. (2) No fuel cost. (3) No fire hazard. (4) Least supervision. (5) Least mould growth compared to supplemental heat. Disadvantages: (1) Very slow drying rate, drying period may be extended to several weeks. (2) Weather dependent. (3) More drying space necessary in comparison to heated air drying. (4) Useful particularly for short-term storage in the farm. (5) Not useful for humid tropics. SUPPLIMENTAL HEAT DRYING: Advantages: (1) Lower cost of equipment and maintenance. (2) Independent of weather. (3) Requires less supervision. (4) Most Convection drying Drying under Fluidised state Drying under Spouted bed condition Drying under ordinary state Natural / unheated air drying Heated air drying Air drying with supplemental heatSave to LibraryDownloadby Divyansh Sharma•  16  Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Agricultural Engineering, Soil ScienceFüsun Tezcan,  Börtü Böcek İçin Doğa Dostu Öneriler ve Ev Yapımı İlaçlar. bortu.bocek2011@gmail.com; http://www.pandora.com.tr/Satın almak için (http://www.pandora.com.tr/) adresini ziyaret edebilir ya da bortu.bocek2011@gmail.com adresine yazabilirsiniz!

With reference to the edaphic and climatic conditions encountered at a hazel plantation in Piedmont, Italy, this study examines these challenges in great detail, and presents a novel phytosociological approach to the analysis of suitable truffle habitat. Ellenberg Indicator Values for T. melanosporum are derived, and then used to quantitatively explain the link between Vitis vinifera, the common grape vine, and T. melanosporum habitats. The significance of a locally-udic moisture regime for T. melanosporum development is also explored. Important new cultural procedures, including the potential of host tree early-season defruiting to achieve enhanced mycelial and ascocarp growth, are introduced. The latest version discusses the significance of humus forms, and of the 'mesoMull/oligoMull boundary' in particular, in greater detail.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gerald C. B.

Different pruning regimes affect the nutrient content as the amount of biomass produced by many multipurpose trees. In this study, the aboveground biomass (both fresh and dry matter) production and nitrogen content in Gliricidia sepium under different pruning regimes (4, 8 and 12 weeks) was studied. The study was carried out in the demonstration farm of Department of Agroforestry in the Faculty of Renewable Natural Resources-KNUST. A total of nine (9) Gliricidia trees were selected. The pruning frequencies were assigned to the selected trees, after an initial pruning of 1.2m from the ground. The data collected include; new fresh weight, dry weight and nitrogen content at the various pruning time. Also, the amount of nitrogen (N) in the new biomass was estimated at each pruning time. The result shows that the aboveground biomass production increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks regime. Overall nitrogen concentration increased from 2.61% to 3.58% upon reducing the pruning frequency from 4 to 12 weeks, and total nitrogen content was much higher in 12 weeks (36.01g) than in the other pruning frequencies, due to biomass production been larger. In conclusion, the study highlights the potential of Gliricidia biomass as a source of N and green manure for both agricultural and agroforestry purposes. Hence pruning regime of Gliricidia should be considered in managing it for nutrient and manure purposes.Save to Libraryby CHRISTIAN TETTEY AGBANA•  13  Agronomy, Organic agriculture, Agroforestry, Environment and natural resources conservationHazardous Impacts of Pesticide Usage on Farmer's Health in Cotton Growing Region of District Muzaffargarh, PakistanPesticides are the chemicals used to control the crop harms by killing the pests causing various diseases in crop plants, thereby playing vital role in yield and crop production.

The ingredients of these chemical pesticides are not only lethal to target arthropods but also for human beings. Therefore, the aim of present study was to find out the perception about the impacts of various pesticide usage on the health of cotton growing farmers in rural areas of District Muzaffargarh, Pakistan. Three villages were selected purposively and 130 farmers were approached to perform a questionnaire via face to face interview. Our findings revealed that a major proportion of the respondents (56.9%) were agreed that pesticides cause illness in cotton growing farmers. The results showed the perceptions of respondents that pesticides were responsible to cause various diseases to a great extent in farmers, like increase in headache (48.5%), fatigue (40.0%), insomnia (45.4%), dizziness (37.7%), hand tremors (42.3%), skin disorders (46.9%), birth defects (36.2%), damage of liver (37.7%), damage of kidney (43.8%), respiratory problems (56.9%) and cancer (29.2%). Our results showed non-significant association between age and impacts of pesticide usage on cotton growing farmer’s health. It was illustrated that health issues were significantly correlated with education, income, lack of awareness, lack of precautionary measures and lack of facilities or personal protective equipment (PPE).There is need to implement risk reduction strategies and to arrange formal training sessions to address the proper use and storage of pesticides.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pacific International Journal and +1sajjad ali•  8  Chemical Engineering, Organic agriculture, Crop Modeling, AgricultureA Novel Approach to Autonomous Farming RobotCitation/Export MLA Ronak Mistry, Kishan Malaviya, Harsh Kotak, Harshil Bhatt, Urvi Patel, “A Novel Approach to Autonomous Farming Robot”, April 15 Volume 3 Issue 4 , International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and... moreCitation/Export MLA Ronak Mistry, Kishan Malaviya, Harsh Kotak, Harshil Bhatt, Urvi Patel, “A Novel Approach to Autonomous Farming Robot”, April 15 Volume 3 Issue 4 , International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication (IJRITCC), ISSN: 2321-8169, PP: 2362 - 2366, DOI: 10.17762/ijritcc2321-8169.1604127 APA Ronak Mistry, Kishan Malaviya, Harsh Kotak, Harshil Bhatt, Urvi Patel, April 15 Volume 3 Issue 4, “A Novel Approach to Autonomous Farming Robot”, International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication (IJRITCC), ISSN: 2321-8169, PP: 2362 - 2366, DOI: 10.17762/ijritcc2321-8169.1604127Save to Libraryby HARSH KOTAK•  19  Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Robotics, Control Systems EngineeringKupdf.net irctc ticket formatSave to LibraryDownloadby Rohit Mehla•Organic agricultureProceedings of the First International Conference on Intelligent Human Computer InteractionSave to LibraryDownloadby Tanveer Siddiqui•  28  Engineering, Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, NursingWhy Go Organic 1Save to LibraryDownloadby Anthony Orpen•  2  Organic agriculture, Veganism (Anthropology)Proceedings of the First International Conference on Aquaculture NutritionSave to LibraryDownloadby Nathan Felix•  33  Engineering, Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Earth SciencesPeri-Urban Agriculture in the Metropolitan Area of Rabat, Morocco: Potentials and ConstraintsSave to LibraryDownloadby Fatiha Hakimi•  8  Organic agriculture, Agricultural Economics, Agriculture, MoroccoResearch-based innovation strategy and the New Zealand pipfruit industryThe New Zealand pipfruit industry takes around twenty years to develop a new apple variety up to full commercial production.

There is therefore an expansion in its production and processing. Peeling usually precedes most processing operations which makes it very essential. This machine is part of the efforts to mechanize cassava peeling to meet growing demands. The machine uses the abrasive mechanism to peel cassava roots in batches and is driven by an R.165 (6.5hp) diesel engine. Performance evaluation revealed that the machine could peel an average of 30kg cassava roots in 38s at an operating speed of 715 rpm; peel the same weight for 47s and 52s at 652 and 524 rpm respectively. The machine has an average throughput capacity of 0.790, 0.683 and 0.577 kg/s for operating speeds 715, 652 and 524 rpm respectively. Average peeling efficiency of 72.67, 63.83 and 57.67% was obtained for 715, 652 and 524 rpm respectively.

This study focused on the determination of the crop growing stages and coefficient K c allowing the irrigation of Chrysanthellum indicum, an herbaceous threatened plant frequently used in herbal medicine against heart and kidney diseases. To obtain the K c , three steps were undertaken. First, a weather station provided the variables needed to calculate the reference evapotranspiration ET 0. Secondly, to ascertain scientifically the results, the experiment runs nine lysimeters to determine the crop maximum evapotranspiration ETM. A well-drained loam with 8.1±1.6% of organic matter content was used within the replications. The water-balance providing ETM used irrigation I and drainage D measured every two days. Finally, the definition ETM loc = K c ·ET 0 was applied after the transformation of ETM into local ETM loc. The results showed that the triplet {stage name; stage duration (days); crop coefficient (K c)} values are respectively {initial; 28; 0.7±0.1}; {development; 17; 0.7-1.4±0.2}; {mid-season; 20; 1.4±0.2} and {late-season; 14; 0.7±0.04}. The total growing period was found as 79 days. These results offer the possibility for a water-efficient production of Chrysanthellum indicum in the dry season.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ijoabs An Open Access Journal•  5  Organic agriculture, Agricultural Economics, Agriculture, EvapotranspirationIntegrated Marketing System for Family Farming Products / Sistema Integrado de Comercialização para Produtos da Agricultura FamiliarSmall farmers suffer from several competitive disadvantages.

One of these disadvantages is the lack of informational tools to assist them in the marketing process. Thus, the Technical Solidarity Center (Soltec / NIDES / UFRJ) began the development of the Integrated Marketing System for Family Farming Products (SIPAF). The purpose of this work is, in this context, to work on the development of support systems for family farming markets products. To this end, a dialogue was initiated with the Terra Crioula fair (https://www.facebook.com/TerraCrioulaMST/), which sells agroecological Farm Share basket and takes place every two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. What was previously done manually was replaced by the site http://cesta.repos.net.br, where interested customers register and can buy the products they want. In this article, we analyze the development of this system, the results presented so far and the future perspectives of the project.----Save to LibraryDownloadby Celso Alvear•  7  Engineering, Organic agriculture, Sustainable agriculture, Social JusticeIntegrating the environmental and economic consequences of converting to organic agriculture: evidence from a case studySave to LibraryDownloadby Les Firbank•  14  Organic agriculture, Sustainable agriculture, Agricultural Policy, MultidisciplinaryNeg Brief: GMO Crop InsuranceStoa Debate Neg Brief for 2016/17 TP RezSave to LibraryDownloadby Justin Burnett•Organic agricultureBioConcens: Biomass and bioenergy production in organic agriculture–consequences for soil fertility, environment, spread of animal parasites and socio-economySave to LibraryDownloadby Tommy  Dalgaard•  5  Organic agriculture, Organic Farming, Fossil Fuels, Soil FertilityPESQUISA DE MERCADO - ORGANIC FERTILIZERSave to LibraryDownloadby Estevão Schuh•  2  Organic agriculture, Market ResearchEvaluation of cotton waste, paper waste and jatropha cake for culture of Pleurotus sajor-caju under different pasteurization methodsSave to LibraryDownloadby Marphios Shamuyarira•  5  Organic agriculture, Sustainable agriculture, Environmental Sustainability, Mushroom productionInvestigating Organic Manure and Inorganic Fertilizer for Sustainable Maize (Zea mays) Production in Southwestern NigeriaAim: This research investigated the utilization of livestock manure as nutrient source in maize farming.

This model is build on the causal interrelations between the concepts of techno-economic network and increasing returns. Increasing returns' exploitation behaviors and the evolution of the scares resources, resulting from this same exploitation, are central in this model. Each step of this reflexion is illustrated by the organic agriculture example. We show its networks and its increasing returns. Finally, we explain the transformation processes of the organic agriculture networks.

Chickens and geese were compatible with the system but provided different benefits and had different requirements. Chickens were omnivorous and highly active throughout the day, and dispersed throughout the available area. In contrast, geese were strictly herbivorous and less active, and usually remained close to their coop and water source. Geese substantially reduced vegetation biomass under the trees and around the potatoes without damaging either crop. Chickens reduced noncrop vegetation biomass slightly but also consumed several insect species, including Japanese beetle and Colorado potato beetle. Factors influencing the feasibility of integrating domestic chickens or geese into agroecosystems are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sean Clark•  4  Agroecology, Organic agriculture, Permaculture, Integrated Pest ManagementDe la société civile au mouvement social - géographie d'une redistribution des cadres institutionnels de gouvernance des communs.

Cette double approche propose dans un premier temps une prise de recul sur les diverses motivations et compositions des luttes foncières citoyennes et paysannes actuelles en France. Puis l’analyse se concentre sur les actions foncières et les structures-outils internes qui sont le coeur de métier de ce réseau national : l’enjeu de favoriser une montée en compétence de militant.e.s et d’habitant.e.s, hors du monde agricole et du monde du développement territorial, sur la gestion collective de fermes : comme par exemple le diagnostic foncier (terres et bâtis) de bénévoles en vue de l’acquisition ou encore l’évaluation des conséquences des pratiques de fermier.ère.s dans le temps sur le sol ou le paysage. Cette description des modes d’action et de mobilisation actuels permet de montrer que cette gestion collective construit les « Fermes TDL » comme des « performances » foncières, de luttes et de soins (care). L’enjeu de ces collectifs est in fine de répondre aux problèmes de l’accès et de la transmission d’exploitations agricoles dites « paysannes » et quant à leurs usages, de multiplier les engagements contractuels ou moraux avec les collectivités locales et surtout avec les fermier.ère.s preneur.euse.s de baux, sur des pratiques environnementales, alimentaires, écologiques et territoriales, – telles qu’elles sont promues par l’« agriculture citoyenne » encore émergente. Ces fermes sont co-construites (TDL et partenaires) comme des communs environnementaux et territoriaux inaliénables, reconnus comme tels partout en France. Dans leurs ancrages aux territoires, ces dispositifs fermiers sont donc aussi des lieux d’enrôlements d’acteurs locaux agissant sur les questions foncières, agricoles ou d’aménagement du territoire, invités à rejoindre le collectif en vue de répondre aux enjeux d’une gestion collective de long terme en bien commun de fermes à transmettre dédiées aux circuits cours de proximité et à l’entretien du paysage. L’aménagement du territoire apparaît comme un point de passage obligé des actions de TDL dans la mesure où les actions collectives, – notamment l’installation d’agriculteur.trice.s dans le cadre d’un cahier des charges et la réparation de droits sur le foncier –, ne peuvent se renouveler que dans la perspective d’une « territorialité du commun ». Cette analyse repose sur trois fermes qui composent l’étude de cas, dont la comparaison retient les dimensions politique, culturelle et identitaire des actions collectives engagées localement, ainsi que leurs traductions « sociotechniques ».Save to LibraryDownloadby Lombard Pascal•  20  Anthropology, Long Term Care, Organic agriculture, Karl PolanyiCan Medicine Learn from Organic Agriculture?We associate organics with sound environmental stewardship and improvement of the quality of life and social justice for those participating.

Generally in Indonesia sago is only used as a staple food for the daily life of the family as a companion to rice. However, some region in Indonesia uses sago as the main staple food source, such as in Maluku, Papua, parts of Sulawesi such as East Kolaka. The purpose of this study is to examine in depth the production and productivity of sago plants in the East Kolaka Regency. The study was conducted in the East Kolaka Regency of Southeast Sulawesi Province in 2018. The respondents of this study were 203 sago farmers. The study uses a quantitative approach with a combination of survey methods with quantitative and qualitative descriptive data analysis. The results showed that sago production in East Kalimantan in each year ranged from 119 sacks/ year - 363 sacks/ year or equivalent to 2,161 kg / yr-6,606 kg /yr. The highest average sago starch production is in the Poniponiki village, which is 6,606 kg /yr. While the lowest production is in the Ladongi village, 2,161 kg/ yr. The highest productivity was found in Alaaha village, which was 7.7 tons /ha/ yr while the lowest productivity was 2.5 tons /ha/ yr in Ladongi village. Sago plant productivity in East Kalimantan shows quite good productivity for the condition of sago cultivation that is still extractive tautology. This shows that when sago plantations are used in the improvement of sago plant technology in East Kalimantan, they will provide productivity far higher than current production.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology IJSRST•  4  Organic agriculture, Sustainable agriculture, Agriculture, Impacts Of Climatic Change On AgricultureStatus of the fall armyworm [Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.

The use of alternative energy has become an excellent option of self-sufficiency for private companies and a way to lower the electricity bill and a way start a path toward a low carbon national energy system. The present study analyzed the market of biomass for energy purposes in Guanacaste. The study comprised the biomass market in the region, taking the area of Abangares as the forest core and evaluating forest plantations (supply) and corporate biomass consumers (demand) in a 100 km radius from the production core. The assessment of the offer was based on data queried from FONAFIFO and potential projections of plantation waste; for its part, the demand was obtained through surveys and characterizations of companies that currently consume biomass. The results showed that the dominant species in reforestation was Tectona grandis with a 40.3 % of the total area planted in the region, followed by Gmelina arborea with 13.2 % and with a potentially annual generation of waste greater than 98 000 ton for T. grandis and 44 000 ton for G. arborea. On the other hand, demand showed a capacity of over 250 000 ton/year, being that currently, 48 % is supplied by fossil fuels and only 15.1% by forest biomass (usually chips). Analyzing the financial impact of the possible fuel change by biomass, savings of over 50% are found; however, it was also found the limitation that existing biomass (forest management waste) would not be enough to supply more than 57 % of the current market.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alonso  Ulloa Leiton•  5  Organic agriculture, Environmental Sustainability, Solid Waste Management, MexicoAgricultura orgânica e agronegócio: análise e impactos de tecnologias sustentáveisA produção agropecuária e florestal no Brasil apresenta um desenvolvimento crescente desde meados do século passado, mas a grande aceleração nesse desenvolvimento veio após o grande investimento em pesquisa, assistência técnica e crédito... moreA produção agropecuária e florestal no Brasil apresenta um desenvolvimento crescente desde meados do século passado, mas a grande aceleração nesse desenvolvimento veio após o grande investimento em pesquisa, assistência técnica e crédito rural para a produção primária, efetuado pelo governo federal e também do grande investimento da iniciativa privada no desenvolvimento da indústria de máquinas, equipamentos, insumos e da indústria da transformação da produção primária. O desenvolvimento da agropecuária brasileira seguiu os passos da agropecuária americana, nosso principal fornecedor de tecnologia, de insumos e de equipamentos. (MAZOYER e ROUDART, 2010). A necessidade de rápido desenvolvimento com vastas áreas a serem ocupadas forçou o Brasil na direção de uma agropecuária intensiva em capital e tecnologia, para poder ocupar e tirar proveito das grandes áreas disponíveis. Essa pressão inconscientemente desestimulou a produção sustentável e o extrativismo, que até então constituía o principal portfólio de nossas práticas agropecuárias, restando atualmente poucos exemplos desse tipo de produção e uma grande dificuldade para sua retomada. Em países da Europa esse desenvolvimento aconteceu de forma mais pensada, e atualmente na Europa e na Índia, (Ásia), encontram-se bons exemplos de produção agropecuáriaSave to LibraryDownloadby Joao Paulo Guimarães Soares•  3  Organic agriculture, Organic Farming, Organic/natural crop and animal production3.-Syamsu-Wirman (httpjurnal.lppm-umsb.comwp-contentuploads2015033.-Syamsu-Wirman.pdf).pdfActivityField Work Experience-Learningfor Community Empowerment(KKN-PPM) has beenimplemented, whichaimstoincrease farmers' incomeby producingorganikfertilizerfromagriculturalwasteusedforfertilizingcrops.
