In the Internet age, immigrants, even within the host country, have the option of selecting information for consumption, selecting the topic for discussion in the public virtual sphere, but also to disseminate information. Through social networks these individuals discuss different issues in society. Using these networks a certain image for the host country is often created. Though the image of a country is created from readings in schools and not only, through media, visits, etc., however discussions within various forums online and in closed facebook groups create the possibility of demonizing a country for religious reasons or cultivating the feeling of victimization within immigrants. The research question here is what is the role of this online communication where different groups or forums promote the language of hatred, intolerance and extremism? Through the survey of some online forums in Kosovo where debates are held for religious issues, the findings prove that online media has today enabled the creation of ghetto communication groups. These online communication ghettos spur the extremist spirit by refusing to communicate with other ghettos that deal with issues of general interest or that could also affect the mitigation of negative attitudes towards the host country. Interconnection between these communicative pockets in cyberspace is a challenge both for fighting hate speech and safety in general.Download Free PDFView PDFThe 7th STS Italia Conference “Technoscience from Below”Informal Progressive Collaboration with Bureaucratic Public Bodies and Power Asymmetry: A Case of Public Procurement for Innovation (PPI)2018 • Najmoddin Yazdi, ALI MALEKIDegree of collaboration among stakeholders (suppliers, procurer, buyers, users and innovation intermediator) is an important factor in differentiating different types of Public procurement for innovation (PPI). The present paper tries to shed light on reasons behind the unsuccessfulness of the informal collaboration of an innovation intermediator with a bureaucratic large public body (Iranian Ministry of Petroleum) in a technology-transfer-oriented PPI case in oil and gas industry of Iran. In 2015, The Research Institute for Science, Technology and Industry Policy (RISTIP) was asked by the public procurer to help it as an innovation intermediator with the logic, design and implementation of the innovation procurement, but with limited and blurred boundaries of responsibilities due to the newness of the initiative. Due to the blurriness and newness of the project, and also the character of RISTIP members, the RISTIP semi-voluntarily and gradually got involved into an informal collaboration with the public procurer to save the first-of-its-kind initiative in Iran. Progressively, it was felt that due to the power asymmetry and organizational culture of the public procurer, such an informal progressive collaboration on blurred lines of responsibilities and expectations would negatively affect the whole PPI process and innovation collaboration. Opportunistic behavior of the public staff coupled with the developing context of the country were postulated as the important outcome and contextual factor, respectively. Keywords: Progressive Informal Collaboration; Public Procurement for Innovation (PPI); Boundaries of Responsibilities; Bureaucratic Public Organizations.Download Free PDFView PDFPopular power vs economic necessity in centre-periphery conflictsValerio  LastricoIl tema del potere popolare, titolare di diritto ma non di fatto della sovranità, pare esser diventato un nodo all’interno delle democrazie occidentali dopo l’abbandono di una visione socialdemocratica o keynesiana di welfare state e l’apparente vittoria del neoliberismo. Modello, questo, che pare proporsi costantemente quale ricetta efficiente e veloce, lontana dalle lungaggini del confronto democratico, alle periodiche situazioni di emergenza economica. Non è un caso che, nella situazione di crisi degli ultimi anni, il principale oggetto di blaming nella retorica di gruppi, movimenti e partiti che si pongono quali espressione diretta del popolo contro la “casta” della politica rappresentativa, sia proprio quello del furto di sovranità popolare da parte di tecnocrati che, sulla scorta di pressanti imperativi economici, svuotano di significato il potere del popolo attraverso azioni dipinte come autoritarie (governi tecnici, governi del Presidente, governi “non eletti”, svuotamento del Parlamento, perdita di sovranità in favore di organismi internazionali non controllati dal popolo…). Quello della necessità economica, in effetti, è sempre stato un classico “stato d’eccezione”. Al presentarsi di situazioni eccezionali, notava Schmitt, i poteri previsti in situazioni “normali” vengono sospesi secondo modalità che, per quanto emergenziali ed eventuali, sono previste all’interno dell’ordinamento (Agamben 2003). Secondo una visione di questo tipo, il potere non starebbe nelle orme costituzionali che attribuiscono formalmente la sovranità al popolo, ma nell’effettivo funzionamento dello Stato. Su queste basi già Romano affermava che è la necessità, non la norma, a costituire la fonte primigenia del potere. Similmente, per Schmitt (1972, 33) «sovrano è chi decide sullo stato d’eccezione», rendendo palese la vera essenza dell’autorità solitamente latente e negata: sospensione del potere popolare che, lungi dall’essere negazione della regola, rivela il vero titolare del potere. Se la necessità economica rappresenta un tipico elemento legittimante per lo svuotamento di potere popolare in vista di decisioni rapide prese sulla base dell’expertise, allo stesso modo tutti quei settori visti come possibile volano strategico della crescita quantitativa paiono subire la medesima sorte. In questo paper si prende in considerazione, dal punto di vista dell’analisi teorica (stato d’eccezione, deliberazione) ma con continui riferimenti a casi concreti (Ilva di Taranto, TAV Torino-Lione), uno dei più significativi fra questi settori: quello delle politiche ambientali (infrastrutturali, industriali) che più sono legate allo scoppio di conflitti territoriali. La scelta deriva dal fatto che, visto il quadro di direttive europee e la necessità di superare situazioni conflittuali di stallo decisionale, tale settore viene presentato retoricamente come governato da una logica che impone di andare oltre il tradizionale modello rappresentativo, in cui chi ottiene l’investitura popolare ha anche il diritto-dovere di decidere in tempi brevi per dimostrare la propria abilità operativa, e di conciliare piuttosto modelli solitamente visti come contrapposti, quali quelli di valutazioni e controlli “tecnocratici”, esperti e indipendenti da pressioni politiche, e di condivisione partecipativa con tutti i possibili stakeholders territoriali, anche scomodi o dotati di minore peso politico come le popolazioni locali non organizzate. Fuor di retorica, tuttavia, la preminenza della necessità economica sulle procedure standard è massima proprio in ambito ambientale, solitamente concepito in termini di trade-off rispetto alle scelte economiche, e in ambito territoriale, visto come egoisticamente arroccato nella difesa locale contro il preminente “interesse nazionale”. In tal senso non stupisce come, pur in presenza di continui richiami partecipativi, in realtà lo stesso controllo popolare di tipo rappresentativo venga aggirato per motivi di necessità e urgenza (tanto più in condizioni di crisi) attraverso procedure straordinarie semplificate (Legge Obiettivo 2001, Decreto anticrisi 2008, Decreto Sblocca Italia 2014), definite dai movimenti sociali nati per contrapporsi a tali scelte, ma spesso anche dagli stessi amministratori locali, come accentratrici, top-down, autoritarie. Il che è tanto più grave laddove svuota il potere popolare non solo negando la pur tanto sbandierata retorica partecipativa, ma anche la possibilità di controllo attraverso le rappresentanze locali elette. Il paper intende pertanto tentare di rispondere alla questione di cosa significhi potere popolare nelle situazioni caratterizzate da conflitti territoriali, dove sono continuamente in gioco tensioni (Bobbio 1999; Douglas e Wildavsky 1983) tra sovranità popolare formalmente prevista e sovranità “d’emergenza”, fra rappresentanza e deliberazione (in particolare fra aspirazioni partecipative dei movimenti sociali nati dalla contestazione e prerogative di mediazione portate avanti tanto dai partiti che appoggiano le scelte “autoritarie” dell’esecutivo, quanto dagli amministratori locali che pretendono di incanalare le richieste di coinvolgimento territoriale su binari rappresentativi), fra retorica del decentramento decisionale e accentramento delle scelte strategiche per l’interesse nazionale, fra partecipazione politica ed expertise tecn(ocrat)ica.Download Free PDFView PDFGJ #2015, 1, Transparency and participation in the global polity: lessons learned from food and water governance.

Internet and social media have given new strength to social activism and in the process have laid the path for a new form of govern-ance model – open, consultative and inclusive. India has witnessed social movements that have resulted in significant policy related decision making. In the recent times, such social movements have gained much of its momentum through internet and social media. In this essay, three social movements from India are compared and analysed through case study research in order to draw attention to the growing prevalence of a new form of open consultative policy making process that is both leading to a learning experience for the networked society and also creating newer responsibilities for citizens. The three social movements analysed are the Right to Information Act movement (2005); the India Against Corruption movement (2011); and the Net neutrality movement (2015). The case studies are analysed in terms of their unique features of fostering deliberative democracy under the possible influence of internet and social media. The case studies generate data that could be used to study similar practices with a global comparative perspective.Download Free PDFView PDFDigitalization of old media and new opportunities for social researchAndrea RubinThe social sciences rise to the challenge of «datification». The recent ICT technology development have increased the amount of info potentially available for social research. The interactions present everyday in social networks site are the privilege object of analysis of the computational social sciences. Analysis of interactions in social network have monopolized the methodological debate and empirical research. Beside the growing role of social networking platforms, there is the effort to digitize the most important collections of texts in the world (newspaper, libraries, collections, etc.). In particular, daily press started a fast digitalization process. The digitization of millions of texts presents an opportunity still too often overlooked. This small contribution represents a first draft to open a critical discourse on the advantages and limitations of computational social science that use journalistic texts as the main source of data. Furthermore, it highlights how the issue of Big Data brings to the assumption of a new "paradigm" for the social sciences that definitively determine the road to a new methodological synergy.Download Free PDFView PDFMasculine Bodies and Sexual Purity.

The approach of cultural mobilities suggested in this paper addresses the culturally and socially constructed aspect of modern mobilities through the lived experience of the immigrants themselves and studying within the specific social and economic contexts where it occurs. Ethnographer’s work is to follow mobile practices of immigrants, adopting a multi-sited approach, in order to capture all of their experience without distinguishing 'here' and 'there' which in modern times seem blurred, due to frequent movements, unforeseen paths and economic instability of countries. The case study of Albanian immigrants who work seasonally in Greece (Corinth) and often move inside the country in order to find work due to the economic crisis and visit several times a year their home to maintain their links with their relatives or other family matters demonstrates that the distinction between country of origin and destination obscured in contemporary times. Τhe mobilities of people affected by the economic and social conditions of countries thus seal the uncertainty of their future plans. These complex circumstances create mobilities; both of them are overlapping notions and must be studied togetherDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
