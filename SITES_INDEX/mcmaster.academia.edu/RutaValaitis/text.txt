A Questionnaire for Assessing Community Health Nurses’ Learning NeedsWestern Journal of Nursing Research,  2010Learning needs assessment is an important stage of every educational process that aims to inform ... more Learning needs assessment is an important stage of every educational process that aims to inform changes in practice and policy for continuing professional development. Professional competencies have been widely used as a basis for the development of learning needs assessment. The Canadian Community Health Nursing Standards of Practices (CCHN Standards) were released in 2003. However, it is not known whether community health nurses (CHNs) have the educational background to enable them to meet these standards. This article reports on the development of a learning needs assessment questionnaire for CHNs. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine the consistency of factors underpinning the CCHN Standards. Also, validity and reliability of the questionnaire were evaluated using appropriate techniques. This process resulted in a valid and reliable CHN learning needs assessment questionnaire to measure learning needs of large groups of practitioners, where oth...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There is limited research on how public health policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention - in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers&#39;, managers&#39; and senior managements&#39; perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants.

Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality [Health TAPESTRY] is a primary care intervention aimed at supporting older adults that involves trained volunteers, interprofessional teams, technology, and system navigation. This paper examines implementation of Health TAPESTRY in relation to interprofessional teamwork including volunteers.MethodsThis study applied Normalization Process Theory (NPT) and used a descriptive qualitative approach [1] embedded in a mixed-methods, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. It was situated in two primary care practice sites in a large urban setting in Ontario, Canada. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with primary care providers, clinical managers, administrative assistants, volunteers, and a volunteer coordinator. Data was collected at 4 months (June–July 2015) and 12 months (February–March 2016) after intervention start-up. Patients were interviewed at the end of the six-month intervention. Field notes were taken at weekly huddle meetings.ResultsOverall, 84 participants were included in 17 focus groups and 13 interviews; 24 field notes were collected. Themes were organized under four NPT constructs of implementation: 1) Coherence- (making sense/understanding of the program’s purpose/value) generating comprehensive assessments of older adults; strengthening health promotion, disease prevention, and self-management; enhancing patient-focused care; strengthening interprofessional care delivery; improving coordination of health and community services. 2) Cognitive Participation- (enrolment/buy-in) tackling new ways of working; attaining role clarity. 3) Collective Action- (enactment/operationalizing) changing team processes; reconfiguring resources. 4) Reflective Monitoring- (appraisal) improving teamwork and collaboration; reconfiguring roles and processes.ConclusionsThis study contributes key strategies for effective implementation of interventions involving interprofessional primary care teams. Findings indicate that regular communication among all team members, the development of procedures and/or protocols to support team processes, and ongoing review and feedback are critical to implementation of innovations involving primary care teams.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, no. {"type":"clinical-trial","attrs":{"text":"NCT02283723","term_id":"NCT02283723"}}NCT02283723 November 5, 2014.

The aim of this study was to shed light on how adults in two small towns of rural Ontario experience social capital in their daily lives, and to contribute to the broader literature about the relationship between social capital and rural health. This qualitative phase of a sequential mixed methods study used interpretive description to explore community interactions, social and recreational opportunities, and issues of inclusion and exclusion in two rural Southern Ontario communities. Forty adults of varying ages were recruited using convenience sampling and participated in one of eight focus groups or 13 individual interviews. Data was collected between August and December of 2017 and was analyzed concurrently. The rural context influenced the experience of social capital and residents’ opportunities for a...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study examined provider perspectives on: a) older adults’ health and social needs; b) barriers to accessing services; c) the nature of relationships between primary care and health and social services; and d) ways to facilitate primary care and health and social services navigation to optimize older adults’ health. Methods Four focus groups were conducted involving providers (n = 21) in: urban primary care clinics and health and social services organizations serving older adults in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Purposive sampling was employed to recruit community health and social services managers, directors or supervisors and primary health care providers in a Family Health Team via email.

The Quadruple Aim advocates for: improving patient experience, reducing cost, advancing population health and improving the provider experience. It is at the forefront of Canadian reform debates aimed to improve a complex and often-fragmented health care system. Concurrently, collaboration between primary care and public health has been the focus of current research, looking for integrated community-based primary health care models that best suit the health needs of communities and address health equity. This study aimed to explore the nature of Canadian primary care - public health collaborations, their aims, motivations, activities, collaboration barriers and enablers, and perceived outcomes.
