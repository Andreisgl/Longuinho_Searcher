                          handling spikes in consumption, with our
                          globally distributed infrastructure,
                          connected by a private, software-defined network.
                        Manufacturing
Enable physical distancing, touchless interactions,
                          enhanced visual inspection, and more with solutions
                          built for manufacturing.
                        Ensure safety conformance with AI
Check for safety conformance from workers and provide
                          corrective measures in real time using
                          Vision AI visual inspection.
                          Inspect for adherence to eyewear, hard hat, and
                          physical distancing mandates to reduce risks.
                        Reduce risk with touchless interactions
Use
                          Google Assistant
                          to control building systems and interact with
                          machinery with voice commands. Reduce the
                          contamination risk associated with touching switches,
                          keyboards, and screens.
                        Enable workers to collaborate safely and remotely
Leverage collaboration tools like Google Meet to host
                          and participate in
                          virtual stand-up meetings, onboarding, and training.
                          Virtually collaborate during daily kickoffs, LEAN
                          initiatives, and IT agile meetings.
                        Use AI to visually inspect production processes
Detect quality and conformance conditions without
                          in-person attendance 24/7. Regularly increase
                          inspection accuracy over time with machine learning
                          (ML).
                        Monitor machines from anywhere
Free workers from repetitive processes and re-assign
                          workers to distanced stations. Remotely monitor
                          machines anywhere in the world and gain insights in
                          performance and dashboard views.
                        Optimize IT resources and reduce costs
Strengthen financials with cost-savings from
                          modernizing infrastructure and reducing IT cost. We
                          can work with you to build a proposal for reducing
                          costs while accounting for the needs of your
                          organization.
