The Syriac language is a vital component of the broader Syriac cultural heritage. In this contribution, I locate Syriac within its broader Aramaic (and Semitic) setting as well as its various socio-historical contexts, with a focus on Late Antiquity and, to a lesser extent, the Medieval period. In addition, particular attention is paid to several topics that are of immense importance to our understanding of the Syriac language but are rarely discussed, including periodization, written versus spoken varieties, geographic variation and diachronic change, and standardization.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLATIN WORDS IN CLASSICAL SYRIACmohamed hashadThis study analyzes the more than one hundred Latin words that are found in Syriac texts, not translated from Greek, written through the beginning of the eighth century. The study aims to provide an exhaustive collection of these words categorized by date in which they are first attested in Syriac. This diachronic approach makes it possible to observe changes over time in the contact between Syriac speakers and the Greco-Roman world. Attention is also paid to other languages of the Near East in which a Latin word is found, including various dialects of Aramaic as well as other languages, such as Mishnaic Hebrew, Armenian, and Coptic, in an effort to contextualize the presence of the Latin words in Syriac. Finally, the study hopes to make explicit that almost all of the Latin words in Syriac reached Syriac via Greek.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Greco-Roman Context of the Syriac LanguageAaron Butts“The Greco-Roman Context of the Syriac Language,” in M.

Loanwords are, however, only one of the many different types of contact-induced change. This paper explores a different type of contact-induced change termed grammatical replication, which is defined as a contact-induced change in which speakers of the recipient language create a new grammatical structure on the model of a structure of the source language. In particular, this paper focuses on the replication of the Syriac conjunctive particle den (< *ʾiðayn) on Greek δέ. This case of grammatical replication resulted in changes in the syntax, semantics, and phonology of Syriac den. These changes occurred already by the time of the translation of the Old Testament Peshiṭta in the mid-second century. In addition, this grammatical replication resulted in an increase in the frequency of Syriac den from the second century to the third century. Finally, by the fourth century, Syriac den occurs with man, a loanword from Greek μέν, in a construction that exactly replicates Greek μέν … δέ … ‘on the one hand …, on the other hand …’.Download Free PDFView PDF“The Epistolary Terms k‛t, k‛nt in Official Aramaic, the Feminine Endings in Aramaic Dialects and Other Isoglosses in the History of Aramaic”Elitzur Bar-Asher SiegalDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
