Analysis of these data revealed that teachers perceived a discrepancy between theirrights to maintain a safe classroom environment and the rights of students in special education to receivea free and appropriate public education. Four major themes emerged: (a) safety in the classroom,(b) disciplinary double standard, (c) limited disciplinary options, and (d) perceived tension in the educationalenvironment. These emergent themes create a complex dilemma for schools as they are facedwith balancing their duty to provide a safe working and learning environment with their duty to providea free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities.Save to LibraryDownloadby Susan Bon and +2Gerald LeTendreSusan C Faircloth•EducationEuropean Schoolteachers’ Work And Life Under RestructuringThis chapter was written using data produced as part of an EU-funded project, Professional Knowledge – Restructuring Work and Life between the State and Citizens in Europe (Profknow).

This project aimed to compare educational restructuring in seven countries (England, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Finland and Sweden). The Profknow project juxtaposed policy narratives of restructuring with primary teachers’ own work-life narratives of reform. This comparison highlighted the extent to which policy narratives were accepted, contested or resisted by teachers in each national context. This was a way of exploring how restructuring policy narratives have influenced teachers at the chalkface or have simply been refracted at various levels in the different national contexts.Save to Libraryby Amalia Creus•EducationPedagogy for ethnic minority pupils with special educational needs in England: common yet different?Save to LibraryDownloadby Brahm Norwich•  2  Psychology, EducationRighting Writing's Wrongs: Toward Effective Writing Partnerships between Humans and AIIn industrialised nations, we take for granted that knowledge is acquired and shared through a written medium, and yet the actual task of writing remains a hard skill to master.

In this paper, we present a blueprint for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Web-based text editors, and show that this contributes towards simplifying the writing task for authors. Our approach utilises the textual content of a document as input into existing artificial intelligence processes, extended with an RDF knowledge graph. The supplementary material from the AI partner is presented to an author for possible inclusion in their document. We separately evaluated two approaches to the presentation of linguistic tone analysis into editors. Our results from unmoderated observational user tests validate the premise that cognitive technology can simplify the writing task, and show that design is critical to the adoption of cognitive technologies. We conclude with lessons learned from deploying informal qualitative research sessions and online observational tests, and share opportunities for future work. We note that merely applying AI or any new technology to a human activity is patently insufficient. Our limited experience and evaluation suggest that design and user testing are necessary activities for adoption and acceptance.Save to LibraryDownloadby Horizon Research Publishing(HRPUB) Kevin Nelson•EducationFamilia. 2012, n.º 45.

Findings identified that traditional playground equipment and ‘risky’ play were important for children. Natural features and semi-permanent provision were valued, alongside the provision of mixed-age fixed equipment. Children were highly aware of health and safety, and they were very risk averse. Conclusions recognised constraints and limitations of collaborative working, including eliciting authentic voices of children.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ruby Oates•  3  Education, Childhood, Philosophy and Religious StudiesEnhancing creativity by training metacognitive skills in mental imageryIn a longitudinal study, 240 undergraduate dance students were recruited to assess the effectiveness of a series of workshops designed to develop metacognitive skills in use of mental imagery to support choreographic creativity.

The workshops were based upon a theoretical model of mental representations and cognition. The students also completed a creativity test before the workshops, and a newly designed test of flexible thinking before and after the workshops, and a year later. Five forms of the flexible thinking test were created to allow for repeated administration over time, and the forms were shown to be equivalent and to correlate with the creativity test. Students who had taken part in the imagery workshops showed a greater improvement in flexible thinking a year after the training, compared to the scores of students who had not received the training.

Probably the most unfairly affected would be the high achievers among the poor.Wealthy families who value academics have the choice of moving to a school district where their high achieving children can excel, or sending their children to a private school. It is a waste of money and otherwise too bad that they feel they must move, but they can. Poor families are not so mobile.   High achieving students who cannot leave a school district where academic achievement is undervalued face varied pressures that impede them: pressure to fit in and be popular; to excel at sports; to work at low-pay, dead-end jobs to earn money for cars and parties; and so on. If they study hard and excel at academics, they will be taunted; disliked; called “nerd,” “geek,” “dork”; or be accused of “acting White.”   The report spends considerable effort worrying about the feelings of students who might fail high-stakes tests, but little if any effort worrying about the social fallout of abandoning high academic standards. High-achieving students among our poor should be considered our country’s most precious human resources.   For a variety of reasons, our society very badly needs these students to prosper; so their gifts and ambitions should be nurtured, not discouraged. The report, however, in the effect of its recommendations, would have these students treated as pariahs and have them feel guilty for wanting to work hard and succeed. After all, if these students work hard and succeed, won’t that make other students who do not want to work hard look and feel bad?   Abandoning the enforcement of high academic standards will not eliminate pressures and hurt feelings among our youth, however. Pressure and hurt feelings are facts of life. Abandoning academics just means the pressures will come from and the hurt feelings will be caused by nonacademic aspects of these students’ lives.   Is that really what we want? In radical egalitarian bliss, there will be no high-stakes tests, no academic standards enforced in any meaningful way, and no academic tracking. Academic progress in every school and for every student will be slowed to the preferred pace of the least motivated student.Save to LibraryDownloadby Richard P Phelps•  9  Education, Assessment, Research Ethics, Educational PsychologyThe Relationship of Expert Teacher-Learner Rapport and Learner Autonomy in the CVIF-Dynamic Learning ProgramThis study focused on the relationship of rapport between teachers and learners in the context of the Central Visayan Institute Foundation-Dynamic Learning Program (CVIF-DLP) and learner autonomy.

The concept of rapport and learner autonomy in the field of education is often untouched in varied contexts, including the CVIF-DLP which shows a systems approach to process-induced learning, specifically designed to train learners to learn autonomously or independently. In this approach, learners are only provided intervention whenever the need arises, allowing them to learn with little to no assistance of the teacher; thus, the development of rapport between teachers and learners might diminish, compared to a conventional teaching approach that is teacher-centered, where more rapport may be provided due to more interaction between teacher and learner. A correlational study was conducted among 174 learners by answering scales intended to measure rapport with their teacher and autonomous learning. The results revealed an overall moderate, positive, and very significant correlation across all groups. Therefore, rejecting the generalization of most learners in their adolescence has lower rapport with their teachers as they mature; moreover, autonomy-supportive attitudes might have been a foundation instilled among learners by their teachers in the approach. The conclusion led to mediating factors such as the teaching approach itself and a strong guidance program. This study recommends more studies on the CVIF-DLP teaching approach, its effect on learner autonomy, and a detailed description of the rapport among specific subject teachers for further in-depth understanding.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ryan Dave Delos Reyes•  6  Education, Learner Autonomy, Rapport, Dynamic learningA New Paradigm of Learning for Urban Adult Learners: Challenges for Educators and Policymakers Regarding Education and Community ServiceSave to LibraryDownloadby carroy ferguson•  20  Sociology, Cultural Studies, Social Change, PsychologyPoverty, Literacy, and Social Transformation: An Interdisciplinary Exploration of the Digital DivideHarnessing scholarship focused on literacy and poverty, in this article we aim to complicate the common understanding of the digital divide.

First, we argue that the dominant literature on the digital divide misses broader connections between technological exclusion and broader forms of economic and social exclusion. Accordingly, and following recent qualitative research on the digital divide, we believe future scholarship must examine the complicated relationships between poverty, inequality, and the digital divide and we look to poverty scholarship to understand the complicated and shifting nature of poverty. Finally, we make the case that scholars and practitioners focused on digital literacy programs should pay attention to historical and critical scholarship on education and its role in mediating poverty and fostering social mobility, as it serves digital divide and broadband adoption scholars to understand the ways education processes can either reproduce or set the stage to alter entrenched social realitiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Amy J Bach and +2Todd WolfsonJessica Kate  Crowell•  17  Cultural Studies, Anthropology, Literacy, Digital DivideSelf-regulated and Technology-enhanced Learning: a European perspectiveSave to LibraryDownloadby Karl Steffens•  7  European Studies, Education, Educational Technology, Educational Research"Rejection of Reason and the Fall of Empire" (A)The fall of the Muslim civilization resulted from the rejection of reason.

The rejection of reason was a result of the characterization of the use of reason to know revelation as kufr. The rejection of reason became explicit in the shutting of the gates to ijtihad and was reinforced by al-Ghazali’s attack on philosophers. The rejection of reason found political expression in the repression of the rationalists by Musa al-Hadi in 786. The slaughter of five-thousand philosophers was an event analogous to the Reign of Terror of the Jacobins, under Maximilien Robespierre during the French Revolution. Sixteen thousand followers of “tradition” were beheaded at the guillotine with the emergence of the Age of Reason, touted by the European Enlightenment, a millennium afterwards. In Islam, the rejection of reason made it harder to understand and follow revelation. The perception that “all knowledge is in the Quran” did not help matters. This was an example of perfunctory thought. For it automatically withheld the designation of “knowledge” from all knowledge not in the Quran. This perception was based on a problematic understanding of epistemology or what constitutes knowledge. It was a reflection of hubris. In response to the bewilderment caused the prohibition of the use of reason, exegetes alleged that revelation features “ambiguous” passages. The rejection of reason made it hard to know and follow revelation. It also made it hard to understand key terms as “mutashabihat,” “hikma,” and “hawa.” As a result, Muslims turned to tradition, which replaced reason for the purpose of explaining revelation. But to “explain” revelation, tradition had to be elevated to an “equal” of revelation and subsequently even “above” revelation. For the expectation that it would “explain” revelation placed tradition in the position of a “judge” of revelation. The elevation of tradition above revelation reversed the relation of revelation and tradition. The word of God was subordinated to the words of persons. The reversal of the relationship between revelation and tradition facilitated the adoption of the teaching of abrogation. The abrogation of the peace verses by the ayah as-sayf transformed Islam into “political Islam.” The abrogation of revelation by tradition transformed Islam into “traditional Islam.” The application of the teaching of abrogation warped penal law. The abrogation of revelation by tradition subjugated revelation to tradition. Hence, the process that led to this requires attention. It is necessary to restore revelation to its pre-eminence in relation to tradition, to rehabilitate reason, and to ensure that all laws are in agreement with revelation rather than based on inclination.

Although Britain's Learning and Skills Council's FE and Post-16 sector encompasses around six million learners, four thousand providers and £7.3 billion worth of provision, little research in the sector uses the extensive data-rich client base it serves. Few, if any, in-house research findings inform its professional practice. The Learning and Skills Development Agency Research Network and LSC Research Centre have begun to address this gap, mapping out a new blueprint for research developments in the sector, and raising a new capacity for in-house FE-focused research. These exciting national developments form the foundation for this book, which builds on the key importance of research to strengthen the role of further education as the main bridging sector between school and higher education at a time of Britain's increased national investment in raising achievements. This groundbreaking core text in a new field identifies and constructs a new theoretical framework for a specialist FE research culture, recognizing the unique contribution to research of FE practitioner-researchers. The book identifies good practice in this field through a series of in-depth case studies linked to appropriate and innovative research methods. The theoretical framework outlined links the concept of the critical reflective practitioner with the development of knowledge management techniques specific to Further Education research. This book will enable its readers to: 1. Recognize the value of undertaking research in their sector 2. Draw upon their current practice to develop research questions 3. Identify appropriate research questions and design appropriate research techniques accordingly 4. Interrogate other research, from associated fields 5. Undertake literature searches and derive information for a variety of sources 6. Use research -- their own or others' -- to inform their professional practice 7. Have the confidence to create, use and evaluate their sector specific research. More detailsEmpowering Researchers in Further EducationBy Yvonne Hillier and Jill JamesonContributor: Introductory Chapter by Andrew MorrisPublished by Trentham Books, 2003ISBN 1858562856, 9781858562858194 pagesSave to Libraryby Jill Jameson•  15  Education, Political Participation, Social Networks, Action ResearchClive Palmer (Ed.)

The contents stem mainly from teaching BA undergraduate Outdoor students at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, UK, showcased here to promote critical discussion on Outdoor issues and foster pedagogical progress wherever that may be found. This introduction outlines the structure of the book, which also illuminates the plan of teaching that has brought about such a vibrant collection of chapters. The ethos of my educational mission has been for students to become philosophical about things, ‘having ideas’ with a view to making a comment about some state of affairs in the Outdoors. With a nugget of an idea latched on to, fuelled with some passion, the next step was to transform that idea into some physical presence through an artistic medium; shape it. Thereafter, the academic task was to polish and present the artwork with a supporting chapter, in order to communicate their idea to the world; share it. The creation of art in this context was always a means to an educational end, the artworks being an impressive by-product from this experience – but now the artworks are leading the show, representing the style of education we enjoyed. It seems worth mentioning at the outset, that all the Outdoor students I have taught are not artists, they are climbers, canoeists and mountaineers. They never came to university to do or study art and nor did I teach them as such. If I have done anything, it was to free up the possibility of thinking slightly differently about topics they chose, and then equip them with some basic artistic tools to play with those ideas. As a result, I discovered a huge increase in student confidence and a palpable increase in enjoyment of learning, as much for me as their teacher as for them. In effect, what I did was invite into my classroom a raft of untapped talent in thinking and learning that suddenly had a place in their university degrees. Students were writing home asking parents to dig out their pencils and painting sets that they had at school, as there was now an urgent need to express an idea in a creative way. On this point, and towards a student-centred introduction to this book, I invite the reader to turn to the last chapter (chpt 40) Student Voices: living and learning through art and the outdoors which provides a sense of the endeavour, commitment and learning experiences from a selection of student authors in this volume.Save to LibraryDownloadby Clive Palmer (National Teaching Fellow)•  20  Creative Writing, Education, Self and Identity, CreativityRevising HistorySave to LibraryDownloadby Anne Buchanan•  3  History, Education, Historical RevisionismWhat Role Does Grit Play in the Academic Success of Black Male Collegians at Predominantly White InstitutionsThis study tests the importance of a noncognitive trait, grit, to predicting grades for a sample of Black males attending a predominantly White institution.

Using multivariate statistics and hierarchical regression techniques, results suggest that grit is positively related to college grades for Black males and that background traits, academic factors, and grit explain 24 % of the variance in Black male's college grades. Grit, alone, added incremental predictive validity over and beyond traditional measures of academic success such as high school grade point average and American College Test scores.

In this brief response, I draw on my work in the Middle East and among Arabic‐speaking populations in the United States to offer some illustration of the instantiation of global, macro‐processes of (in)securitization and surveillance in the everyday micro‐practices of schooling—issues that are possible to “see” when language policy is the site of inquiry. In centring everyday communicative practice, sociolinguistics provides a distinctive entry point for examining the lived experience of this (in)securitization, by illuminating pervasive and mundane micro‐processes within the “extraordinary” and routinized social interactions of everyday schooling.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zeena Zakharia•  4  Education, Sociolinguistics, Education and Conflict, Language PolicyThespian Decoys - New World Order Puppet Masters [Free Book]https://journalistethics.com/ Free book available in PDF at this link This book lifts the veil to identify the puppet masters behind the MK Ultra Mind Control shills that front the New World Disorder Dystopia.

Rejecting the medieval tradition of church education primarily for and by the clergy, Martin Luther argued that all Christians need to be educated to be able to read the Bible on their own, to participate fully in the life of the church, state, and society, and to prepare for their distinct vocations. Lutheran Germany and Scandinavia thus set up public schools as "civic seminaries," in Philip Melanchthon's apt phrase, designed to offer general spiritual and civic education for all. In early modern Lutheran lands, the state replaced the church as the chief educator of the community, and free basic education with standard curricula was made compulsory for all children, boys and girls alike. The Article offers case studies of new German city and territorial laws on education on the books and in action, and it reflects on the enduring significance of this early experiment in education even in our day.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Witte, Jr.•  10  Religion, Christianity, History, EducationMuslim women and sportSave to LibraryDownloadby Tansin Benn and +2Gertrud PfisterYousra Alsinani•  6  Religion, Education, Case Studies, Physical Activityhigher educationSave to LibraryDownloadby विवेक पाठक•EducationRescaling the local: Multi-academy trusts, private monopoly and statecraft in EnglandTo cite: Wilkins, A. 2017.

Rescaling the local: Multi-academy trusts, private monopoly and statecraft in England. Journal of Educational Administration and History, 49 (2), 171-185For the past six years successive UK governments in England have introduced reforms intended to usher in less aggregated, top-down, bureaucratically overloaded models of service delivery as well as secure conditions for greater school autonomy.  Yet the ‘hollowing out’ of local government has not resulted in less bureaucracy on the ground or less regulation from above, nor has it diminished hierarchy as an organising principle of education governance.  In some cases, monopolies and monopolistic practices dominated by powerful bureaucracies and professional groups persist, albeit realised through the involvement of new actors and organisations from business and philanthropy.  In this paper I adopt a governmentality perspective to explore the political significance of large multi-academy trusts (MATs) – private sponsors contracted by central government to run publicly funded schools – to the generation of new scalar hierarchies and accountability infrastructures that assist in bringing the gaze of government to bear upon the actions of schools that are otherwise less visible under local government management.  On this account, it is argued, MATs are integral to statecraft and the invention and assemblage of particular apparatuses for intervening upon specific organisations, spaces and peoples.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Wilkins•  87  Critical Theory, Business, Management, Business AdministrationThe Critical Literacy Education inside The Classroom: The Freirian ApproachThe practice of language teaching and learning inside the classroom is, in fact, under the circumstance of philosophical assumption or ideological framework.

Teaching program and curriculum set are absolutely written on the basis of particular assumptions about the nature and value of knowledge. These assumptions mainly determine actual decisions in listing important items to be taught and learned along with the way those items are delivered.

However, most scholarly and empirical contributions have ignored the inherent tensions, challenges and dilemmas associated with the practice of school leadership and the realities principals confront on a daily basis. This is partly because researchers have tended to ignore multiple facets of justice in their empirical investigations as well as how larger forces outside the school associated with historical, political, social and economic injustices marginalize students and communities. This article explores three cases of challenging school–community contexts that confound and partially subdue the efforts of well-intentioned principals. Each case highlights a dedicated principal committed to their school and community, and documents the significant progress made in addressing particular social justice issues, but also how they confronted justice dilemmas that they believed required them to prioritize certain social justice issues over others. These findings have important implications for how principals view their communities and engage in critical reflection about the leadership decisions and actions they take on a daily basis. This article concludes with implications for future research and a discussion of how aspiring principals can be better prepared to lead for social justice and effectively address justice dilemmas without ignoring or putting off other injustices.Save to LibraryDownloadby David DeMatthews•  8  Public Administration, Education, Organizational Theory, Educational LeadershipUndocumented Undergraduates on College Campuses: Understanding Their Challenges and Assets and What It Takes to Make an Undocufriendly CampusSave to LibraryDownloadby Carola Suárez-Orozco and +2Cynthia AlcantarMinas Michikyan•EducationThe State Education is in: recognising the challenge of achieving a fair educational systemThis paper examines the problem of the wider economic and political context for any project aimed at achieving a fairer educational system.

The consequences of the current status quo can be seen in diminishing funding and rising inequalities. The paper argues that the answer lies not in tinkering with an unjust educational system but rather in big bold initiatives that are transformative rather than incremental. Introduction At a time when, according to a recent editorial in the Sunday Times (May 7 2017), the British no longer resent the rich but rather celebrate their success and try to join them, the prevailing attitude to poverty is that the poor need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, seize their opportunities, develop resilience, and become as successful as the already privileged without access to the resources and connections that make such success possible. The Rich List in the same issue of The Sunday Times proudly celebrates the fact that the richest in society increased their wealth by 14% in 2016.According to the Resolution Foundation (2013) between 1995 and 2010 the top 1% of earners saw their slice of pre-tax income increase from 7% to 10% while the bottom 50% of the UK population saw their share drop from 19% to 18%.Save to LibraryDownloadby Diane Reay•  3  Education, Social Justice in Education, Social InequalityLa laïcité: des repères pour en parler et l’enseignerQu’est-ce que la laïcité ?

Students charted the ups and downs of their English learning histories and then completed a questionnaire in which they explained the causes of their demotivation and the pathways, unintentional or intentional, by which they became remotivated. This data was analyzed in terms of the affective and attitudinal conditions which students brought with them into the classroom. Studentswith positive antecedent conditions were found to have experienced fewer periods of demotivation in the past and exhibited more dynamic use of a wide range of strategies in their attempts to remotivate themselves. There is evidence to suggest that these learners also had more exposure to such strategies in use. Based on this hypothesis, we compiled and returned the strategies they reported to seed their self-motivational practices.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tim Murphey and +1Christopher Carpenter•  8  Psychology, Social Psychology, Education, Teaching English as a Second LanguageForty Qualia Propositions and the Implicate OrderIn You Are the Universe, the contemplative endocrinologist Deepak Chopra and the MIT physicist Menas Kafatos offer a groundbreaking, lucid work on consciousness that is refreshingly accessible without relying upon mathematical language or... moreIn You Are the Universe, the contemplative endocrinologist Deepak Chopra and the MIT physicist Menas Kafatos offer a groundbreaking, lucid work on consciousness that is refreshingly accessible without relying upon mathematical language or overspecialized jargon. In summary, their book is a serious attempt to address the fundamental contemporary question, “Is the universe made of matter that learned to think, or is the universe made of mind that created matter?” (Chopra & Kafatos, 2017, p. 154). By the end of the book Chopra and Kafatos have gone so far as to argue that not only is the universe created and sustained by an underlying mind but that we are the universe, we are that mind. In a real sense, they declare, we as an organic species have co-created this universe.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shelli Joye•  22  Sociology, Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Quantum PhysicsThe Differences Between the Influences of Synchronous and Asynchronous Modes on Collaborative Learning Project of Industrial DesignSave to LibraryDownloadby Wenzhi Chen•  11  Education, Technology, Design, Design educationContract Opportunity with the College of Mental Health Counselling (download)In order to accept this Student Recruiter agreement with the College of Mental Health Counselling, you must believe in and agree with the value of learning about counselling through the online course described at www.ctihalifax.com, and... moreIn order to accept this Student Recruiter agreement with the College of Mental Health Counselling, you must believe in and agree with the value of learning about counselling through the online course described at www.ctihalifax.com, and you must act in good faith accepting that the College will remunerate you as per the terms of this agreement in #5 below.

This expression commonly denotes mental medicine that draws from psychotherapeutic practices and psychological theories to improve our understanding of mental diseases and to cure them. Although still used today, usually in juxtaposition to 19th century alienism or to biological psychiatry, the origin and meaning of this expression are unclear. An unpublished lecture (1956) by Ellenberger on this subject, accompanied by an explanatory introduction, is reproduced here to shed light on Ellenberger's interpretation of that term. This article additionally aims to draw certain parallels and distinctions between Ellenberger, Michel Foucault and George Devereux's teaching in the 1950s. Considering that the history of psychiatry is now a well-established speciality in the academic world, Ellenberger's lecture is also an original document which enables us to trace the professionalization of psychiatric historiography as an academic discipline back to its beginnings after World War II.Save to LibraryDownloadby Emmanuel Delille•  31  History, Cultural History, Medical Sociology, Native American StudiesGLOBALIZATION AND ITS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CHALLENGES TO EDUCATION: REASONS & SOLUTIONSAbstract_ This study aims at shedding light on globalization: its definition and its challenges to the educational process in its both internal and external levels.

The researcher adopted a review of literaturethat is related to the main subject of the study. The study concludes the following:- The educational globalization means having control and authority over curriculum which results in the meltingof the individuality and identity in the name of technological development and therefore the dominance of thevalues of the western world.- Moreover, the study reveals the internal challenges of globalization with regard to education; of thesechallenges comes the absence of active positive role of the teacher.- Finally, the study recommends the following measures as solutions to face the challenges that encountereducation.

At its core was avision of a learner-centered educational system where Jewish wisdom (i.e., Torah) becomes a resource for personal meaning-making. Those familiar with the trajectory of Woocher’s thinking were surely not surprised by his enthusiasm for prosumerism or his relative sanguinity aboutthe decline of legacy institutions. But they might have been caught o  guard by the virtual absence of any reference to a role for community and Jewish peoplehood in his proposed educational paradigm. For Woocher, Jewish community had been an animating concern that presaged his interest in communal dynamics, guided his work as the longtime executive director of the Jewish Education Service of North America ( JESNA), and grounded his e orts on behalf of Jewish continuity and renaissance. Was Woocher’s silence on community in “Reinventing Jewish Education” indicative of a radical rethinking of the bases of Jewish life?Save to LibraryDownloadby Jonathan Krasner•  14  Ethnic Studies, Education, History of Education, Children's LiteratureRésolution de problèmes, autorégulation et apprentissageSave to LibraryDownloadby Helene Poissant•EducationTransition Rate Of Girls From Lower Primary To Upper Primary, Kajiado CountyThis study is on factors that influence the girls' transition rate from lower primary to upper primary in public primary schools of Kajiado County, Kenya.

Four study questions guided the study. Literature review focused on international calls on girl's education among the pastoral communities and the girl's education in Kenya and Africa at large. The study focused on the factors that influence girls' education which include the socio-cultural factors, socioeconomic factors, school based factors and early teenage pregnancies which include the flight of the girls due to the effects of HIV/AIDS and FGM. The study used the descriptive survey design. The target population for the study was 524 comprising of 14 head teachers and 510 class six girls from all the fourteen public primary schools in Kajiado County. The sample for the study was 14 head teachers, and 16% of the girls (82) in class six from the selected schools. Based on the findings the following conclusions were made: Early marriage was found to be the main cause of girls not graduating to the next higher level of education in public primary schools. Female genital mutilation (FGM) was the second contributing factor to low transition rate of girls. Results on physical facilities had mixed reactions. Majority of the girls (72.5%) belief that lack of physical facilities had no influence on them being or not being in school. This meant that whether the physical facilities are available or not the girls will still continue with their education. Early pregnancies represented by 88.4% most likely to lead to girls leaving school before completing the entire primary cycle. Only 8.7% of the respondents indicated that early pregnancy had no influence on girls being or not being in school. It was found that there was high percentage of girls out of school due to lack of female teachers in their school to act as role models. The study also established that most of the girls from poor households go through FGM as compared to those from richSave to LibraryDownloadby European Scientific Journal ESJ•EducationExecutive Functions, Self-Regulation, and Chronic Pain: A ReviewChronic pain conditions are complicated and challenging to live with.

Capacity to adjust to such conditions may depend on the ability to self-regulate, that is, the ability to alter thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Self-regulation appears to rely on executive cognitive functions, and the current review, therefore, sought to draw attention to the impact of self-regulatory capacity and executive functions on chronic pain. Chronic pain conditions present with complex interactions of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological components for which self-regulatory ability is crucial. The ability to self-regulate varies, and self-regulatory strength appears to be a limited resource that can be fatigued. The many challenges of chronic pain conditions could, therefore, tax self-regulatory strength, leading to self-regulatory deficits. The current review proposes a relationship among pain, self-regulatory capacity, self-regulatory demands, executive functions, and self-regulatory fatigue, suggesting that executive functions and self-regulatory deficits are indeed part of the etiology and maintenance of chronic pain conditions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Suzanne Segerstrom•  11  Education, Pain, Cognition, Chronic PainNextLast »Related TopicsSociology of EducationFollowFollowingTeacher EducationFollowFollowingCritical PedagogyFollowFollowingEducation PolicyFollowFollowingPhilosophy of EducationFollowFollowingEducational ResearchFollowFollowingPolitics Of EducationFollowFollowingCritical TheoryFollowFollowingSocial Justice in EducationFollowFollowingEducational Inequalities (class; race; gender etc)FollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
