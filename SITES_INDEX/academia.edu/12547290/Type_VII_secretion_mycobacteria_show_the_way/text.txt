These secretion systems are also known as ESAT-6-like secretion systems. Here, we have determined the secretome of ESX-5 by a proteomic approach in two different strains of Mycobacterium marinum. Comparison of the secretion profile of wild-type strains and their ESX-5 mutants showed that a number of PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR proteins are dependent on ESX-5 for transport. The PE and PPE protein families are unique to mycobacteria, are highly expanded in several pathogenic species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. marinum, and certain family members are cell surface antigens associated with virulence. Using a monoclonal antibody directed against the PGRS domain we showed that nearly all PE_PGRS proteins that are recognized by this antibody are missing in the supernatant of ESX-5 mutants. In addition to PE_PGRS and PPE proteins, the ESX-5 secretion system is responsible for the secretion of a ESAT-6-like proteins. Together, these data show that ESX-5 is probably a major secretion pathway for mycobacteria and that this system is responsible for the secretion of recently evolved PE_PGRS and PPE proteins.Download Free PDFView PDFCell Host & MicrobeStrong Immunogenicity and Cross-Reactivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESX-5 Type VII Secretion -Encoded PE-PPE Proteins Predicts Vaccine Potential2012 • Claude LeclercDownload Free PDFView PDFCurrent Opinion in MicrobiologyTo catch a killer.

While the role of the ESX-1 and ESX-3 systems in M. tuberculosis has been elucidated, predictions for the function of the ESX-5 system came from data obtained in Mycobacterium marinum, where it transports PPE and PE_PGRS proteins and modulates innate immune responses. To define the role of the ESX-5 system in M. tuberculosis, in this study, we have constructed five M. tuberculosis H37Rv ESX-5 knockout/deletion mutants, inactivating eccA(5) , eccD(5) , rv1794 and esxM genes or the ppe25-pe19 region. Whereas the Mtbrv1794ko displayed no obvious phenotype, the other four mutants showed defects in secretion of the ESX-5-encoded EsxN and PPE41, a representative member of the large PPE protein family. Strikingly, the MtbeccD(5) ko mutant also showed enhanced sensitivity to detergents and hydrophilic antibiotics. When the virulence of the five mutants was evaluated, the MtbeccD(5) ko and Mtb...Download Free PDFView PDFESX���1���mediated translocation to the cytosol controls virulence of mycobacteria2012 • Nicole van der WelDownload Free PDFView PDFCell Micr Houben etal 2012Nicole van der WelDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS PathogensDirect Visualization by Cryo-EM of the Mycobacterial Capsular Layer: A Labile Structure Containing ESX-1-Secreted Proteins2010 • Wilbert BitterDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Infectious DiseasesESAT-6 Secretion-Independent Impact of ESX-1 Genes espF and espG1 on Virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis2011 • Claude LeclercDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
