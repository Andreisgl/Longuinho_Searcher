The Karun III Arch dam located on Karun River, Iran, which was originally designed as a conventional concrete arch dam, has been taken for the purpose of verification of the finite element code. In this study, RCC technology has been ascertained as an alternative method to reduce the cost of the project and make it competitive. A numerical procedure to simulate the construction process of RCC arch dams is presented. It takes into account the more relevant features of the behavior of concrete such as hydration, ageing and creep. A viscoelastic model, including ageing effects and thermal dependent properties is adopted for the concrete. The different isothermal temperature influence on creep and elastic modulus is taken into account by the maturity concept.

If these stresses are not controlled, they cause cracks in mass concrete structures such as dams. Hence, the thermal and structural stresses needs to be checked against the possibility of cracking to evaluate the safety of the dam. This study deals with formulation and simplified procedure to predict the possibility of crack development in RCC dam. An existing 2-D code has been modified by implementing the crack prediction procedures. The applicability of the modified 2-D code has been shown by analyzing a real RCC dam called Zirdan dam situated in southeast of Iran. The predicted stresses which were obtained through the finite element analysis are examined against the crack development at Gaussian points and it was found that the dam is structurally safe.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Hydration of cement and climatic changes on the convective boundaries are the two main heat sources of the temperature rise in RCC dams. Therefore, the effects of these two factors have to be determined accurately in order to reduce the risk of thermally induced cracking in these dams. Simplified approaches are usually adopted to approximate the temperature changes on the upstream dam side after the dam reservoir is filled. These simplified approaches are usually based on long-term observations of similar reservoirs. However, it is practically hard to generalise the conditions of these reservoirs with respect to the reservoir under consideration. In this work, the finite-element method has been used to simulate the heat exchange between the RCC dam body and the reservoir water taking into account the reservoir operation. A realistic isothermal profile has been obtained...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The superstructure members have been represented by means of three‐node isoparametric beam elements with three degrees of freedom per node. The soil mass is idealized by eight node isoperimetric quadrilateral element at near field and five node isoparametric infinite element to simulate the far field behavior of the soil media. The non‐linearity of the soil mass has been represented by using the Duncan and Chang hyperbolic model. The applicability of this model was demonstrated by analyzing a single span IAB. This study has shown that the soil nonlinearity has significant effect on the response of the structure, where the displacement that have been obtained on basis of nonlinear analysis is 1.5–2.0 times higher than that obtained from linear analysis. The stress magnitudes in the nonlinear analysis are also high...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The biggest uncertainty in the design of these bridges is the reaction of the soil behind the abutments and adjacent to the piles. The handling of soil-structure interaction in the analysis and design of integral abutment bridges has always been problematic. This study describes the implementation of a 2-D finite element model of IAB system which explicitly incorporates the nonlinear soil response. The superstructure members have been represented by means of three-nodded isoperimetric beam elements with three degree of freedom per node which take into account the effect of transverse shear deformation.

Making reliable prediction of stress fields, and thereby cracking risk, thermal and mechanical properties such as creep form an important part of the material modeling. Recently, many models have been proposed to study the significance of thermal loads and creep on RCC dam. Most of the earlier researchers considered creep very approximately or neglected it altogether. However, due to the significant influence of creep on the stress values, especially in early age concrete, a more accurate creep model is essential. Furthermore, most of the previous researchers who investigated dam concrete mainly focused on the uniaxial compressive and tensile strength, so their studies did not consider safety of the dam concrete under multi-axial stress states. In this investigation, a system of crack prediction of RCC dam during constru...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
