In light of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence with it through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community when they themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist, from reluctance to change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore, this article offers a selection of accessible DH methods that can be used to positively shape humanities pedagogy.Download Free PDFView PDFTeaching and Learning With Digital Media: Learning Ecologies and Digital PedagogiesRonan  HallowellThis study highlights ways in which educators can employ extant pedagogical knowledge and develop innovative instructional practices that leverage the shift from print-based literacy to digitally inflected multiliteracies. The explosion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and digital media, especially the Internet in the 1990s, has changed the way students read, write, and learn. In an effort to expand knowledge about teaching and learning with digital media, this case study of curriculum and instruction at Tomol University’s Department of Digital Media (DDM) (a pseudonym) examined the changing nature of literacy in the Digital Age. To shed light on this phenomenon, students, faculty and administrators were purposefully selected from the DDM’s population. Data were collected from curriculum documents, interviews with faculty and administrators, a student survey, and artifacts of student work and instructor feedback. Qualitative analysis elucidated how the DDM’s instructional practices supported the advancement of students’ digital multiliteracies, media-rich project skills, and Digital Age communication fluency. The theoretical framework, grounded in pragmatic meliorism, critical realism and the education research literature, provided an analytic and interpretive approach that led to the study’s findings and recommendations for educational practice and future research.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of DocumentationPedagogy and Public-Funded Research: An Exploratory Study of Skills in Digital Humanities Projects2019 • Alex H PoolePurpose Public-funded research in Digital Humanities (DH) enhances institutional and individual research missions and contributes open data to a growing base of globally-networked knowledge. This case study on the Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014-2016), an international, interdisciplinary, and collaborative grant initiative, explores skills that faculty and students brought to projects and others they acquired and shared on collaborative teams. Design/methodology/approach Rooted in the naturalistic paradigm, this qualitative case study centers on semi-structured interviews with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects. Documentary evidence complements empirical evidence; analysis is constructivist and grounded. Findings Hailing from diverse academic research institutions, centers, and repositories, participants brought 20 types of discipline-based or interdisciplinary expertise to DID3 projects. But they reported acquiring or refining 27 other skills during their project work. While most are data-related, complementary programming, management, and analytical skills push disciplinary and interdisciplinary expertise toward new frontiers. Project-based learning and pedagogy function symbiotically; participants therefore advocate for aligning problem-solving skills with pedagogical objectives at home institutions to prepare for public-funded DH projects. A modified content analysis juxtaposes DID3 skills with those advanced in 23 recent DH syllabi to identify commonalities and gaps. Originality/value Pedagogy has an important yet under-researched and underdeveloped role in public-funded digital humanities.Download Free PDFView PDFNew Directions for Computing Education2017 • Thomas LombardiDownload Free PDFView PDFChallenges for New Infrastructures and Paradigms in DH Curricular Program Development2017 • Tanya E.

Computer Science and the Liberal Arts: Hidden Synergies and Boundless OpportunitiesDaniel Walzer, Mark BaileyA growing body of evidence supports the contention that many students will benefit from coursework in computer science regardless of their respective academic majors. While there are distinct advantages to learning computer science for students in the quantitative and analytical fields (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math or STEM disciplines), the tangible benefits for students in non-STEM areas are less clear. To investigate the influence of computer science methods on students in the liberal arts, we convened a workshop of faculty equally distributed from computer science and various liberal arts disciplines. We also included two career placement professionals, one from a small college and another from a larger technical university. By defining “computer science and the liberal arts”, the group had a common designation with which to work. This consensus-based, interdisciplinary lexicon enriched and guided the group’s dialog. Next, the group discussed and identified possible requisite computer science courses and ideologies, identified aspects of liberal arts programs that would benefit from the inclusion of principles of computer science, and estimated the possible postgraduate effects of computer science courses on students currently enrolled in liberal arts programs. Finally, workshop participants came away with a better understanding of the computing needs of liberal arts students and faculty to advance interdisciplinary collaboration, faculty research, cooperative learning, and post-graduate employment prospects.Download Free PDFView PDFFinno-Ugric linguistics through solving IT problems2018 • Jeremy  BradleyThis paper seeks to introduce our approach of integrating computational methods, digital resources, and computer literacy skills into the curriculum of Finno-Ugric (Uralic) linguistics. Our starting point is the class Digital Resources in Linguistics, which we taught at the Institute of Finno-Ugric/Uralic Studies at LMU Munich in 2017; our eventual aim is the compilation of teaching materials (a textbook with supplementary online materials) on this subject matter and their integration into Finno-Ugric curricula. While there are numerous high-quality textbooks on computational linguistics, our endeavour is more tied to the framework of Digital Humanities, stressing the background in humanities and social sciences rather than details of specific technologies, and attempting to be conscientious to the specific needs, interests, and skills of our students. This endeavour is happening within the context of the ongoing internationalization of our research discipline, exemplified by the Er...Download Free PDFView PDF"The Wicked Problem of Pedagogy, An Afterword" in Learning Through Digital Media Experiments in Technology and PedagogyElizabeth EllsworthDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
