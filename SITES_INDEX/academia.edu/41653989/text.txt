However, in the 1940s-1950s she inhabited multiple coinciding roles: painter, performer, choreographer, cultural ethnographer, and folklore collector. As part of this expansive practice, her canvases display a peculiar movement and animacy while her dances transmit the restraint of the two-dimensional figure. Drawing from black feminist theoretical redefinitions of the human, this paper argues that Streat's exploration of muralism, African American spirituals, Native Northwest Coast cultural production, and Yaqui Mexican-Indigenous folk music established a diasporic mapping forged through the coxtension of gesture and brushstroke. This transmedial work disorients colonial cartographies which were the products of displacement, conquest, and dispossession, aiding notions of a new humanism at mid-century.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSFMOMA: Open Space: Projects and PerspectivesBerit Potter_Grace McCann Morley Defending and Diversifying Modern Art_SFMOMA 2017.pdf2017 • Berit PotterEssay commissioned in conjunction with the exhibition Andrea Geyer: To Those Who Have Eyes To See, February 9–August 15, 2017, San Francisco Museum of Modern ArtDownload Free PDFView PDFNew Acquisitions 2008 African-American Masters Collection2009 • Jorge Daniel Torres de VenecianoDownload Free PDFView PDFTate PapersPainting the Global History of Art: Hale Woodruff's The Art of the Negro2018 • Christian KravagnaThis paper shows how African American artist Hale Woodruff’s 1950–1 mural cycle The Art of the Negro depicts a transcultural art history that embeds the genealogy of modern art within the history of mankind, colonial violence and the politics of liberation. It discusses the specific ways that Woodruff used the murals to negotiate the divergent requirements of abstract expressionism and black historiography on the eve of the civil rights movement in the United States.Download Free PDFView PDFPermalink Journal Journal of Transnational American Studies, 7(1) Publication Date The Mexico Diary Winold Reiss between Vogue Mexico and Harlem Renaissance An Illustrated Trilingual Edition with Commentary and Musical InterpretationFrank MehringDownload Free PDFView PDFBeyond the Walls: Locating "Community" in American Muralism Since 1930Elizabeth MettsDownload Free PDFView PDFExcerpts of The Mexico Diary published in Journal of Transnational American Studies (Volume 7, Issue 1, 2016)Frank MehringExcerpt from The Mexico Diary: Winold Reiss between Vogue Mexico and Harlem Renaissance (An Illustrated Trilingual Edition with Commentary and Musical Interpretation) (Wissenschaftlicher Verlag Trier, co-publishedDownload Free PDFView PDFAmerican StudiesThe Flat Plane, the Jagged Edge: Aaron Douglas's Musical Art2010 • Robert O'MeallyDownload Free PDFView PDFThe University of Texas at Austin-DissertationRacialization, Representation, and Resistance: Black Visual Culture and the Production of Alterity2003 • Bonnie C L A U D I A HarrisonRacialization, Representation, and Resistance: Black Visual Artists and the Production of Alterity queries the relationship between Black visual representation and Black social and cultural politics. For the past two centuries Black visual artists throughout the African Diaspora have painted, sculpted, and filmed images of blackness inspired, funded, and otherwise supported by progressive patrons and institutions. Largely produced outside of mainstream art worlds, these visual representations focused on Black social and cultural politics and Black alterity more than mainstream tastes or stereotypes. As the coherence of Black social and political movements and resources declined in the late twentieth century, however, commercialization and the mainstream art world had increasing influence on Black visual culture. These changes created intense resistance and debate about the politics of visual representation throughout the Black Atlantic, particularly in the United States, Cuba, and the United Kingdom. Ethnographic observations, interviews, and gallery talks with artists in these three nations, including John Yancey, Vicky Meek, Marcus Akinlana, Kara Walker, Michael Ray Charles, Gloria Rolando, Anissa Cockings, and Andrew Sinclair, along with cultural and historical comparisons, provide fresh insight into the relationship between Black visual representation and contemporary Black social and cultural politics.Download Free PDFView PDFAaron Douglas and Hale Woodruff: The social responsibility and expanded pedagogy of the Black artist2007 • shbey@syr.edu BeyABSTRACT This study examines the expanded pedagogy and formal instruction of Aaron Douglas and Hale Woodruff, two African-American artists who came to prominence during the New Negro Movement, in the 1920s. The decades following the New Negro Movement marked a new era for the art education of African-American students when renowned African-American artists began to prepare future generations of artists and art educators. Douglas and Woodruff spent their tenures teaching the visual arts at historically Black universities in Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia, respectively. They both had a profound influence on this new era of art education, in which they were situated in a Black experience in the segregated United States. I specifically explore to what extent and for what goals racial consciousness and Black content were a part of the instruction, artwork, and lives of Douglas and Woodruff. The majority of the data examined for this study was discovered in special collections in the archives of the libraries at Fisk and Atlanta Universities. Artist statements, letters, curricular materials, class and lectures notes, exams, interviews, artwork, and testimony of their former students were all closely examined to understand the political, cultural, aesthetic, and pedagogical influence of these two teaching artists. The data convincingly conveys that Douglas and Woodruff were influential figures outside of the classroom. My findings indicate that various political factors and the limitations of classroom instruction within these institutions did not allow Douglas and Woodruff to teach content which affirmed the historical and cultural significance of African-Americans in the United States, but their lives and artwork served as pedagogy which instilled racial pride, tenacity, and perseverance that was absent in the curriculum.Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Communists View Mexican Muralism: Critical and Artistic Responses2002 • Andrew HemingwaySurvey and analysis of critical and artistic responses to Mexican muralism (Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros) by American communists in the 1930s.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
