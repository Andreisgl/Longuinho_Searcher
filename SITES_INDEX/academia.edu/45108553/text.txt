Culture as a sector and as a practice in international relations has not been exempted either. Indeed, the social, political and economic characteristics of the pandemic have had deep implications for culture and its role in international relations. Preliminary evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on the cultural and creative sectors (CCS) in partner countries – the Neighbourhoods, the Western Balkans, and the Strategic partners – and on their capacity and willingness to conduct international relations (IR), together with an overall analysis of the policy responses put in place by state and non-state actors to limit such an impact, are provided in this report.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersUniversity of BergamoTourism Facing a Pandemic. From Crisis to Recovery2020 • Federica  BuriniThis collection of papers has been written by the international team of scholars teaching at the Master Course in Planning and Management of Tourism Systems of the University of Bergamo, while the Covid-19 emergency was spreading in all parts of the World and especially in the territory of Bergamo. The main aim of the work is to face the topic of Tourism in the case of exogenous shocks, like the Covid-19 pandemic, reflecting on their impacts on territories, communities and heritage both during and after the crisis. The papers adopt different disciplinary approaches and methods, trying to give a multi-focused gaze to the complexity of a global phenomenon and to possible forms of recovery. This collection is addressed to students and researchers studying in the tourism sector, who are in search of answers in this time of change and crisis. We believe that after reading this volume they won't have all the answers to their dilemmas, but they will reflect about them, they will receive proposals for specific approaches, methodologies, sources, references, examples, useful for the future of their own research.Download Free PDFView PDFTourism Facing a Pandemic: From Crisis to Recovery Contemporary Art and Tourism: Global and Local, in Tourism Facing a Pandemic: From Crisis to Recovery (edited By Federica Burini), Università degli studi di Bergamo, 2020, pp. 243-2502020 • raffaella pulejo, Patrizia AnesaThis collection of papers has been written by the international team of scholars teaching at the Master Course in Planning and Management of Tourism Systems of the University of Bergamo, while the Covid-19 emergency was spreading in all parts of the World and especially in the territory of Bergamo.

The papers adopt different disciplinary approaches and methods, trying to give a multi-focused gaze to the complexity of a global phenomenon and to possible forms of recovery. Raffaella Pulejo's papers (pp.243-250), focuses on some contemporary art practices which are based on local ground and reshape the notion of space, time and social interaction. Against the background of big international events, typical in the contemporary art system and now forbidden, artists' works might suggest new paths in the tourism domain.Download Free PDFView PDFReconnect: the Cultural Sector in a State of Emergency, Sofia: Intercultura Consult, April 2020Reconnect: the Cultural Sector in a State of Emergency, Sofia: Intercultura Consult, April 20202020 • Milena Berbenkova, Petya KolevaAt the end of March, we interviewed eleven representatives of the independent cultural sector in both the arts and cultural tourism. We explored how the state of emergency is affecting their activities and income, and how they are coping with the new challenge. A summary of the interviews is presented here, and a list of interviewees is presented below. Understandably, all interviewees stated that they have had to postpone planned activities such as performances, guided tours, and touring. Some had already canceled commitments beyond the state of emergency period - in the months of the second half of the year. Currently, events with direct interaction are impossible to conduct and expectations for live events in the months afterwards are pessimistic. Yet, important aspects of social life are accompanied by cultural services, which form a main source of economic activity and income for theater actors and artists combining art with educational activities. Under the condition of social isolation, family festivities with accompanying cultural activities are also cancelled. For one of the interviewees, these celebrations normally represent 7-8 engagements per month, and generate a considerable part of their monthly income. An additional obstacle for artists working with children is the closure of schools and kindergartens.Download Free PDFView PDFBrookings InstitutionLost Art: Measuring COVID-19's devastating impact on America's creative economy2020 • Michael SemanThe COVID-19 crisis hits hard at arts, culture, and the creative economy. This study estimates the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the creative economy, comprised of industries such as film, advertising, and fashion as well as creative occupations like musicians, artists, performers, and designers. We estimate losses in sales of goods and services, employment, and earnings for creative industries and creative occupations at the national, state, and metropolitan levels over the period of April 1 through July 31, 2020.Download Free PDFView PDFONCE UPON A TIME IN MOVIE THEATRES: HOW THE FILM INDUSTRY IS RE-WRITING ITS SCREENPLAY Master thesis in CULTURAL ECONOMICSIsabella FaveroThe outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in the early months of 2020 unleashed a domino effect that impacted a wide variety of sectors. Among others, the film industry registered critical detriments, with thousands of cinema theatres closed around the world and film productions, major releases and some of the most important events in the field, such as festivals and awards postponed, temporarily suspended or definitively cancelled. The aim of this thesis is to outline an extensive picture of the Covid-19 effects on the world of cinema, starting from the analysis of the pre-existing challenges that were affecting the business and that have been exacerbated by the health crisis, namely the impact of digital technologies on the film value chain, the enhancement of OTT and VOD platforms and the consequent “streaming war”, the constant need for original contents, the overload of franchises and sequels and the predominance of blockbusters at the expenses of small and mid-budget productions. The research will therefore focus on film festivals that, being the quintessential node of intersection between trade and artistic interests can be regarded as an ideal “microcosm” from which to develop a reflection on cinema and the processes in which it is involved. In this respect, the analysis of the 34th edition of Il Cinema Ritrovato was deemed an emblematic case study to investigate the extent in which the outbreak of the virus impacted the industry of cinema, providing interesting insights on the implementation and management of an unprecedented festival configuration involving the co-existence of live and digital events. The study will thus highlight the pivotal role played by the pandemic hiatus in accelerating a process of change in spaces, times and means of consumption, eventually giving the opportunity to re-think the way in which audiences and professional approach and define cinema.Download Free PDFView PDFArts Management QuarterlyArts Management Quarterly No 134: Generating Revenue Online2020 • Kristin Oswald, Johan  KolsteegAura, experience and being together. For many professionals in arts and culture, these are the central values of analogue cultural formats, which cannot be replaced by digital ones. Unfortunately, this skepticism or contempt regarding digital cultural offerings as well as an unwillingness to pay for them is also being assumed for the audience – without actually asking them about it. Are aura, experience, and being together as valuable to the visitors as they are for us professionals? And are these aspects really pivotal for their visits to cultural institutions? Is it not rather about valuable content, no matter if analogue or digital? Additionally, digital formats and events also mean financial expenses for cultural institutions and artists. So why should they be for free? First and foremost, what it needs to make digital paid formats attractive are new parameters, such as lower prices, creative formats or the principle of shortened availability. As well as a mindset for digital business models for cultural institutions and artists. There are already numerous examples from arts and culture proving that new forms of experience or community are possible in the digital world – and not only in times of limited analogue access.Download Free PDFView PDFHuman FuturesGLOBAL VS LOCAL: THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS AND EDUCATION2020 • Alexandra Montgomery Whittington, Joana LenkovaThe COVID-19 crisis has brought to light new tipping points and tensions positioned to impact global institutions over the coming years.

Being highly dependent on social interaction, the creative industries and art making are among those badly hit-specifically the performing arts sector. The sector's vulnerability is magnified by the onslaught of this crisis, and the industry, in most countries are not given funding priority in the region, especially when the immediate need is to mitigate the spread of the virus. The Philippine government has provided some assistance to the sector, but these will never be enough. The concerns and anxiety of creative workers continues to heighten with these questions: "Will the industry will ever go back to the way it was before COVID? Will the arts retain its patrons and audiences in these times of uncertainty, with limited resources and spending power, and with the looming threat of recession?" This descriptive study intends to solicit the perceptions and behavior of arts audiences in Metro Manila through a quantitative survey conducted from May to June 2020. The insights gathered from this study aims to provide guidance as to how struggling arts organizations will be able to pivot their operations and productions, and transition towards the new normal in presenting the arts in the country.Download Free PDFView PDFMUSEUMS AND THE WEB AT THE TIME OF COVID-19MUSEUMS AND THE WEB AT THE TIME OF COVID-19 In search of lasting museological innovations during the pandemic2020 • Massimo NegriThis project aimed to carry out, in a relatively short period, an overview of new initiatives and emerging trends in the museum sector – with a specific focus on the use of the web - as online tools are already changing the way museums orient themselves to society and the user’s perception of these initiatives.
