It is important both for a single scene when the combination of land covers, sun, and view angles create anisotropy and for multiple scenes in which the sun angle changes. As a consequence, it is important for inter-sensor calibration and comparison. Procedures based on physics-based models have been applied successfully with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. For Landsat and other higher resolution data, similar options exist. However, the estimation of BRDF models using internal fitting is not available due to the smaller variation of view and solar angles and infrequent revisits. In this paper, we explore the potential for developing operational procedures to correct Landsat data using coupled physics-based atmospheric and BRDF models. The process was realized using BRDF shape functions derived from...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRemote Sensing of EnvironmentDevelopment of an approach for generation of temporally complete daily nadir MODIS reflectance time series2010 • Yanmin ShuaiDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentThe value of multiangle measurements for retrieving structurally and radiatively consistent properties of clouds, aerosols, and surfaces2005 • Ralph KahnDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Applied Earth Observation and GeoinformationScaling dimensions in spectroscopy of soil and vegetation2007 • Zbynek malenovSKYDownload Free PDFView PDFRadiative Transfer Modelling for the characterisation of natural burnt surfaces AO/1-5526/07/NL/HEMathias DisneyDownload Free PDFView PDFPreparing Landsat Image Time Series (LITS) for Monitoring Changes in Vegetation Phenology in Queensland, AustraliaSantosh  BhandariTime series of images are required to extract and separate information on vegetation change due to phenological cycles, inter-annual climatic variability, and long-term trends. While images from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor have the spatial and spectral characteristics suited for mapping a range of vegetation structural and compositional properties, its 16-day revisit period combined with cloud cover problems and seasonally limited latitudinal range, limit the availability of images at intervals and durations suitable for time series analysis of vegetation in many parts of the world. Landsat Image Time Series (LITS) is defined here as a sequence of Landsat TM images with observations from every 16 days for a five-year period, commencing on July 2003, for a Eucalyptus woodland area in Queensland, Australia. Synthetic Landsat TM images were created using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm for all dates when images were either unavailable or too cloudy. This was done using cloud-free scenes and a MODIS Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product. The ability of the LITS to measure attributes of vegetation phenology was examined by: (1) assessing the accuracy of predicted image-derived Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) estimates using ground-measured values; and (2) comparing the LITS-generated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1) time series. The predicted image-derived FPC products (value ranges from 0 to 100%) had an RMSE of 5.6. Comparison between vegetation phenology parameters estimated from LITS-generated NDVI and MODIS NDVI showed no significant difference in trend and less than 16 days (equal to the composite period of the MODIS data used) difference in key seasonal parameters, including start and end of season in most of the cases. In comparison to similar published work, this paper tested the STARFM algorithm in a new (broadleaf) forest environment and also demonstrated that the approach can be used to form a time series of Landsat TM images to study vegetation phenology over a number of years.Download Free PDFView PDFScaling dimensions in spectroscopy of soil and vegetation (International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 2007)Zbynek malenovSKYDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentFirst operational BRDF, albedo nadir reflectance products from MODIS2002 • Trevor Tsang, Jan-Peter MullerDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentA generalized approach to the vicarious calibration of multiple Earth observation sensors using hyperspectral data2001 • Herb Ripley, G.
