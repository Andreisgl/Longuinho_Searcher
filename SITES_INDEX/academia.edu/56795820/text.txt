(2017). The “New Racism” of K–12 Schools: Centering Critical Research on Racism. Review of Research in Education, 41(1), 182-202.Rita Kohli, Arturo NevárezWhile organizing efforts by movements such as Black Lives Matter and responses to the hate-filled policies and rhetoric of President Donald Trump are heightening public discourse of racism, much less attention is paid to mechanisms of racial oppression in the field of education. Instead, conceptualizations that allude to racial difference but are disconnected from structural analyses continue to prevail in K–12 education research. In this chapter, our goal is to challenge racism-neutral and racism-evasive approaches to studying racial disparities by centering current research that makes visible the normalized facets of racism in K–12 schools. After narrowing over 4,000 articles that study racial inequity in education research, we reviewed a total of 186 U.S.-focused research studies in a K–12 school context that examine racism. As we categorized the literature, we built on a theory of the " new racism " —a more covert and hidden racism than that of the past—and grouped the articles into two main sections: (1) research that brings to light racism's permanence and significance in the lives of students of Color through manifestations of what we conceptualize as (a) evaded racism, (b) " antiracist " racism, and (c) everyday racism and (2) research focused on confronting racism through racial literacy and the resistance of communities of Color. In our conclusion, we articulate suggestions for future directions in education research that include a more direct acknowledgement of racism as we attend to the experiences and needs of K–12 students of Color.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Assembly JournalPublic Pedagogy for Racial Justice Teaching: Supporting the Racial Literacy Development of Teachers of Color2018 • Rita Kohli, Arturo Nevárez, Nallely ArteagaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Critical Thought and PraxisWhiteness FAQ: Responses and Tools for Confronting College Classroom QuestionsCheryl  MatiasDownload Free PDFView PDFKohli, R. (2016) Behind School Doors: The Impact of Hostile Racial Climates on Urban Teachers of Color. Urban Education2016 • Rita KohliDespite recruitment efforts, teachers of Color are underrepresented and leaving the teaching force at faster rates than their White counterparts. Using Critical Race Theory to analyze and present representative qualitative narratives from 218 racial justice–oriented, urban teachers of color, this article affirms that urban schools—despite serving majority students of Color—operate as hostile racial climates. Color blindness and racial microaggressions manifest as macro and micro forms of racism and take a toll on the professional growth and retention of teachers of Color. These findings suggest a need for institutionalized reform to better support a diverse K-12 teaching force.Download Free PDFView PDFThe 20th Year Anniversary of Critical Race Theory in Education: Implications for Leading to Eliminate RacismColleen CapperStructured Abstract Purpose: Though the first published application of Critical Race Theory (CRT) to education occurred 20 years ago, implications of CRT for educational leadership did not occur until Lopez (2003) conducted a CRT analysis of the politics of education literature. No publications explicitly identify the implications of CRT for leadership practice. Given the gap in the literature, the research question that anchors this paper asks: How can CRT inform educational leadership to eliminate racism? Research Methods: To address the research question, I conducted a literature analysis of CRT in educational leadership, identified the CRT tenets that guided each publication and derived six primary, interrelated CRT tenets from this analysis. I also extracted from the publications explicit and implicit implications for leadership practice as these implications related directly to each of the six CRT tenets. Findings/Implications: I describe each of the CRT tenets and explain how each can inform educational leadership practice. To close the paper, I propose a CRT Inventory for Leading to Eliminate Racism. The Inventory suggests questions to guide leadership practice for each of the CRT tenets. I also offer implications for future research.

Exploring the potential of teacher education2018 • Melissa A AlvaréA substantial body of literature demonstrates how withinschool patterns serve to maintain and perpetuate racial inequality in education. This occurs as well‐meaning teachers and administrators tend to hold lower academic expectations for students of color; engage in racially biased discipline patterns; employ alienating curricula; and fail to address racial issues in meaningful ways when they surface in classrooms. In this paper, I review literature on these and other inequitable patterns and subsequently summarize research exploring how these issues are confronted teacher training programs. While some pedagogical models show promise, many studies suggest that multicultural education and programs for preservice teachers fall short in promoting perspectives and practices to address inequity in schools. I apply tenets of critical race theory to scrutinize oppression within schools and the shortcomings of initiatives claimed to redress them, and moreover, to suggest how teacher education can be improved to encourage pedagogy for social justice ends.Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Race Theory and Hmong American EducationChristin DePouwCritical Race Theory and Hmong American Education by Christin DePouw, Hmong Studies Journal, 19(1): 1-40. Abstract Critical race theory (CRT) in education provides important conceptual tools in analyses of Hmong American education. CRT in education centers race and racism in relation to other axes of oppression, thereby locating educational inequities that Hmong American youth experience within appropriate historical, social, and institutional contexts. These contexts support deeper analyses that consider the sociopolitical and intersectional factors that affect Hmong American youth and their families. Importantly, these analyses provide Hmong American students with the concepts needed to name and validate their experiences as part of the development of critical race consciousness.Download Free PDFView PDFHigher EducationUsing critical race theory to reframe mentor training: theoretical considerations regarding the ecological systems of mentorshipCarrie SaetermoeDownload Free PDFView PDFEducational StudiesCan We Say the "r" Word?: Identifying and Disrupting Colorblind Epistemologies in a Teacher Education Methods Course2019 • Vincent  BasileSeveral educational researchers have critiqued the increasing marginalization of foundations coursework in teacher education programs within the United States. Situated within a teacher certification program at a Predominately White Institution without foundations courses, this self-study examined an English methods course designed to address this curricular gap and prepare candidates to teach racially and culturally diverse students attending urban schools. Through a conceptual framework grounded in critical race theory, interpretive analysis of student work relative to course material evidenced a consistent pattern of omitting themes, discussions, and reflection about race and racism. This finding–consistent with the literature on colorblind epistemologies–led me to implications about pedagogy and curriculum in teacher education centered around opportunities for candidates to develop racial literacy in their methods courses and across their programs.Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Race Theory 20 Years Later: Where Do We Go From Here2016 • Oscar Navarro, Tyrone HowardAs the nation's schools become increasingly diverse along ethnic and racial lines, examining and understanding the racial complexities in the United States is more germane now than ever in the nation's history. To that end, critical race theory (CRT) has been a transformative conceptual, methodological, and theoretical construct that has assisted researchers in problematizing race in education. As we reflect on 20 years of CRT, it is essential to examine in what ways, if any, CRT is influencing school practice and policy. Given the disparate educational outcomes for students of color, researchers have to inquire about the influence of CRT on the lived experiences of students in schools. In this article, the authors lay out the historical trajectory of CRT, discuss its influence on educational research, and then evaluate to what extent, if any CRT has had on school policy and practice. The article will conclude with research, practice, and policy implications that may influence CRT's development over the next 20-year period. Race and education have always been an essential element in the way opportunities for learning have manifested in U.S. schools.
