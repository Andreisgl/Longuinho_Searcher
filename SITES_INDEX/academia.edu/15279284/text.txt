Osmotic devices which are tablets coated with walls of controlled porosity are the most promising strategy based systems for controlled drug delivery. In contrast to common tablets, these pumps provide constant (zero order) drug release rate. When these systems are exposed to water, low levels of water soluble additive is leached from polymeric material i.e. semipermeable membrane and drug releases in a controlled manner over an extended period of time. The main clinical benefits of oral osmotic drug delivery system are their ability to improve treatment tolerability and patient compliance. These advantages are mainly driven by the capacity to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, independent of the drug chemical properties, of the patient’s physiological factors or following food intake. This review brings out the theoretical concept of drug delivery, history, advantages and disadvantages of the delivery systems, types of oral osmotic drug delivery systems, factors affecting the drug delivery system and marketed products.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersA Review on Novel Osmotically Controlled Drug Delivery SystemP. Dinesh KumarConventional drug delivery systems are known to provide an immediate release of drug, in which one can not control the release of the drug and can not maintain effective concentration at the target site forlonger time. Osmotically controlled drug delivery systems (OCDDS) are most promising systems for controlleddrug delivery. Osmotically controlled drug delivery systems utilize osmotic pressure for controlled delivery ofactive agents. Various patents are available for osmotic drug delivery system like Rose and Nelson pump,Higuchi Leeper pump, Higuchi Theeuwes pump, Elementary osmotic pump etc. Various techniques available for preparation of OCDDS include push pull osmotic pump, Osmotic bursting osmotic pump, Liquid OROS,Telescopic capsule for delayed release, OROS-CT (colon targeting), and Sandwiched osmotic tablet system.These systems can be used for systemic as well as targeted delivery of drugs. Drug delivery from these systems,to a large extent, is independent of physiological f...Download Free PDFView PDFOsmotically Controlled Drug Delivery System with Associated Drugshồ hồng ngọcConventional drug delivery systems have slight control over their drug release and almost no control over the effective concentration at the target site. This kind of dosing pattern may result in constantly changing, unpredictable plasma concentrations. Drugs can be delivered in a controlled pattern over a long period of time by the controlled or modified release drug delivery systems. They include dosage forms for oral and transdermal administration as well as injectable and implantable systems. For most of drugs, oral route remains as the most acceptable route of administration. Certain molecules may have low oral bioavailability because of solubility or permeability limitations. Development of an extended release dosage form also requires reasonable absorption throughout the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Among the available techniques to improve the bioavailability of these drugs fabrication of osmotic drug delivery system is the most appropriate one. Osmotic drug delivery systems release the drug with the zero order kinetics which does not depend on the initial concentration and the physiological factors of GIT. This review brings out new technologies, fabrication and recent clinical research in osmotic drug delivery. __________________________________________________________________________________________Download Free PDFView PDFOsmotic Controlled Drug Delivery Systems: An OverviewAjit JadhavOsmotic controlled drug delivery systems utilize the principles of osmotic pressure for the controlled delivery of active agent. The delivery rate of zero-order is achievable with these systems. The release rate from these systems is highly predictable and can be programmed by modulating the release control parameters. The drug release from these systems is independent of gastric pH and hydrodynamic conditions. A high degree of in vivo-in vitro correlation (IVIVC) is obtained with osmotically controlled drug delivery systems. In this review various types of osmotic systems, basic components, patent literature and commercially marketed osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFBansode, SarvananAshwini S BansodeDownload Free PDFView PDFFormulation aspects in development of controlled porosity osmotic pump tabletDurgesh R ParakhThe development of oral controlled release system has been a challenge to formulation scientist due to their inability to restrain and localize the system at targeted areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Various physical and chemical approaches have been applied to produce a well characterized dosage form that controls drug input into the body within the specifications of the desired release profile. This is generally accomplished by attempting to obtain " zero-order " release from the dosage form, i.e., the rate of drug release is independent of the drug concentration. Controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet; which is an extension of elementary osmotic tablet, utilizes the principle of osmotic pressure for the delivery of drugs and avoids the expensive laser drilling for creation of delivery orifice on the tablet coat. They do not have any aperture to release the drugs; drug release is achieved through the pores, which are formed in the semi permeable wall in situ during the operation. The advantages of controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet are mainly driven by the capacity to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, independent of the drug chemical properties, patient's physiological factors or concomitant food intake. However, access to this technology has been restricted by the crowded patent landscape and manufacturing challenges. The present review highlights the principle of osmosis, formulation variables, factors affecting drug release, recent researches, marketed products and the evaluation parameters of controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet.Download Free PDFView PDFOSMOTIC PUMP DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM: A NOVAL APPROACHJillian ChangDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Controlled ReleaseOsmotic drug delivery: a review of the patent literature1995 • Richard BakerDownload Free PDFView PDFpharmacie-globale.infoOSMOTIC PUMPS: A REVIEWRohitashva SharmaDownload Free PDFView PDFDesign and Development of Once a Day Oral Osmotic Drug Delivery System of Ropinirole Master of Pharmacy in Pharmaceutical Technology Under the guidance ofAurélio MoreiraDownload Free PDFView PDFOsmotic Pump: A Reliable Drug Delivery SystemK ReddyDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
