International Journal of Inclusive Education. doi:10.1080/13603116.2014.981602Judith  Hebron2014, International Journal of Inclusive EducationA ‘state of the field’ review of what is currently known about bullying of children and adolescents with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) is presented. We highlight compelling evidence that they are considerably more likely to be bullied than those with other or no special educational needs and disabilities. Although prevalence estimates vary from study to study, they are always worryingly high, with the highest rate reported as 94%. Those most at risk include (but are not limited to) individuals with Asperger syndrome and/or with milder deficits in social understanding, early adolescents, those attending mainstream school, and those with concurrent behavioural difficulties. Research on anti-bullying interventions for ASC is in its relative infancy. Currently available evidence suggests that a multi-level, comprehensive approach to intervention that offers parallel foci on children and young people with ASC, their peers, teaching and support staff, and the broader school ethos and climate is warranted. A crucial component of the above is the acknowledgement of the elevated risk experienced by those with ASC and the requirement to tailor interventions to their specific needs.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAutismHebron, J. & Humphrey, N. (2013). Exposure to bullying among students with autism spectrum conditions: A multi-informant analysis of risk and protective factors. Autism: The International Journal of Research and Practice. doi: 10.1177/13623613134959652013 • Judith  HebronIn recent years, research has consistently shown that children and young people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are more likely to be bullied than those with other or no special educational needs. The aim of the current study was to explore characteristics associated with increases (risk factors) and decreases (protective factors) in bullying. 722 teachers and 119 parents completed questionnaires on their child’s experience of being bullied, with consideration given to both individual and contextual factors. Both teachers and parents reported that behaviour difficulties and increased age were related to being bullied. Teachers also reported that having positive relationships with others and attending a special school were associated with lower levels of bullying, while the use of public/school transport to travel to and from school was accompanied by a small increase in bullying. Parents reported that pupils with identified needs but without statutory educational support were at greater risk of being bullied, although higher levels of parental engagement and confidence were associated with reductions in bullying. These findings are discussed in relation to the ASC literature, along with a reflection on the relevance of general bullying research to those with ASC, and the social inclusion of this group of children. Opportunities for intervention are considered in the light of emerging common themes, including different types of approach and the importance of the school environment.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Research in Special Educational NeedsVulnerability to bullying of children with autism spectrum conditions in mainstream education: a multi-informant qualitative exploration2015 • Jeremy OldfieldDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of Special Needs EducationPerceptions of friendship among adolescents with autism spectrum conditions in a mainstream high school resource provision2016 • Judith  HebronDownload Free PDFView PDFAustralasian Journal of Special EducationBullying Prevalence in Students With Autism Spectrum DisorderJill AshburnerAll forms of bullying, physical, verbal, social, and cyber, are prevalent among youth worldwide. An especially vulnerable population for involvement in bullying is students with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although there are some studies that have investigated bullying in these students, many of these are beset by methodological issues. We surveyed 104 students with ASD on their bullying experiences in all 4 forms of bullying and examined their roles as victim, perpetrator, and bully-victim, comparing them with a group of typically developing students matched for age and gender. It was found that students with ASD reported significantly more traditional victimisation (physical, verbal, and social) than their typically developing peers. Cyberbullying victimisation was similar for the 2 groups. There were no differences between the groups on traditional bullying perpetration; however, typically developing students reported more cyberbullying perpetration behaviours.

Nonetheless, concerns about their emotional well-being and mental health in these settings have also been raised. This study sought to compare caregiver-reported anxiety and other emotional and behavioural problems in youth with ASD attending mainstream or specialist schools. Caregivers of 27 youth with ASD in mainstream schools (age 10.91 ± 3.44 years) and 69 youth with ASD in special schools (age 10.93 ± 2.81 years) matched for gender, age, adaptive functioning and autism symptom severity scores participated. Caregivers completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale–Parent, a measure of adaptive functioning, and a checklist of other emotional and behavioral difficulties. Students with ASD attending mainstream schools experienced higher levels of social anxiety symptoms compared to their specialist school counterparts. No other statistically significant differences were found in other aspects of emotional and behavioural functioning examined, but some differences emerged in item-level analyses. Uncertainties in navigating more complex social environments and increased social relating difficulties in mainstream schools are discussed as probable environmental triggers for increased social phobia related symptomatology, although other explanations for this small effect size difference are also considered. Limitations of the present study and recommendations for future research focusing on exploring environmental socio-ecological factors influencing anxiety and mental health in young people with ASD are also discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFThe experience of friendship, victimization and bullying in children with an autism spectrum disorder: Associations with child characteristics and school placement2012 • tom loucasDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Communication DisordersFamiliarity breeds support: Speech-language pathologists’ perceptions of bullying of students with autism spectrum disorders2013 • Erinn FinkeDownload Free PDFView PDFReview Journal of Autism and Developmental DisordersApproaches to Inclusion and Social Participation in School for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC)—a Systematic Research ReviewJohanna LüddeckensThis systematic research review identifies approaches of inclusive education concerning adolescents with autism spectrum (ASC) without intellectual disability (ID). The definitions of inclusion, whose perspectives are taken into account, approaches, and the implications suggested for best practices are reviewed in the articles included in this study. The results show how inclusion is defined as a sense of social acceptance and an approach that physical placement in a regular class can lead to social participation. Taking into account students’ perspectives is seen as important. Implications for best practice include information on how to improve school personnel’s reflections on their responsibilities and expectations of students with disabilities and points to difficulties for teachers in meeting the diversity of students in the classroom.Download Free PDFView PDFBritish Journal of Educational PsychologySchool connectedness and the primary to secondary school transition for young people with autism spectrum conditionsJudith  HebronDownload Free PDFView PDFAn Investigation of "Circle of Friends" Peer-Mediated Intervention for Students with Autism2014 • Mary SchliederThe dramatic rise in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by a substantial increase in public school inclusion. A growing body of research supports the need for teachers proficient in evidence-based practices to support such students. One strategy involves using peer support networks like Circle of Friends (CoF) for ASD adolescents. A collective case study was used to investigate experiences of stakeholders relative to a CoF community. Four themes emerged from a cross-case analysis: the influence a CoF partnership initiative has on inclusion, social skills improvement, empowerment, and sense of wellbeing. For the purposes of this article, findings relative to inclusion are discussed. CoF fostered an attitude of peer acceptance for classmates with ASD and helped alleviate feelings of fear peers experienced toward ASD classmates. CoF peers developed empathy and understanding for the CoF target student, and those qualities extended to students outside t...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
