Writing, Remembering and Commemorating the Holocaust in Macedonia and Bulgaria after 1989Nadège  RAGARUPaolo Fonzi2017, SüdosteuropaThe author analyses the scholarship, remembrance, and commemoration of the Holocaust in Macedonia and Bulgaria after 1989. She re-examines interpretive schisms between former communists and anticommunists, explores changes in one of the major lieux de mémoire in Bulgaria, the ‘rescue’ of its Jews, and juxtaposes it to the killing of those Jews who lived in Bulgarian-occupied territories. She contextualizes the Bulgarian-Macedonian controversies within European and global frameworks, looking at the process of the institutionalization of Holocaust remembrance in the two countries. She then considers the role of international Jewish communities and the effects of a European Union that since the enlargement of 2007 has been moulding a ‘European’ commemorative landscape from fear of yet another East-West divide. In her conclusion the author outlines an agenda for a transnational social history of anti-Jewish policies and persecutions, and looks at who might be its major actors in Bulgaria and Macedonia.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSüdost-ForschungenBordering the Past: The Elusive Presences of the Holocaust in Socialist Macedonia and Socialist Bulgaria2017 • Nadège  RAGARUDownload Free PDFView PDFLA SHOAH EN EUROPE DU SUD-EST : Les Juifs en Bulgarie et dans les terres sous administration bulgare (1941-1944)Roumen AvramovDownload Free PDFView PDFParis: Editions du Mémorial de la Shoah (Ebook)La Shoah en Europe du Sud-Est.

This ally of Nazi Germany passed anti-Semitic legislation in January 1941 and laid the framework for the expropriation of Jewish properties. In the “Old Kingdom” (pre-1941 borders) however, the economic deprivation of the Bulgarian Jews did not prefigure their deportation. By contrast, in Yugoslav and Greek territories under Bulgarian occupation, economic dispossession, deportation and extermination were inexorably linked. Could the issue of spoliation therefore provide a perspective shedding new light on this tragic bifurcation? How can one interpret the micro-social dynamics, which led some social actors to take part in the grabbing of Jewish property and at times to also publicly oppose the deportation of Bulgaria’s Jews? The publication of a pioneer piece of research by Bulgarian historian Roumen Avramov provides the opportunity to offer a review of the literature on the Holocaust and the expropriation of Jewish properties in Bulgaria. Building upon Avramov’s work, this article also suggests areas for further research on anti-Jewish policies in Bulgaria.Download Free PDFView PDF"The Liquidation of Jewish Properties in Bitola: Plunder by Decree during the Bulgarian Occupation (1943," in: Berta Romano Nikolikj et al. (ed.), Jews in Macedonia. History, Tradition, Culture, Language and Religion, Skopje: Jewish Community in the Republic of Macedonia, 2015, p.249-262.Nadège  RAGARUA few years ago, former partisan Žamila Kolonomos recalled her impressions as she, together with some fellow partisans, returned to the Jewish quarters of Bitola following the end of the war: “One day, we decided to visit the Jewish quarters, los Kurtilos (the courtyards), la Kaleja (the street), the Male, the Tabane, the Bumba, the synagogues, the schools, the cemetery, the stores, the shops of the secondhand dealers and the tinsmiths, il ken (the clubhouse), where the members of the Hashomer Hatsair gathered and the other places where our people lived and worked (…). What did we see, houses abandoned, destroyed or rundown. At the windows and doors were strange people. The Ladino language was not heard, nor the voices of mothers calling their children, nor the sounds of disputes and curses, nor the singing of romansas (ballads). We didn’t meet a known person and no one invited us to enter a house.” The reading of these lines prompted my desire to return to these houses and try to investigate the fate of the properties that Bitola’s Jews, arrested by Bulgarian authorities in March 1943 and later deported to Treblinka, had left behind them. Within the framework of this talk, I would like to focus on three issues in particular: the organization of the liquidation of Jewish properties, the competitive relations between the institutions and social actors in charge of this action, and the looting of Jewish houses.Download Free PDFView PDFMaster's Thesis - "Nationalism in Practice: Assimilation, Expulsion, and Extermination in the Balkans, 1913-1945"2012 • Josef M DjordjevskiDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Deportation of the Jews from Vardar Macedonia and Aegean Region.

It compares the work of two path-breaking historians—Mark Levene and Timothy Snyder—while also discussing recent research by other scholars. The reviewer discusses the recent turn to microhistories in Holocaust scholarship. The article points to the limitations of the discourse of the nation-state in narrowing the historical context and our world of imagination. It concludes that the complexities on the social level, each rooted in specific circumstances and histories, challenge the analytical value of the general term “Holocaust.” "Tomasz Frydel, for example, has described his research on the Rzeszów region in the General Government of German-occupied Poland as 'integrated microhistory' that offers 'an antidote to polarized historiography,' usually along national fault lines. Focusing on the 'hunt for Jews' in the Polish countryside from 1942 to 1945, Frydel explores the violence within the context of the brutality of the German occupation and the related hunt for Soviet prisoners or war, partisans and deserters from the German army. Within this extremely violent reality, 'local attitudes and violence against Jews was connected with—and conditioned by—violence against Poles for sheltering Jews.' It is for this reason 'that rescuing and killing were not infrequently carried out by the same people.' The term 'the Holocaust' offers no insight into such complexity, and it blurs the wide range of complexities that Jews and others faced in vastly different places and times throughout World War II."Download Free PDFView PDFThe Microeconomics of State AntisemitismRoumen AvramovThe fates of the Jews from Bulgaria and from the territories occupied by the country (1941– 1944) present a striking dichotomy. While those inhabiting Bulgaria proper survived, the Jews from the Greek and Yugoslav lands administrated by the Bulgarian authorities were deported by them into German custody and murdered in Treblinka. The economics of this Holocaust story has attracted scant attention. The lecture draws evidence from the Bulgar­ ian archives and addresses the Government's spoliation policies carried out in the realm under its control. They nurtured behavioural patterns, mobilised social actors and fostered institutional networks. Reduced to its basic economic terms, the expropriation of the Jews boiled down to a forced offer of assets and personal belongings, which engendered strongly biased customer's 'markets'. This operation remapped segments of the economic tissue and further enhanced the role of the State through the arbitrary interventions of the Commis­ sariat for the Jewish Affairs. In a broader perspective, the myriad of induced economic trans­ actions contributed largely to the banalisation of antisemitism among different strata of the society.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
