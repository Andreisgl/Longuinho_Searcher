This study examined the impact of a PMTCT intervention and male involvement on EBF. In a two-phase cluster-randomized trial, rural South African community health centers were randomized to offer HIV-infected pregnant women PMTCT standard of care plus either: a behavioral PMTCT intervention, or a time-equivalent attention-control condition. Phase 1 women had non-participating male partners; Phase 2 women had participating partners. Pregnant women (n = 1398) were assessed on HIV stigma, disclosure of HIV status to partner, male involvement, and family planning knowledge. Feeding practices were assessed 6 weeks postpartum (56% retained). Reduced depressive symptomatology predicted EBF 6 weeks postpartum, adjusting for attrition (AOR = 0.954, p = 0.001). Neither male involvement in antenatal care, phase, HIV stigma, disclosure, nor family planning knowledge pre...Download Free PDFView PDFAIDS and BehaviorEffects of Depression, Stigma and Intimate Partner Violence on Postpartum Women’s Adherence and Engagement in HIV Care in Kenya2019 • kevin owuorDownload Free PDFView PDFViolence Against WomenPrenatal and Postnatal Intimate Partner Violence and Associated Factors Among HIV-Infected Women in Rural South Africa: A Longitudinal StudyMotlagabo MatsekeIntimate partner violence (IPV) has been highlighted as one of the challenges to the effectiveness of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs in rural areas in South Africa. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of prenatal and postnatal physical as well as psychological IPV, and corresponding time-invariant and time-varying predictors, among HIV-positive women attending PMTCT services in rural South Africa. The Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) was used to assess IPV at four time points prenatal and postnatal. This study highlighted high levels of physical and psychological IPV experienced by HIV-infected women during pregnancy and in the first year after childbirth. Time-invariant predictors and time-varying predictors of physical IPV and psychological IPV were individual, social, and behavioral factors. Multi-dimensional evidence-based interventions are needed to deal with the high levels of prenatal and postnatal physical as well as psychological...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Pregnancy and ChildbirthSocial concerns related to HIV status disclosure and participation in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV care among pregnant women in KenyaE.

Bidirectional IPV—being both a perpetrator and victim—may be the most common pattern of IPV, yet no research has examined its effect on engagement in care, which could identify couples in most need of interventions. Married couples ( N = 211) with at least one partner on antiretroviral therapy were recruited from HIV clinic waiting rooms in Zomba, Malawi. Partners completed separate surveys on physical, sexual, and emotional IPV, medication adherence, and appointment attendance. We created categorical variables indicating no violence, perpetrator-only, victim-only, and bidirectional violence. Generalized estimating equation regression models tested for associations between IPV and engagement in care. The bidirectional pattern represented 25.4%, 35.5%, and 34.0% of all physical, sexual, and emotional IPV. Physical IPV victimization-only (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.28, 95% confiden...Download Free PDFView PDFThe effect of intimate partner violence on women's risk of HIV acquisition and engagement in the HIV treatment and care cascade: an individual-participant data meta-analysis of nationally representative surveys in sub-Saharan AfricaLynnMarie SardinhaBackground: Achieving the 95-95-95 targets for HIV diagnosis, treatment, and viral load suppression (VLS) to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic hinges on eliminating structural inequalities, including intimate partner violence (IPV). Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has among the world&#39;s highest prevalence of IPV and HIV. We aim to examine the impact of IPV on recent HIV infection and women&#39;s engagement in the HIV care cascade. Methods: We pooled individual-level data from nationally representative surveys with information on physical and/or sexual IPV and HIV in SSA (2000-2020). We used Poisson regressions with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of past year experience of IPV on recent HIV infection (measured using recency assays), past-year HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake, and VLS among ever-partnered (currently/formerly married or cohabitating) women. Models were adjusted for women&#39;s age, age at sexual debut, residence type, marital st...Download Free PDFView PDFPLOS ONEIntimate partner violence and subsequent premature termination of exclusive breastfeeding: A cohort study2019 • jane rogathiDownload Free PDFView PDFMaternal and Child Health JournalIntimate Partner Violence and Breastfeeding in Africa2013 • Kathryn YountDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Maternal and Child Health and AIDS (IJMA)HIV-Positive Women Taking Lifelong Antiretroviral Therapy Report Better Adherence Than Women Taking Short-Course Prophylaxis During and After Pregnancy Under PMTCT Program Option A in Lusaka, Zambia2017 • Yusuf AhmedBackground and Objectives: HIV-positive women’s adherence to antiretrovirals is critical for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. We aimed to establish if mothers taking triple lifelong antiretroviral therapy report higher adherence compared to mothers taking short-course prophylaxis under Option A in Lusaka, Zambia.Methods: In this clinic-based cross-sectional study, we interviewed 320 HIV-positive mothers at a large public health facility in Lusaka in 2014. Participants reported adherence using a visual analog scale. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the adjusted odds of adherence by mother’s prescribed regimen.Results: Women taking lifelong triple antiretroviral therapy report higher adjusted odds of adherence during pregnancy, postpartum, and to giving the infant prophylaxis compared to women to women taking short-course prophylaxis.Discussion: Women on lifelong therapy may have better adherence compared to women on short course prophylaxis becaus...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
