  Overview
As a charity you can get certain tax reliefs. To benefit you must be recognised by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
Charities do not pay tax on most types of income as long as they use the money for charitable purposes.
You can claim back tax that’s been deducted, for example on bank interest and donations (this is known as Gift Aid).
This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
When you need to pay tax
Your charity may need to pay tax if you’ve:
received income that does not qualify for tax relief
spent any of your income on non-charitable purposes
You need to complete a tax return if your charity has tax to pay.
Community amateur sports clubs (CASCs) get different tax reliefs.
