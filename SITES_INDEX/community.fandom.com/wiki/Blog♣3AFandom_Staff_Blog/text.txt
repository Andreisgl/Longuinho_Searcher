Creating Magic at Conventions
One of the aspects I cherish most about this platform is
witnessing communities grow and flourish. People from diverse
backgrounds unite to celebrate their fandom, document intricate
lore, discuss theories, and simply have fun. When this all comes
together to create a healthy, welcoming environment, it’s a
culinary masterpiece -- *chef’s kiss* -- of digital
togetherness.
Anime communities, in particular, hold a special place in my
heart. My initiation into the world of fandom began with Digimon
and Pilot Candidate (if that rings a bell, congratulations, you're
officially my friend!) When I was younger, I didn’t really
participate in communities much. I mostly stayed in my own corner
of the internet and took in content by myself.
My first exp…

Celebrating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Entertainment: A Win for All
The entertainment industry, with its rich tapestry of stories,
characters, and narratives, holds an influential position in
shaping cultural dialogue and societal norms. Over the years, it
has become increasingly clear that the industry's true power lies
in its ability to foster an inclusive space that reflects the
diverse world we live in. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
are not just buzzwords but integral values that can enrich our
entertainment landscape and society at large.
Here are some compelling reasons why fans should celebrate and
acknowledge DEI in entertainment:
Representation Matters: When entertainment mirrors the
diverse realities of our global society, it makes everyone feel
seen, acknowledged, and validated. Viewing a…

When editors created an infobox and set row labels, it failed

Users will no longer experience issues when they open the

editor mode and trying to switch between VisualEditor and
SourceEditor pages, editors won’t be stuck on a loading state on
the page as they edit.

Let’s talk about fanon wikis
We need to talk about… fanon wikis! We have decided to start a
series of blogs about the lesser-known and misunderstood wikis of
Fandom, and I chose fanon wikis to kick it off! Fanon can be
ill-perceived by certain individuals or entities for reasons such
as: violation of canon, quality concerns, misrepresentation of
characters, shipping wars, copyright and legal concerns… But it's
essential to remember that fanon is also very diverse and rich.
Fanon is a reflection of fans' passion, creativity, and love for
the source material, and for many, it enhances their enjoyment of
the original works. Let’s dive into the topic now! And don’t
hesitate to share your love for fanon wikis in the comments!
"Fanon" refers to the ideas, stories, and interp…

resolved!
There was an issue with the Light Theme background not
appearing properly for some users after uploading a new version
through the Theme Designer. The Light Theme background now appears
in the Theme Designer.

Disability Pride Month: Making Room and Taking Up Space
We’re celebrating Disability Pride Month, highlighting the
resilience and contributions of the disabled community through the
theme Making Room and Taking Up Space. In the context of
inclusivity, "making room" and "taking up space" refer to creating
an environment where individuals from diverse backgrounds feel
welcome, valued, and empowered to participate fully. This month is
not only about raising awareness but also about fostering an
environment of acceptance and inclusion. And what better way to do
this than through one of the most powerful mediums of our time –
entertainment?
The entertainment industry often serves as a mirror, reflecting
the diverse experiences and perspectives that make up our world.
Unfortunately, the reflection of …

Disability Pride Month: Going Through the (E)motions
Hey folks!
I'm Chris, back with my second ever Community Central blog -
practice makes perfect!
It's Disability Pride Month, a time where we highlight
how people with disabilities should feel empowered by their
differences and take pride in them. It's about reflecting on how
society sees disability and what we all can do to improve this.
I'll be honest, I had no idea what Disability Pride Month was up
until recently, even though I have been using a wheelchair since I
was a child. I remember when I was younger, I wasn't exactly proud
of my disability and focused on how limiting it could be. Over time
though, I learned that any limitations there are don't have to
limit how I live and that I can and should be proud of who I
am.
So for those who ju…

Editor-Oriented Upgrade for Community Central Live Today
Hello everyone!
As you are reading this blog post, you are currently on
Community Central, and you will have noticed some things have
changed - these are part of the work we did to make Community
Central more useful for all kinds of editors and users on

about editing topics at their skill level with skill-level-tailored
help or advice, be able to find help on editing matters in our
editor forums, learn about new product updates and more
initiatives, and from there they can deep dive into our community

Improving Inclusiveness: New Ways For Beginners to Join the Community
Hello everyone!
We have heard your message clearly that you want us to do more
to bring new editors to Fandom. Recently, on the product front, we
already have communicated some of the great success we've found,
and to complement these efforts on the social side of things, we
have set out to make it easier for newcomers to become first-time
editors, do their next few edits and finally join the users who
feel confident enough to explore around the network and wikis on
their own.
Presenting the new Advice Section of our help documentation:
We have been working internally and in collaboration with our
Fandom Stars group to bring custom advice and opinion blogs for new
users to explore and dive into. For people who are not yet
comfortable with edi…
