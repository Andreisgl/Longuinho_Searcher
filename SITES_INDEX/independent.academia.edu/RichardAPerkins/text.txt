The equations are based in part upon a body of experimental data that have been critically assessed for internal consistency and for agreement with theory whenever possible.Inthecase ofthedilute-gas thermal conductivity,atheoretically based correlation was adopted in order to extend the temperature range of the experimental data. Moreover, inthecriticalregion,theexperimentally observedenhancementofthethermalconductivity is well represented by theoretically based equations containing just one adjustable parameter. The correlations are applicable for the temperature range from the triple point to 600 K and pressures up to 250 MPa. The overall uncertainty (considered to be estimates of a combined expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2) of the proposed correlation is estimated, for pressures less than 250 MPa and temperatures less than 600 K, to be less than 4%. 2013 by the U...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We describe current work at NIST to improve the data situation for both transport properties. For the viscosity, new theoretical results for the dilute vapor and a semitheoretical scaling approach for the liquid allow us to produce an improved correlation. In the case of the thermal conductivity, we measured new data with a transient hot-wire instrument. These measurements cover temperatures from 219 K to 751 K at pressures up to 69 MPa, with uncertainties near 0.5 % for the liquid and compressed gas, increasing to 3 % for low-pressure gases and conditions very near the critical point. This improves the uncertainty at most conditions by more than a factor of two compared to previous me...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
