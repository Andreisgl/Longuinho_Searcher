Academics and students in higher education have responded to the challenges by reconceptualising what learning and teaching is in the twenty-first century. This study proffers a new vision seen through interdisciplinary lenses, the application of design thinking and the development of a new collaborative teaching and learning methodology: journey-mapping in the Landscapes of Learning (J-MapLL). This empirical study analyses the multi-modal methodology through three case study groups. The findings illustrate its efficacy in unfolding thinking in the individual through the sharing of collective narratives and production of journeymaps, in the personal and professional Landscapes of Learning.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersConference parallel session 7.1 Empowering Students Co-curriculum Design in a Conceptual Age: Engaging Students in the Landscapes of Learning 2013 • Christine KingsleyThe current social and economic uncertainties have posed particular challenges for students and lecturers in contemporary Higher Education (HE). Academics and students in universities have responded to the challenges by reconceptualising what learning and teaching encompasses in the twenty-first century. This study proffers an interdisciplinary solution through the development of a new methodology: journey-mapping in the Landscapes of Learning (J-MapLL). This empirical study analyses the multi-modal methodology through three case study groups and demonstrates its efficacy in unfolding thinking through individual journey-maps and collective ‘big picture’ maps in the Landscapes of Learning that are personal and professional, within a given context.Download Free PDFView PDFAdditional InformationMatilda YeboahPlease cite the published version.Download Free PDFView PDFAustralian Journal of Environmental EducationThree Academics’ Narratives in Transforming Curriculum for Education for Sustainable Development2013 • Dr Luise Adams, Jenny Underwood, Verity PrideauxDownload Free PDFView PDFStrategies and Outcomes of community engagement using an adaptive learning perspectiveDesiree Manicom, Julia Preece, Cias  TsotetsiThe purpose of this article is to compare how students and community members learned and applied their knowledge in four small-scale university–community engagement projects during 2013. It draws on the concept of adaptive leadership as an approach and analytical tool in a recently completed community engagement and service learning action research partnership between the University of the Free State (UFS) Qwa Qwa campus and the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Pietermaritzburg campus. The project was funded by the National Research Foundation , with additional support from the UKZN Teaching and Learning Fund and UFS Faculty of Education research funds. A total of twelve case studies involved sixty-five students, nine NGOs and four schools. In each case, students worked in teams in response to community requests for assistance. Projects included Saturday curriculum activities for schools, workshops for parents, assisting with film making or archiving, assisting with monitoring and evaluation of rural reading clubs, producing small organic gardens and assisting with a childcare development project. Each case study involved end of project interviews with students and community contacts and some interim observations during the project implementation phase. This article compares four of the case study findings between the two institutions. It outlines how the concept of community engagement has evolved and briefly reviews the literature on community engagement, particularly in the South AfricanDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Computing Sciences in …Connecting undergraduate programs to high school students: Teacher workshops on computational thinking and computer science2010 • George ChangDownload Free PDFView PDFWriting intensive and writing extensive: a continuum for advancing writing in computer science education: panel discussion2010 • Timothy  DansdillDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Computing Sciences in CollegesA general education course-Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking-using Visual Logic©: poster session2010 • Namita SarawagiDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Ethical and Practical Dimensions of Focusing on Followership Development (with Ira Chaleff and Wendy Edmonds)Tom SechrestDownload Free PDFView PDFTeaching Introductory Programming: A Quantitative Evaluation of Different ApproachesRobert MacredieDownload Free PDFView PDFAn evaluation of school responses to the introduction of the Queensland 1999 health and physical education (HPE) syllabus and policy documents in three Brisbane Catholic primary schools. doi:10.13140/2.1.1865.66412005 • Timothy  LynchWithin Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE) the 1999 HPE syllabus was implemented between 1999 and 2001. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the 1999 Queensland HPE syllabus in three BCE primary schools of varying enrolment numbers. The research problem is: ‘How developed is the implementation of the new HPE syllabus in BCE schools?’ The data collection was guided by the following research questions:- • How are teachers in these BCE schools implementing the HPE curriculum documents? • What readily accessible resources do schools have to assist with the implementation of Health and Physical Education? • What are teachers’ perceptions with regard to the HPE Key Learning Area? • What are the children’s perceptions of the HPE Key Learning Area? • What implementation strategies are required to optimize HPE practices in BCE schools? This study is significant for the feedback it may provide to BCE of the HPE syllabus implementation process and in informing BCE of the current status of the HPE key learning area within a sample of systemic Catholic primary schools. The findings have the potential to contribute to the BCE Strategic Renewal Framework currently occurring within BCE schools for all curriculum areas and planned for completion by the end of 2006. This research has been designed within a constructionist paradigm. An interpretivist study was conducted employing symbolic interactionism. This qualitative, interpretive study is most appropriate as meanings were constructed. The case study methodology was chosen to construct meaning through capturing the context of each school. The sites for the three case studies involved: one small sized BCE primary school (less than 200 students); one medium sized BCE primary school (200 - 400 students); and one large sized BCE primary school (over 400 students). The participants included teachers and students from the respective schools. The data gathering strategies used were; semi-structured and focus group interviews, reflective journal note taking, observations, questionnaire and document analysis. The research concluded that factors which led to the decline in Australian HPE during the 1980s and early 1990s may have contributed to impeding the implementation challenges formulated by BCE. This was evidenced within the three BCE primary schools by unequal allocation of teaching resources, equipment, facilities, HPE teachers and HPE teacher release time for sports coordination. It appears that the implementation process ceased prematurely before all schools had had sufficient time and preparation to design whole school HPE programs. Teachers lacked understandings of practical ways to implement the social justice underpinnings of the syllabus and some school principals were unaware of the necessity of employing qualified HPE specialist teachers. The research revealed that school principals play a significant role in the implementation of the 1999 HPE syllabus, a role made more imperative by the absence of BCE HPE Curriculum Officers and systemic HPE professional development. Therefore, the HPE key learning area requires further system level support and attention so that the 1999 HPE syllabus can be implemented successfully in all BCE primary schools, enabling curriculum change to occur.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
