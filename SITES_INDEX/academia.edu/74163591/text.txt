A great many of these alien species have become invasive and had extraordinary environmental, ecological, economic, societal, and cultural impacts in recipient communities. For example, invasive alien species (IAS, for definitions in this paper see Box 1) are considered one of the main drivers of global biodiversity loss . They can also cause severe economic losses, risks to animal, plant and human health and create societal and cultural impacts . Furthermore, these effects are expected to accelerate as more species spread beyond their historic borders due to (1) further globalization;See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe EASIN Editorial Board: quality assurance, exchange and sharing of alien species information in EuropeYa'arit Levitt-BarmatsThe European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) aims to facilitate the exploration of alien species information in Europe, and is recognized as the information system supporting European Union Member States in the implementation of the recently published Invasive Alien Species Regulation. In this paper, we present the role and activities of the EASIN Editorial Board (EB), which is responsible for the quality assurance, safeguarding and constant improvement of EASIN. The EB is supported by a web platform that facilitates online discussions about alien species. This platform creates a virtual community by providing a forum-like interface that is moderated by the EB Members but is freely accessible to the scientific community and the general public. It allows all registered users to make comments, raise questions and share experience and expertise on alien species in Europe. Moreover, it provides a means for exchanging opinions and solving disputes in a transparent way. The overall EB activity is commonly agreed upon procedures and standards.Download Free PDFView PDFThe EASIN Editorial Board: quality assurance, exchange and sharing alien species information in Europe.2016 • Michel Bariche, Ya'arit Levitt-BarmatsDownload Free PDFView PDFPeerJAlien plants of Europe: introduction pathways, gateways and time trendsAnastasia ChristopoulouThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) pathways classification framework used in the implementation of the European Union’s (EU) Regulation 1143/2014 on invasive alien species (IAS Regulation) has recently been adopted by the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN), the official information system supporting the implementation of the IAS Regulation. In the current paper, the result of an alignment of the primary introduction pathways of all alien plants in Europe included in the EASIN catalogue is presented, based on the CBD framework. In total, 6,250 alien plant taxa (marine plants excluded), both alien to Europe (native range outside Europe) and alien in Europe (native range partially in Europe) are reported. Altogether 5,175 plant taxa had their primary introduction pathway aligned based on the CBD framework, while for the rest the pathway remains unknown. In addition, the taxonomy, year and country of its first record in the wild are provided for each taxon.

Managing the pathways through which alien species arrive and spread is important to reduce the threat of biological invasions. Harmonising information on pathways across individual sectors and user groups is therefore critical to underpin policy and action. The European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) has been developed to easily facilitate open access to data of alien species in Europe. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Pathway Classification framework has become a global standard for the classification of pathways. We followed a structured approach to assign pathway information within EASIN for a subset of alien species in Europe, which covered 4169 species, spanning taxonomic groups and environments. We document constraints and challenges associated with implementing the CBD Pathway Classification framework and propose potential amendments to increase clarity.

The conference continues to provide an opportunity for dialog between academia, industry and environmental regulators. Abstract Aquatic Invasive Alien Species (AIAS) are increasing due to the synergistic effects of climate change and habitat destruction. AIAS can heavily impact biodiversity and human health, causing a loss of ecosystem services; therefore, their control and management have now become a priority, particularly in the light of the new EU regulation 1143/2014 on invasive alien species. The main research goal of the Innovative Training Network Marie Skłodowska-Curie Aquainvad-ED is to exploit the application of innovative tools and the power of citizen science for early detection, control and management of AIAS. Eight early stage researchers are involved in Aquainvad-ED, engaged in four main research themes: (1) development and application of novel methods for early detection of AIAS; (2) identification of vectors of introduction and pathways of dispersal; (3) impacts of freshwater and marine invaders; and (4) risk assessment and control of AIAS. In order to develop multidisciplinary approaches to address these issues, the fellows are working within an international consortium (UK, Spain, Italy) composed of scientists and conservation practitioners from three universities (Swansea University, Universidad de Oviedo, Università degli Studi di Firenze), one technological institute (AZTI), two governmental agencies (Natural Resources Wales and Cardiff Harbour Authority), one NGO (Wye & Usk Foundation) and five SMEs working in fundamental and applied aspects of AIAS (Neoalgae, Natural Applications, NEMO, Ecohydros, and Itinera C.E.R.T.A).Download Free PDFView PDFFrontiers in ICTHandling Big Data of Alien Species in Europe: The European Alien Species Information Network GeodatabaseEugenio GervasiniDownload Free PDFView PDFTackling invasive alien species in Europe II: threats and opportunities until 2020Predrag Simonović, Marina Piria, Gordon H CoppInvasive alien species (IAS) are a significant and growing problem worldwide. In Europe, some aspects of IAS have been addressed through existing legal instruments, but these are far from sufficient to tackle the problem comprehensively. The FINS II Conference considered the relevance of Top 20 IAS issues (Top 10 threats and opportunities) for Europe determined at the 1st Freshwater Invasiveness – Networking for Strategy (FINS I) conference held in Ireland in 2013. Using a similar format of sequential group voting, threats from FINS I (lack of funding, of awareness and education; poor communication) and several new threats (lack of lead agencies, of standardized management and of common approach; insufficient monitoring and management on private property) were identified by 80 academics, applied scientists, policy makers and stakeholders from 14 EU and three non-EU countries (including 10 invited speakers) during four workshop break-out sessions (legislation remit in both EU/non-EU countries; best management and biosecurity practice for control; data management and early warning; pathways of introductions and citizen science). Identified opportunities include improved cooperation and communication, education and leadership to enhance public awareness and stakeholder participation, systems establishment for early detection, rapid response, monitoring and management of IAS using standardised methods of data collection, storage and usage.The sets of threats and opportunities identified underline the importance of international cooperation on IAS issues in communication, education and funding as priorities, as well as in standardization of legislation, control methods and best practise of research.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Alien Species Information Network (EASIN): supporting European policies and scientific researchYannis Kokkorisof existing alien species information and to assist the implementation of European policies on biological invasions. At the core of EASIN, there is an inventory of all known alien and cryptogenic species in Europe (the EASIN Catalogue, herein published), which includes relevant information, such as taxonomic classification, pathways of introduction, year and country of first introduction. Spatial records of species occurrence in Europe are stored in the EASIN geo-databases, integrating data from many data providers and the literature. All this information is publicly available through a widget framework, providing easy to use and flexible tools for searching and mapping. The EASIN datasets have been used for pan-European or regional assessments of pathways and gateways of alien invasions, towards the fulfilment of the related targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity and of European policies.
