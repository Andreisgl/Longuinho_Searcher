Yet the very well-intentioned actions that are meant to stave off immediate humanitarian crises may, in the long-term, serve as tools that promote dependence, decrease the likelihood of sustainable development, and make peace less possible. In this article, I examine food insecurity and food aid in the conflict-affected Palestinian territories. I will describe ways in which Palestinian efforts to localise food production and increase food security are actively hindered, as well as how the system of humanitarian food assistance meant to fill these gaps may in fact perpetuate them. Finally, I discuss policy recommendations for stakeholders in the conflict that can encourage Palestinian food sovereignty in a manner that increases prospects for long-term peace and development, while providing immediate benefits for Palestinian quality of life and well-being.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Equality through Innovation: Promoting Women in the Workplace in Low-and Middle-Income Countries with Health Information TechnologyJournal of Social Issues,  2020Technological innovation has served as a useful catalyst for development goals across sectors, fr... more Technological innovation has served as a useful catalyst for development goals across sectors, from agriculture to education. Various forms of health information technology (HIT), such as mobile health and telemedicine, have been used globally to support health care delivery systems. Forms of HIT, developed primarily by men in rich countries, are touted to support all patients and providers. However, while women perform most global health delivery, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), they have less access to technology. Stakeholders have been slow to recognize and resolve conflicts about how technology affects gender disparities, especially in health care. In this paper, we describe, using a social capital framework, how integrating HIT in health systems can empower women in the health care workforce. We conclude with policy recommendations that can support women in the health care workforce through HIT. Numerous global development initiatives suggest that the empowerment of women and girls is one of the most pressing issues of this century. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 aims to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls" by 2030 (UNDP, 2019a,b), while the Organization * Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed toYara M.

To develop meaningful safety programs, it is important to identify workplace factors that contribute to injuries. This study explored factors that affect injuries in a sample of newly licensed registered nurses (NLRNs) in Florida. Regressions were run on models in which the dependent variable was the degree to which the respondent had experienced needlesticks, work-related musculoskeletal injuries, cuts or lacerations, contusions, verbal violence, physical violence, and other occupational injuries. A higher probability of these injuries was associated with greater length of employment, working evening or night shifts, working overtime, and reporting job difficulties and pressures. A lower probability was associated with working in a teaching hospital and working more hours. Study findings suggest that work environment issues must be addressed for safety programs to be effective.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study assesses the health-related quality of life, stress, and insecurity of the West Bank, which has been engaged in conflict for seven decades, in comparison to a demographically and culturally similar population in Jordan, a neighboring nation with no conflict. We expect the Jordanian sample to report better functioning.Methods We collected 793 surveys from university students (mean age = 20.2) in Nablus, West Bank (398 [50.2%]) and Irbid, Jordan (395 [49.8%]). The survey instrument consisted of the SF-36 to measure HRQoL, the PSS-4 to measure stress, and an insecurity scale, along with demographic characteristics. Results Our findings indicate that outcomes in the West Bank were not significantly worse than in Jordan, and in some cases represented better functioning, especially in the SF-36 measures.Conclusions Our counterintuitive results suggest that health and well being outcomes are dependent on many factors in addition to conflict. For one, it may be that the better perceived health and well-being of the Palestinians is because they have developed a culture of resilience. Additionally, Jordanians are undergoing a period of instability due to internal struggles and surrounding conflicts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The role of digital health in making progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 in conflict-affected populationsInternational Journal of Medical Informatics,  2018Purpose: The progress of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) shows that sustained global acti... more Purpose: The progress of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) shows that sustained global action can achieve success. Despite the unprecedented achievements in health and education, more than one billion people, many of them in conflict-affected areas, were unable to reap the benefits of the MDG gains. The recently developed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are even more ambitious then their predecessor. SDG 3 prioritizes health and well-being for all ages in specific areas such as maternal mortality, communicable diseases, mental health, and healthcare workforce. However, without a shift in the approach used for conflict-affected areas, the world's most vulnerable people risk being left behind in global development yet again. We must engage in meaningful discussions about employing innovative strategies to address health challenges fragile, low-resource, and often remote settings. In this paper, we will argue that to meet the ambitious health goals of SDG 3, digital health can help to bridge healthcare gaps in conflict-affected areas. Methods: First, we describe the health needs of populations in conflict-affected environments, and how they overlap with the SDG 3 targets. Secondly, we discuss how digital health can address the unique needs of conflict-affected areas. Finally, we evaluate the various challenges in deploying digital technologies in fragile environments , and discuss potential policy solutions. Discussion: Persons in conflict-affected areas may benefit from the diffusive nature of digital health tools. Innovations using cellular technology or cloud-based solutions overcome physical barriers. Additionally, many of the targets of SDG 3 could see significant progress if efficacious education and outreach efforts were supported , and digital health in the form of mHealth and telehealth offers a relatively low-resource platform for these initiatives. Lastly, lack of data collection, especially in conflict-affected or otherwise fragile states, was one of the primary limitations of the MDGs. Greater investment in data collection efforts, supported by digital health technologies, is necessary if SDG 3 targets are to be measured and progress assessed. Standardized EMR systems as well as context-specific data warehousing efforts will assist in collecting and managing accurate data. Stakeholders such as patients, providers, and NGOs, must be proactive and collaborative in their efforts for continuous progress toward SDG 3. Digital health can assist in these inter-organizational communication efforts. Conclusion: The SDGS are complex, ambitious, and comprehensive; even in the most stable environments, achieving full completion towards every goal will be difficult, and in conflict-affected environments, this challenge is much greater. By engaging in a collaborative framework and using the appropriate digital health tools, we can support humanitarian efforts to realize sustained progress in SDG 3 outcomes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study assesses the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), perceived stress and insecurity of Palestinian young adults in the West Bank. We surveyed 398 university students from Nablus (mean age = 20.1) using the SF-36 to measure HRQoL, the PSS-4 to assess stress and a context-specific insecurity instrument. A third of participants reported Israeli citizenship, and the results indicated better outcomes in these individuals in several outcomes, with the noteworthy exception of insecurity. This study is one of the first to assess citizenship of West Bank Palestinians as a potential covariate to predict measures of well-being. Because citizenship is such a meaningful issue for Palestinians and is related to individual freedom and access to resources, this study suggests that there are complex dynamicsSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Thi... more ABSTRACT Evaluating disparities in healthcare outcomes is not an easy task for policy makers. This requires access to outcome indicators at the patient level. Patient level data are not easily available because of privacy considerations and costs of collection. One approach to assess health disparities is to examine variations in mortality from conditions known to be amenable to medical care. Mortality amenable to healthcare (MAHC) is defined as deaths before the age of 75 from selected causes that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective medical care (Nolte ad McKee, 2004). This study describes the differences in age-adjusted standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) from all cause MAHC and ASMRs for diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease separately, by parish, in Louisiana; and estimates the Spearman correlation between ASMR from all cause MAHC and socio-economic factors.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Subjects in the hard sciences, such as pathophysiology, have traditionally been taught in the face-to-face format, but growing demand for preclinical science courses has compelled educators to incorporate online components into their classes to promote comprehension. Learning tools such as case studies are being integrated into such courses to aid in student interaction, engagement, and critical thinking skills. Careful assessment of pedagogical techniques is essential; hence, this study aimed to evaluate and compare student perceptions of the use of case studies in face-to-face and fully online pathophysiology classes. A series of case studies was incorporated into the curriculum of a pathophysiology class for both class modes (online and face to face). At the end of the semester, students filled out a survey assessing the effectiveness of the case studies. Both groups offered positive responses about the incorporation of case studies in the curriculum of the pathophysiology class. This study supports the argument that with proper use of innovative teaching tools, such as case studies, online pathophysiology classes can foster a sense of community and interaction that is typically only seen with face-to-face classes, based on student responses. Students also indicated that regardless of class teaching modality, use of case studies facilitates student learning and comprehension.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study, we aim to assist administrators in understanding the characteristics of top performing hospitals. We utilized data from the Health Information and Management Systems Society and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid to assess 1039 hospitals. Inputs considered were full time equivalents, hospital size, and technology inputs. Technology inputs included personal health records (PHR), electronic medical records (EMRs), computerized physician order entry systems (CPOEs), and electronic access to diagnostic results. Output variables were measures of quality, hospital readmission and mortality rate. The analysis was conducted in a two-stage methodology: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Automatic Interaction Detector Analysis (AID),decision tree regression (DTreg). Overall, we found that electronic access to diagnostic results systems was the most influential technological characteristics; however organizational characteristics were more important than technological inputs. Hospitals that had the highest levels of quality indicated no excess in the use of technology input, averaging one use of a technology component. This study indicates that prudent consideration of organizational characteristics and technology is needed before investing in innovative programs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Can Inbound and Domestic Medical Tourism Improve Your Bottom Line?

Two potentially untapped sources are inbound (international) and domestic (within theUnited States) medical tourists. This case study uses data from a large, urban healthcare system in the southeastern United States to quantify its potential market opportunities for medical tourism. The data were mined from electronic health records, and descriptive frequency analysis was used to provide a preliminary market assessment. This approach permits healthcare systems to move beyond anecdotal information and assess the relative market potential of their particular geographic area and the diagnostic services they offer for attracting inbound and domestic medical tourists. Implications for healthcare executives and guidance on how they can focus marketing efforts are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, this work often limits their personal and professional opportunities and perpetuates gender disparities. The outsized role of women caregivers is attributed to historical, cultural, and social perspectives on gender and caregiving that perpetuate the gender inequalities in unpaid care work. In this chapter, we analyze women in unpaid work considering two regions: The United States and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We compare these regions along social, political and historical contexts, including use of two vignettes. As a result of the comparisons, we make several key recommendations, framed by Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model, that include: 1) generating awareness for US women caregivers to receive compensation, and 2) developing the job industry to embrace women caregivers in MENA countries.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
