Therefore, reconstructing the history of their association is of evolutionary, ecological, and conservation significance. Here, time-calibrated Bayesian phylogenies of Euastacus species and their temnocephalans (Temnohaswellia and Temnosewellia) indicate near-synchronous diversifications from the Cretaceous. Statistically significant cophylogeny correlations between associated clades suggest linked evolutionary histories. However, there is a stronger signal of codivergence and greater host specificity in Temnosewellia, which co-occurs with Euastacus across its range. Phylogeography and analyses of evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) suggest that regional differences in the impact of climate warming and drying had major effects both on crayfish...Save to LibraryDownloadby Lester Cannon•  14  Conservation Biology, Phylogeography, Phylogenetics, AustraliaThe first report of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia in farmed rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), in the United KingdomSave to LibraryDownloadby Peter Dixon•  12  Zoology, Fish Diseases, United Kingdom, PhylogenyCoevolution of languages and genes on the island of Sumba, eastern IndonesiaSave to LibraryDownloadby John Schoenfelder and +2Peter NorquestSteve Lansing•  11  Coevolution, Indonesia, Linguistics, LanguageOutbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) in seawater-farmed rainbow trout in Norway caused by VHS virus Genotype IIISave to LibraryDownloadby Helle Frank  Skall•  24  Pathology, Epidemiology, Fisheries, ImmunohistochemistryIdentification and pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae species associated with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) decline in southern CaliforniaSave to LibraryDownloadby alaaddin eskalen•  10  Microbiology, Plant Biology, California, PhylogenyLow “penetrance” of phylogenetic knowledge in mitochondrial disease studiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Alessandro Achilli and +1Qing-peng Kong•  20  Documentation, Population Genetics, East Asia, European UnionLittle evidence for enhanced phenotypic evolution in early teleosts relative to their living fossil sister groupSince Darwin, biologists have been struck by the extraordinary diversity of teleost fishes, particularly in contrast to their closest " living fossil " holostean relatives.

Hypothesized drivers of teleost success include innovations in jaw mechanics, reproductive biology and, particularly at present, genomic architecture, yet all scenarios presuppose enhanced phenotypic diversification in teleosts. We test this key assumption by quantifying evolutionary rate and capacity for innovation in size and shape for the first 160 million y (Permian–Early Cretaceous) of evolution in neopterygian fishes (the more extensive clade containing teleosts and holosteans). We find that early teleosts do not show enhanced phenotypic evolution relative to holosteans. Instead, holostean rates and innovation often match or can even exceed those of stem-, crown-, and total-group teleosts, belying the living fossil reputation of their ex-tant representatives. In addition, we find some evidence for hetero-geneity within the teleost lineage. Although stem teleosts excel at discovering new body shapes, early crown-group taxa commonly display higher rates of shape evolution. However, the latter reflects low rates of shape evolution in stem teleosts relative to all other neopterygian taxa, rather than an exceptional feature of early crown teleosts. These results complement those emerging from studies of both extant teleosts as a whole and their sublineages, which generally fail to detect an association between genome duplication and significant shifts in rates of lineage diversification.Save to LibraryDownloadby John T Clarke•  14  Geometric Morphometrics, Fish Biology, Phylogeny, DiversificationThe Lejeunea tumida species group is positively polyphyletic (Lejeuneaceae: Jungermanniopsida)Save to LibraryDownloadby Glenda Wardle•  18  Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Plant Ecology, Plant BiologyAn mtDNA perspective of French genetic variationSave to LibraryDownloadby Kristiina  Tambets•  9  Population Genetics, France, Phylogeny, Mitochondrial DNALactobacillus diolivorans sp. nov., a 1,2-propanediol-degrading bacterium isolated from aerobically stable maize silageInoculation of maize silage with Lactobacillus buchneri (5 x 10(5) c.f.u. g(-1) of maize silage) prior to ensiling results in the formation of aerobically stable silage.

After 9 months, lactic acid bacterium counts are approximately 10(10) c.f.u. g(-1) in these treated silages. An important subpopulation (5.9 x 10(7) c.f.u. g(-1)) is able to degrade 1,2-propanediol, a fermentation product of L. buchneri, under anoxic conditions to 1-propanol and propionic acid. From this group of 1,2-propanediol-fermenting, facultatively anaerobic, heterofermentative lactobacilli, two rod-shaped isolates were purified and characterized. Comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the newly isolated bacteria have identical 16S rDNA sequences and belong phylogenetically to the L. buchneri group. DNA-DNA hybridizations, whole-cell protein fingerprinting and examination of phenotypic properties indicated that these two isolates represent a novel species, for which the name Lactobacillus diolivo...Save to LibraryDownloadby J.

In this review, we describe the use of different molecular markers and methods for data analysis used to address these questions. There is a clear trend towards the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms and whole-genome sequence information, the application of Bayesian or Approximate Bayesian analysis and the use of adaptive next to neutral diversity to support decisions on conservation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hans Lenstra•  14  Genetics, Zoology, Genomics, Population GeneticsState of cat genomicsSave to LibraryDownloadby Marilyn Menotti-Raymond•  8  Geography, Genomics, Felidae, CatsAnalysis of structural diversity in wolf-like canids reveals post-domestication variantsSave to LibraryDownloadby Iñigo Olalde and +2CARLES LALUEZA-FOXJessica Hernandez-rodriguez•  8  Molecular Evolution, Biological Sciences, Dogs, PhylogenyHistorical stocking data and 19th century DNA reveal human-induced changes to native diversity and distribution of cutthroat troutSave to LibraryDownloadby Kyle Keepers•  12  Phylogeography, Population Genetics, Molecular Ecology, Biological SciencesDiversity in the Enteric Viruses Detected in Outbreaks of Gastroenteritis from Mumbai, Western IndiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Vaishali Tatte•  16  Biology, Adolescent, Medicine, MultidisciplinaryJuvenile hormone induces the expression of the SnoSP2 gene encoding a methionine-rich hexamerin in Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera)Save to LibraryDownloadby Anna Kourti•  19  Physiology, Biology, Medicine, LepidopteraGenome maps across 26 human populations reveal population-specific patterns of structural variationSave to LibraryDownloadby Walfred Ma•  20  Evolutionary Biology, Algorithms, Genomics, Computational BiologyEvolution of mating isolation between populations of Drosophila ananassaeSave to LibraryDownloadby Shiva Zargham•  19  Geography, Speciation, Molecular Evolution, AustraliaPeriglandula, a new fungal genus within the Clavicipitaceae and its association with ConvolvulaceaeSave to LibraryDownloadby Eckhard  Leistner•  14  Microbiology, Plant Biology, Symbiosis, BiologyHalorhabdus tiamatea sp. nov., a non-pigmented, extremely halophilic archaeon from a deep-sea, hypersaline anoxic basin of the Red Sea, and emended description of the genus HalorhabdusSave to LibraryDownloadby Marco Taborda•  20  Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology, Medical Microbiology, BiologyEvolutionary origins, diversification, and biogeography of liver flukes (Digenea, Fasciolidae)Fasciolid flukes are among the largest and best known digenetic trematodes and have considerable historical and veterinary significance.

Recently, this species was discovered by us in northern Vietnam as the first record outside of China. DNA sequences of both second internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2) and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1) genes of the metacercariae and adult worms of P. proliferus of the Vietnamese isolates were identical with those of Paragonimus hokuoensis in the DNA database of the GenBank. To confirm those observations and to clarify the molecular phylogenetic status of P. proliferus, we determined the ITS2 and CO1 sequences of the metacercariae of P. proliferus obtained in Yunnan province, China where the original specimen was discovered. The results show that both ITS2 and CO1 sequences of P. proliferus of the Chinese isolates are identical with those of P. proliferus of the Vietnamese isolates and are also identical with those of P. hokuoensis that appeared in the DNA database (obtained in Yunnan province), suggesting the synonymy of P. hokuoensis with P. proliferus. By phylogenetic tree analyses, all samples of P. proliferus from China and Vietnam together with P. hokuoensis constructed a distinct group within, or very close to, Paragonimus skrjabini complex in both trees.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lai, Pham Ngoc•  18  Microbiology, Parasitology, Medical Microbiology, ChinaGenotypic Diversity of Clinical Actinomyces Species: Phenotype, Source, and Disease Correlation among GenospeciesWe determined the frequency distribution of Actinomyces spp. recovered in a routine clinical laboratory and investigated the clinical significance of accurate identification to the species level.

Recent... moreCyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are the catalytic subunits of a family of mammalian heterodimeric serine/threonine kinases that have been implicated in the control of cell-cycle progression, transcription and neuronal function. Recent genetic evidence obtained with gene-targeted mice has shown that Cdk4 and Cdk6 are not needed for entry into the cell cycle after mitogenic stimuli and organogenesis; however, they are essential for the proliferation of some endocrine and hematopoietic cells. Cdk2 is also dispensable for the mitotic cell cycle. Indeed, mice without Cdk2 are normal except for their complete sterility: unexpectedly, Cdk2 is crucial for the first meiotic division of male and female germ cells. These findings have important implications both for our current understanding of the role of Cdks in regulating the mammalian cell cycle and for their potential use as therapeutic targets in cancer.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marcos Malumbres•  9  Cell Cycle, Biological Sciences, Phylogeny, HumansExploitation of marine bacteria for production of gold nanoparticlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Anirban Choudhury•  8  Microbiology, Industrial Biotechnology, Metal Nanoparticles, PhylogenyMethanogenesis at extremely haloalkaline conditions in soda lakes of Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia)Microbial methanogenesis at extreme conditions of saline alkaline soda lakes has, so far, been poorly investigated.

Despite the obvious domination of sulfidogenesis as the therminal anaerobic process in hypersaline soda lakes of Kulunda Steppe (Altai, south-western Siberia), high concentrations of methane were detected in the anaerobic sediments. Potential activity measurements with different substrates gave results significantly deviating from what is commonly found in hypersaline habitats with neutral pH. In particular, not only a non-competitive methylotrophic pathway was active, but also lithotrophic and, in some cases, even acetate-dependent methanogenesis was found to be present in hypersaline soda lake sediments. All three pathways were functioning exclusively within the alkaline pH range between 8 and 10.5, while the salt concentration was the key factor influencing the activity. Methylotrophic and, in less extent, lithotrophic methanogenesis, was active up to soda-saturatin...Save to LibraryDownloadby M.

We used genome assemblies of bread wheat and five diploid relatives to analyze genome-wide samples of gene trees, as well as to estimate evolutionary relatedness and divergence times. We show that the A and B genomes diverged from a common ancestor ~7 million years ago and that these genomes gave rise to the D genome through homoploid hybrid speciation 1 to 2 million years later. Our findings imply that the present-day bread wheat genome is a product of multiple rounds of hybrid speciation (homoploid and polyploid) and lay the foundation for a new framework for understanding the wheat genome as a multilevel phylogenetic mosaic.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kellye Eversole•  9  Molecular Evolution, Science, Multidisciplinary, PolyploidyNextLast »Related TopicsTaxonomyFollowFollowingZoologyFollowFollowingBotanyFollowFollowingBiodiversityFollowFollowingEcologyFollowFollowingSystematicsFollowFollowingEvolutionary BiologyFollowFollowingBiogeographyFollowFollowingPhylogeneticsFollowFollowingSystematics (Taxonomy)FollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
