Ten marine reptile taxa have been found from the 1.82–2.10 m-thick fossiliferous level in the Upper Member of the Guanling Formation, which can be subdivided into three marine reptile beds through the analysis on the stratigraphic distributions of fossil reptiles. The Lower Reptile Bed yields the sauropterygians Placodus inexpectatus Jiang et al., 2008 and Lariosaurus hongguoensis Jiang et al., 2006, the ichthyopterygians Xinminosaurus catactes Jiang et al., 2008 and Phalarodon cf. Phalarodon fraasi Merriam, 1910, associated with Mixosaurus panxianensis Jiang et al., 2006, representing a stage of predominance of durophagous taxa. In this bed, the large complete skeletons may reach up to 2.3 m in length, and lithofacies and chemostratigraphic analyses indicate a relatively deep carbonate platform with an oxic water environment near the bottom, as well as a rising sea level. The Middle Reptile Bed yields the sauropterygian Nothosaurus yangjuanensis Jiang et al., 2006 and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus Li et al., 2006, associated with Mixosaurus panxianensis Jiang et al., 2006. The fossils in this bed are characterized by its pincering dentition and large overall body size, with the largest possibly exceeding 3 m in length. This bed might represent a time of deepest basin with relatively anoxic condition near the bottom. The Upper Reptile Bed yields the sauropterygians Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis Jiang et al., 2008, Keichousaurus sp., the protorosaur Dinocephalosaurus orientalis Li, 2003, and the ichthyopterygian Mixosaurus panxianensis Jiang et al., 2006. In this bed, reptilian taxa characterized by suction feeding appeared, and most are less than 1 m long. This bed corresponds to a period of decreasing water depth.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers…  on Triassic and later …New fossil sites with Triassic vertebrate fauna from the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, Slovenia _ pdf reprints on request - mail to tomazhitij@gmail.com2010 • Tomaž HitijDownload Free PDFView PDFIntegrative ZoologyTriassic actinopterygian fishes: the recovery after the end-Permian crisis2013 • andrea tintoriDownload Free PDFView PDFActa Palaeontologica PolonicaSilicified Anisian (Middle Triassic) Spiriferinid Brachiopods from Guizhou, South China2009 • Zuoyu sunDownload Free PDFView PDFNature CommunicationsNothosaur foraging tracks from the Middle Triassic of southwestern China2014 • Jun LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFProgress in Natural ScienceNew primitive ichthyosaurian (Reptilia, Diapsida) from the Middle Triassic of Panxian, Guizhou, southwestern China and its position in the Triassic biotic recovery2008 • Lars SchmitzDownload Free PDFView PDFActa Palaeontologica PolonicaA New Basal Actinopterygian Fish from the Anisian (Middle Triassic) of Luoping, Yunnan Province, Southwest China2012 • Chang-yong  Zhou, Shi-xue HuDownload Free PDFView PDFScience China-earth SciencesBiodiversity and taphonomy of the Early Cambrian Guanshan biota, eastern Yunnan2010 • Michael SteinerThe Guanshan biota from eastern Yunnan (Cambrian Series 2, early Stage 4) is a Burgess Shale-type fossil biota with abundant exceptionally preserved soft-bodied fossils after the discovery of the well-known Cambrian Chengjiang fauna and Kaili biota in South China. The geological settings, sedimentology, taphonomy, and the fossil assemblage of the Guanshan biota are briefly summarized here. The Guanshan biota consists of about 60 taxa belonging to more than 10 metazoan groups and algae, among which the lobopods, eldonids, hyolithids with helens, and green algae are reported for the first time. The common occurrence of soft-bodied preservation in many groups, notably the trilobites and brachiopods, makes the Guanshan biota a significant fossil lagerstätte for understanding the metazoan evolution during Cambrian explosion and taphonomy of the Burgess Shale-type fossils.Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological SciencesThe Luoping biota: exceptional preservation, and new evidence on the Triassic recovery from end-Permian mass extinction2011 • Zhong-Qiang ChenDownload Free PDFView PDFA new species of the genus Perleidus (Actinopterygii: Perleidiformes) from the Middle Triassic of southern Chinaandrea tintoriDownload Free PDFView PDFPloS oneEarly Triassic marine biotic recovery: the predators' perspective2014 • Hugo F R BucherExamining the geological past of our planet allows us to study periods of severe climatic and biological crises and recoveries, biotic and abiotic ecosystem fluctuations, and faunal and floral turnovers through time. Furthermore, the recovery dynamics of large predators provide a key for evaluation of the pattern and tempo of ecosystem recovery because predators are interpreted to react most sensitively to environmental turbulences. The end-Permian mass extinction was the most severe crisis experienced by life on Earth, and the common paradigm persists that the biotic recovery from the extinction event was unusually slow and occurred in a step-wise manner, lasting up to eight to nine million years well into the early Middle Triassic (Anisian) in the oceans, and even longer in the terrestrial realm. Here we survey the global distribution and size spectra of Early Triassic and Anisian marine predatory vertebrates (fishes, amphibians and reptiles) to elucidate the height of trophic pyr...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
