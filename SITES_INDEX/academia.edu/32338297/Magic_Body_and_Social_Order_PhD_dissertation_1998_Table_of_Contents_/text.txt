It examines from an anthropological perspective magic rituals practiced by and for Finnish women in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as pollution beliefs and sexual imagery, and what all of these reveal about gender dynamics in the traditional Finnish-Karelian culture area. Many of the original source materials on women's magic rituals are translated into English for the first time.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMaidens, Matrons, and Magicians: Women and Personal Ritual Power in Late Antique EgyptMeghan Mattsson McGinnisUtilizing an interdisciplinary approach to a variety of material, textual, and literary evidence, the aim of this thesis is to shed light on the realities –rather than stereotypes- of an important aspect of late ancient women’s experience: the use of ritual power. Patterns of gender differentiation in late antique Egyptian magic are investigated and shown to be connected to the particular aims to which numinous powers were employed, aims which were in turn bound up with the social roles expected of each sex. The majority of this study consists of a series of case studies of different types of women’s rituals of power, which emphasize examples of significant trends in ritual iconography, praxis, and context, both those which were typical of late antique Egyptian magic as a whole, and those which were uniquely female in character. The fact that female practitioners came from a wide array of socio-economic, ethnic, and religious backgrounds is also addressed.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Politics of Folklore, the Policy of Collecting it: Majority Folklore on the Roma in Early 20th Century Finland2016 • Eija StarkNineteenth century Romantic nationalism viewed the nation as one entity whose members shared a common language, folklore, customs and traditions. This view of nationalism inspired the collection of folklore which served as the cultural heritage of a society. Once collected and interpreted, folklore built a grand-although often exclusive , mean and racist-narrative of the past. This article examines the social boundaries between rural peasant commoners and the Roma in Finland in the early 20 th century. Using folktales from rural Finns about the Roma, this article examines how elements of everyday communication laid bare notions of social hierarchies among citizens and, simultaneously , served as political tools. Because the policy of collecting folklore only targeted majority groups of people, that is, white peasants and small landholders, their views were considered most important and more valuable. By contrast, the Roma, as outcasts from rural communities and removed from the idea of nationhood, were underrated through the narration of tales, which directed ridicule and, at times, harsh bullying at them. Whilst the treatment of groups traditionally lying at the margins of Western societies has improved over time, narratives and oral lore continue to express biases against individuals or groups on the basis of race, age, gender or disability. Mentions in folklore of ethnic minorities such as the Roma are replete with prejudices. Internal boundaries within the lower classes of past peasant societies also appear in the stories of life crafted by non-elites. This article specifically focuses on the role of folklore in representations of the national Roma in Finland, who for centuries lived among the non-Roma, or Finns. The Kaales in Finland are often portrayed as a traditional Roma minority, not only in their official status within the country, but also in their social organisation, which strictly upholds presumably age-old Roma customs, rituals and taboos. These rituals and taboos include sexual taboos, rules of cleanliness, dress codes, ritualised respect for elders, gender norms and specific views on morality, family and kinship. Today, approximately 10,000 Finnish Roma reside within Finland's population of 5.4 million; another 4,000 Finnish Roma live in Sweden (Blomster & Mikkola 2014: 15). In this article I examine the mechanisms of folklore and how these serve as means of stigmatising and isolating one minority group from the majority population. Using folktales about the Roma as told by Finnish rural commoners, I investigate how such elements of everyday communication laid bare notions of social hierarchies amongst peopleDownload Free PDFView PDF1998 The Exorcising Sounds of Warfare: Shamanic Healing and the Struggle to Remain Mapuche.Ana Mariella BacigalupoDownload Free PDFView PDFALTERNATIVE FEMININE SPIRITUALITY AND FEMALE CULTURAL CAPITALOpen Access Publishing  GroupThe ritual in its context and indeed the magical one is approached as " text " and " speech " and its readings/hearings are extremely interesting. The female, spoken, magic words as well as the body language often shape or deny the intellectual worlds of gender. The women's experiential experience, through ritual, builds identities, even if within an occasional environment of freedom and self-determination. Moments of resistance are marked, probably unconsciously, in the patriarchal status quo and in the image of the female self that this class constructs. By exploring the identities and the social roles of the gender in reality, we examine how people, men and women, experience life in specific social and cultural contexts. The meanings, which are associated with gender and identities, eventually shape an understanding of the world and produce ideology. This fact implies a classification-however minimal-of those phenomena and their meanings that ensure the gendered status quo as a symbolic one. What were women trying to say through their magical rituals and when will we discover the importance of cultural consignment which the feminine mystique is bearing as a property and the ritual as action?Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican EthnologistFlagellation and Fundamentalism: (trans)Forming Meaning, Identity, and Gender Through Pakistani Women's Rituals of Mourning1998 • Mary Elaine HeglandDownload Free PDFView PDFSilent Sentinels: Archaeology, Magic, and the Gendered Control of Domestic Boundaries in New England, 1620-17252013 • C Riley Auge`Download Free PDFView PDFMeaning of FolkloreMei YueDownload Free PDFView PDFGender and EthnoarchaeologyKathryn Weedman ArthurDownload Free PDFView PDF Nicole Revel, ed.

Cambridge Scholars PublishingEpic as a Means to Control Memory and Emotions of Gods and Humans: Ritual Implications of Hudhud Among the Yattuka and Tuwali Ifugao, pp. 167-204.  20132013 • Maria  V. StanyukovichAbstracts (English and Russian) : Strong ritual ties are characteristic of early stages of epics in general (Zhirmunsky 1985; Putilov 1997) and of Philippine epics in particular (Manuel 1963). The hudhud has been repeatedly claimed to be a non-ritual epic as opposed to the alim ritual songs (Lambrecht 1965; Peralta 2001, 2007). However, evidences of ritual connections of the hudhud genre are to be found not only in Barton's (Barton 1946, 1955), but even in Lambrechts's works. This paper continues a study of ritual functions of the hudhud performance, (Stanyukovich 1981, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007) on the basis of analysis of early sources and fieldwork in Ifugao since 1995. Hudhud personages are not just folklore figures, they belong to the halupe, a class of deities in the Ifugao pantheon. The specialization of halupe deities is to control emotions and memories; they are believed to be ma'ule, 'kind', i.e. benevolently disposed towards humans and to act on behalf of humans in their interactions with other deities. The halupe deities form the core of halag, so-called "women's religion" (Barton 1946). They are also addressed in rituals performed by males. The hudhud-singing area is within the geographic boundaries where female agricultural rites were defined in the early 20th century (Barton 1946). It will be demonstrated that female hudhud singing during agricultural activities (weeding and harvesting) traditionally aimed to remind the benevolent deities of the needs of humans in order to secure an abundant harvest. Even today informants define the contents of hudhud di 'ani/page -'hudhud of the harvest/rice') as "it is all about rice". Women's singing in the fields pursues the same goal as the agricultural rites performed by males, i.e., to ensure the magical increase of rice. Regional variations in hudhud epic singing result in the distribution of ritual functions between different genres within the frame of one ritual situation. This paper will discuss the role of the hudhud epic and hudhud-shaped ritual songs in funeral rites in order to make the soul of the deceased admit its new status, to achieve reconciliation between its living relatives and the soul of the dead, and to restore the territorial boundary between the dead and the living that has been jeopardized by a recent death. For that, the soul of the deceased, led by a spirit conductor Domia by means of hudhud singing, must be convinced to 'forget' the way back and to 'cool' its emotions towards its living kin, in that intense positive emotions towards those left on earth are just as dangerous for the living as are the negative ones. Abstract Russian: Статья представляет собой теоретическое исследование антропологии эмоций, написанное на материалах, собранных автором в ходе многолетней полевой работы со сказителями, шаманами и другими ритуальными специалистами горных народов Филиппин (1995-2013). Основной круг проблем, рассмотренных в статье, относится к ключевым темам антропологии и эпосоведения: фольклор и действительность, эпос и обряд, антропология религий, шаманизм, антропология пространства, символика материальных предметов в фольклорном тексте и ритуале, обряды жизненного цикла, этнолингвистика, традиции и инновации в повседневной жизни коренных народов. Современные филиппинские материалы (расшифровки записанных автором сказаний и интервью) анализируются в сопоставлении с ранними - конца девятнадцатого-начала двадцатого века. Представления ифугао и яттука о взаимодействии мира людей и мира духов, живых и мертвых даются в сопоставлении с фольклорными традициями других народов – как родственными сказаниям филиппинских горцев, так и обладающими только типологической близостью с ними (народы Сибири, Монголии и др.). Это позволяет автору придти к выводам, значение которых выходит за рамки исследования австронезийского культурного ареала.Download Free PDFView PDFStudies on AsiaChicken and Family Prosperity: Marital Ritual among the Miao in Southwest China2012 • Xianghong fengDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
