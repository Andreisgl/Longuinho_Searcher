Despite being one of the most common procedures performed in the hospital setting, international data on the prevalence and management of these devices is lacking, particularly in developing countries.  ObjectiveTo conduct an international observational pilot study and assess the feasibility of conducting a large, international, multi-centre investigation on the prevalence of peripheral intravenous catheter use.  MethodsPilot sites were sourced through international vascular access networks. During the study conducted in December 2013¬-January 2014, hospital sites were asked to screen adults patients in general wards with or without a peripheral intravenous catheter. Data collected included demographics, catheter characteristics, site assessment, and dressing and securement details. Multiple language options were provided. ResultsA total of 479 patients from 14 hospitals in 13 countries were screened for the presence of a peripheral intravenous catheter. Of these, 59% (n = 281) had at least one peripheral intravenous catheter (95% CI 54.2–63.0); 16% (n = 76) had another vascular access device (95% CI 12.9–19.4), and 25% (n = 122) had no vascular access device (95% CI 21.7–29.6). The majority of peripheral intravenous catheters were inserted by nursing staff or a specialist team, and 90% were inserted in the general wards. The prevalence of intravenous catheters in place with no fluid or medication order was 17%. The majority (89%) of peripheral intravenous catheter sites assessed had no symptoms of phlebitis or infiltration. ConclusionMore than half of hospitalised patients screened had a peripheral intravenous catheter in place. The findings suggest that a larger global study is warranted to assess differences in practice for peripheral intravenous devices and complications associated with their use.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Inter-rater agreement on  peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC)-associated phlebitis signs, symptoms and scales Introduction

We examined agreement between trained vascular access research nurses assessing phlebitis symptoms commonly used in phlebitis assessment scales.  MethodEthics Committee approval and written informed consent were obtained. Research nurses undertook paired assessments for seven symptoms of phlebitis (pain, tenderness, erythema, swelling, warmth, purulence, and palpable venous cord). Paired observations were undertaken immediately consecutively, with each nurse blinded to the other’s results. This data was modelled into phlebitis scores using 12 different scoring tools (Barker, Baxter, Catney, Curran, Infusion Nurses Society [INS], Lanbeck, Maki, PVC ASSESS, Rickard, Rittenberg, Van Donk, and Visual Infusion Phlebitis [VIP] scales). Proportions of specific agreement (e.g. positive, negative), observed and expected agreements, Cohen’s kappa, the maximum achievable kappa, and both prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa were calculated. Results210 patients were recruited across three hospitals, with 246 sets of paired observations. The most prevalent symptom was tenderness: 47/246 observations (19.1%). The Catney and Lanbeck scales were the most sensitive (phlebitis in > 20% of observations), while the PVC assess, Rittenberg and VIP scales were the most restrictive (no phlebitis detected). Only ‘tenderness’ and ‘erythema’, and the Catney and Lanbeck scales had acceptable (> two-thirds, 66.7%) levels of inter-rater agreement.  Discussion & ConclusionInter-rater agreement for current phlebitis assessment symptoms and scales is generally low and of concern given the many nursing hours used for documentation. Poor agreement likely contributes to the high degree of variability in phlebitis rates in the literature. We recommend further research into agreement for infrequent symptoms, into the Catney or Lanbeck scales, and to exploring new approaches to evaluating vein irritation that are practical, valid, reliable and based on evidence that they really predict clinical complications.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
