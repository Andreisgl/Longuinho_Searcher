From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
< Wikipedia:GLAM
In the Summer of 2011, Wikimedia UK and ARKive are collaborating on a project to improve Wikipedia's articles on threatened species. This will involve sharing some of ARKive's text content with Wikipedia, and community outreach through online and offline events. This will involve a fixed-period in-residence role that we are calling Wikipedia Outreach Ambassador. Andy Mabbett, known on Wikipedia as User:Pigsonthewing, has been appointed to this role, starting on 11 July. He's written a blog post about the role.
Background[edit]
For background and contacts, please see the Wikimedia UK page for the project.
The project[edit]
The project will involve internal tasks of improving content and liaising with the Wikipedia and Wikiproject communities. Internal tasks will include:
Improving the target articles using text and references from an agreed selection of ARKive's fact-files. This includes both extending and improving the content of the articles and increasing the number of helpful wiki-links between articles.
Adding external links from target articles to relevant ARKive pages, on a wide range of specific species.
Informing other language Wikipedias of relevant articles in English, where this is not already being done by Wikipedia's processes.
Keeping relevant Wikiprojects informed of the improvement work.
Events[edit]
We held two events, on the afternoon, and again in the evening of 15 September, in Bristol, using the hashtag #GLAMARKive on Twitter.
You can read more about the events.
Templates and categories[edit]
{{ARKive attribute}} - for giving attribution (use in references section). Adds articles to the hidden category Wikipedia articles incorporating text from ARKive.
{{ARKive}} - for adding external links to articles. Adds articles to the hidden category ARKive links.
{{GLAMARKive}} - for talk pages of articles incorporating text donated by Wildscreen. Adds articles to the hidden category ARKive texts.
Category:Wikipedia-ARKive collaboration
How to take part[edit]
As part of this collaboration Wildscreen have kindly agreed to release the text (note: not images or other media) of 200 of their ARKive articles (listed below) under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 License and the GFDL. 
Those agreed to date are listed below, together with some suggested article sections for expansion.
How to transfer content[edit]
This is a detailed list; don't worry if you can only complete some of the steps.
Search ARKive to get to the appropriate page.
Click on the icon for "print fact sheet". (It is a little icon to the right of the "A"s, in the upperish right.)  This will give you all the text on one page, useful for cut and pasting.  You can also scroll through the individual tabs (same content though).
Decide which sections of text are helpful and transfer them to the Wiki article.  Some articles may only need a small update. Others that are stubby, can get a huge head start. Some can just use isolated sections. Make sure to transfer the list of Arkive references as well. (Easiest is just to transfer as a set into the Wiki article references section.)
Add {{ARKive}} in the external links section if appropriate. (Note the template instructions are helpful for understanding how to fill in the fields. Or compare how African elephant or other completed improvements do it.)
Format the refs, wikilink text, do any other quick edits to integrate.
To show attribution, insert {{ARKive attribute}} between the references header and the first reference.
Consider using this edit summary: Text from [[ARKive]] donated by [[Wildscreen]] under CC-BY-SA 3.0 & GFDL; see [[Wikipedia:GLAM/ARKive]]
Add {{GLAMARKive}} to the article's talk page.
Return to this page and strike-through the relevant item, below, so that we can keep track of progress.
Also, copy the link for the improved article to the relevant Work done section; please feel free to sign, so everyone can see how hard you're workingÂ ;-)
If additions were substantial, and eligible, investigate getting a WP:DYK award - you can ask on this project's talk page if you need help, or a nominator. Or seek Peer review with a view to obtaining good article or  featured article status.
For an example of how ARKive text can be incorporated into a Wikipedia article, please see this change to the African Elephant article.
Inter-wiki[edit]
Once articles are improved using the donated texts, editors are invited to:
translate them into other languages (or tell other people who might do so, about this project)
re-write them in simple English
Articles[edit]
Donated texts[edit]

Bristlecone pine Tried to incorporate what I could but the ARKive article is pretty short and has at least one inaccuracy ("Bristlecone pines inhabit the harsh environments of the western Sierra Nevada Mountains, where there is very little moisture" - in fact the western Sierras are wetter than the eastern Sierras and these pines are more to the east, with many not even in the Sierras - see http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?195,210,225 and http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?195,210,213 ).
