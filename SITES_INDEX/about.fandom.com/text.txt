FOR THE LOVE OF FANS
Fandom is the world's largest entertainment & gaming fan platform. We help 350 million people worldwide go deeper on their favorite games, entertainment and culture with unique tools, memorable experiences, original content and commerce. We reach more fans, across more fandoms, than anyone. And we do it all for the love of fans.
Fandom is a fan's constant companion as they explore, celebrate and engage with their favorite fictional worlds.
 
 
AUTHORITATIVE FAN COMMUNITIES
Our communities are a one-stop-shop for both existing and new fans to explore their fandoms, diving deep on stories, characters and lore.
 We're a resource to fans in 80 languages across 200 countries - including the Vatican City (It seems someone has been bingeing the Young Pope?)
 From Halo Infinite to Hulu Originals, Game of Thrones to Golden Girls, fans have come together to build communities on our platform for just about every movie, tv show, video game or cultural phenomenon out there.
 Fans use our platform to document their favorite fictional worlds, creating millions of pages of specific content. How specific? We have 74 pages about the furniture of Star Wars alone.
        POWERED BY THE PASSION OF OUR COMMUNITY

"Fandom has allowed me to connect with people from all across the world that are super passionate about the same things as me. Before I started editing, I knew very few people with the same interests - now I have a group of friends that I for sure would not have met otherwise. For years now, we have worked together to build and maintain a valuable resource that can be used and enjoyed by our community, and I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved together."
