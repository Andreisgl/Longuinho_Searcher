ARAB WOMEN'S RIGHT TO PRACTICE SPORT BETWEEN CRIMINALIZATION AND PROHIBITIONby Nouzha  Latreche, Salim Harbi, and Abdelkader HannatIn this research, we discuss women's struggle for their right to be part of sport as a human achi... more In this research, we discuss women's struggle for their right to be part of sport as a human achievement with values and morals. The methodology used in this study is an analytical approach, mainly focused on the historical and cultural dimensions through analyzing situations and events women faced in general, particularly Arab women. With consideration of the involvement of official bodies across supporting projects and laws issued by parliament and the commitment of supervising ministries and institutions in its application on one hand, and highlighting efforts and struggle of non-governmental organizations on the other hand, working on the international, and national level, such as: the International Olympic Committee and its national branches with the UNESCO, and the Arab League. In this study, we trace the events from the ancient Olympic Games of the Greek era, in which women were banned from participating, for explicit ideological and religious reasons until, the re-establishment of Olympic Games. In 1894, the French Baron Pierre de Coubertin established the International Olympic Committee; which in turn prevented women from participating fully in Olympics until 1928, followed by the struggle of Arab women in order to gain their right to participate in sports. We concluded the article with the following: the path to women's participation in sport has taken an upward trend, with consideration of the influence of economic, cultural, political and social changes that have affected the modern Arab society.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
