In 1885, she stated that the pieces would ‘be distributed among various museums, and, scattered far and wide…. never again will it be possible to compare them one with another, except in photographs or engravings’ (Edwards 1885, 261). Following the Naukratis Project’s cataloguing of all of the more than 18,000 known objects excavated and collected in the late 19th–early 20th century at Naukratis, and currently in over seventy-five collections worldwide (Villing et al. 2013–19), as well as the restudy of over 4,000 finds from the later American fieldwork in the 1970s and 80s, it is possible to compare all figurines again, although the long years since have resulted in a number of casualties (destroyed, lost or provenance misattributed). The Project has now catalogued to date 1,613 terracotta and 432 stone figurines from the site that range from the Late Period to the Byzantine period. Like the inhabitants of Naukratis, they are diverse, comprising both local figures and pieces that had travelled far from across the Eastern Mediterranean. This large and varied, but poorly understood, corpus has long demanded systematic analysis, given the growing literature on figurines in general (if not specifically those from Naukratis). This article will introduce the catalogue, provide a brief overview of the figurines, their dating, techniques and technology including their production at Naukratis, and discuss some major trends and developments between the late 7th century BC and the 7th century AD within the corpus at Naukratis.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNaukratis: Egyptian Late Period figures in terracotta and limestone (2015)Ross I ThomasNaukratis was a Nile Delta settlement in which many inhabitants followed the Egyptian religious and cultural practices of Lower Egypt. The over 550 Late Period Egyptian figures found at the site are a large and important group among the finds from Naukratis because they attest a clear link with native Egyptian practices at a settlement commonly misunderstood as predominantly Greek. Manufactured from both terracotta and limestone, they are of typical Lower Egyptian types, with representations of nude female, ithyphallic male and Bes figures particularly frequent. Indeed, phallic figures and ‘erotic’ figure groups used to be commonly known as ‘Naukratite figures’ because of the ‘great quantity of indecent statuettes’ (Edgar 1905, 130) uncovered at the site. This chapter discusses the production, meaning and use of this little understood group. Their production continued into the early Ptolemaic period when the industry was transformed by the introduction of new production techniques and styles from the late 4th century BC onwards.Download Free PDFView PDFNaukratis: Greeks in Egypt. The British Museum, Online Research Catalogue. Naukratis: Stone and terracotta figures – an introduction (2015)2015 • Ross I ThomasThe figures from Naukratis are a large and informative group that can be used to better understand the population of Naukratis over its long history. They comprise both locally made figurines and imports from the Eastern Mediterranean, notably East Greece and Cyprus, but also Greece and the Levant. Recent studies have concentrated on 7th to 6th century BC Cypriot limestone and alabaster sculpture, while Cypriot terracotta figures, local Egyptian and Greek figurines were largely ignored. This chapter provides a brief introduction to the material and a summary of the patterns present within this diverse assemblage. Comprising nearly 1,800 terracotta figures, figure vessels, models and coffin-fittings as well as over 400 stone figures, they cover all periods of the site’s history across the Saite, Achaemenid, Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Figures (and moulds) were found in workshops, houses, burials and sanctuary deposits. The assemblage provides useful insights into the production, use, meaning and deposition of figures that represent a variety of human activities at Naukratis. This yields valuable information about the site’s inhabitants and their identity. Whilst the figures from the Greek sanctuaries were predominantly East Greek and Cypriot – attesting the strong trade links between these regions and Naukratis – one remarkable observation is that the assemblage in the town is predominantly Egyptian in nature, suggesting that Egyptian religious practices were widespread in Naukratis from the time of its foundation onwards.Download Free PDFView PDFNaukratis: Greeks in Egypt. The British Museum, Online Research Catalogue. Naukratis: Ptolemaic and Roman figures, models and coffin-fittings in terracotta (2015)2015 • Ross I ThomasFrom the late 4th century BC new styles and techniques of terracotta figure manufacture were introduced to Naukratis from Greece, replacing those of Late Period Egypt. The resulting Ptolemaic and Roman terracotta figures, coffin fittings and models from Naukratis comprise a large and varied group of artefacts. Spanning the period from the end of the 4th century BC through to the 7th century AD, they reflect the continued significance of the settlement to Roman times. They also highlight an increase in the production and demand for terracotta representations of Egyptian deities. With over 850 of the extant examples locally produced in Naukratis, they are evidence for a proliferation in local demand for terracottas for the home and the cemetery. This chapter introduces the large and diverse group of extant figures from Naukratis, their production, use and deposition.Download Free PDFView PDFBMSAES Roman Naukratis and its Alexandrian context (2014)2014 • Ross I ThomasDownload Free PDFView PDFNaukratis: Greeks in Egypt Stone and terracotta figures – an introductionDrhegazy MohamedDownload Free PDFView PDFpicture at 50mm from topkhaled essamDownload Free PDFView PDFAnnual of the British School of AthensPOPULAR DIVINE IMAGERY IN HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN ALEXANDRIA. THE TERRACOTTA FIGURINES COLLECTION OF THE PATRIARCHAL SACRISTY IN ALEXANDRIA2019 • Kyriakos SavvopoulosTerracotta figurines represent one of the most fascinating categories of material evidence from Hellenistic (Ptolemaic) and Roman Egypt relating to the domestic aspects of religious life. They include deities, ordinary humans, animals and sacred symbols, represented in exhaustive variety, both in terms of content and form. The group of terracotta figurines presented in this paper are no exception. It is drawn from the collection of the Sacristy of the Greek-Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, exhibited in a most impressive Roman cistern, which was discovered during the recent renovation of the Patriarchate premises. The catalogue will be accompanied by a concise overview of the nature and role of the main divine protagonists in comparison to other types of material evidence such as statuary, architecture, coinage and epigraphy, focusing on Alexandria, the capital of Egypt during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.Download Free PDFView PDFNaukratis: Egyptian offerings in contextNaukratis: Egyptian offerings in context (2019)2019 • Aurelia Masson-Berghoff (Masson)The Naukratis Project brought to light the underestimated Egyptian aspect of the Naukratite material culture, helping to outline the contemporaneous existence of different systems of beliefs – and their possible interaction or separation – in the cosmopolitan city. This paper focuses especially on contexts in which Egyptian votive and/or ritual objects were consecrated or deposited. Two particularly rich contexts are considered here, the ‘cache of bronzes’ discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1885, and deposits excavated in the vicinity of the Great Temenos by Francis Llewellyn Griffith in 1885 and David Hogarth in 1903. All yielded Late Period material. Despite the many challenges that the recontextualisation of these finds presents, these contexts offer a unique insight into Egyptian religious practices and beliefs at Naukratis. A few Egyptian votives discovered within Greek sanctuaries will be briefly mentioned. These recontextualised offerings will be assessed in the light of what we know of religious practices and beliefs at the site and beyond, in order to measure to what extent Naukratis fits the (Lower) Egyptian religious picture in the Late Period.Download Free PDFView PDFNaukratis: Greek terracotta figures (2015)2015 • Ross I ThomasWith few exceptions, the large number – over 400 fragments – of ‘Greek’ figures found at Naukratis date from the period between 620 and 300 BC when Naukratis operated as an eastern Mediterranean trade hub and port of Egypt. The majority of imported Greek figurines are of East Greek origin and were found in Archaic and Classical Greek sanctuary deposits. Six broad groups can be distinguished, with parallels known from other East Greek, Cypriot and Phoenician sites. The Greek figures include: Archaic East Greek hand-made and mould-made figure plaques; Archaic East Greek mould-made figures and figure vases; Late Archaic and Classical East Greek protomes and figures; and late Classical and early Hellenistic East Greek and Greek mould-made hollow figures. This chapter introduces the wide variety of Greek figures brought to Naukratis, their production, use and deposition.Download Free PDFView PDFFaience finds from Naukratis and their implications for the chronology of the siteVirginia WebbDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
