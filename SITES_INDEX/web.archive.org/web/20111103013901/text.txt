Tudor Period and the Birth of a Regular Navy Part Two
From Royal Navy History

Another great change of these Henry VIII days
was in the form of the ships. (Henry VlII introduced a new form of warship in the
"pinnaces," which were, to a certain extent, analogous to the torpedo craft of to-day.)
At this era they began to be built with "tumble-home"
sides, instead of sides slanting outwards upwards, and inwards downwards as
heretofore. With the coming of the porthole came the
decline of the cross-bow as a naval arm. In the pre-porthole
days every record speaks of "showers of arrows," and the gun appears to have been a species of
accessory. In the early years of the Sixteenth Century
it became the main armament, and so remained unchallenged
till the present century and the coming of
the long-range torpedo.
Henry VIII's reign is also remarkable for the
first institution of those "cutting out" expeditions
which were afterwards to become such a particular
feature of British methods of warfare. This first
attempt happened in the year 1513, when Sir Edward
Howard, finding the French fleet lying in Brest Harbour
refusing to come out, "collected boats and barges"
and attacked them with these craft. The attempt was
not successful, but it profoundly affected subsequent
naval history.
Therefrom the French were impressed with the idea
that if a fleet lay in a harbour awaiting attack it
acquired an advantage thereby. The idea became
rooted in the French mind that to make the enemy
attack under the most disadvantageous circumstances
was the most wise of policies. That "the defensive
is compelled to await attack, compelled to allow the
enemy choice of the moment" was overlooked!
From this time onward England was gradually
trained by France into the role of the attacker, and
the French more and more sank into the defensive
attitude. Many an English life was sacrificed between
the "discovery of the attack" in the days of Henry
VIII, and its triumphant apotheosis when centuries
later Nelson won the Battle of the Nile; but the
instincts born in Henry's reign, on the one hand to
fight with any advantage that the defensive might offer,
on the other hand to attack regardless of these advantages,
are probably the real key to the secret of later
victories.
The Royal ships at this period were manned by
voluntary enlistment, supplemented by the pressgang
as vacancies might dictate. The pay of the mariner
was five shillings a month; but petty officers, gunners
and the like received additional pickings out of what
was known as "dead pay." By this system the names
of dead men, or occasionally purely fancy names, were
on the ship's books, and the money drawn for these
was distributed in a fixed ratio. The most interesting
feature of Henry VII and Henry VIII's navies is the
presence in them of a number of Spaniards, who presumably acted as instructors. These received normal pay of seven shillings a month plus
"dead pay."
The messing of the crews was by no means indifferent.
It was as follows per man :â
Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday : 3/4lb. beef and 1/2 lb. bacon.
Monday, Wednesday, Saturday : Four herrings and two pounds of cheese.
Friday : To every mess of four men, half a cod, ten herrings, one pound of butter and one
pound of cheese.
There was also a daily allowance of one pound of bread
or biscuit. The liquid allowance was either beer, or a
species of grog consisting of one part of sack to two of
water. Taking into account the value of money in
those days and the scale of living on shore at the time,
the conditions of naval life were by no means bad,
though complaints of the low pay were plentiful enough.
Probably, few received the full measure of what on
paper they were entitled to.
Henry VIII died early in 1547. In the subsequent
reigns of Edward VI and Mary, the Navy declined, and
little use was made of it except for some raiding
expeditions.
When Elizabeth came to the throne the regular
fleet had dwindled to very small proportions, and, war
being in progress, general permission was given for
privateering as the only means of injuring the enemy.
It presently degenerated into piracy and finally had to
be put down by the Royal ships.
No sooner, however, was the war over than the Queen
ordered a special survey to be made of the Navy.
New ships were laid down and arsenals established for
the supply of guns and gunpowder, which up to that
time had been imported from Germany. Full advantage
was taken of the privateering spirit, the erstwhile
pirates being encouraged to undertake distant voyages.
In many of these enterprises the Queen herself had a
personal financial interest. She thus freed the country
from various turbulent spirits who were inconvenient
at home, and at one and the same time increased her
own resources by doing so.
There is every reason to believe that this action
of Elizabeth's was part of a well-designed and carefully
thought out policy. The type of ship suitable for
distant voyages and enterprises was naturally bound to
become superior to that which was merely evolved
from home service. The type of seamen thus bred was
also necessarily bound to be better than the home-made
article. Elizabeth can hardly have failed to realise
these points also.
To the personnel of the regular Navy considerable
attention was also given. Pay was raised to 6/8 per
month for the seamen, and 5/- a month with 4/- a month
for clothing for soldiers afloat. Messing was also increased
to a daily ration of one pound of biscuit, a gallon
of beer, with two pounds of beef per man four days out
of the seven, and a proportionate amount of fish on the
other three days. Subsequently, and just previous to
the Armada, the pay of seamen rose to 10/- a month,
with a view to inducing the better men not to desert.
The regular navy was thus by no means badly
provided for as things went in those days; while service
with "gentlemen adventurers" offered attractions to a
very considerable potential reserve, and so England
contained a large population which, from one cause
and another, was available for sea service. To these
circumstances was it due that the Spanish Armada,
when it came, never had the remotest possibility of
success. It was doomed to destruction the day that
Elizabeth first gave favour to the "gentlemen adventurers."
Of these adventurers the greatest of all was Francis
Drake, who in 1577 made his first long voyage with five
ships to the Pacific Ocean. Drake, alone, in the Pelican,
succeeded in reaching the Pacific and carrying out his
scheme of operations, which â not to put too fine a point
on it â consisted of acts of piracy pure and simple
against the Spaniards. He returned to England after
an absence of nearly three years, during which he
circumnavigated the globe.
There is little doubt that Drake in this voyage,
and others like him in similar expeditions, learned a
great deal about the disadvantages of small size in
ships. Drake, however, learned another thing also.
Up to this day the crew of a ship had consisted of
the captain and a certain military element; also the
master, who was responsible for a certain number of
"mariners." The former were concerned entirely with
fighting the ship â the latter entirely with manoeuvring it.
This system of specialisation, awkward as it appears
thus baldly stated, may have worked well enough in
ordinary practice. It did not differ materially from the
differentiation between deck hands and the engineering
departments, which to a greater or less extent is very
marked in every navy of the present day.
