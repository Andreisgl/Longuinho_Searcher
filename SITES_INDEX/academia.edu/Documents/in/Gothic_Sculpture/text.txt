In the portal of Saint Froilán is seen a celebration of this local saint’s main liturgical Feasts; the choice of an Apocalyptic program for the south central portal is justified by a Castilian tradition of decorating the cathedral entrance near the bishop’s palace with ecclesiological discourses; and Bishop Martín Fernández’s great expectations can be shown in the commemoration of the bethrothat of the Castilian heir Fernando de la Cerda and the French Princess doña Blanca in the south western portal’s sculpted decoration. As for the Western entrance, the baptismal imagery displayed in the northern access is related to the parish function of the chapel in the ground floor of the northern tower; and the scatological discourses in the Last Judgement and the Coronation of the Virgin portals adequate to the medieval use of the parvis as  a cemetery, and they are discussed in the frame of mid-thirteenth century theological controversies on the resurrection of the body that help to recognize a Franciscan bias not only in León but also in the “diplomatic” portal of La Coronería in Burgos. Finally, the different stylistic trends that converge in León are examined as sculpted counterparts of vernacular pastoral rhetorical devices: the more “narrative styles” of the portal of San Froilán and Saint John as opposed to the “expressionistic naturalism” of the last Judgement and Apocalyptic portals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rocío Sánchez Ameijeiras•  11  Cultural History, Visual Studies, Visual Rhetoric, Iberian StudiesLe style rayonnant en France (1240-1360)Save to LibraryDownloadby Yves  Gallet•  7  Art History, History of Art, Medieval Art, Gothic architectureVan Utrechtse bodem?

Pouco divulgada e pouco conhecida do público não especialista, carece de uma análise mais aprofundada, em especial no que se refere às suas características formais e aos modelos estéticos que lhe estão subjacente. Este estudo, através de uma metodologia comparativa, pretende colocar hipóteses que ajudem a colocar esta obra num tempo e numa corrente estética que a tornam mais compreensível par a História da Arte, sobretudo, se tivermos em conta que não chegaram até nós outras esculturas com características que permitam identificar a presença do mesmo artista (anónimo, até ao momento).Abstract:  The image of the Holy Trinity from the church of Santa Clara in Santarém, now belonging to the Municipal Museum of this city, is a stone sculpture, with traces of polychrome that is incomplete, with two missing figures that complete the Throne of the Grace. Little publicized and poorly known to the non-specialist public lacks a deeper analysis, especially with regard to their formal characteristics and the underlying aesthetic models. This study, through a comparative methodology, aims to put hypotheses that help to put this work in a time and aesthetic movement that make it more understandable to the History of Art, especially if we consider that other sculptures with features that allow us to identify the presence of the same artist (unnamed so far) have not reached us.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carla Varela Fernandes•  7  Iconography, Medieval Studies, Sculpture, Christian IconographySochařstvíSave to LibraryDownloadby Michaela Ottová•  14  Art History, Medieval Studies, Monastic Studies, History of SculptureLa Mare de Déu de l'antic retaule major de Santa Maria de Tamarit de Llitera, obra de Juan Dusi (1504): recuperació de dos fragmentsThis article describes two fragments of the alabaster virgin that presided over the centre altarpiece of the church of Saint Mary in Tamarite in 1504, having been commissioned by the legal representatives of the town of Tamarite and the... moreThis article describes two fragments of the alabaster virgin that presided over the centre altarpiece of the church of Saint Mary in Tamarite in 1504, having been commissioned by the legal representatives of the town of Tamarite and the sculptor Juan Dusi, native of Bruges and resident of Zaragoza. The piece was made just after the completion of the altarpiece, made with panels painted by the Zaragoza-born painters Miguel and Juan Ximénez between 1500 and 1503, and it continued to preside over the presbytery even when the Gothic furnishings were replaced by a new altarpiece, in this case made by the sculptor Juan de Loscertales in around 1682. The sculpture remained in this location until 1936, when material goods of the parish church were destroyed in the context of the Spanish Civil War. Since then, it was believed that the work was missing, hence the relevance of the recently recovered fragments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alberto Velasco Gonzàlez•  9  Medieval Art, Spanish Sculpture, Medieval Crown of Aragon, Gothic SculptureK vybavení kláštera cisterciáků v Sedlci/ Zur Ausstattung des Zisterzienserklosters in SedletzSave to LibraryDownloadby Aleš Mudra and +1Michaela Ottová•  7  Late Middle Ages, Cistercians, Medieval Art, Medieval Sculpture (XIII-XVth Century)German (Cologne?), The Entombment, 1500/05Northern European and Spanish Paintings before 1600 in the Art Institute of Chicago.

By the early thirteenth century, bodies acquired more three-dimensional mass, more flexibility, more natural poses and drapery, and more individual faces. Later thirteenth-century sculpture gave up this monumental power for more specific anatomy, actions, and emotions.

What stands out within the works of art attributed to him are his carved and painted altarpieces. Despite this, the only item that can beyond doubt be linked to him is the stone sculpture of Madonna dated 1499, with his last name on the supporting bracket. All the other works supposedly by him date to subsequent years. The purpose of this article is to analyse these questions: (1) What kind of artist was Beinhart, and what was his field of specialization? (2) What other stone sculptures could have been done by him or his studio? (3) How do stone sculptures by Beinhart compare to wood carvings attributed to his studio? A comparison was made of three stone sculptures portraying the Holy Virgin, dated 1499, pinpointing their fundamental similarities. Attention was drawn to another Madonna display, most likely the oldest among them, similar to the 1499 carving signed in Beinhart's name. Importantly, this Madonna probably decorated the artist's house on Nowy Targ (Neuer Markt) in Wrocław (Breslau). The stone sculpture of Maria from Obstmarkt in Nuremberg, dated around 1482, has been suggested as the essential formal model for all Madonna statues referred to above.Save to LibraryDownloadby Romuald A Kaczmarek•  3  Gothic Art, Gothic Sculpture, Late Medieval Silesian HistoryNagrobek Władysława Jagiełły, Donatello i metodologia historii sztuki.

There are only a few pieces made from this precious material in Krakow, including a small appliqué showing enthroned Virgin with a Child, attached to a cover of a Latin Bible from the Princes Czartoryski Museum in Krakow. The figurine was mainly attributed to the French circle and dated to the 2nd half of the 14th century. However, the analysis of the form may indicate that the appliqué was made in a German circle as an “offspring” of the so‑calledKremsmünster workshop. This rather non‑French atelier was under the influence of the French and Cologne monumental, but also smaller, wooden sculpture. These doubts concerning the appliqué show that it is quite necessary to look into the provenance of the ivories still preserved in Krakow.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elżbieta Musialik•  3  Gothic Sculpture, Ivory Carving, Gothic IvoriesTommaso Pusterla e la chiesa di Santa Maria in Castello a Tradate.

L’articolo analizza il ruolo dei Pusterla a Tradate secondo una chiave di lettura prevalentemente storico artistica, evidenziando cioè le iniziative legate alla trasformazione della chiesa di Santa Maria in Castello e del vicino palazzo di Tradate nel corso dei secoli, facendo luce sul periodo di maggior interesse da questo punto di vista, la seconda metà del XIV secolo, in cui devono essere collocate l’edificazione della chiesa e la realizzazione del suo altare marmoreo.This study wants to analyze a relief realized at the request of Tommaso Pusterla, member of a family that was particularly influential in Milan political and religious life during Middle Ages and that was mentioned by several genealogy scholars, among which Pompeo Litta. The article highlights the initiatives related to the transformation of the church of Santa Maria in Castello and the nearby palace, both in Tradate (VA), over the centuries, shedding light on what happened during the second half of the XIVth century, the most important period from this point of view, in which the building of the church and the realization of its marble altar must be placed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gigliola Gorio•  4  Gothic Sculpture, XIVth Century, Tradate, Private ChurchesRycerski ród von Pannwitz i jego prawdopodobne fundacje artystyczne w Ziemi kłodzkiej w okresie średniowieczaThe Knightly Family of Pannwitz and its Probable Artistic Foundations in the Kłodzko (Glatz) Region in the Middle Ages The Pannwitz family, one of the most important in the Kłodzko land, appeared here around 1300, arriving from Upper... moreThe Knightly Family of Pannwitz and its Probable Artistic Foundations in the Kłodzko (Glatz) Region in the Middle AgesThe Pannwitz family, one of the most important in the Kłodzko land, appeared here around 1300, arriving from Upper Lusatia through Silesia. Representatives of the Pannwitz family held official functions in the structure of territorial authority, as well in the Church as clergy of various ranks. Family and feudal relationships connected them with the Bohemia and Silesia. According to sources, the local Pannwitz representatives funded altars, masses, and liturgical equipment in Kłodzko, Bystrzyca, Duszniki, Żelazno, Waliszów. This family had the patronage over some churches, and the representatives of this family were parsons in Krosnowice, Stara Łomnica, Szalejów Górny. In these churches gothic sculptures have been preserved, the creation of which can be combined with the initiative of representatives of that family. From Krosnowice the sculpture of the Madonna on lions from 1360/1370 was bought into the Germanisches National-Museum Nürnberg. The form and iconography of this work belongs to an elite style. As the initiator of the foundation can be considered Dr. Nikolaus von Pannewitz († 1375), cantor and custodian of the Wrocław cathedral, with contacts with the Bohemian court and Johann of Neumarkt, or Matthias von Pannewitz († 1385), canon of the Wrocław cathedral and St. Johnʼs knight, parson in Krosnowice from 1366. In this church the Madonna figure survived from around 1480. At that time, the owner of Krosnowice and the patron of the church was Hans Pannwitz the Younger, associated with the Poděbrad family, and from 1477 the governor of Kłodzko and Ziębice. In turn with Johann von Pannwitz († 1446) one can combine two sculptures in two churches, where he was a parson. In Łomnica it is the Enthroned Madonna from around 1400, and in Szalejów Górny the Pietà group modeled on the famous sculpture at the Augustinians in Wrocław. The circumstances of the creation of the presented sculptures should be analyzed taking into account the context of patrons belonging to the Kłodzko- Silesian-Bohemian intellectual and knightly elite.Save to LibraryDownloadby Romuald Kaczmarek•  6  Medieval Art, Patronage (Medieval Studies), Late Medieval Bohemia and Central Europe, Gothic SculptureDie Löwenmadonnen und ihre Stilkonvention in Kleinpolen [in:] Madonnas on lions and the soft style of the third quarter of the 14th century.

The works in question are fragments of altarpieces, remains of architectural decor, and statuettes designed for private devotion. Judging from their location along much-frequented historical trade routes, they might have been brought to Poland as imports. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that at least some of them were made in Lesser Poland, where – as archival sources have it – artists from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were residing in the late fourteenth and the early fifteenth centuries. The occurrence of the style of the Madonna on a lion in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown appears as a challenge to the theory about the link between that iconographic format and the visual propaganda of the court of Emperor Charles IV in Prague. If it were true, such works would never have become popular with the political opponents of the House of Luxembourg.Save to LibraryDownloadby Wojciech Marcinkowski•  6  Art History, Cultural Transfer Studies, Christian Iconography, Gothic SculptureBottega aostana - Madonna in trono col Bambino, terzo quarto circa del XIII secoloSave to LibraryDownloadby Luca Mor•  8  Romanesque Art, Medieval Art, Medieval Sculpture (XIII-XVth Century), Medieval Art HistoryOsservazioni in margine ad alcune sculture poco note da gruppi lignei di DeposizioneSave to LibraryDownloadby Luca Mor•  14  Iconography, Art History, Medieval Drama, History of Art"Mensch, mein Kreuz trug ich für dich...".

With thisdissertation we aim to analyze this theme, starting from the most global methodologypossible in terms of chronology within the limits of the Late Middle Ages, andgeography within the border of the national territory of Portugal. Firstly, we felt theneed to illustrate the typological plurality of this big family, constituted by the theme ofthe green man, since it raises many issues and is still being discussed and defined. Assuch, the present iconography ends up adopting a diversity of names according to whatis represented and how it is represented.We chose to guide our investigation in a way that would enable us to produce achronological evolution of the mentioned iconography, in the territory that is todayconsidered Portugal, through the collection of samples throughout the whole country.The former task was guided by the purpose of understanding the genesis of the theme ofthe green man in this territory, and to understand if we can see if there was animportation, or not, and if there was, from which geographical areas, monastic orders oraesthetic movements. With this exercise we attempted to establish what were the placesin which the green man was represented more frequently: within the sacred space orwithin the available space in the media in which it was imprinted, and what symbolicimplications these diverse locations have in the multiple contexts where the green manwas represented. We came to the conclusion that the foliate mask, as it is also called, isnot so much a marginal iconography as one would possibly consider at first glance. Aposteriori, by observing this built diachrony, we easily notice the divergence betweentypologies of representation in the transition between the epitome of the Romanesqueart and the beginning of the gothic art, as well as the new locations within the sacredspace, and in other media, in the years of the Gothic. We concluded, with this spatialexamination, that the green man behaves in a slightly different manner in the symbolicfield, between the chronologies that we usually call the Romanesque and the Gothic.We tried, in an equal manner, to apprehend the difference operated in these twoartistic phases in the international conjuncture, and with this contextual perspective wepropose to find the distinctions between the Portuguese examples and the foreign ones,in terms of preferences, regionalisms, chronological differences, and eventually,specific innovations of the territory where we decided to site our work. To reach thegoal, we opted for restricting our analysis of the iconography in six paradigmatic casesof study, which enabled us to better explore the various questions we proposed toanswer in a more practical manner. Finally, we concluded, through these case studies,that the foliate head in Portugal ‘wears’ a very particular presence and expression,ending up adapting itself to the specificities of the art and architecture in this country.Keywords: green man, green beast, monster, iconography, symbology of space,architectonic sculptureSave to LibraryDownloadby Carolina Almodôvar Proença•  16  Iconography, Art History, Medieval Studies, Medieval ArchitectureOntsnapt aan de Beeldenstorm.

New ways of composing, building and decorating. The Lonja de los Mercaderes was the greatest work of the 15th century in Valencia. According to the documentation, it was conceived as a memorable feat, «in such a way that the construction and work of la Lonja matches the nobility of the city and the glory of those who had begun the work...». In fact, the building was highly praised by of all sorts of people since its early days, and the rigorous scholar Ponz even referred to it as «a truly magnificent construction, a supreme example of Gothic form». A similar opinion was shared by the academic Vicente Noguera in 1783: «a majestic model of architecture that, although hewn in Gothic style, exudes accuracy, proportion, elevation and greatness». However, the Lonja should not be studied as an isolated building but rather as a summary of the architectural investigations carried out in Valencia throughout the 15th century: in it, masters such as Pere Compte perfected the new ways of organizing work, composing and building that had been introduced by his own masters, Francesc Baldomar and Antoni Dalmau. Of particular interest are the intersections of the helical pillars and the nerves of the vault, as well as the pinnacles of twisted canes. On a different note, the development of the art of stonecutting, materialised in the groined vaults of Baldomar, not only brought about the modification of the technical and social organisation of the construction work, but it also led to a change in the aesthetic trends. Compte’s vaults of spherical rampant opened the path towards a new aesthetics, and two extraordinary examples of modern stereotomy should be highlighted: the vault of the turret of the Lonja, built circa 1492, a massive spherical stone vault that covers a square floor plan, and, over the entrance to this very place, a molded and skewed arch cavado en torre redonda.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arturo  Zaragoza•  5  Medieval Crown of Aragon, Gothic architecture, Gothic Sculpture, StereotomyZ.

This is the first evidence which attests the trade of English alabaster sculptures in Italy. Although only few similar documents survive, the spread of these works of art in Italy is proved by the great amount of existing pieces. Indeed, with more than 40 carvings held in Italy, the Peninsula should be considered among the eagest purchasers of alabasters in Europe. Through a careful investigation of the carvings kept in different Italian regions this essay aims to trace the diffusion of these artworks in the Peninsula. Some unpublished or neglected carvings are here discussed for the first time, and some scattered panels are here recomposed together as part in origin of the same altarpiece.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zuleika Murat•  15  Medieval History, Medieval Studies, History of Sculpture, SculptureNagrobek sufragana płockiego Piotra Lubarta w kościele Mariackim w Krakowie, „Rocznik Krakowski”, LXXV, 2009, s. 11-41Save to LibraryDownloadby Marek Walczak and +1Krzysztof J.

It is one on which a considerable number of monographs have been written in the English-speaking world, but I have not as yet been able to find a book on the subject by a trained art historian. In recent years there has on one hand been a huge amount of interest in green men, but on the other hand there has also been a considerable vulgarisation of the discourse, with much of the input coming from various "alternative" researchers with an interest in enigmas, paranormal phenomena and mythology (both ancient and modern environmentalist mythology). This may well be the reason why (art) historians have tended to hang back, most of them content to remain with a leaf-mask (Blattmaske or Blattdämon in German) identification without developing or interpreting the theme further. If, however, art historians were to grasp the subject in a focused way, there is a chance they might be able to steer the debate down from the speculative heights – where green men are connected with anything green, vegetable or natural within ancient mythology or Christian culture – to a more factual level. Unlike the written sources, in which the presence of the green man cannot be documented, material works (sculpture) mostly have the advantage that they appear in the factual and iconographic context of a particular building. This provides a relatively reliable guide to their interpretation. The study gives examples of the possibilities for interpreting the role and meaning of green men in the context of their location in the church space (the boundary context), in the context of liturgical service (Easter performances) and the iconography of other architectural sculpture. Of particular interest is the use of the presence of the green man, as an embodiment of the principle of the cyclical renewal of nature, as a key that makes accessible articles of faith that are otherwise difficult to grasp, namely the bodily resurrectionon of the dead at the Last Judgment (Resurrectio carnis).Save to LibraryDownloadby Aleš Mudra•  16  Iconography, Art History, Liturgical Studies, LiturgyLe portail disparu de l’abbatiale de Charroux (Vienne).

But his artistic activities were much wider in scope. With its focus on stone sculpture in Brussels at the time that Rogier was working there, an area of art history that to date has been little studied, this book offers a fresh and fascinating look at the context in which Brussels’s famous city painter worked. Exploring the complex network of stoneworkers and craftsmen, from the stone quarry to the sculptor’s workshop, the raw material to the finished work, Bart Fransen discovers a number of remarkable but hitherto unknown or misjudged sculptures now in churches, an abbey, a béguinage, a museum’s reserve collection and a castle chapel. With these various case studies in mind he examines Rogier van der Weyden’s direct involvement in sculptural projects, drawing on the evidence revealed by archive documents, drawings and the sculptures themselves. This highly readable and plentifully illustrated book reunites the various artistic media as they would have been in the fifteenth century.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bart Fransen•  2  Early Netherlandish Painting, Gothic SculptureSochařství v severozápadních Čechách a v regionu Krušnohoří mezi gotikou a renesancí; katalogová heslaSave to LibraryDownloadby Michaela Ottová•  12  Art History, Medieval Studies, History of Sculpture, Sculpture« Le portail royal du Mans et l’évolution de la première sculpture gothique entre les façades de Dijon et de Chartres », Cahiers de civilisation médiévale, 60, 2017, p. 27-58.Le portail royal de la cathédrale du Mans a généralement été considéré comme une oeuvre exécutée après la façade de la cathédrale de Chartres par des artistes moins talentueux que leurs prédécesseurs.

L'analyse iconographique et formelle montre cependant qu'il s'inspire avant tout de la sculpture bourguignonne et plus particulièrement du portail disparu de Saint-Bénigne de Dijon. Depuis les premières années du xii e siècle, les portails de cette région ont accueilli des théophanies atemporelles dérivées de l'Ascension intégrant des composantes semblables ou identiques à celles du Mans et évoquant peut-être la liturgie eucharistique. Quant au portail de Dijon, il partage avec celui du Mans l'essen-tiel de la structure et du décor des ébrasements – la disposition des statues-colonnes, la présence des saints Pierre et Paul, les chapiteaux des colonnettes, le décor animalier –, auxquels s'ajoutent les arcades architecturées encadrant les personnages du linteau, un cycle de l'Enfance accordant au Massacre des Innocents une place exceptionnelle et les anges thuriféraires. Enfin, plusieurs traits formels dont les vêtements du Christ et des statues-colonnes plaqués sur les fonds trahissent une certaine permanence des formes romanes. La majorité des composantes suggère par conséquent une chronologie relative dans laquelle le portail du Mans s'inscrirait entre la façade de Dijon et celle de Chartres. abstRact The royal portal of the cathedral of Le Mans has generally been considered as a work carried out after the facade of Chartres cathedral by artists less talented than their predecessors. The iconographic and formal analysis, however, shows that it is inspired above all by the Burgundian sculpture and especially by the now lost portal of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon. Since the early years of the twelfth century, the portals of this region included atemporal theophanies derived from the Ascension, incorporating similar or identical components to those of Le Mans and perhaps evoking the liturgy of the Eucharist. Regarding the portal of Dijon, it shares with that of Le Mans most of the structure and the decoration of the jambs – the arrangement of the statues-columns, the presence of saint Peter and saint Paul, the capitals of the columns, the animals motifs – to which can be added the architected arches framing the characters of the lintel, an Infancy cycle giving to the Massacre of the Innocents an exceptional place and the thurifer angels. Finally, several formal traits including the Christ's clothing and of the statues-columns which appear on the background reveal some permanence of Romanesque forms. The majority of the components therefore suggests a relative chronology in which the portal of Le Mans may be said to have been erected between the facades of Dijon and Chartres.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marcello Angheben•  4  Gothic Sculpture, Chartres Cathedral, Dijon Saint-Bénigne, Le Mans cathedralLe portail Royal de la cathédrale de Bordeaux.

Rediscovery of a masterpiece.Inaccessible behind iron grids during several decades and blackened by pollution, the Royal portal of the cathedral of Bordeaux has recently been restored and reopened to the public. This restoration led to a genuine rediscovery: a masterpiece of 13th century sculpture in Europe. Moreover, the remains of the ancient polychromy still preserved allow us to reconstruct and to analyse the initial coloured appearance of the portal – an aspect that is still poorly known for French monumental sculpture of this period. This publication gives an overview of the researches undertook recently on the occasion of restoration carried out between 2011 and 2014. It contains contributions written by art historians, archaeologists, staff in charge of the restoration (Monuments historiques) and a specialist of communication science. Their results renew entirely our vision not only of the portal’s sculpture, its iconography and its stylistic treatment, but also of its architectural framing and its initial colouring. They embrace the history of the Royal portal from the Middle Ages up to the 21th century.Save to LibraryDownloadby Markus Schlicht•  22  Cathedrals (Medieval Studies), Science for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage, Communication Science, Restauration and ConservationMadona z Bečova/ Madonna aus Bečov (Hochpetsch)Save to LibraryDownloadby Aleš Mudra•  5  Late Middle Ages, Medieval Studies, Medieval Art, Medieval Sculpture (XIII-XVth Century)Josef Braniš : Chrám svaté Barbory v Hoře Kutné: dějiny a popis původní stavby až do roku 1620 / Cathedral of St. Barbara in Kutna Hora: History and description of the original building until 1620The book was published in Kutna Hora (Karel Šolc) in 1891.Save to LibraryDownloadby Digital library Bohemia•  15  Art History, Medieval Studies, Architectural History, Cultural TourismIl tempo sulla pietra.

It was only in the late eleventh century, when sculpture became the preferred medium for the Church to promote great figurative programs whose goal was to present the faithful with the key to their salvation, that the months were included in the decoration of important sacred buildings, creating a dialogue with stories from the Old and New Testament, to illuminate the temporariness of human life. This book underlines the importance of sculpture as a mass medium for the diffusion of the cycles of the months in the Europe of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and emphasizes the richness of meaning they contain. In the merely descriptive appearance of seasonal activities that mark the passage of time, these images, corresponding astonishingly to proverbs still in use today but whose original meanings have been lost in the mists of time, were capable of evoking a gamut of multiple associations. However, in this wide and polysemic panorama, there is still room for a new interpretation, which is based on both symbols and precepts and somehow tied, surprisingly, to the sudden climate change phenomenon defined by scholars as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or Medieval Climate Optimum.Save to LibraryDownloadby Manuel Castiñeiras and +1grazia maria fachechi•  10  Romanesque Art, Calendars, Religion and Popular Culture, Romanesque SculpturePorch of Confessors Save to LibraryDownloadby Alicia A Berdan•  3  Cathedrals (Medieval Studies), Gothic Sculpture, Gothic cathedralsL'escultura a l'edat mitjana, Art i cultura.
