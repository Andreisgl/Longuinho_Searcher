Tim ThorntonUniversity of Central Lancashire,  School of Health,  Faculty MemberPhilosophy of Mind+8Tim Thornton is Professor of Philosophy and Mental Health in the School of Health at the University of Central Lancashire.  As well as contemporary philosophy of thought and language, his research concerns conceptual issues at the heart of mental health care. He has written research papers on clinical judgement, idiographic and narrative understanding, the interpretation of psychopathology and reductionism and social constructionism in psychiatry. In his spare time he is writing his half of a co-authored book on tacit knowledge. He is author of Essential Philosophy of Psychiatry (OUP 2007), Wittgenstein on Language and Thought (EUP 1998), John McDowell (Acumen 2004) and co-author of the Oxford Textbook of Philosophy and Psychiatry (OUP 2006).  He established a Philosophy and Mental Health distance learning teaching programme at the University of Central Lancashire.

This new approach has drawn in equal measure on both the humanities and medicine. Essential Philosophy if Psychiatry is both an introduction to, and a summary of a rapidly growing field. It is the first concise introduction to what is a contested field, written by one of the people driving it forward. Because recent philosophy of psychiatry has drawn from moral philosophy, the philosophy of mind and language, and the philosophy of science, it is difficult to get a clear overview of the field. This book does just that. It is divided into three parts: Values, Meanings and Facts. In addition, there is a short chapter of conclusions, a glossary of philosophical terms and a guide to further reading. For anyone looking for an accessible, undaunting introduction to this field, this is the essential text.   Readership: Psychiatrists and philosophers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

His writings have drawn on the works of, amongst others, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Sellars, and Davidson. His contribitions have made him one of the most widely read, discussed and challenging philosophers writing today. This book provides a careful account of the main claims that McDowell advances in a number of different areas of philosophy. The interconnections between the different arguments are highlighted and Tim Thornton shows how these individual projects are unified in a post-Kantian framework that articulates the preconditions of thought and language. Thornton sets out the differing strands of McDowell's work prior to, and leading up to, their combination in the broader philosophical vision revealed in Mind and World and provides an interpretative and critical framework that will help shape ongoing debates surrounding McDowell's work. An underlying theme of the book is whether McDowell's therapeutic approach to philosophy, which owes much to the later Wittgenstein, is consistent with the substance of McDowell's discussion of nature that uses the vocabulary of other philosophers including, centrally, Kant.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The text shows how Wittgenstein's critical arguments concerning mind and meaning are destructive of much recent work in the philosophy of thought and language, including the representationalist orthodoxy. These issues are related to the work of Davidson, Rorty and McDowell among others.  “Tim Thornton’s discussion of philosophy of content is admirably in-depth. Wittgenstein on Language and Thought should be read not only by those with an interest in Wittgenstein but by anyone interested in contemporary theories of content.” (Review of Wittgenstein on Language and Thought in Philosophical Quarterly)Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Oxford Textbook of Philosophy and Psychiatry is aimed at all those responding to these challenges, from professionals in health and social care, managers, lawyers and policy makers; service users, informal carers and others in the voluntary sector; through to philosophers, neuroscientists and clinical researchers.  Organised around a series of case studies in five key topic areas - concepts of disorder, the philosophical history of psychopathology, philosophy of science, ethics and philosophical value theory, and philosophy of mind - the book provides a detailed introduction to the field and a framework for study and skill development. Each case study is supported by selected readings from both philosophy and mental health, thinking skills exercises, self-test questions, key learning points and detailed guides to further reading. There is an introduction for philosophers to classification and descriptive psychopathology, and for practitioners to philosophical methods (including logic). The philosophical topics covered include philosophical methods (analytic and Continental); phenomenology, hermeneutics and existentialism, logical empiricism and its successors; idealism and realism; reasons and causes; and modern theories of mind and brain, free will and personal identity. Topics from mental health include psychiatry and 'anti-psychiatry'; Jaspers' psychopathology and the new neurosciences; the future of psychiatric classifications; strengths-based approaches, recovery practice, social inclusion and diversity; and key topics in psychopathology, such as delusion, autism, disorders of volition, thought insertion and other experiences in schizophrenia. The Oxford Textbook of Philosophy and Psychiatry aims to secure the skills-base of the discipline by bringing philosophers closer to the realities of practice in mental health, and mental health practitioners closer to the resources of philosophy as a partner to the sciences in responding to the challenges of twenty-first century mental health and social care.   Readership: Psychiatrists; other professionals in health and social care, managers, lawyers and policy makers; service users and their carers; through to philosophers, neuroscientists and clinical researchers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Abstract The World Psychiatric Association has emphasised the importance of idiographic understanding as a distinct component of comprehensive assessment but in introductions to the idea it is often assimilated to the notion of narrative judgement. This paper aims to distinguish between supposed idiographic and narrative judgement. Taking the former to mean a kind of individualised judgement, I argue that it has no place in psychiatry in part because it threatens psychiatric validity. Narrative judgement, by contrast, is a genuinely distinct complement to criteriological diagnosis but it is, nevertheless, a special kind of general judgement and thus can possess validity. To do this I first examine the origin of the distinction between idiographic and nomothetic in Windelband&#39;s 1894 rectorial address. I argue that none of three ways of understanding that distinction is tenable. Windelband...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Psychiatry’s inchoate wish for a paradigm shift and the biopsychosocial model of mental illnessPsychiatry Reborn: Biopsychosocial psychiatry in modern medicine,  2020‘Psychiatry’s inchoate wish for a paradigm shift and the biopsychosocial model of mental illness’... more ‘Psychiatry’s inchoate wish for a paradigm shift and the biopsychosocial model of mental illness’ critically examines the much discussed goal of a paradigm shift in psychiatric taxonomy. The chapter first highlights some illustrative calls for such a change and then sets these against the Kuhnian account of science from which the idea is taken, highlighting the connection to incommensurability. Relative to a distinction drawn from Winch, between putative sciences where the self-understanding of subjects plays no role and those where it is fundamental, psychiatry falls into the latter kind. This suggests that the wish for a paradigm shift in psychiatry is either incoherent or a wish for a radical but unpredictable overhaul of a significant aspect of our self-understanding as subjects and agents. The biopsychosocial model of mental illness is thus a helpful reminder of the cost of a paradigm shift in psychiatry.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Il dissenso a questo riguardo e di lunga data. Al fine di gettare qualche luce sul dibattito, l’Autore utilizza, rielaborandolo, lo schema suggerito da Zachar e Kendler per riflettere sulla tassonomia psichiatrica. Secondo Thornton, un approccio radicalmente esternalista della malattia mentale (un esternalismo costitutivo valutazionista) invalida il ruolo svolto dalle neuroscienze. Tuttavia, la divergenza tra una tale posizione valutazionista e il suo opposto oggettivista puo riguardare non solo la natura della malattia mentale, ma altresi i termini del dibattito medesimo. Il valutazionista puo, infatti, asserire che lo stesso dissenso non e una questione fattuale, ma al contrario valoriale.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The former is found in the biological and higher sciences. It applies in the case of reasons because meaning is encoded in brain states. Thus symptoms of mental disorder can both be caused and carry meaning providing they result from intentional-causal processes. I argue, however, that this account fails on three counts. The encoding thesis does not explain how reasons as opposed to the bearers of mental content play a causal role. The counter claim that the information which neural states encode is causally relevant turns on a concept of content or information drawn from cognitive science which is merely metaphorical and which severs the connection between neural states and semantics.
