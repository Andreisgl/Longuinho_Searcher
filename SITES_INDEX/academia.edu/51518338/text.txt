However, an expanded lens on the life of the Siegelaub-Projansky Agreement in law yields another legacy for these endeavors, where the Agreement is instead evidenced as influencing artists’ rights laws in the United States, and where its rhetoric of collectivity can be viewed as a radical appropriation of private law in an effort to establish more equitable art industry norms. This reclaimed narrative of political influence emerges only when we recognize the capacity of these artistic documents as legal instruments, and consider how they have circulated through and challenged the limits of both fields they are cross-classified between: art and law.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw and LiteratureThe Animal Question via Art and Law2021 • Joan KeeSpecial attention paid to works by Asian artistsDownload Free PDFView PDFIn: Stefan HUYGEBAERT, Georges MARTYN, Vanessa PAUMEN, Eric BOUSMAR & Xavier ROUSSEAUX (eds.), The Art of Law.

If art law encompasses all legal aspects of the production, distribution, and transaction of art, as well as any other rights and obligations governing art world actors and works of art, then transnational art law is the framework of legal knowledge necessary to understand these relationships and transactions across borders. Following the Transnational Law framework proposed by Philip Jessup in 1956, TAL would not be restricted to public or private, national or international, substantive or procedural law, but intervene in problem spaces involving all of these. It would capture the transnational actors, norms, and processes, the formal and informal interactions that constitute the art world. This chapter sketches TAL in its possible doctrinal, policy, regulatory, and advocacy dimensions, and suggests some openings for interdisciplinary study in particular.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw & Literature The Arena of Suspension: Carrie Mae Weems Bryan Stevenson and the Ground in the Stand Your Ground Law Era2021 • Sarah LewisHow are artists, and how are disciplines in the arts, humanities and law, responding to the hyper-visuality of racial injustices on American ground? This article explores a set of “groundwork” tactics in the Stand Your Ground Era in the United States. Stand Your Ground laws, first established in 2005, define the right to self-defense, to claim the ground on which one stands if there is a perception of “reasonable threat.” The law disproportionately affects black and brown lives today. The artworks under discussion in this article—Grace Notes: Reflections for Now by Carrie Mae Weems to honor lives lost to racial terror, and the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI)’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice to lynching—prompt the question, What does it mean to not be able to “Stand Your Ground”? What are the representational tools available to show the frequent challenge to this upright position as a statement of sovereignty over one’s own life? How has the manifold meaning of the term “ground”—as both reason, fact, but also soil itself, opened up a mode of critical inquiry to address the injustices wrought at our feet? Just as the field of environmental studies has begun to consider its nexus with racial inequity, this article approaches these representations of the “ground” through the lens of racial formation, art history, and legal study in the United States.Download Free PDFView PDFArtforumDue Processes: Law by Art2019 • Joan KeeOn artists working through, against, and in the lawDownload Free PDFView PDFLeiden Journal of International LawSetting the Scene: The Use of Art to Promote Reconciliation in International Criminal Justice2020 • Marina Aksenova, Amber RieffThis article maps out the landscape holding and connecting three interrelated phenomena: art, interna- tional criminal justice, and reconciliation. We argue that reconciliation, viewed as a restoration process, is one of the goals of international criminal justice. Yet, its attainment through law is challenging because international criminal justice, strictly construed, is outcome oriented. Art can serve as a ‘bridge’ linking normative legal standards with their reconciliatory aspirations. The key argument is therefore that art has the clear ability to mediate and amplify the law’s restorative potential through three key features. Firstly, art reflects the complexity of the human condition and reserves a place for emotional processing. Secondly, it is a useful relational tool in opening the space for dialogue, the latter being essential for reconciliation. Lastly, art has the capacity to translate legalistic findings into a language accessible to a wider audience.Download Free PDFView PDFIndexForensic Listening in Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s Saydnaya (the missing 19dB)2020 • James ParkerThis essay offers a critical account of Lawrence’s Abu Hamdan’s Saydnaya (the missing19db), which debuted at the 13th Sharjah Biennial and was central to the artist’s Turner prize nomination in 2019. The work concerns an acoustic investigation into Saydnaya Military Prison, in Syria, where an estimated thirteen thousand people have been executed by the Assad regime since 2011. The essay begins by situating Saydnaya (the missing 19dB) in relation to Abu Hamdan’s broader artistic, political and jurisprudential project before turning to the work’s specific exemplification of what the artist calls “forensic listening”. In doing so, I draw out the conversation the work inevitably stages with John Cage’s 4’33” (1952). Abu Hamdan’s work can, I suggest, be understood precisely as a critique of the twin conceptions of sound and silence advanced by Cage and taken up by his inheritors. But unlike Cage, Abu Hamdan’s work presents itself as already jurisprudential. It works with, on and against legal techniques and idioms; gathers, presents and interprets evidence; stages virtual trials; and makes explicit doctrinal claims; all with a view to intervening in political struggles in which questions of law are directly implicated. If, in Cage’s thinking, the power relations that produce and mediate sound and silence are systematically elided, for Hamdan, it is precisely these power relations and their material residues that we are asked to listen out for. But it is not a matter of simply appealing to legal structures of critique and condemnation either. In the final analysis, Saydnaya (the missing 19dB) poses “forensic listening” as a technique of resistance available to the least empowered, precisely as a function of their disempowerment in fact, and independent of law’s recognition or authorisation. http://www.index-journal.org/issues/law/part-2-lacunae/forensic-listeningin-lawrence-abu-hamdans-saydnaya-the-missing-19db-by-james-parkerDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Mirror Axiom. Legal Iconology and the Lure of Reflection, in: The Art of Law, eds. Eric Bousmar, Stefan Huygebaert, Georges Martyn, Vanessa Paumen, Xavier Rousseaux. Ius Gentium Series, New York; London: Springer 2018, 43-60.The Mirror Axiom: Legal Iconology and The Lure of Reflection2018 • Carolin BehrmannThe mirror metaphor bestrides and divides studies on images in law in two opposing factions, either confirming or dissenting the Law the notion of law by doubling or deferring its presence. Whereas legal history tends to read pictures and iconographies as depictions of a legal reality, art historical iconology interprets images beyond their conceptual historical evidence of the mirror surface, leaving it undecidable whether the reflection is real or present, or an event that is not assured and part of the artistic process. The paper explores the stability and abyssal structure of both formalising and revealing forces of the mirror axiom, asking how images reflect or constitute legal phenomena. 3.1 Pictorial Regimes The history of research in the field of law and the image, of legal iconographies, or visual dimensions of judiciary practice, has brought forth contrasting approaches. 1 While the ubiquity of vision as master sense of the Modern Era has a long historical record, legal studies, however, discover the variety of the visual legacy of law only circumspectly and often with suspicion.

We aspired to decipher ways in which artists, curators, and legal scholars tackle politics as a sphere in which contested areas are negotiated, leading to administrative ordering and laws. With contributions by legal scholars, artists, and curators, we set out to re-explore their own relation to law and the complexity of administrative and policy making, in an attempt to formulate anew the role law has had and continues to hold in their work, research, and creation. The law’s immense power to direct, authorize, and legitimize social relations and institutions is therefore interrogated, underscored, and reflected upon throughout the journal as we trace and map law’s evolving definitions, concepts, and practices in contemporary art and legal scholarship.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
