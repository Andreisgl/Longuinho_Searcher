Shoot cultures were cold-hardened at 5 degree C on MS medium containing 0.5 M sucrose over a period of 20 to 40 days. Shoot tips with basal plate (1.0-1.5 x 1.0 mm) were dissected from shoot cultures and precultured at 5 degree C for 2 days on MS medium containing 0.5 M sucrose. Precultured shoot tips were placed on aluminium cryo-plates (7 mm x 37 mm x 0.5 mm) with 10 wells (diameter 1.5 mm, depth 0.75 mm) and embedded in alginate gel. Osmoprotection was performed by immersing the cryo-plates for 30 or 60 min in 25 ml pipetting reservoirs filled with loading solution (2 M glycerol + 1.4 M sucrose). For dehydration, the loading solution was replaced with PVS 7M vitrification solution (30 percent glycerol, 19.5 percent ethylene glycol and 0.6 M sucrose in liquid MS basal medium), which was applied for 40 min.

Papers that (1) address directly or indirectly the subject of credentialing or of learning curve, (2) report on a surgeon&#39;s performance, (3) are reported as feasibility or learning curve studies, or both, (4) discuss the learning curve issue, and (5) express an expert&#39;s opinion on the learning curve. The number of procedures of the learning curve can not be fixed for all surgeons. Only surgeons in specialized breast cancer centers can succeed in meeting current recommendations with 20 to 30 cases. Surgeons from affiliated community hospitals will need more than 30 cases, whereas broad-based surgeons might need as many as 60 cases with their current caseload.

These recipients were used for stocking cereals and their dry products, for feeding the livestock, or for transporting the céréals to the rotative mill.

Surface investigations included macroscopic and microscopic examination, infrared reflectography and x-radiography, while material characterization of the ground, organic and inorganic pigments and binding media was carried out with a range of non-destructive and destructive analytical techniques. The belief that the two works were an original pair of pendant paintings was disproved due to substantial technical differences in the wood support, ground layers and use of yellow pigment. It was also found that Van Huysum&#39;s use of newly developed pigments (Prussian blue, Naples yellow) had lead to changes in his painting technique, which no longer corresponded to those described in the period&#39;s manuals, an...Save to Libraryby Arie Wallert•  18  History, Art, Microscopy, PaintingHeavy metal in hair samples of 109 non-industrial (miners) population in KatangaSave to LibraryDownloadby Christophe de Brouwer•  19  Tropical Medicine, Public Health, Mining, AdolescentGFP-based FRET analysis in live cellsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jie Zheng•  14  Cognitive Science, Microscopy, Spectroscopy, Fluorescence Resonance Energy TransferSurgical management of desmoid tumors of the female pelvis11No competing interest declaredSave to LibraryDownloadby Franklin  Sim•  19  Pathology, Surgery, Treatment, AdolescentThe Correction of Stress Incontinence by Simple Vesicourethral SuspensionSave to LibraryDownloadby victor marshall•  9  Surgery, Urology, Comparative Study, HumansRandomized Clinical Trial of an Absorbable Stent for Vasectomy ReversalMore successful methods of vasectomy reversal would benefit those undergoing this treatment and might also increase the popularity of vasectomy.

We conducted a randomized, prospective clinical trial of vasectomy reversal methods, comparing a new absorbable stent with 2-layer reattachment.We studied 116 men seeking vasectomy reversal between November 1990 and March 1994. Data were analyzed primarily by intention to treat.Patients in the stent (64 cases) and no stent (52) randomized groups were similar in age distribution, age of spouses, years since vasectomy, proportion who had undergone prior vasectomy reversal and proportion who had previously achieved pregnancy. Operation time was more than 19 minutes shorter in the stent randomized group (p = 0.006). Fewer patients in the stent than the no stent group had patent vasovasostomies (81.0 versus 89.6%, respectively, p = 0.2) postoperatively. Fewer stent randomized patients had motile sperm (76.2 versus 81.3%, respectively, p = 0.5) and normal total motile sperm counts (49.2 versus 52.1%, respectively, p = 0.8) than did those without a stent. Conception occurred in 22 and 51% of all couples in the stent and no stent groups. The relative risk of conception among those in the stent group was 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.71, p = 0.002). A Mantel-Cox log-rank test comparing pregnancies in each group according to the number of postoperative months revealed that the no stent group achieved more earlier pregnancies (p = 0.003).The 2-layer microscopic vasovasostomy results in greater pregnancy rates than vasovasostomy using the absorbable stent.Save to LibraryDownloadby Richard Berger•  20  Urology, Research Methodology, Clinical Trial, TreatmentAccuracy and Reliability of Three Different Techniques for Manual Goniometry for Wrist Motion: A Cadaveric StudySave to LibraryDownloadby Aviva  Wolff and +2Sherry I BackusHoward Hillstrom•  17  Humans, Fluoroscopy, Orthopedics, TechniqueThree Distinct Directions of Intramural Activation Reveal Nonuniform Side-to-Side Electrical Coupling of Ventricular MyocytesSave to LibraryDownloadby Bryan Caldwell•  38  Cartography, Structure, Density, StabilityWall Suction Applied to Needle Muscle Biopsy—A Novel Technique for Increasing Sample SizeThe needle biopsy technique described by Bergström is the most commonly used technique to obtain samples to assess muscle metabolism.

Sampling of muscle, particularly the vastus lateralis, has become an essential tool in biomedical and clinical research. Optimal sample size is critical for availability of tissue for processing. To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel technique to obtain adequate sample size using wall suction applied to needle muscle biopsy, we collected samples from subjects in on-going clinical studies for gene expression.Muscle biopsy samples of the vastus lateralis using 6 mm Bergström needles under local anesthesia were obtained from 55 subjects who had volunteered to participate in this research project. The vastus lateralis was biopsied according to the methods described by Bergström with a 6 mm biopsy needle. Wall suction was applied to the inner bore of the biopsy needle after the needle was inserted into the muscle.The mean sample of biopsy taken using the 6 mm was 233 mg (n = 55). The wall suction (200 mm Hg) applied to the needle pulled the surrounding tissue into the central bore of the needle. The quality of the samples was adequate for all biochemical assays. The biopsy technique did not result in any complications due to infection or bleeding.Using a novel technique of connecting a 6 mm Bergström biopsy needle to wall suction, we have obtained 200 to 300 mg muscle biopsy specimens uniformly, with ease, and minimal discomfort. An increase in sample size allows for a wider variety of biochemical and histopathological analysis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mary Melendez•  14  Surgery, Skeletal muscle biology, Treatment, MedicineVolumes Ingested by Four Species of Noctuids with Reference to Peroral Droplet Bioassay of BaculovirusesSave to LibraryDownloadby James Fuxa•  14  Zoology, Lepidoptera, Virus, AnimalsHow virtual reality may enhance training in obstetrics and gynecologySave to LibraryDownloadby Gerard Letterie•  20  Obstetrics, Communication, Domestic Violence, Health EducationSusruta, the pioneer urologist of antiquitySave to LibraryDownloadby Sakti Das•  13  Surgery, Urology, History of Medicine, Ayurvedic MedicineAn improved configuration for the reduction of EMG in electrode cuff recordings: a theoretical approachSave to LibraryDownloadby John Taylor•  15  Biomedical Engineering, Biometry, Neurophysiology, Signal AnalysisCarbon dioxide laser evaporation of leukoplakia of the lower lipSave to LibraryDownloadby Jan Roodenburg•  17  Dentistry, Surgery, Carbon Dioxide, TreatmentSelective analysis of the sentinel node in breast cancerSave to LibraryDownloadby Shahab Abdessalam•  16  Pathology, Breast Cancer, Localization, ImmunohistochemistryPressure support.

Between 1977 and 2001, 168 children under 18 years of age underwent colectomy and IAPP. One hundred thirty-one had ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-six had familial colonic polyposis (FP), 9 had Hirschsprung&amp;#39;s disease (HD), and 2 had colonic inertia. Ninety-seven had a J-pouch, 62 had a lateral pouch, and 9 had a straight pull-through (SP). The mean age was 13.9 years. Complications within 2 years included pouchitis (16%), ileoanal strictures (14%), and adhesions (7%). There were no deaths. Fifty-six patients (33%) required reoperation, including 20 revisions of large pouches and 8 conversions of SP to pouches because of stool frequency. Six children (3.6%) had later pouch removal (3 had Crohn&amp;#39;s disease). Stool frequency at 6 months was 3.8 (mean). At 6 months 5% had occasional soiling. Eighty-four percent can delay defecation over 1(1/2) hours; 82% can urinate without a bowel movement. With a mean follow-up of 11.2 years, 94.6% are functioning well. Colectomy with IAPP is the preferred operation for children with UC, FP, and selected HD. The J-pouch is the preferred technique because of simplicity of construction and sparsity of complications.Save to Libraryby anjani thakur•  19  Surgery, Adolescent, Humans, ChildNeuroimaging of Bipolar Disorder: Emphasis on Novel MRI Techniques: MRI TECHNIQUES IN BIPOLAR DISORDERSave to LibraryDownloadby Stefania  Bruno•  15  Neuroimaging, Bipolar Disorder, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Diffusion Tensor ImagingTechnique Comparison for Efficient Orthodontic Tooth Measurements Using Digital ModelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Philippe Gaillard•  14  Dentistry, Orthodontics, Nonparametric Statistics, SoftwareGraded Full-Thickness Anterior Blepharotomy for Upper EyelidRetractionSave to LibraryDownloadby Adam Hassan•  18  Surgery, Treatment, Treatment Outcome, EstheticsEffect of a FastSkin suit on submaximal freestyle swimmingSave to LibraryDownloadby Richard Sharp and +1Khaled Kamel•  14  Biomechanics, Swimming, Sport, HumansSquamous cell carcinoma arising in chronic osteomyelitisSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare but well-documented complication of chronic osteomyelitis.

Between February 1991 and March 1999, 13 cases (12 men and one woman) of SCC arising in chronic osteomyelitis were diagnosed and treated in our clinic. Mean age was 56.5 (38–70) years. Twelve patients underwent amputation and one underwent limb salvage. Average follow-up was 56 (24–121) months. Among the 13 patients two died of the disease. Treatment of choice for these tumours has been amputation. Carcinome cellulaire squameux est une complication d'ostéomyélite, peu fréquente, mais bien connue. Entre le février 91–mars 99, dans notre clinique, nous ont constate 13 malades (12 hommes et 1 femme) a qui nous ont vu la maladie développe a la base d'ostéomyélite chronique. L'age moyen était 56.5. (38–70) 12 malades ont subi une amputation et dans l'autre l'extrémité a été gardée. La surveillance a duré à peu près 56 (24–121) mois. Parmi ces 13 malades seulement deux sont morts.
