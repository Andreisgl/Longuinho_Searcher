In an ever-growing field of study, this is a major contribution to one of the key areas in cultural studies and cultural theory – the spaces, practices and mythologies of our everyday culture.  Drawing on the work of such continental theorists as Henri Lefebvre, Michel de Certeau, Marc Aug? and Siegfried Kracauer, Joe Moran explores the concrete sites and routines of everyday life and how they are represented through political discourse, news media, material culture, photography, reality TV shows, CCTV and much more.    Unique in his focus of the under-explored, banal aspects of everyday culture, including office life, commuting, traffic and mass housing, Moran re-evaluates conventional notions of everyday life in cultural studies, and shows that analysing such ‘boring’ phenomena can help make sense of cultural and social change.    This book is interdisciplinary in its approach and covers many different areas including visual culture, cultural geography, material culture, and cultural history as well as the key areas of cultural studies and sociology.     Students from all these subjects will find this clearly written and lively work an invaluable study resource.Issue: до 2011-01Edition: 1Includes bibliographical referencesIntroduction: Waiting, cultural studies, and the quotidian -- Workspace : office life and commuting -- Urban space : the myths and meanings of traffic -- Non-places : supermodernity and the everyday -- Living space : housing, the market, and the everyday -- Conclusion: The everyday and cultural change
