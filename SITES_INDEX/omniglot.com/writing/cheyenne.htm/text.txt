Cheyenne (Tsėhesenėstsestotse)
Cheyenne is a Plains Algonquian language spoken by about 2,100 people
 in Montana and Oklahoma in the USA. It is spoken specifically on the 
 Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in the south east of Montana and 
 in central Oklahoma. Most Cheyenne speakers are over 50, and the 
 language is classified as by UNESCO as "definitely endangered" in 
 Montana, and "critically endangered" in Oklahoma.
The Cheyenne name for their language is Tsėhesenėstsestotse or Tsisinstsistots, and the Cheyenne people call themselves Tsitsistas. 
There are classes in Cheyenne at Chief Dull Knife College in Lame Deer
 in Montana, at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and at Watonga High School in Watonga in Oklahoma.
Cheyenne is written with just 14 letters which can be combined together to make some very long words.
Cheyenne is a tonal language and tones are marked as follows:
á, é, ó = high pitch or tone
 ȧ, ė, ȯ or â, ê, ô = voiceless (whispered)
The low tone is not marked.
