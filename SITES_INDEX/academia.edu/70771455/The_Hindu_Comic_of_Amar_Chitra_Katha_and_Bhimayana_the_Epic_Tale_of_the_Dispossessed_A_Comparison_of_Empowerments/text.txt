NayarThis article argues that the graphic novel of BR Ambedkar’s life, Bhimayana, generates a postcolonial critical literacy. Critical literacy forces the reader to link personal experiences with socio-historical and institutional power relations, and alerts us to reflect on issues of otherness in the text. In the first section, the article argues that Bhimayana’s innovations of form and content, and its extensive metaphorization and multiple registers serve to combine a personal story with the history of a condition – of caste-based discrimination. In the second section of the article, I focus on the critical literacy the text initiates and demands of its readers. I suggest that the work fits into an already existing interocular (where the visual intersects with images from other visual media, such as television) field, and draws upon a popular register. It is this everyday register of comics – commonplace in the form of the comic strips in newspapers and periodicals but also as comic books – that enables Bhimayana to debate social issues in a medium that is far removed from other forms and genres such as newspaper reportage, commentaries and Amnesty reports where human rights issues are mostly addressed. The text is therefore significant in that it situates debates about caste and human rights in the popular cultural realm. A postcolonial critical literacy is the demand made on the reader to recognize, in this supposedly non-serious medium, a social problem.Download Free PDFView PDFImaginaires queers: Transgressions religieuses et culturelles à travers l’espace et le temps (eds. Francesca Prescendi Morresi & Irene Becci)Earth, heart, art : ‘re-tracing’ religion and identity in Indian graphic novels2020 • Marianna FerraraText available at: https://www.cairn.info/imaginaires-queers--9782940648160.htm This text considers some examples of the new literature from India authored by women, where gender, nature, and religion are all engaged in criticism against the sacralised foundation of a society, that justifies and allows the exploitation of its subalterns. Drawing on examples from the universe of visual story-telling, this text discusses a selection of recent graphic novels where epic narration has found fresh space and is being brought to the attention of new audiences. While looking at India’s ancient history and mythological heritage through graphic novel genre, not only the younger generations, but also so-called ‘young adult’, and women especially, have found an unconventional space in which to claim a voice to speak on the country’s traditions, to share ideas, and approach contemporary issues debated in the public.Download Free PDFView PDFBhimayana: Caste, Ambedkar, Art, and PedagogyVivek VellankiBhimayana is a graphic novel that narrates Dr B.R. Ambedkar’s experi- ences of being discriminated against. Using a graphic form inspired by Pardhan Gond art, Bhimayana breaks popular conventions of graphic narratives published in the West. The narrative of Bhimayana is inter- laced with contemporary events and brings to life Ambedkar’s story in a compelling way while retaining its subtleties. In this interview, S. Anand reveals that although the book was not planned for children, it has poten- tial as a pedagogical tool for exploring questions about caste-based dis- crimination. Anand talks about the book, its relevance in contemporary times, Dr Ambedkar and his journey in engaging with the issue of caste- based discrimination.Download Free PDFView PDF‘Radical Graphics: Martin Luther King., Jr., BR Ambedkar and Comics Auto/biography’2016 • Pramod K.

The representation of women in the Indian comics scene before the advent of the graphic novel in 2004 (with Sarnath Banerjee's Corridor) is dominated by masculine projections of femininity, where, given the context of Indian societal values, visuality becomes a pretext of stereotypical depictions and unreal or generally misconstrued gender roles. This paper considers both shortform and longform comics by select women author/artists of India and aims to situate them in the corpus of the Indian comics industry, along with providing a critical evaluation of women representation on the reformed comic book page by said authors and artists. The paper will showcase how contemporary Indian comics by women have been able to naturalize the erstwhile stereotypical and limited attitude towards the body, psyche, and the socio-cultural stance of a woman.Download Free PDFView PDFBook:Caste, gender and media: Significant sociological trends in India – an open distance paradigmRethinking beyond the Borders: A Cross Country Analysis of Women’s Political Participation (Book:Caste, gender and media: Significant sociological trends in India – an open distance paradigm)2018 • Monalisa ChakrabortyDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Hindu StudiesBhakti Rhetoric in the Hagiography of 'Untouchable'Saints: Discerning Bhakti's Ambivalence on Caste and Brahminhood2009 • Patton BurchettDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
