We aimed to explore the contemporary context, framed as challenges and opportunities, for improving population-level prevention and management of MSK health in LMICs using secondary qualitative data from a previous study exploring HSS priorities for MSK health globally and (2) to contextualize these findings through a primary analysis of health policies for integrated management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in select LMICs. Part 1: 12 transcripts of interviews with LMIC-based key informants (KIs) were inductively analysed. Part 2: systematic content analysis of health policies for integrated care of NCDs where KIs were resident (Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Philippines and South Africa).

Methods based on the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) by INFORMAS (International Network for Food and Obesity/NCDs Research, Monitoring and Action Support) were used. Between October 2017 and August 2018, a cross-country team of researchers trained by a Food-EPI expert implemented the Kenya Food-EPI exercise.Download Free PDFView PDFNCDs in the Small Countries of the Commonwealth.docMarcus  DayWhen researching this article on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the Small States of the Commonwealth, I was shocked at learning of two aspects of what has quickly become a global epidemic. The first was the extent of the problem: I was astounded that up to 80% of the worlds deaths were caused by diseases that were only recently been amalgamated into the category “NCDs”. The second thought I had was: “If this is so huge, why is it just now that we are hearing about it? The whole concept of the cumulative impact NCDs seems to have only appeared on the global stage since the turn of the century. Despite their obvious and growing significance, the lack of amalgamating the component diseases as “NCDs” has had the effect of keeping the impact of the aggregate hidden, misunderstood and under-recorded. NCDs were not even mentioned in the Millennium Development Goals, which, by focusing attention on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal, child and reproductive health, may have caused this growing public health concern to o unrecognized at the global level until recently.Download Free PDFView PDFLancet Series 2018 Investing in non-communicable disease prevention and management to advance the Sustainable Development GoalsLouis W NiessenReduction of the non-communicable disease (NCD) burden is a global development imperative. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 includes target 3·4 to reduce premature NCD mortality by a third by 2030. Progress on SDG target 3·4 will have a central role in determining the success of at least nine SDGs. A strengthened effort across multiple sectors with effective economic tools, such as price policies and insurance, is necessary. NCDs are heavily clustered in people with low socioeconomic status and are an important cause of medical impoverishment. They thereby exacerbate economic inequities within societies. As such, NCDs are a barrier to achieving SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 4, SDG 5, and SDG 10. Productivity gains from preventing and managing NCDs will contribute to SDG 8. SDG 11 and SDG 12 offer clear opportunities to reduce the NCD burden and to create sustainable and healthy cities.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Lancet Public HealthPrimary stroke prevention worldwide: translating evidence into action2021 • SEREFNUR OZTURKDownload Free PDFView PDFFood Security4th Annual Conference of the Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research on Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH), Agri-food policy and governance for nutrition and health, London, 3–4 June 20142014 • Soledad CuevasDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
