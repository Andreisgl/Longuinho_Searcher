Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales denies site is 'losing' thousands of volunteer editors
Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is contesting the accuracy of a recent study which claims that 49,000 volunteer editors of the online encyclopaedia have left in the first three months of 2009.
   By Emma Barnett  and  Emmabarnett    26 November 2009 • 11:36am 
 
 
 
  
 
 Jimmy Wales co-founded Wikipedia in 2001.
 
The study, conducted by Felipe Ortega at Libresoft, a research group at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid, analysed the editing history of more than three million active Wikipedia contributors in ten different languages. It found that the first three months of this year the English-language version of the site suffered a net loss of 49,000 contributors, compared with a loss of about 4,900 during the same period last year. 
The findings of the research have prompted many to question whether this is the beginning of the end for the world’s largest encyclopedia. However, Mr Wales told The Telegraph he didn’t accept the research as new editors are replacing existing editors at nearly the same pace. 
“Our internal numbers don’t confirm all the claims made. We do agree that the number of editors has stabilised, as one would expect, since we're already the fifth most popular website on the internet...[however] our own data shows that the number of active editors across all projects is stable – i.e. the new editors are replaced at about the same pace as existing editors are leaving.”
According to Wikipedia’s statistics, there were 39,211 Wikipedians – people who write and edit pages on the site – in September 2009 who contributed more than five times to the English-language version of the site during that month. This is compared to 40,793 Wikipedians who contributed the same amount to the English Wikipedia in September 2008 – which is a year on year decline of 1,585. 
Mr Ortega’s research suggested editors are leaving the site in record numbers and that the downward trend would continue. However, Mr Wales was keen to stress the numbers had stabilized because Wikipedia was so large. “You can’t keep growing forever, there are only so many people on the internet,” he explained. 
He also denied the “stabilisation” of the number of editors would bring about a quickening end to the site – saying “Wikipedia is doing just fine”. 
The site came under fire recently when it announced new measures which would enable a core group of volunteer editors to adjudicate on any changes made to a living person's Wikipedia before those modifications were published. 
These new measures, known as “flagged revisions", which are set to be adopted in December, were designed to combat the growing problem of vandalism on the site. The measures will mean that amendments made by a new Wikipedia user to the page of a famous person or someone in the news, such as Tony Blair, will be held in a queue for as long as a few days, until the editors have checked the veracity of the new material. This new process was criticised by many observers for being a fundamental shift in Wikipedia’s approach to gathering and sharing of online information. 
However, Mr Wales denied there had been any “material changes” to the editing rules, and in an interview with The Telegraph last week dismissed the concerns that the web encyclopaedia has changed its ethos. “We have not compromised. There has always been protection on the site. There is a mythology that Wikipedia used to be a crazy anarchy but that just isn’t true. We have an ongoing trend towards openness – which is getting more open. People used to have to register to make these sort of changes to high profile Wikipedia pages and then wait a few days. Now they can upload the changes without registering and wait to see if they are uploaded.”
Mr Ortega contested this in an interview with The Times saying contributors “don’t feel the spirit of the first years. The articles are very tightly controlled by others now, and that makes it hard to jump in and contribute”.
