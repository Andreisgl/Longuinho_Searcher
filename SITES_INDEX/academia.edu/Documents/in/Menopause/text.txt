Indonesian women were shorter and lighter than Australian women (P < 0·001) but had a comparable body mass index (BMI). The Indonesians also had a lower spinal BMD than the Australians but this was accounted for by the differences in height and weight between the two populations. The differences in serum and urinary calcium and phosphate and serum alkaline phosphatase across the menopause were comparable in Indonesian and Australian women but creatinine excretion was 25% lower in Jakarta than in Adelaide (P < 0·001) and this was probably sufficient to account for higher ratios of some urinary solutes to urinary creatinine in the Indonesians. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels were significantly lower (P < 0·001) and serum PTH levels significantly higher (P = 0·0045) in Jakarta than in Adelaide.Conclusions  The differences in bone-related biochemical variables across the menopause were similar in the two populations, but calcium and protein intake and urine creatinine were lower in Indonesian than in Australian women. Serum 25OHD was lower and PTH higher in the Indonesian women, probably because of their darker skin, their practice of avoiding direct sunlight and the heavy atmospheric pollution in Jakarta.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maryantoro Oemardi•  18  Indonesia, Vitamin D, Menopause, OsteoporosisHealth in Middle-Aged and Elderly Women: a Conceptual Framework for Healthy MenopauseSave to LibraryDownloadby Ellen Laan•  11  Aging, Health, Menopause, HumansAxillary dissection in breast cancerSave to LibraryDownloadby CK Axelsson•  16  Breast Cancer, Menopause, Humans, FemaleWhy are physicians reluctant to use estrogens for anything - or do they prefer 'PROFOX'?The reluctance of physicians to use estrogens in women with hormone responsive disorders is a tragic result of the 2002 WHI study.

Clinical information on the 8688 women seen in the WHC through May 2017 who gave consent for the use of their medical records in research is contained in the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality (DREAMS). Initially, DREAMS was created to improve the clinical care of women, but it has become a valuable research tool. About 25% of the DREAMS women have been seen in the WHC 2 or more times, allowing for passive longitudinal follow-up. Additionally, about 25% of the DREAMS women live in the 27-county region included in the expanded Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system, providing additional information on those women.

In this article we share the insights we have gained from using focus group methodology in work with an under-served population of black menopausal women. This methodology holds promise for advancing our understanding of, and ultimately eliminating, health disparities. Included is a discussion of planning and facilitating the focus group, recruiting group members, collecting and analyzing the data and reporting the results. Throughout, we explain how we applied these principles and we conclude by sharing lessons learned from our study on menopause and midlife experiences in Black women.Save to LibraryDownloadby Coralease Ruff•  17  Nursing, Communication, Research Design, Focus GroupsPhysical performance in relation to menopause status and physical activitySave to LibraryDownloadby Taija Finni•  2  Menopause, Medical and Health SciencesUpdate on management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause: a practical guideSave to LibraryDownloadby Velja Mijatovic•  16  Sexuality, Quality of life, Menopause, HumansAcupuncture and self acupuncture for long term treatment of vasomotor symptoms in Cancer patients - audit and treatment algorithmIntroduction Since hormone replacement therapy given for long periods is now recognised to produce serious side effects, patients with troublesome vasomotor symptoms are increasingly using non-hormonal treatment including acupuncture.... moreIntroduction Since hormone replacement therapy given for long periods is now recognised to produce serious side effects, patients with troublesome vasomotor symptoms are increasingly using non-hormonal treatment including acupuncture. Several randomised controlled trials have shown that acupuncture reduces menopausal symptoms in patients experiencing the normal climacteric. It may have this effect by raising serotonin levels which alter the temperature set point in the hypothalamus. Vasomotor symptoms can be extreme in breast cancer patients and patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing anticancer therapy. The safety of some herbal medicines and phytoestrogens has been questioned, as they could potentially interfere adversely with the bioavailability of tumouricidal drugs. A previous study reports short term benefit from acupuncture, and the aim of this report is to describe our approach to long term treatment.

This has driven many climacteric women to seek for alternatives, chiefly natural products. Phytoestrogens containing soy or red clover preparations, however, when taken at the recommended daily doses, proved to be ineffective to ameliorate climacteric complaints and to prevent osteoporosis. Cimicifuga racemosa(CR) preparations, on the other hand, have been shown to ease climacteric distress.CR extracts are traditionally used to ease climacteric complaints and a number of double-blind placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated this effect. Low or intermediate doses, however, are more effective than high doses. CR extracts do not contain estrogenic compounds: they exert their efficacy through mechanisms linked to the presence of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and GABA-ergic acting substances, but no estrogenic activity can be expected.There is a widespread, but false, belief that the efficacy of CR preparations is linked to the presence of phytoestrogens in the plant. This review aims at summarizing the available in vitro and in vivo evidence showing that compounds in CR extracts do not bind to oestrogen receptors and thus do not exert any estrogenic effects in the uterus and mammary gland, as shown in vivo in experiments on ovariectomized rats and clinically in postmenopausal women. Studies in ovariectomized rats and in women suffering from climacteric complaints have indicated that substances with neurotransmitter-like activities affect beneficially postmenopausal symptoms such as hot flushes. Some of these compounds, such as triterpenes with GABA-ergic activity and a serotonin analogue, are present and have been identified in the CR extracts. Authors conclude that these activities explain most likely the beneficial effects of CR extracts on climacteric complaints.Save to LibraryDownloadby Reproductive Endocrinology•  6  Menopause, Black Cohosh, Hormone Replacement Therapy, Cimicifuga racemosaStigma, Abortion, and Disclosure—Findings from a Qualitative Studyj sm_2604 3137..3147Introduction.

It explores women's journey through abortion from confirmation of pregnancy to post-abortion. Aim. The study seeks to understand the implications of these perceptions for policy and practice. Main Outcome Measures. A qualitative study involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 women, aged between 22 and 57 years, who had undergone legal induced abortion in the UK when they were 16 years or older. Participants were not recruited under the age of 16 because of the ethical and legal complexities of interviewing minors. Additionally, 16 years was deemed to be the most appropriate age as this is the legal age of consent in the UK. Methods. Participants were recruited from 12 community contraception and sexual health clinics in two NHS trusts, one in England and one in Wales. Participant recruitment was set at a minimum of 12 and participants were recruited on a " first come first served basis " (i.e., the first 12 who contacted the researcher). The number of participants was raised to seventeen as this was the number deemed to be the most suitable for data saturation in this particular qualitative research. Results. Women in this study understood abortion as highly taboo and a potentially personally stigmatizing event. These perceptions continued to affect disclosure to others, long after the abortion, and affected women's perceptions of the response of others, including society in general, significant others, and health professionals. Conclusions. Women's experiences of abortion may be influenced by perceived negative social attitudes. Health professionals and abortion service providers might combat the perceived isolation of women undergoing abortion by attending not only to clinical/technical aspects of the procedure but also to women's psychological/emotional sensitivities surrounding the event.

Physiologic changes in menopause can change body’s appearance and function that may disturb body and then lead to anxiety and depression. This study aims to assess the relationship between body image with anxiety and depression among postmenopausal women. Methods This descriptive study was performed on 307 women attending to the health centers in Tehran- Iran. Sampling was performed by a multi-staged randomized method. Data were collected by using Beck Depression questionnaire, Spielberger Anxiety Questionnaire, Fisher Body Image Questionnaire and Socio-demographic questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 and using t-test, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests and multiple linear regression methods. Results The average age of the participants was 55.19 ± 4.034 years.

Present studies suggest that soluble fragments of the c-erbB-2 oncogene may be released from the cell surface and become detectable in patients with carcinoma of the breast. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to assay the c-erbB-2 protein in the saliva and serum of women with and without carcinoma of the breast and to determine whether the protein possesses any diagnostic value. To determine the diagnostic utility of this oncogene, the soluble form of the c-erbB-2 protein was assayed in the saliva and serum using ELISA in three different groups of women. The three groups consisted of 57 healthy women, 41 women with benign breast lesions, and 30 women diagnosed with breast cancer.

Cross-sectional analysis of data from a prospective cohort study. University medical center. Seventy-one cancer survivors aged 15-39 years; 67 healthy, similarly aged unexposed subjects; and 69 regularly menstruating women of late reproductive age (40-52 years). None. Early follicular-phase hormones (FSH, E(2), inhibin B, antimüllerian hormone [AMH]) and ovarian ultrasound measurements (ovarian volume and antral follicle counts [AFC]) were compared using multivariable linear regression. In adjusted models, FSH, AMH, and AFC differed between exposed vs. unexposed subjects (FSH 11.12 mIU/mL vs. 7.25 mIU/mL; AMH 0.81 ng/mL vs. 2.85 ng/mL; AFC 14.55 vs. 27.20). In participants with an FSH &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;10 mIU/mL, survivors had lower levels of AMH and AFC compared with controls. Alkylating agent dose score was associated with increased levels of FSH and decreased levels of AMH. Exposure to pelvic radiation was associated with impairment in FSH, AMH, AFC, and ovarian volume. Antimüllerian hormone was similar in women previously exposed to high-dose cancer therapy and 40-42-year-old controls. Measures of ovarian reserve are impaired in a dose-dependent manner among cancer survivors compared with unexposed females of similar age. Reproductive hormone levels in menstruating survivors exposed to high-dose therapy are similar to those in late-reproductive-age women. The predictive value of measures for pregnancy and menopause must be studied.

Fatigue and perceived stress are commonly experienced by women during the MT and EPM. We sought to discover relationships between these symptoms and to employ these symptoms as possible markers for resilience. Participants were drawn from the longitudinal Seattle Midlife Women&#39;s Health Study. Eligible women completed questionnaires on 60+ occasions (annual health reports and monthly health diaries) (n = 56 women). The total number of observations across the sample was 4,224.
