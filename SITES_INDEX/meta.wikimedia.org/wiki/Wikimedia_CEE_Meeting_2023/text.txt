Wikimedia CEE Meeting 2023 (#WMCEE) is an annual conference centered on Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia and other related projects) in countries of Central and Eastern Europe (more recently, also in Central Asia). It features presentations on Wikimedia projects, other wikis, free/open source software, free knowledge and free content, and the social and technical aspects of these topics. The 2023 meeting will be held in Tbilisi, Georgia, between 15-17 September, organized by Wikimedia UG Georgia.
The idea was conceived at an informal meetup that took place on 6 August 2011 at Wikimania 2011 in Haifa. Most of the attendees from the region's countries were present and shared their experiences in establishing a more global community. The history of CEE meetings is already 11 years old, starting from the first meeting in Belgrade (2012). The following meetings were organized in Modra (2013), Kyiv (2014), Voore (2015), Dilijan (2016), Warsaw (2017), Lviv (2018), Belgrade (2019), two online meetings during the Covid pandemic and the last one took place in Ohrid (2022).
