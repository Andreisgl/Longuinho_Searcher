Sorry, Crimson fans, this may be harder to swallow than that NCAA tourney loss.

Harvard grads: there’s good news and bad news. First, the good news. In a data-based ranking of the world’s most influential universities, Harvard takes the top spot among U.S. schools. Take that, Yale and Princeton. Now the less-good news. There are two schools that beat Harvard in this influence ranking: the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in the U.K. 
The influence ranking comes from a group led by Jose Lages at the University of Franche-Comte in France (hat tip to the MIT Review for bringing it to our attention and distilling the data), and is based on an algorithm that mined Wikipedia for mentions of the universities.  As MIT Review points out, conventional rankings of universities can’t always take into account important differences between university models and can’t always account for cultural and linguistic biases. For instance, no ranking has really figured out how to handle a university that focuses more on teaching against one that focuses more on research.

Cambridge and Oxford beating out Harvard may not seem like a huge upset — those universities aren’t exactly no-name party schools. Harvard may be the U.S.’s oldest institution of higher learning, but Cambridge and Oxford trace their history back to the Middle Ages and together count Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, dozens of Nobel laureates and British prime ministers and countless foreign heads of state among their alumni.  But this ranking does differ — and not just on Harvard — from one of the most well-known rankings of universities world-wide, the Academic Ranking of World Universities. In that list Harvard takes the top spot overall, followed by U.S. institutions Stanford, MIT, and the University of California, Berkeley. Cambridge comes in at No. 5 and Oxford at No. 10, behind Princeton, Cal Tech, Columbia and the University of Chicago. The Wikipedia Ranking of World Universities using PageRank algorithm takes the same kind of process that Google uses to rank websites and applies it to mentions of universities in Wikipedia. This approach doesn’t solve every problem with conventional rankings and has a few of its own — its reliance on the self-policing nature of Wikipedia is one right off the bat. But it’s worth looking at the results just for a few of the interesting surprises it turns up. U.S. schools dominate the top of the Academic Ranking of World Universities, and more than half the universities in that ranking are in the U.S. The U.S. is still the highest ranked country overall in the Wikipedia ranking, but to a lesser degree — 38% of the schools in the ranking are American.The Wikipedia Ranking of World Universities top 20:
