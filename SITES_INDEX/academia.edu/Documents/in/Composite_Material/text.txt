Powder samples were prepared in proportion as 5%, 10% and 20% B4C was added in to Cu-%5 Al powder mixture. Prepared powder samples subject to hot pressing at 600 oC, 4 minutes under argon inert gas atmosphere, 30 MPa/cm2 pressure. Pressed specimens were investigated hardness and microstructure. At the result of the experiments, it&#39;s fastened down; B4C affected the hardness and microstructure of the materials, which added at the different rates in matrix.Save to LibraryDownloadby Prof.Dr.Hüseyin TURHAN•  5  Materials Science, Microstructure, Composite Material, Engineering SciencesCrosslinking of a polyester resin in the heated plain sheet copper mouldSave to LibraryDownloadby ZORAN GOMZI•  14  Materials Science, Kinetics, Modeling, Heat TransferDamage evolution and infrared thermography in woven composite laminates under fatigue loadingSave to LibraryDownloadby L.

Mixer parameters such as the mixing temperature, mixing time, and rotor speed were screened and optimized with response surface methodology to maximize the impact strength. The parameters were selected as three independent variables and the impact strength (J/m) was selected as the response in a screening factor study. The mixing temperature and its interaction terms were identified as insignificant factors with a P value greater than 0.0500. The optimum calculated values of the tested variables (rotor speed and mixing time) for the maximum impact strength were found to be a rotor speed of 60 rpm and a mixing time of 6 min with a predicted impact strength of 208.88 J/m. These predicted optimum parameters were tested in real experiments. The final impact strength was found to be close to the predicted value of 215.84 J/m, with only a 3.33% deviation. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study we discuss experimental data about the mesoscopic structure and the crystallographic texture (orientation distribution) of the α-chitin–protein fiber network in this material. The synchrotron measurements reveal very strong crystallographic textures of the α-chitin. According to these data, a large fraction of the α-chitin lattice cells is arranged with their longest axis parallel to the normal of the surface of the exoskeleton. Additionally, a smaller fraction of the α-chitin cells is oriented with their longest axis perpendicular to the cuticle surface. These structural investigations reveal the pronounced role of crystallographic orientation distributions in mineralized biological composite materials which may be of relevance for an improved understanding of biological and bio-inspired nano-composites.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dierk Raabe•  38  Materials Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science, CrystallographyMechanics of Bimaterial Interface: Shear Deformable Split Bilayer Beam Theory and FractureSave to LibraryDownloadby Jialai Wang•  13  Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, ModelingSeismic behavior of a full-scale RC frame repaired using CFRP laminatesThe opportunities provided by the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites for the seismic repair of reinforced concrete (RC) structures were assessed on a full-scale dual system subjected to pseudodynamic tests in the... moreThe opportunities provided by the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites for the seismic repair of reinforced concrete (RC) structures were assessed on a full-scale dual system subjected to pseudodynamic tests in the ELSA laboratory.

A common metallic alloy, widely used in orthopaedic surgery, was used as control (Stellite). The aim of the study was to analyze the biological response towards the surface of the material. Composite implants and metallic implants did not induce adverse or inflammatory reactions. The morphological picture produced was similar, in muscle and in bone, for both materials. In muscle, cylinders were confined by an extremely thin fibrous layer and the overall appearance of the muscular tissue was normal. In bone, cylinders were confined by a nearly annular rim of newly formed bone.

Prosthetic limbs are artificial limbs that are used to replace the original human limbs which a person lost due to any injury, accident and disease. It was found that there is a adhere need to find an optimized cost-effective method for amputated athletes so that they can run at same efficiency with their artificial limbs. This is very expensive medical equipment and its reliability is not that great so taking that into consideration there was a need to find an alternative design or material regarding the same.

However, with advancement in manufacturing, changing societal outlook for the chemical industries and emerging technologies that disrupt conventional approaches to thermoset fabrication, there is a need for a multifunctional epoxy resin that is able to adapt to newer and robust requirements. Epoxy resins that behave both like a thermoplastic and a thermoset resin with better properties are now the norm in research and development. In this paper, we viewed multifunctionality in epoxy resins in terms of other desirable properties such as its toughness and flexibility, rapid curing potential, self-healing ability, reprocessability and recyclability, high temperature stability and conductivity, which other authors failed to recognize. These aspects, when considered in the synthesis and formulation of epoxy resins will be a radical advance for thermosetting polymers, with a lot of applications. Therefore, we present an overview of the recent finding as to pave the way for varied approaches towards multifunctional epoxy resins.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaworski C .

Here we developed novel methods to prepare such materials by an improved drying of wet cellulose prior to pyrolysis. This procedure is an adaptation from electron microscopy techniques, i.e. rapid freeze drying of suspension and solvent exchange drying, both being effective in preventing coagulation of cellulose microfibrils/microcrystals. Pyrolytic carbon from such material has a large external surface area, with the graphitic carbon crystallites roughly aligned along the fiber axis. These features are potentially useful in developing novel carbon nanomaterials for electrodes, catalyst supports, or composite material elements.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yoshiharu Nishiyama•  4  Materials Engineering, Electron Microscopy, Cellulose, Composite MaterialSorption and diffusion of water, salt water, and concrete pore solution in composite matricesSave to LibraryDownloadby Tinh Nguyen•  14  Engineering, Water, Kinetics, Brackish WaterNextLast »Related TopicsArtificial ReefFollowFollowingAdat Melayu SarawakFollowFollowingPower ConsumptionFollowFollowingGreen DesignFollowFollowingMicrostructuresFollowFollowingCockle ShellFollowFollowingWaste MaterialFollowFollowingIon ExchangeFollowFollowingMembrane ScienceFollowFollowingComposite structuresFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
