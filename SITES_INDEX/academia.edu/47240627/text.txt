Little information is available on changes to the HRMT in bed rest. A set of dynamic oscillation mechanosignals ([Hz], [N/m], log decrement, [ms]) collected and computed by a hand-held digital palpation device (MyotonPRO) were used to study changes in tone and in key biomechanical and viscoelastic properties in global and postural skeletal muscle tendons and fascia from a non-exercise control (CTR) and an exercise (JUMP) group performing reactive jumps on a customized sledge system during a 60 days head-down tilt bed rest (RSL Study 2015-2016). A set of baseline and differential natural oscillation signal patterns were identified as key determinants in resting muscle and myofascial structures from back, thigh, calf, patellar and Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia. The greatest changes were found in thigh and...Download Free PDFView PDFMuscle tissue composition and physiological responses to low-level contractions2004 • Pernille NielsenDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of Applied PhysiologyWhole muscle contractile parameters and thickness loss during 35-day bed rest2008 • Igor MekjavicDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of PhysiologySIT' down and relax: the interpolated twitch technique is still a valid measure of central fatigue during sustained contraction tasks2013 • Brian  DaltonDownload Free PDFView PDFArchives of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationVibratory facilitation of strength in fatigued muscle2002 • David GabrielDownload Free PDFView PDFApplied Biological Engineering - Principles and PracticeThe Influence of Different Elbow Angles on the Twitch Response of the Biceps Brachii Muscle Between Intermittent Electrical Stimulations2012 • Raja DahmaneDownload Free PDFView PDFIn vivo specific tension of human skeletal muscleDerek  BallDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Electromyography and KinesiologyTorque and mechanomyogram correlations during muscle relaxation: Effects of fatigue and time-course of recovery2013 • Emiliano CèDownload Free PDFView PDFActa Physiologica ScandinavicaIntramuscular pressure and tissue oxygenation during low-force static contraction do not underlie muscle fatigue2005 • Karen SogaardDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Physiology-londonMuscle vibration sustains motor unit firing rate during submaximal isometric fatigue in humans2001 • Tanya IvanovaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
