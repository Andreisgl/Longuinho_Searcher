          in the United States 
There are approximately 6900 languages currently spoken around the 
            world, the majority of which have only a small number of speakers. 
            About 4 billion of the earth's 6.5 billion people, or over 60% of 
            the earth's population, speak one of the following 30 languages as 
            their native tongue.

            Languages are ordered in the table below by numbers of native speakers. 
            Numbers of second-language speakers are given where known. Second 
            language speakers are those whose native language is typically a minority 
            language of the country in which they live and who learn the second 
            language because it is the official national language of the country 
            where they reside.
