In order to conduct and evaluate any research, it is therefore important to know what these assumptions are. This chapter discusses the philosophical assumptions and also the design strategies underpinning this research study. Common philosophical assumptions were reviewed and presented; the interpretive paradigm was identified for the framework of the study. In addition, the chapter discusses the research methodologies, and design used in the study including strategies, instruments, and data collection and analysis methods, while explaining the stages and processes involved in the study. The research design for this study is a descriptive and interpretive case study that is analysed through qualitative methods. Questionnaires were used to evaluate participants' WebCT skills (before the course starts) and to determine their levels of satisfaction in the course (at the end of the case study). A descriptive statistical method was used to analyze the student satisfaction survey. Participant observation, face-to-face interviews, focus-group interviews, questionnaires, and member checking were used as data collection methods. Furthermore, the justification for each of the data collection methods used in the study was discussed. Finally, in order to ensure trustworthiness of the research, appropriate criteria for qualitative research were discussed, and several methods that include member checks, peer reviews, crystallisation and triangulation were suggested and later employed. The chapter closed with a diagrammatic representation of the major facets of the envisaged framework for the research design and development of the study, and a discussion on the project management approach envisaged for this study.Download Free PDFView PDFQualtiatative research 3Right MagejoDownload Free PDFView PDF05Chap 4_Research methodology and design.pdfsaeed ahmedThe research design for this study is a descriptive and interpretive case study that is analysed through qualitative methods.

For this purpose, the researcher conducted a case study with twenty 4 th year students studying English at the University of Human Development (UHD), Iraqi Kurdistan Region. They were selected based on purposive sampling. The participants were invited to respond to a questionnaire that was created and piloted by the researcher. They were also requested to take part in a structured interview. The findings show that the nature of research methods for 4 th year students across higher education is complex and elusive. The findings also show that most of the students almost have the same problems and they have similar views on their final project as they started at the beginning of the final year of the academic year (2018-2019) at the University of Human Development.Download Free PDFView PDFA Critical Review of the Relationship between Paradigm, Methodology, Design and Method in ResearchIOSR JournalsThis paper makes a conceptual clarification of some research elements-paradigm, methodology, design and method which have proved confusing to early career researchers, postgraduate supervisors and authors. This confusion has often been created and perpetuated by many research textbooks and journals over the years. By using a literature review and author's experience, this paper provides an exposition of the distinction and relationship between these concepts with a view to better the understanding and application of the concepts, for early career researchers, especially Master's and PhD students and postgraduate supervisors.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Nature of Educational Inquiry: Paradigms in Social Science Research Part A Sections 1 & 2: Research methodologies and their philosophical underpinnings2009 • Ruari Alexander  MacLeodThis paper examines the three major paradigms in social science research.Download Free PDFView PDFComputer and Engineering Approach to Methodology and Design Issues for a Customised Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Model/Framework for the Universities in Developing Countries2020 • Assoc Prof Martins E . IrhebhudeThe use of virtual learning environment for teaching and learning provision is one of the concepts that are changing the frontier of knowledge acquisition in today's educational arena. The flexibility of online learning space can offer developing countries great opportunities in supporting varied learning methodologies. This study is about the development of customised VLE framework/model for use by higher institutions in the developing countries, particularly in Nigeria. However, in this paper, we examine only the methodological aspect of the entire research and context within which the current research study was situated. The paper starts by discussing the theoretical perspective underpinning the study and in that aspect provides constructivism as the adopted paradigm. The paper further examines epistemological principles and research design mechanism presented by [15] which includes four (4) principle elements that inform one another in the process of designing a study. These principles include; Epistemology, Theoretical perspective, Methodology and Methods: these are discussed within the methodological framework. This is followed by the identification of methods of data collection, research samples and professional ethics which are keys to the management of research study. This article further describes the fundamental concepts of validity, reliability and generalizability as applicable to this research and finally, presents the contribution of the research in the light of previous studies.Download Free PDFView PDFAN EXPLORATION OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT TEAM'S PROMOTION OF QUALITY EDUCATION WITIDN THE CONTEXT OF INTEGRATED QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMEnock MtshaliDownload Free PDFView PDFJEELS (Journal of English Education and Linguistics Studies)CRITICAL ANALYSIS ON THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING2017 • JEELS  (Journal of English Education and Linguistics Studies)The primary objective of this paper is to assert the contribution of qualitative research in ELT. This paper has presented qualitative theories and features advantages and limitations, the criteria of good qualitative research, and analysis of two articles based on Tracy " s model. The analysis result showed that both articles have some limitations such as the uncovering of potential resources and perspectives on how effective extensive reading programs should be implemented in tertiary education in Indonesia. However, most of the criteria that Tracy established were found in these articles, such as relevance of the area of study, timeliness and significance; sufficient, abundant, appropriate and complex use of theoretical constructs, as well as data collection and analysis processes.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
