The newest film in the Top 10 is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, released in 1968, which charts at six.The top British film in the countdown is The Third Man, which came in at the relatively low placing of number 73.The panel, which voted for 2,045 films overall, was asked to interpret "greatest" how it saw fit.Its results, said Sight and Sound editor Nick James, "reflects changes in the culture of film criticism".Vertigo, he continued, was "the ultimate critics' film"."It is a dream-like film about people who are not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul-mate."In a separate poll run by the monthly publication involving 358 film directors, Ozu's Tokyo Story was voted the greatest film ever made.Citizen Kane is ranked at number two jointly with 2001, while Vertigo occupies seventh place.Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen and Mike Leigh were among the participants in the poll. The full results are published in Sight and Sound's September issue.More on this storyVertigo: The best film ever?Published1 August 2012Citizen Kane tops critics' pollPublished9 August 2002The genius of KanePublished9 August 2002View commentsRelated Internet LinksSight and SoundThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesThreats and insults: How Russian diplomacy diedPublished2 hours agoBurning Man festival turns to mud after heavy rainPublished2 hours agoIsraeli police clash with Eritrean asylum seekersPublished7 hours agoloadingFeaturesFour sons set out on a perilous migration route.
