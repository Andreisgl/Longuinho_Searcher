Controlled for environment-market, geographic-region, and hospital-related variables, the results show almost no measurable effect of strategic adoption on rural hospital profitability and liquidity. Where statistically significant relationships existed, they were more often negative than positive. These findings were not expected; it was hypothesized that positive effects across a broad range of strategies would emerge, other things being equal. Discussed are possible explanations for these findings as well as their implication for a rural health policy relying on individual rural hospital strategic adaptation to environmental change.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Rural HealthRural Hospitals and the Adoption of Managed Care Strategies2001 • James RohrerThis research examined the performance of rural hospitals engaged in different levels of managed care activities and identified factors related to performance and competition that affected rural hospitals&amp;amp;amp;#39; likelihood of pursuing managed care as a strategy. The sample studied consisted of 139 rural hospitals in Iowa and Nebraska. Results showed that a relatively high percentage of hospitals were engaged in managed care activities, mainly through contractual arrangements. The study found that high competition in the marketplace increased the likelihood of hospitals pursuing managed care strategies, while high demand markets had a negative association with the likelihood of pursuing a managed care strategy. No significant relationship was detected between poor performance and pursuing a managed care strategy.Download Free PDFView PDFManagement strategies and financial performance in rural and urban hospitals2001 • James A FalkDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Rural HealthStrategic Adaptations to PPS by Rural Hospitals: Implications for Theory and Research1990 • N.

To obtain an answer from the hospital perspective, the authors conducted a survey of New York State hospitals to determine how network integration, complexity, and financial risk sharing relate to measures of financial performance during the period of 1991-1995. Of the 64 hospitals indicating a network affiliation by 1995, 67.2 percent listed some network risk-sharing activity. The least integrated networks were associated with the smallest improvements in throughput, and the most complex were associated with the largest negative changes in operating margins. During the first 2 years of network membership, hospitals joining risk-sharing networks experienced operating margin gains averaging 12 percentage points higher than hospitals joining networks without risk sharing; however, this difference dissipated in later years. Networks with higher levels of integration, lower levels of complexity, and which involve some risk-sharing between affiliates are most likely to experience improved hospital financial performance during the network’s initial years.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Productivity AnalysisRural hospital performance and its correlates1996 • Gary FerrierDownload Free PDFView PDFHealth Care Management ReviewHospital board effectiveness: Relationships between board training and hospital financial viability1992 • Carol MolinariDownload Free PDFView PDFHealth Care Management ReviewDelivery system characteristics and their association with quality and costs of care2014 • Gloria Bazzoli, Askar Chukmaitov, Henry  CarrettaDownload Free PDFView PDFLong Range PlanningCost reductions or reputation enhancement as motives for mergers: the logic of multi-hospital systems1995 • Mark ShanleyDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Rural HealthA Comparison of Financial Performance, Organizational Characteristics and Management Strategy Among Rural and Urban Nursing Facilities1992 • N.
