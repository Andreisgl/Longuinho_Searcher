Through a case study of the National Junior Challenge Cup (now know as the JP McGuire Cup), the country’s oldest ongoing competition across all youth sports, this paper examines the transformation of American soccer’s identity. The tournament began in 1935 and evolved from an initial constituency of ethnic, immigrant and Catholic youth clubs. Following societal demographic trends, the growing national participant base came from more suburban, middle-class neighbourhoods. The 1970s witnessed a paradigm change in youth soccer as the sport began to move closer to mainstream consciousness. The tournament is a window into the complexity of defining the term ‘ethnic’ and its individuals who straddled both ‘ethnic’ and ‘native’ worlds. This article explores the origins of soccer in America, the bridges between ethnic identity, immigration and the foreign-native cultural debate and Soccer Americana.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers“If They Can Die for Italy, They Can Play for Italy!”: Immigration, Italo-Argentine Identity, and the 1934 Italian World Cup TeamZach BigalkeIn 1934, four Argentine-born soccer players participated for the Italian team that won the FIFA World Cup on home soil. As children born to parents who participated in a wave of Italian immigrants that helped reshape Argentine society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these four players were part of a larger trend where over one hundred Argentine soccer players of Italian descent were signed by Italian clubs in the late 1920s and through the 1930s. This thesis examines the liminal space between Italian and Argentine identity within the broader context of diaspora formation in Argentina through a look at these four exemplars of the transatlantic talent shift. Utilizing sources that include Italian and Argentinian newspapers and magazines, national federation documents, and census and parish records, the thesis reveals the fluidity and temporality of national identity among Italo-Argentine immigrant offspring during the early twentieth century.Download Free PDFView PDFSoccer and SocietyAnything but ringers: early American soccer hotbeds and the 1930 US World Cup team2018 • Zach BigalkeAt the 1930 FIFA World Cup in Uruguay, a group of American soccer players advanced to the semi-finals of the tournament, securing what remains the best-ever finish by a team representing the United States. As time has passed, this team has largely been dismissed as a group of English and Scottish players brought in to bolster the Americans’ chances at the World Cup. This treatment belies the complex interrelation between immigration, labour and leisure time in the early twentieth century that were at the heart of American success in Uruguay. This article keys in on the four regions from which the roster for the 1930 US World Cup team was selected in order to show that their third-place finish was the culmination of a decade-long process of soccer popularization, proliferation, and professionalization through the immigrant hotbeds of the Atlantic seaboard and Midwest.Download Free PDFView PDFEverywhere and nowhere: the forgotten past and clouded future of American professional soccer from the perspective of Massachusetts2012 • Steven  Apostolov, Ph.D.Professional soccer in the United States enjoyed several moments of popularity throughout the 20th century. Professional soccer leagues were founded, some as early as the 1890s. In spite of that, the sport has never caught fire at the professional level. Soccer leagues have not only been in the shadow of baseball, football, basketball and, most recently, ice hockey, but with the exception of Major League Soccer (MLS), a newcomer on the mainstream sporting scene, all of them have folded within a couple of decades. This paper provides insight as to why professional soccer has failed to attain the status of a major American sport. This paper also analyzes the development of professional soccer in the US through the scope of immigration and from the perspective of MassachusettsDownload Free PDFView PDFFrom Foreign Curiosity to National Obsession: Soccer, Immigration, and Politics in Argentina from Mitre to YrigoyenZach BigalkeBartolomé Mitre’s election as president in 1862 commenced a series of political, economic, and demographic developments that radically altered Argentine culture. Immigration fueled exponential population growth and rapid urbanization, and British capital drove a pattern of railroad construction that concretized Buenos Aires’ primacy as the political and financial capital of Argentina. The British also imported soccer, a sport that gradually gained purchase among the various immigrant groups as well as the extant population. Politics created the conditions by which the sport proliferated through the capital and the nation; in turn, soccer became an anchor in the political process after the 1912 enactment of universal, compulsory suffrage for all adult male citizens. Soccer clubs, already expanding in number throughout the country, became focal points for the construction of power bases for aspiring politicians. The dynamic processes that contributed to the development of modern Argentinian national identity molded and were molded by soccer’s evolution from a wholly British enterprise into a multiethnic national pastime. Through an evaluation of newspapers from the period as well as official publications from the various soccer federations of the sport’s early years, this paper builds upon previous studies that have evaluated facets of this subject to illuminate the inextricable push-pull factors linking soccer, immigration, and politics as essential elements in the formation of patriotic sociocultural identity through the second presidency of Hipólito Yrigoyen and the end of the amateur era in 1931.Download Free PDFView PDFHOW TO MAKE A FOREIGN IDEA YOUR OWN: ARGENTINE IDENTITY AND THE ROLE SOCCER PLAYED IN ITS FORMATIONBrandon BlakesleeAll ideas come from somewhere else. We get inspiration from a single source or several external sources and then seek to make that idea our own. But when does that idea cease to be someone else's and become ours. My master's thesis looked to trace the adoption of soccer in Argentina to explore that question.

While historians have touched on all three sports in the American sporting context, there is a historical myopia once the sports were supplanted by American inventions or adaptations that literally writes them out of the sporting landscape and historians continue to distort the actual histories of these three sports. I suggest an eight point explanatory model for the relative failures of British team sports to become enduring “national pastimes” beyond moments of initial interest and expansion. The model includes historians’ failure to fully address the role of these sports in American history and society as this effects our current perceptions and explanations of histories of sports in the United States: 1. American independence and manifest destiny. There was a reluctance to accept rules generated and controlled from another country. Additionally, in cricket, most American teams played 22 players against international teams in deference to the superiority of the game in England and Australia. While international matches helped sustained cricket and soccer, it also limited their appeal at the same time. 2. Adapation. In cricket, soccer, and rugby, many early adherents adapted their skills or playing focus to newer sporting forms of baseball and American football. 3. National memory and nationalism. All three sports suffered for many decades without collective national memories sustaining them, though cricket succeeded for a time and, more recently, soccer has begun to appear in the pantheon of American sporting collective memory. 4. Organization. At various times and for various reasons leaders of British team sports organizations failed to work together to create strong American organizations for their sport or to establish American based rule making bodies. 5. Amateurism versus Professionalism. Cricket and rugby both embraced amateurism. Even when professionals used in cricket they failed to dominate the game. Soccer had mixed fortunes and took many years to resolve the amateur/professional divide. 6. Playing cultures. Cultures in and around British team sports promoted British ways of playing and socializing that had an effect on how Americans engaged with them. 7. Ethnicity versus the Melting Pot. Each sport was readily identified with Britishness and with British immigrant communities even though none of the sports remained exclusively British. The sports did, however, promote ties to Great Britain and to British culture and created space where ethnic affiliations could be “lived out” on the sports field. 8. Historians’ interests and comparative neglect (including the framing of “exceptionalism” in the American sporting landscape): As much of the writing of sports history in the USA has sought national narratives and to explain success of American sports, the historical record of these sports (and others) remains incomplete and, at times, inaccurate.
