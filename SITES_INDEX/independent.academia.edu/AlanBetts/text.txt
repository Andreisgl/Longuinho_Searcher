The PBCM unifies the clear-sky and shallow convection boundary layer regimes by obtaining mixed-layer growth, cloud fraction, and convective inhibition from a single parameterization based on physical principles. The evolution of the shallow convection PBCM is based on the statistical distribution of the surface thermodynamic state of convective plumes. The entrainment velocity of the mixed layer is related to the mass flux of the updrafts overshooting the dry inversion capping the mixed layer. The updrafts overcoming the convective inhibition generate active cloud-base mass flux, which is the boundary condition for the shallow cumulus scheme. The subcloud-layer entrainment velocity is directly coupled to the cloud-base mass flux through the distribution of vertical velocity and fractional cover of the updrafts. Comparisons of the PBCM against large-...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its capacity to reproduce the triggering of deep convection over land is analyzed in detail. The model accurately reproduces the timing of shallow convection and of deep convection onset over land, which is a major issue in many current general climate models. PPM is based on a distribution of plumes with varying thermodynamic states (potential temperature and specific humidity) induced by surface-layer turbulence. Precipitation is computed by a simple ice microphysics, and with the onset of precipitation, downdrafts are initiated and lateral entrainment of environmental air into updrafts is reduced. The most buoyant updrafts are responsible for the triggering of moist convection, causing the rapid growth of clouds and precipitation. Organization of turbulence in the subcloud layer is induced by unsaturated downdrafts, and the ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Betts-Miller SchemeThe Representation of Cumulus Convection in Numerical Models,  1993The impetus for the development of this simple lagged convective adjustment scheme came from the ... more The impetus for the development of this simple lagged convective adjustment scheme came from the series of tropical field experiments in the decade 1969–79 [VIMHEX, the Venezuela International Meteorological the Hydrological Experiment in 1969 and 1972; GATE, the GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program) Atlantic Tropical Experiment in 1974, and MONEX, the Monsoon Experiment in 1979]. Deep convection is the dominant vertical transport process in the tropics. In conjunction with the radiation field and the subsiding branches of the tropical circulations, convective processes maintain a vertical thermal structure, which is quite close to the moist adiabat through the equivalent potential temperature θ e of the subcloud layer in the regions of deep convection. This was the basis of early cumulus parameterization schemes. Manabe (1965) proposed adjustment toward a moist-adiabatic structure to remove conditional instability in large-scale models. Kuo (1965, 1974) proposed a simple cloud model for deep convection that adjusted the atmosphere toward the saturated moist pseudoadiabat in the presence of grid-scale moist convergence. However, the mean tropical atmosphere is always cooler by several degrees in the middle troposphere than this reference moist adiabat, even in regions of vigorous convection (see Figs. 9.5–9.7). At the same time, the deep convective transports also maintain the water vapor and cloud distributions in the tropics, which in turn play a crucial role in the radiative fluxes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
