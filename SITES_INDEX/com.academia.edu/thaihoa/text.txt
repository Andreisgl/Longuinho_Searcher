Our focus is on ASP.NET, the web application framework developed by Microsoft that powers 25% of all Internet web sites. We show that attackers can abuse multiple cryptographic design flaws to compromise ASP.NET web applications.

Based on the polar predistortion polynomial representation, the recursive relations are derived to formulate the suitable RLS procedure. Two other RLS-based structures are also proposed: the simplified RLS for low complexity and the cascaded RLS for faster convergence. Their complexity and performance in terms of convergence rate and out-of-band power emission are discussed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The wurtzite crystal structure of the nanoneedle relaxes the strict nonlinear selection rules of normal zincblende GaAs while maintaining its strong nonlinear optical coefficients. The ability to grow GaAs nanoneedles without catalysts on (111) Si makes them particularly attractive as nonlinear optoelectronic media compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Four coatings were then selected for further study under various conditions of storage including ambient (19–22C and56–60% RH) and simulated commercial (12C and 80% RH) storage. The four coating formulations contained carnauba wax, shellac, zein, and/or cellulose derivatives. All coatings reduced the respiratory rate, the development of external and internal color, and all but carnauba wax retarded the loss of firmness. Changes in acids were also delayed in all coated mangoes. Based on these parameters, fruit maturation was estimated to have been delayed by a few days compared with uncoated fruit. Shellac and cellulose-based coatings, however, caused elevated levels of ethanol, although this did not lead to significant flavor differences from the control (uncoated fruit) in sensory tests. Only the carnauba wax coating was an effective water loss barrier under conditions of high RH.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
