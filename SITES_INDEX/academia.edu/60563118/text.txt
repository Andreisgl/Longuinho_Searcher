Examining how independent musicians make a living todayHolger Schwetter"The digital era has brought major changes to the music business, on the production side as well as to matters of distribution. Both illegal and legal platforms were created which are being used for free-of-charge music distribution. A debate has been going on about the practical and theoretical implications of the development of digital cultural markets and on the relationships between making money and giving things away for free. The debate either focuses on the situation of the user or on the future of the music in- dustry. In both cases the musician is being thought of as a subset of one of those groups. This does not at all do justice to the position of the musicians. My study focuses on the situation of independent musicians in popular culture and their use of Free Culture licenses compared to traditional copyright use. “Independent musician” here means those who compose their own music and distribute it by means of self- management. Potentially they are deeply influenced by the developments on the digital market; yet only a few studies examine their situation. In this article I'll give a brief description of the current state of research and debate and I will present my approach to examining the situation of musicians today in the course of my PhD project. This includes some initial hypothesis. Furthermore I'll integrate some first hints to possible results from the research I am presently undertaking for this study."Download Free PDFView PDFSites of sound: recording studios and the musical economyAndrew LeyshonBackground This is a summary report of on-going research into the UK music industry conducted at the University of Nottingham. It is part of a broader study which is considering the implications for copyright-based economic activities in an era of digital reproduction and distribution. The focus of the study is the musical economy which in recent years has been subject to a significant crisis of reproduction which has been exacerbated by the advent of Internet 'piracy'(Leyshon et al., 2005).Download Free PDFView PDFThe Artful EconomistThe Composer in the Market Place Revisited: The Economics of Music Composition TodayDavid  ThrosbyDownload Free PDFView PDFGrowth and ChangeA Creative Industry in Transition: The Rise of Digitally Driven Independent Music Production2012 • Brian  HracsDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Music Industry in the Digital Era: Toward New ContractsFrançois MoreauDigital piracy, although negatively altering the recorded music market, has a positive impact on other segments of the music market, such as live music or ancillary goods, because it generates a positive externality benefiting those activities. Through a 2-player strategic game between a record company and an artist, this study shows that a renegotiation of music contracts could allow the internalizing of this positive externality, while being welfare-improving for both record companies and artists. This study also shows, however, that pervasive piracy is not desirable for an artist. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, digital piracy explains most, if not all, of the 10% annual average drop in the number of CDs sold in the United States over the 2000 to 2007 period. 1 Record companies, as well as some artists, claim that music file sharing on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks generates a replacement effect (free music downloads and CDs are substitutes) and point out the concomitance of the decline in recorded music sales and the growing number of broadband Internet subscribers and music file sharers. As a result, following pioneer works on software piracy (Conner & Rumelt, 1991), music piracy has become a specific topic for economists, who mainly focus on comparing, both theoretically and empirically, the negative effect of piracy on music sales with two potential positive effects: a network effect, increasing legal demand for a widely pirated product; and, above all, a sampling effect, prompting some consumers to purchase a legal copy of a product they already get for free in a low-quality pirated version. The positive effects of piracy and of the digitization of music, in general, are either partial, when favoring emerging artists to the detriment of " stars "Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Music Business Research Vol 4 No 1 2015Dennis Collopy, Martin Lücke, Fangjun LiThis focuses on the German music market.
