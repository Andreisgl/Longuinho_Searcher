Five field cells (including one control) were constructed and equipped with mechanisms for collecting vertical water infiltration and surface runoff. The five cells included: (C1) Control cell; (C2) 5 wt % limestone amendment; (C3) 10 wt % limestone amendment; (C4) 5 wt % half ordinary Portland cement and half fly ash amendment; and (C5) 5 wt % ordinary Portland cement amendment. The control cell showed an acidic behavior (pH &lt; 4.5) with variable concentrations of Fe, Al, Zn, and Cu. The amendments were used to neutralize the acidic leachates and decrease dissolved metal concentrations. Leachates from surface runoff samples of amended cells were less loaded with metals compared to samples of vertical infiltration. All amendment formulations increased th...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They are the primary raw material for phosphoric acid and fertilizers used in agriculture, and are increasingly considered to be a potential source of rare earth elements. Phosphate rocks occur either as sedimentary deposits or igneous ores associated with alkaline rocks. In both cases, the genesis of high-grade phosphate rocks results from complex concentration mechanisms involving several (bio)geochemical processes. Some of these ore-forming processes remain poorly understood and subject to scientific debate. Morocco holds the world’s largest deposits of sedimentary phosphate rocks, and also possesses several alkaline complexes with the potential to bear igneous phosphate ores that are still largely underexplored. This paper summarizes the main geological features and driving processes of sedimentary and igneous phosphates, and discusses their global reserve/resource situation.

Here, we aimed to stabilize acid-generated mine tailings using several alkaline and cementitious amendments, which were tested in columns for 361 days. The alkaline amendments consisted of 10 and 20 wt.% limestone, while the cementitious amendments consisted of different binders at a total dosage of 5 wt.% binder. The different formulations for the cementitious amendments were: 50% Kruger fly ash and 50% class F fly ash; 20% ordinary Portland cement, 40% Kruger fly ash, and 40% class F fly ash; 80% ordinary Portland cement and 20% Kruger fly ash; and 20% ordinary Portland cement, 40% Kruger fly ash, and 40% fly ash. Kinetic testing on the amendment formulations showed that the pH values increased from &lt;2.5 to circumneutral values (~7.5). The mobility of various chemical species was greatly reduced. Cumulative Fe released from the unamended tailings was ~342.5 mg/kg, and was &lt;22 mg/kg for the amended tailings.

These wastes are generally surface landfilled, leading to significant environmental impacts and a large footprint. The current practices of phosphate waste management, the typology of the waste streams and their characteristics, and finally their potential applications are reviewed. All the waste streams generated during the life cycle of phosphoric acid production going from the extraction of phosphate rock to its enrichment and transformation are considered. Great circularity opportunities have been identified and they aim (i) to recover the residual phosphorus and other critical minerals and metals, and (ii) to consider phosphate wastes as alternative resources in the civil engineering and building sectors. The purpose is to shift from linear thinking to circular thinking where synergy between different mining and other industries is highly encouraged. By doing so, opportunities to safeguard na...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Osisko urban lake located in Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec, Canada) was used partially as a waste disposal facility for many decades, causing a heavy pollution. The main undertakings of this study are (i) assessing the mineralogical and geochemical properties of lake Osisko sediments, and (ii) studying the pollution that occurred within lake water due to the sediments’ reactivity. Water and sediments across the lake were collected in different sensitive locations. Within the sediment samples, two parts were distinguished: a small layer of black vase over grey sediments. The black vase resembled organic matter while the gray sediment seemed close to clean lake sediments. The collected samples were characterized for their physical (particle size distribution, specific gravity and specific surface area), chemical (minor and major elements as well as total sulfur an...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
