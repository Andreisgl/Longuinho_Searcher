All eligible workers were offered enrollment from June 15–December 30, 2020, and annually, then followed for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) through: 1) self-reporting to study nurses, 2) sentinel surveillance at health posts, and 3) absenteeism. Workers with ILI submitted nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 testing, then completed surveys at days 0, 7, and 28. Through October 10, 2021, 1,833 workers developed 169 ILIs (12.0/100 person-years) and 43 (25.4%) of these ILIs were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (3.1/100 person-years). Workers with SARS-CoV-2-positive ILI reported more anosmia (p&lt;0.01), dysgeusia (p&lt;0.01), difficulty concentrating (p=0.01), and irritability (p=0.01), and greater clinical and well-being severity scores (Flu-iiQ) than test-negative ILIs; they also had greater absenteeism (p&lt;0.01) and lost income...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Guatemala is one of the few LMICs where HTPs are available. This study examined prevalence and correlates of HTP awareness, susceptibility and use among adolescents in Guatemala.Design, setting and participantsA cross-sectional survey on HTP awareness, susceptibility and use was conducted among 2870 students between the ages of 13 and 17 in private schools in Guatemala City, Guatemala.Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe primary outcome was susceptibility to future use of HTP among school-aged current and never smokers in Guatemala. We also explored awareness and use of HTPs. Multivariate binomial regression models were used to explore associations between these outcomes and both sociodemographic factors and established smoking correlates.ResultsOf all students (n=2870), about half were awa...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Effects of tobacco product type and characteristics on appeal and perceived harm: Results from a discrete choice experiment among Guatemalan adolescentsby Jose Monzon and Sophia MusArticle,  2021Guatemala is one of the few countries where both heated tobacco products (HTPs) and electronic ci... more Guatemala is one of the few countries where both heated tobacco products (HTPs) and electronic cigarettes (ecigarettes)remain unregulated. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to 2038 high schoolstudents to assess how tobacco product attributes influence their appeal among Guatemalan adolescents. Participantswere randomly assigned to evaluate 4 of 32 contrasting sets, each containing 3 packs (1 of each producttype). Experimental manipulations included: product type, brand, nicotine content and flavor. Participants thenindicated which product they were most and least interested in trying and would be most and least harmful totheir health. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of product characteristics onchoice. Product type accounted for almost 90% of variation in choices. Respondents were less interested in tryingHTPs (B = 􀀀 0.93; p < 0.001) and viewed them as more harmful (B = 2.77; p < 0.001) compared to cigarettes.They were more interested in trying e-cigarettes (B = 1.22; p < 0.001), which were also perceived as less harmful(B = 􀀀 1.47; p < 0.001) compared to cigarettes. Products without nicotine were of more interest for trying (B =0.14; p < 0.001) and perceived as more harmful (B = 0.20; p < 0.001) than those with. Students were moreinterested in trying a flavor compared to regular tobacco and among the flavors, berry was the highest rated one(B = 0.28; p < 0.001). Finally, in this country with weak tobacco control, e-cigarettes appear to be moreappealing and perceived as less harmful than HTPs and cigarettes. Packaging and flavoring regulations are urgentlyneeded on these products as they are a marketing strategy targeting adolescentsSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Due to issues related to poor enforcement, scant data is currently available from low/ middle income countries on the long-term compliance to smoke-free laws. In 2006, high levels of secondhand smoke (SHS) were found in bars and restaurants in Guatemala City. Six months after a smoking ban was implemented in 2009, levels significantly decreased. However, in 2010, poor law compliance was observed. Therefore, we sought to assess long-term compliance to the ban using SHS measurements.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, given the way universities and the health care system are structured, it lacksan environment that fosters research careers and generates the required knowledge to implement sound public health policies and clinical strategies.The RFP was implemented at the Cardiovascular Unit of Guatemala.INTERVENTION: This 4-year Program recruited two one-year fellows and provided funding to define a research topic, write a protocol and implementthe research. Strong emphasis is placed on developing skills in knowledge translation and exchange to bridge the “know–do” gap. Close mentoringrelationships between the Principal Investigator and former and current fellows are fostered through the Program.OUTCOMES: The mentoring Program has generated strategic data to support the implementation of sound chronic disease control strategies, mainlyrelated to tobacco control. Results have been presented nationally and internationally. Research training has included principles of biostatistics andepidemiology, and a journal club. The Program is increasingly generating interest among medical graduates to pursue further research training abroadand is building local research capacity. Fellows and research assistants have created a research network in Guatemala and abroad. The main obstacle theProgram faces is ensuring long-term sustainability.CONCLUSIONS: A mentoring program can lead to an increase in research interest and capacity in a low-income country with little researchinfrastructure.KEY WORDS: Developing countries; chronic disease; capacity buildingSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

De no abordarse de manera urgente, para el año 2030 podría llegar a matar a 8 millones de personas anualmente, 80% de estas muertes ocurriendo en países de mediano/bajo ingreso. Los datos sobre la prevalencia de tabaquismo en Guatemala son escasos. Según la " Encuesta Global del Tabaco " en el 2008, en los primeros grados de secundaria hay una prevalencia de tabaquismo de 19.7% para hombres y 13.3% para mujeres.

Abstract According to the World Health Organization (WHO), smoking is a major cause of chronic disease and the leading cause of preventable death globally. If not addressed urgently, 2030 might get to kill 8 million people annually, 80% of these deaths occurring in middle / low income countries. Data on smoking prevalence are scarce in Guatemala. According to "Global Survey of Tobacco" in 2008, in the early grades of school is a smoking prevalence of 19.7% for men and 13.3% for women.
