Both of these phenomena occurred while a significant warming took place in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), thus sparking a debate on whether the warming is a consequence of natural climate variations, anthropogenic forcing, or both; and if both, what their relative roles are. Here models and observations are used to detect and attribute long-term (multidecadal) twentieth-century North Atlantic (NA) SST changes to their anthropogenic and natural causes. A suite of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) twentieth-century (C20C) coupled model simulations with multiple ensemble members and a signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function analysis are used to identify a model-based estimate of the forced, anthropogenic component in NA SST variability.

To identify key sources of predictability and determine the role of upper and deeper ocean data assimilation, we first conduct a series of perfect model experiments. These experiments reveal the importance of upper ocean temperature and salinity assimilation in reducing sea surface temperature biases. However, to reduce biases in the sea surface height, data assimilation below 300 m in the ocean is necessary, in particular for high-latitude regions. The perfect model experiments clearly emphasize the key role of combined three-dimensional ocean temperature and salinity assimilation in reproducing mean state and model trajectories. Applying this knowledge to the realistic decadal climate prediction system, we conducted an ensemble of ocean assimilation simulations with the fully coupled CESM covering the period 1960–2014.

Over the past decades, the research about ENSO prediction and predictability has attracted broad attention. With the development of coupled models, the improvement in initialization schemes and the progress in theoretical studies, ENSO has become the most predictable climate mode at the time scales from months to seasons. This paper reviews in detail the progress in ENSO predictions and predictability studies achieved in recent years. An emphasis is placed on two fundamental issues: the improvement in practical prediction skills and progress in the theoretical study of the intrinsic predictability limit. The former includes progress in the couple models, data assimilations, ensemble predictions and so on, and the latter focuses on efforts in the study of the optimal error growth and in the estimate of the intrinsic predictability limit.Save to LibraryDownloadby Youmin  Tang•  5  Environmental Science, Climatology, Science, PredictabilityMultiyear Predictions of North Atlantic Hurricane Frequency: Promise and LimitationsRetrospective predictions of multiyear North Atlantic Ocean hurricane frequency are explored by applying a hybrid statistical–dynamical forecast system to initialized and noninitialized multiyear forecasts of tropical Atlantic and... moreRetrospective predictions of multiyear North Atlantic Ocean hurricane frequency are explored by applying a hybrid statistical–dynamical forecast system to initialized and noninitialized multiyear forecasts of tropical Atlantic and tropical-mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from two global climate model forecast systems.

External forcing influences the predictions throughout, but their contributions to predictive skill become dominant after most of the improved skill from initialization with observations vanishes after about 6–9 years. Recent multimodel results suggest that there is relatively more decadal predictive skill in the North Atlantic, western Pacific, and Indian Oceans than in other regions of the world oceans. Aspects of decadal variability of SSTs, like the mid-1970s shift in the Pacific, the mid-1990s shift in the northern North Atlantic and western Pacific, and the early-2000s hiatus, are better represented in initialized hindcasts compared to uninitialized simulations.

External forcings like the addition of anthropoghenic carbon dioxid into the climate system as well as internal feedbacks within the climate system contribute this variability. To understand the variability and to predict its changes is a major scientific field of research and in the interest of many users. For the time frame up to a hundred years ahead the IPCC performs climate projections to estimate the effects of the changing forced boundary conditions due to the anthropogenic green-house gas emissions on the climate trends. For the short time-scales the numerical weather prediction is well established. Such predictions based on initial conditions have been extended to seasonal scales in the last two decades. In between these time frames emerges a new research field of the decadal predictions, which is located in the transition between the initial value and the forced boundary condition problem.

Descriptions of these three different approaches, as well as their respective skill, are available in the peer-reviewed literature, but because these various studies are sufficiently different in their details (e.g., period covered, metric used to compute the skill, measure of hurricane activity), it is nearly impossible to compare them. Using the latest decadal reforecasts currently available, we present a direct comparison of these three multiannual forecasting techniques with a combination of simple statistical models, with the hope of offering a perspective on the current state-of-the-art research in this field and the skill level currently reached by these forecasts.

In addition to this, multidecadal sea surface temperature (SST) variations of internal origin exist. Evidence suggests that the North Atlantic Ocean exhibits the strongest multidecadal SST variations and that these variations are connected to the overturning circulation. This work investigates the extent to which these internal multidecadal variations have contributed to enhancing or diminishing the trend induced by the external radiative forcing, globally and in the North Atlantic. A model study is carried out wherein the analyses of a long control simulation with constant radiative forcing at preindustrial level and of an ensemble of simulations with historical forcing from 1850 until 2005 are combined. First, it is noted that global SST trends calculated from the different historical simulations are similar, while there is a large disagreement between the North Atlantic SST trends.

These phenomena produce a myriad of impacts on society and the environment on seasonal, interannual, and longer time scales through variability manifest as coherent fluctuations in ocean and land temperature, rainfall, and extreme events. Improved understanding of this variability is essential for assessing the likely range of future climate fluctuations and the extent to which they may be predictable, as well as understanding the potential impact of human-induced climate change.

Here both synthetic time series and the historical simulations from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5) are used to examine several methods of performing this separation. Linear detrending, as is commonly used in studies of low-frequency climate variability, is found to introduce large biases in both amplitude and phase of the estimated internal variability. Using estimates of the forced signal obtained from ensembles of climate simulations can reduce these biases, particularly when the forced signal is scaled to match the historical time series of each ensemble member. These so-called scaling methods also provide estimates of model sensitivities to different types of external forcing. Applying the methods to observations of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation leads to different estimates of the phase...Save to LibraryDownloadby Leela Frankcombe•  4  Environmental Science, Oceanography, Climate, Atmospheric sciencesDecadal Climate Variability, Predictability and Prediction: Opportunities and ChallengesSave to LibraryDownloadby Richard Seager•  4  Geography, Climatology, Climate variability, PredictabilityAnalysis of Existing Weather and Climate Information for MalawiSave to LibraryDownloadby David Mkwambisi•  2  Environmental Science, Climate ChangeInter-annual variability of precipitation over Southern Mexico and Central America and its relationship to sea surface temperature from a set of future projections from CMIP5 GCMs and RegCM4 CORDEX simulationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Erika Coppola•  6  Environmental Science, Oceanography, Climatology, Climate DynamicsA Linear Inverse Model of Tropical and South Pacific Seasonal PredictabilityA multivariate linear inverse model (LIM) is developed to demonstrate the mechanisms and seasonal predictability of the dominant modes of variability from the tropical and South Pacific Oceans.

We construct a LIM whose covariance matrix is a combination of principal components derived from tropical and extra-tropical sea surface temperature, and South Pacific Ocean vertically-averaged temperature anomalies. Eigen-decomposition of the linear deterministic system yields stationary and/or propagating eigenmodes, of which the least damped modes resemble the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the South Pacific Decadal Oscillation (SPDO). We show that although the oscillatory periods of ENSO and SPDO are distinct, they have very close damping time scales, indicating the predictive skill of the surface ENSO and SPDO is comparable. The most damped noise modes occur in the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, reflecting atmospheric eastward-propagating Rossby wave train variability.
