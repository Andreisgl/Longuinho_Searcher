The eta mesons are reconstructed through their eta--> \gamma\gamma channel for the three colliding systems as well as through the eta-->pi^0 pi+ pi- decay mode in p+p and d+Au collisions. The nuclear modification factor in d+Au collisions, R_dAu(p_T~1.0-1.1, suggests at most only modest p_T broadening ("Cronin enhancement"). In central Au+Au reactions, the eta yields are significantly suppressed, with R_AuAu(pT)~0.2. The ratio of eta to pi^0 yields is approximately constant as a function of p_T for the three colliding systems in agreement with the high-p_T world average of R_eta/pi^0 \approx 0.5 in hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions for a wide range of center-of-mass energies [sqrt(s_NN)~3-1800 GeV] as well as, for high scaled momentum x_p, in e+e- annihilations at sqrt(s)=91.2 GeV. These results are consistent with a scenario where high-p_T eta production in nuclear collisions at RHIC is largely unaffected by initial-state effects, but where light-quark mesons (pi^0;eta) are equally suppressed due to final-state interactions of the parent partons in the dense medium produced in Au+Au reactions.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review C  …High transverse momentum η meson production in p+ p, d+ Au, and Au+ Au collisions at sqrt [s_ {NN}]= 200 GeV2006 • Jang NaraDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CHeavy-quark production in p + p and energy loss and flow of heavy quarks in Au + Au collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=200 GeV2011 • Walter Sondheim, T.

The invariant transverse momentum spectra measured in different decay modes give consistent results. Measurements in the hadronic decay channel in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions show that ω production has a suppression pattern at high transverse momentum, similar to that of π0 and η in central collisions, but no suppression is observed in peripheral collisions. The nuclear modification factors, RAA, are consistent in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at similar numbers of participant nucleons.Download Free PDFView PDFProduction of omega mesons in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu, and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV2011 • Christopher OakleyDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CCentrality dependence of low-momentum direct-photon production in Au + Au collisions at s N N = 200   GeV2015 • I. TserruyaDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CSystem-size dependence of open-heavy-flavor production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeVSteven  SkutnikThe PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured open heavy flavor production in Cu$+$Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV through the measurement of electrons at midrapidity that originate from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons. In peripheral Cu$+$Cu collisions an enhanced production of electrons is observed relative to $p$$+$$p$ collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. In the transverse momentum range from 1 to 5 GeV/$c$ the nuclear modification factor is $R_{AA}$$\sim$1.4. As the system size increases to more central Cu$+$Cu collisions, the enhancement gradually disappears and turns into a suppression. For $p_T&gt;3$ GeV/$c$, the suppression reaches $R_{AA}$$\sim$0.8 in the most central collisions. The $p_T$ and centrality dependence of $R_{AA}$ in Cu$+$Cu collisions agree quantitatively with $R_{AA}$ in $d+$Au and Au$+$Au collisions, if compared at similar number of participating nucleons $\langle N_{\rm part} \rangle$.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
