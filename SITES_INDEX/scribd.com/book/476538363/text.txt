The volume is made up of 16 short stories; each story is like a small but sharp painting of various characters. The faces in these paintings look very familiar, like someone you know, or someone hiding deep inside you. An inescapable loneliness of people in the modern world is the main topic of the stories by Pachyan.
This book was published with the support of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Armenia under the “Armenian Literature in Translation” Program.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextGeneral FictionLiterary FictionShort StoriesLanguageEnglishPublisherGlagoslav PublicationsRelease dateJun 8, 2020ISBN9781912894772Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleAPAuthorAram PachyanAram Pachyan is an acclaimed writer from the new generation, who writes fiction and non-fiction, and has won several awards and prizes, including the honorable Presidential Prize for Literature in Armenia.

Thank you for purchasing this book Glagoslav Publications Catalogue ROBINSON I opened the envelope – it was my beloved Friday. Hello, my master, I am writing to you from the city of Nantes. After an exhausting journey I have stopped at a comfortable hotel. I had an argument with the staff in the evening because they were stubbornly refusing to take this letter, saying that the era of letters in envelopes was behind us, people only send letters through the internet these days. But, with the stubbornness characteristic of my tribe, I forced them to take the letter and put some money in each of their pockets. I have no good news, master. I stopped at many islands on my journey, one of which seemed so familiar to me that tears started flowing from my eyes, but I later realized that this was simply a case of déjà vu. There was no sign of vegetation left on the island, not even the yellow sand. I was walking on white hot asphalt, burning my feet. There were factories all around me making terrifying noises, there were no parrots or goats – I came across no animals in any case, not even a mosquito. I was thirsty and looked for gushing springs, but it was all in vain. Master, I was in for a surprise. I stood in front of a café that was called Robinson. I sat down and ordered some water, but they refused to serve me. They said, We are running out of water on the island and if you’re not a factory employee, you have no right to ask for drinking water. Besides, everyone must smile on this island – this is a mandatory requirement. If you don’t obey this law, you will be subjected to terrible punishment. What do you mean? I was surprised. I mean that, if you don’t smile, the corners of your mouth will be sewn with surgical thread to the lobes of your ears. A stupid smile appeared immediately on my face, master. The fear I felt caused me pain. I sat for a while in the café and realized that the bartender was being nice to me. When there were fewer customers left, he brought me a waterlike liquid. I put money in his pocket and expressed my gratitude. I left that island with a heavy heart and then landed in many other islands that did not differ from each other – there were people everywhere that were waging a war against sorrow, but the most terrifying thing was the noise to which they were now accustomed, and they slept soundly even though it went all the way up to space. There is nowhere in the world where I can make a ship and come for you; I know that you have been waiting impatiently for years in the belief that I will tap on your window one day. I have not lost hope yet. I’m going to leave for Canada from here where I will look for a tree to make a barka. But master, even if I manage to make one, have you thought about the direction in which we need to point our compass, what we need to do, where we need to search for the island? These are worrying questions; I pray every day for you to find peace. Master, I hope the time when we meet is near, please keep the necessary trunks ready. With love, Yours, Friday. I dipped my pen into the inkwell and wrote a letter in response. Dearest Friday, I felt unbounded joy when I saw your slanted handwriting – emotional, worrying about me. I am also searching for the island in my room full of books in Yerevan, under the plaster, between the covers, in my hair. I drink a washing soda solution at dawn, throw up, use the tip of my pen to poke at porridge and the fresh excreta of my family members, but the island is not there, as if it never existed. How ungrateful I had been when I was complaining of my solitude and cursing that magnificent island, where my good fortune had given me refuge… ¹ In my dreams I come close to that familiar shore, but when I step into that sand, I leap out of bed with fever, I see Jesus and wildly tear his belly, pulling out his intestines, but I cannot find the island. Then, drained by my powerlessness, I cut my skin with a knife and my nerves flutter like sails in the wind. But where is the island? The island is not here either. I look in the mirror and think that perhaps this is the island, without trees or shores, without the sea or wind. Dear Friday, I am suffering from a strange disease. My hands are growing shorter and it is becoming difficult for me to write these lines. Perhaps this is endocrine in nature, or a case of visual schizophrenia. I’m shrinking. When I returned home, everyone was happy. Two days later, they gave me a mobile phone, a black suit, and sent me to work in an office. The phone kept ringing without interruptions. It got to me and I switched it off, then threw it under a fireproof drawer so that I would not hear its noise, but I got a scolding at home for doing this. The whole world is looking for you, irresponsible creature, my father shouted, You have no right to switch off your mobile phone. I’m in no condition to answer all these calls, I protested to my father. Nobody cares about the condition you’re in, he stormed, People are looking for you. I’m not used to all this yet. I need time. I want to be alone sometimes because I miss the island. What island? Your boss came over last evening and said that you hadn’t shown up for work. Where were you? The city is looking for you, do you understand, you idiot? Father slapped me. If you switch off your phone again, I’ll kill you! Blood flowed from my lip. Where is the island? I asked. He put a finger on his temple and screamed. It’s in here, in here! I walked up to him and examined his head carefully. My father’s fist landed on my jaw and I felt a pleasant pain. Perhaps this blow will dispatch me to the island, I thought. Dearest Friday, Jesus and I stand near the window every day, waiting for the ripples caused by your boat… And by the way, it makes no difference whether it is a large boat or a small one… ² I embrace you warmly. Hurry!" ³ The room where I’ve relocated is similar to a Bible with a worn leather cover, which smells of moisture. This is where I hide my books, there is almost no place to walk except for three intersecting paths, one of which leads to the bed, the other to the window, and the third to the wall, against which leans a crate of bananas. I don’t leave my room for months, trying not to cause any inconvenience to my family members living in the apartment. My books have grown in number so much that there is no longer any place for my feet, I somehow managed to curl up on the windowsill, trying to avoid unnecessary movement; I don’t cough, sneeze or go to the bathroom, I try not to breathe because the pile of books that are stacked up to the ceiling hangs above my head like the sword of Damocles, a small tremor and it will be difficult to pull my body out from that heavy mass. I have quite a large stock of ink and the goosefeather pen is so light that it feels like one of my own fingers. I eat a banana every day and collect the skins, which I use as the pages of my diary. Bananas do not understand Shakespearean language… but they fill my humble belly. I am full of wonder – how is it that the crate of bananas never empties? I meticulously fill out my diary in the silence afforded by the books. March 19. Friday. The boys were using cigarettes to burn the teacher’s nose – this was the last action in the ceremony. They had crucified the teacher on the blackboard. One of them had covered the teacher’s mouth with his palm. The old educator was screaming, her voice filtering through the boy’s fingers and sounding like the whistle of a boiling kettle. The girls were applying make-up to their faces and whispering to each other, their cosmetics strewn on the table. I could not leave the classroom, the door was locked tight. The old teacher was floundering with the jerky movements of a sheep being slaughtered, trying to escape the tongs. The hot breath of the cigarette moved slowly like lava across her nose. Tears were streaming from her eyes. The boys called out to me and asked me to come closer and grab her left leg, which was impudently refusing to behave itself. I did not move from my spot. The cigarette singed the random hairs growing on her nose and touched her skin, filling the room with the smell of cooking meat and the teacher’s indescribable scream. Only newborns scream like that, I thought. The pain gave the old teacher the immense strength she needed to break free from the boys’ grasp, and she chose the window with lightning speed and threw herself out. We saw her lying there, on the sole rock in all that grass, shattered. But, her belief in resurrection allowed her to get up and run away, disappearing in the stream of people on the crowded street. Someone opened the classroom door, I wanted to walk out but a book dropped out from under my coat at that moment… Oh dear… No, no, take a good look at this colorful picture – Robinson, with a gun on his shoulder, his mangy mutt in the river, and a stupid parrot perched on his head. This guy is about to start the tenth grade and here he is, hiding a book about Robinson under his coat, concealing it from us.
