New Tau VMs deliver

                Designed for scale-out workloads
Tau VMs offer a great combination of performance and price
                  for your scale-out workloads including web servers,
                  containerized microservices, media transcoding, and
                  large-scale Java applications.
                Architecture choice
Choose from x86 or Arm-based VMs to meet your workload and
                  business requirements. Tau VMs provide excellent
                  price-performance to test, develop, and run your workloads on
                  the optimal architecture for your workload.
                More savings
Tau VMs are the lowest cost solution for scale-out workloads
                  on Compute Engine, with up to 42% higher
                  price-performance compared to general-purpose VMs of any of
                  the leading public cloud vendors.
                Get more from your containers
Google Kubernetes Engine
                  (GKE) supports Tau VMs, helping you optimize price-performance
                  for your containerized workloads. Run Tau VMs in GKE Autopilot
                  mode for a hands-off experience, or on GKE Standard clusters,
                  where you manage your own nodepools.

                      “The new Tau VM family is an important expansion to Google
                      Cloud’s already comprehensive Compute Engine portfolio
                      designed to drive cost efficiency for large-scale, cloud
                      workloads. Tau VMs deliver on both fronts—an attractive
                      combination of performance and price compared to other
                      leading cloud providers. The initial testing results for
                      Tau VMs demonstrate the ongoing commitment Google has to
                      innovating in scale-out platforms.” - Matt Eastwood,
                      Senior Vice President, Enterprise Infrastructure, Cloud,
                      Developers, and Alliances, IDC
 
 
                      “At OpenX, our ad-exchange services over 200 billion
                      requests every day. Getting the best combination of
                      performance and price from the infrastructure is
                      critically important for us. We use multiple Google
                      Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters across geographic regions
                      with autoscaling to power our ad-delivery components.
                      Running Google Cloud’s Tau VMs with GKE has enabled over
                      40% better price-performance and 62% latency reduction for
                      our application as compared to the prior generation
                      family. We have made the move to Tau VMs for our
                      application to take advantage of these benefits.” - Paul
                      T. Ryan, CTO, OpenX
 
 
                      “At Snap, it is critical for our business to continue
                      improving our scale-out compute infrastructure for key
                      Snapchat capabilities like AR, Lenses, Spotlight and Maps.
                      We were impressed when we tested Google Cloud’s new Tau
                      VMs with Google Kubernetes Engine. While it's early days,
                      we believe we can gain double digits in infrastructure
                      performance improvements for key workloads—enabling us to
                      do more with less and invest even more in new features for
                      our amazing Snapchat community." - Cody Powell, Senior
                      Engineering Manager, Snap Inc.
 
 
                      "For our core application, Google's Tau VMs with Google
                      Kubernetes Engine delivers over 40% better
                      price-performance than Amazon's Graviton-based VMs. 
                      Further, Tau VMs maintain x86 compatibility and eliminate
                      the need to maintain a separate stack for Arm. We are
                      moving our workload from Amazon Web Services to Google
                      Cloud to take advantage of these benefits."  - David
                      Ting, SVP of Engineering, Nylas
 
 
                      “Our core capability at Ascend is bringing together data
                      ingestion, transformation, delivery, orchestration and
                      observability into a single platform.  To operate at
                      scale and keep pace with our telemetry data production
                      rates, high single-threaded performance is critical. 
                      With Google Cloud’s Tau VMs with Google Kubernetes Engine
                      (GKE), we are able to achieve over 125% higher performance
                      than previous generation families. This has completely
                      changed our ability to query historical metrics. Where
                      previously metric queries against historical data over
                      ranges longer than a couple hours were difficult, we can
                      now easily query data ranges of multiple weeks.” - Joe

                      “Momento’s serverless cache enables developers to
                      accelerate database and application performance at scale.
                      Over the past few months, we have become intimately
                      familiar with Google Cloud’s new T2A VMs. We were
                      pleasantly surprised with the ease of portability to Arm
                      instance from day one. The maturity of the T2A platform
                      gives us the confidence to start using these VMs in
                      production. Innovations like T2A VMs in Google Cloud help
                      us continuously innovate on behalf of our customers.” -
