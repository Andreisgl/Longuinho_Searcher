It examines three arguments that have been advanced for thinking that eradication is in some way ethically exceptional as a policy goal. These are (1) global eradication has symbolic importance, (2) disease eradication is a global public good and (3) disease eradication is a form of rescue. It argues that none of these provides a good reason to think that individuals have special duties to facilitate eradication campaigns, or that public health authorities have special permissions to pursue them. But the fact that these arguments fail does not entail that global disease eradication is ethically problematic, or that it should not be undertaken. Global eradication of a disease, if successful, is a way of providing an enormous health benefit that stretches far into the future. There is no need to reach for the idea that there is a special duty to eradicate disease; the same considerations that are in play in ordinary public health policy – of reducing the burden of disease equitably and efficiently – suffice to make global disease eradication a compelling goal where doing so is feasible.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInternational Library of Ethics, Law, and the New MedicineToward Control of Infectious Disease: Ethical Challenges for a Global Effort2008 • Margaret BattinDownload Free PDFView PDFBioethicsEthical Models Underpinning Responses to Threats to Public Health: A Comparison of Approaches to Communicable Disease Control in Europe2008 • Nicola Moran, Sabina GainottiDownload Free PDFView PDFBioethicsEthics and Infectious DISEASE12005 • Ross  UpshurDownload Free PDFView PDFAdvanced Journal of Social ScienceBrief History of Ethics in the Presence of a PandemicCurt AndersonThe current COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong effect on individual liberty versus a consequentialist ideal of the greater good for societal norms. Rather than arguing for the current situation, I have chosen to take a historical approach to address the ethics of dealing with these health situations in the past. Ultimately, I conclude that, while at risk of individual liberty, a rule utilitarian approach, as backed up by epidemiolocal data suggests that a mandate for the greater good is more ethical than a simple approach to individual liberty.Download Free PDFView PDFVaccineThe principles and feasibility of disease eradication2011 • Stephen CochiDownload Free PDFView PDFAmicus curiaeEthical Limits of Pandemic Governance2022 • Nergis CanefeDownload Free PDFView PDFClinicsBioethical principles and values during pandemics2020 • CHIN AN LININTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the greatest threat to public health today. The disease arose at a time when it was widely believed that humankind had only one last frontier to conquer in public health—to master techniques for the definitive treatment of genetic and hereditary diseases, as well as neoplasms and degenerative diseases. The emergence of a new infectious disease, caused by a virus previously believed to be harmless to human beings, generated a global crisis and [...]Download Free PDFView PDFEthical Challenges of International Outbreaks-A Case Study of Ebola Virus DiseaseTexila International Journal, Okafor CNPublic health measures are strictly required to prevent increase in the spread of Ebola virus disease and that includes identifying cases and quarantining persons who are suspected to have come in contact with the disease or its agent. Though quarantine restricts freedom of movement of those affected, the reasons may be justified based on the fact that health of the public needs to be protected. But though the personal rights and liberties of individuals may be expected to be lost in international outbreaks, it should not be totally taken away. There ought to be a balance between preserving individual rights and maintaining public health. Thus a legal and political framework is needed while research for therapy and vaccine are encouraged.Download Free PDFView PDFPublic Health EthicsTowards a normative framework for public health ethics and policy2009 • James WilsonDownload Free PDFView PDFMultiMedia PublishingEthics in the pandemic2020 • Nicolae SfetcuThe largest medical institutions and various ethicists advocate a utilitarian approach in times of public health crises, to maximize benefits for society, in direct conflict with our usual (Kantian) view of respect for people as individuals. A central problem with utilitarianism is that there is no clear way to evaluate moral choices, including in medical decisions. In general, in medicine is respected the Kantian medical ethics. But in a pandemic, when resources are poor, deep choices of life and death must be made. In these situations, the principles of utilitarianism offer the best answer, moving from a patient-centered thinking model to a society-centered thinking model.
