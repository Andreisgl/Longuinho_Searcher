Project Name: Tenaga Nasional Berhad 500kV Transmission System, Phase 1Start Date: August 1993Completion Date: July 1997
Project Description/Services Provided:
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) owns and operates approximately 11,000 km of transmission lines in Malaysia. The main voltage levels currently in use are 275kV, 132kV and 66kV. The 275kV and 132kV lines together form the National Grid, while the 66kV lines, located mainly in the south, are slowly being phased out.
With power demand and generation capacities projected to rise to 35,000MW by the year 2020, and as a part of TNB's plans to expand the existing transmission system towards maintaining a more cost effective, reliable and stable power supply, TNB implemented the 500kV Transmission System complements the existing National Grid.
Ranhill provided comprehensive EPCM, System Studies of transmission network., civil and structural engineering services, mechanicl and electrical engineering services and environmental impact assessment studies.
Phase 1 of the project extended from Port Klang in Selangor to Gurun, Kedah, whilst Phase 1A extended from Pasir Gudang to Yong Peng in Johor. The project comprised construction of four sections of transmission lines covering a total distances of approximately 510km, together with five sub-stations at Port Klang, Bukit Tarek near Rawang, Air Tawar near Lumut and Junjong and Gurun to the north and Yong Peng and Bukit Batu in the south.
Ranhill - BVI Consortium undertook the engineering of the whole the project. In undertaking the project, TNB initiated an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study, although it is not required by the Department of the Environment to do so. The EIA study investigated the impacts of the 500kV Transmission System on the surrounding environment. This effort is in line with TNB's philosophy to ensure environmental protection and conversation in all its projects.
