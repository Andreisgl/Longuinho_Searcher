This page has been adapted from one on the Wikipedia, and still needs further editing, keep this in mind if you are using it for guidance.
Introduction
Wikiquote is a wiki, meaning that anyone can edit with ease any article and have those changes posted immediately. This page is the reference for Wiki markup. You may also want to learn about:

Finally, for a list of all articles about editing Wikipedia, see Category:Wikipedia.
It's very easy to edit a Wiki page.  Just click on the "Edit this page" link at the top or bottom (also on the sidebar) of a Wiki page to change the page itself, or click on "Discuss this page" link and then on "Edit this page" to write on the corresponding talk page. This will bring you to a page with a text box containing the editable text of that Wiki page.
Then type away, write a short edit summary on the small field below the edit-box and when finished press "Save"!  You can also preview your changes before saving if you like. Depending on your system, pressing Enter while the edit box is not active (there is no typing cursor in it) may have the same effect as pressing Save.
Please use a neutral point of view, and please cite your sources so others can check and extend your work.
It is often more convenient to copy and paste the text first into your
favorite text editor, edit and spell check there, and then paste back
into the browser to preview. This way, you can also keep a local backup copy of the pages you authored so that you can make changes offline.
Minor edits
When editing a page, a logged-in user has the option of flagging the edit as a "minor edit". When to use this is somewhat a matter of personal preference. The rule of thumb is that an edit of a page that is spelling corrections, formatting, and minor rearranging of text should be flagged as a "minor edit".  A major edit is basically something that makes the entry worth relooking at for somebody who wants to watch the article rather closely, so any "real" change, even if it is a single word, is a major edit. This feature is important, because users can choose to hide minor edits in their view of the Recent Changes page, to keep the volume of edits down to a manageable level.
The reason for not allowing a user who is not logged in to mark an edit as minor is that vandalism could then be marked as a minor edit, in which case it would stay unnoticed longer. This limitation is another reason to log in.
The wiki markup
In the left column of the table below, you can see what effects are possible. In the right column, you can see how those effects were achieved. In other words, to make text look like it looks in the left column, type it in the format you see in the right column.
You may want to keep this page open in a separate browser window for reference. If you want to try out things without danger of doing any harm, you can do so in the Sandbox.
Sections, paragraphs, lists and lines
What it looks like
What you type
Start your sections with header lines:
New section
Subsection
Sub-subsection
== New section ==
=== Subsection ===
==== Sub-subsection ====
A single newline
has no effect on the layout. 
These can be used to separate
sentences within a paragraph.
Some editors find that this aids editing
and improves the diff function.
But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.
A single [[w:newline]]
has no effect on the layout. 
These can be used to separate
sentences within a paragraph.
Some editors find that this aids editing
and improves the ''diff'' function.
But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.
You can break lines
without starting a new paragraph.
You can break lines<br>
without starting a new paragraph.
Lists are easy to do:
start every line with a star
more stars means deeper levels
* Lists are easy to do:
** start every line with a star
** more stars means deeper levels
Numbered lists are also good
very organized
easy to follow
# Numbered lists are also good
## very organized
## easy to follow
You can even do mixed lists
and nest them
like this
* You can even do mixed lists
*# and nest them
*#* like this
Definition list
list of definitions
item
the item's definition
; Definition list : list

; item : the item's definition
A colon indents a line or paragraph.
A manual newline starts a new paragraph.
This is primarily for displayed material, but is also used for discussion on Talk pages.
: A colon indents a line or paragraph.
A manual newline starts a new paragraph.
IF a line starts with a space THEN
  it will be formatted exactly 
    as typed;
  in a fixed-width font;
  lines won't wrap;
ENDIF
this is useful for:
  * pasting preformatted text;
  * algorithm descriptions;
  * program source code
  * ascii art;
WARNING If you make it wide,
you force the whole page to be wide and
hence less readable. Never start ordinary lines with spaces.

Links, URLs, Images
What it looks like
What you type
The Godfather is a good movie.
First letter of target is automatically capitalized.
Internally spaces are automatically represented as underscores (typing an underscore has the same effect as typing a space, but is not recommended).
Thus the link above is to http://www.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Godfather, which is the article with the name "The Godfather".
[[The Godfather]] is a good movie.
Link to a section on a page, e.g.
Moby-Dick#Epilogue (links to non-existent sections aren't really broken, they are treated as links to the page, i.e. to the top)
[[Moby-Dick#Epilogue]]
Same target, different name ("piped link"): answers.
Same target, different name ("[[Help:Piped link|piped link]]"): 
[[Wikiquote:FAQ|answers]]
Endings are blended into the link: machines, designing
Endings are blended into the link: [[machine]]s, [[design]]ing
Automatically hide stuff in parentheses: The Lord of the Rings.
Automatically hide namespace: Village pump.
The server fills in the part after the | when you save the page. Next time you open the edit box you will see the expanded piped link. A preview interprets the abbreviated form correctly, but does not expand it yet in the edit box. Press Save and again Edit, and you will see the expanded version. The same applies for the following feature.
Automatically hide stuff in parentheses:
[[The Lord of the Rings (movies)|]]. 
Automatically hide namespace: 
[[Wikiquote:Village pump|]].
Link to articles in other wiki projects, like Automobile (Wikipedia), novel (Wiktionary), and Hamlet (Wikisource).

External link: 
[http://www.nupedia.com Nupedia]
Or just give the URL: http://www.nupedia.com.
In the URL all symbols must be among: A-Z a-z 0-9 ._\/~%-+&#?!=()@ \x80-\xFF. If a URL contains a different character it should be converted; for example, ^ has to be written %5E (to be looked up in ASCII).
Or just give the URL: http://www.nupedia.com.
A picture: 
Only images that have been uploaded to English Wikiquote or Wikimedia Commons can be used. To upload images, use the upload page. You can find the uploaded image on the image list. See Wikipedia:Image use policy for many more hints.
A picture: [[Image:Wikiquote-logo-en.png]]
or, with alternate text (strongly encouraged) 
[[Image:Wikiquote-logo-en.png|Wikiquote]] 
Browsers render alternate text when not displaying an image -- for example, when the image isn't loaded, or in a text-only browser, or when spoken aloud. See Alternate text for images for help on choosing alternate text.
Clicking on an uploaded image displays a description page, which you can also link directly to: Image:Wikiquote-logo-en.png
[[:Image:Wikiquote-logo-en.png]]
Similar markups are used for categories:
Plain wiki link categorizes the page under a certain category (see somewhere this page: you find a link to category "Wikiquote"). 
Clicking on a category link leads you to a category page, which you can also link directly in the page elsewhere to: Category:Categories
[[Category:Wikiquote]]
[[:Category:Wikiquote]]
To include links to non-image uploads such as sounds, or to images shown as links instead of drawn on the page, use a "media" link.

Character formatting
What it looks like
What you type
Emphasize, strongly, very strongly.
These are double and triple apostrophes, not double quotes.
''Emphasize'', '''strongly''', 
'''''very strongly'''''.
You can also write italic and bold
if the desired effect is a specific font style
rather than emphasis, as in mathematical formulae:
F = ma
However, the difference between these two methods is not very important for graphical browsers, and many people choose to ignore it.
You can also write <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>
if the desired effect is a specific font style
rather than emphasis, as in mathematical formulas:
:<b>F</b> = <i>m</i><b>a</b>
A typewriter font for technical terms.
A typewriter font for <tt>technical terms</tt>.
You can use small text for captions.
You can use <small>small text</small> for captions.
You can strike out deleted material
and underline new material.
You can <strike>strike out deleted material</strike>
and <u>underline new material</u>.

Subscript: x2
Superscript: x2 or x²
The latter method of superscript can't be used in the most general context, but is preferred when possible (as with units of measurement) because most browsers have an easier time formatting lines with it.

Tables
Placement of the Table of Contents (TOC)
At the current status of the wiki makup language, at least four headers automatically trigger the TOC in front of the first header (or after introductory sections). Adding __TOC__ anywhere in the page forces a TOC for pages with fewer than four headers. Putting __NOTOC__ anywhere forces the TOC to disappear.
HTML tables
HTML tables can be quite useful as well. For details on how to use them and discussion about when they are appropriate, see Wikipedia:How to use tables.
