Several indices involved in multifractal models, i.e., asymmetry, multifractality, and range of singularity, are commonly used to characterize nonlinear properties of multifractal fields. An understanding of how these indices are related to the processes involved in the generation of multifractal fields is essential for multifractal modeling. In this paper, a five-parameter binomial multiplicative cascade model is proposed based on the anisotropic partition processes. Each partition divides the unit set (1-D length or 2-D area) into h equal subsets (segments or subareas) and m1 of them receive d1 (&amp;gt; 0) and m2 receive d2 (&amp;gt; 0) proportion of the mass in the previous subset, respectively, where m1+m2 ≤ h. The model is demonstrated via several examples published in the literature with asymmetrical fractal dimension spectra. This model demonstrates the various properties of asymmetrical multifractal distributions and multifractal indices with explicit functions, thus providing insight into and an understanding of the properties of asymmetrical binomial multifractal distributions.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMultiplicative cascade processes and information integration for predictive mapping2012 • Louise  KelloggAbstract. This paper presents a new model proposed on the basis of multiplicative cascade process (MCP) theory for integrating spatial information to be used for mineral resources prediction and environmental impact assessment. Probability of a spatial point event is defined as the probability that a small map calculating unit (map unit) randomly selected from a study area contains one or more points.Download Free PDFView PDFComputers & GeosciencesA multifractal simulation model for the distribution of VMS deposits in the Spanish segment of the Iberian Pyrite Belt2011 • David Sanderson, Pablo GumielDownload Free PDFView PDFCharacterization of Geochemical Distributions Using Multifractal Models2001 • Mário GonçalvesDownload Free PDFView PDFFractalsA GEOMETRIC PLATONIC APPROACH TO MULTIFRACTALITY AND TURBULENCE1999 • Nelson  ObregonПоиск в библиотеке, Расширенный поиск. ...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geochemical ExplorationMultifractal analysis of geochemical anomalies: A tool for assessing prospectivity at the SE border of the Ossa Morena Zone, Variscan Massif (Spain)2012 • Pablo GumielDownload Free PDFView PDFNonlinear Processes in GeophysicsMulti-scale interactions of geological processes during mineralization: cascade dynamics model and multifractal simulation2011 • Qiuming cheng, Lingqing YaoDownload Free PDFView PDFMukli Nagy Eke Multifractal formalism by enforcing the universal behavior of scaling functions Physica A 2014Mukli PéterDownload Free PDFView PDFA multifractal approach to characterize cumulative rainfall and tillage effects on soil surface micro-topography and to predict depression storage2010 • Jose MirandaDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysica A: Statistical Mechanics and its ApplicationsEmpirical evidences of a common multifractal signature in economic, biological and physical systems2009 • Antonio TurielDownload Free PDFView PDFFractals in petrologyДшэя ChanA fractal (power-law) distribution is the only statistical distribution applicable to a scale-invariant process. One of the major problems in petrology is the distribution of trace elements in the Earth's crust. Extreme values of this distribution result in ore deposits. There is accumulating observational evidence that tonnage-grade statistics of ore deposits are often fractal (power-law). Rayleigh distillation and chromatographic models can explain power-law (fractal) distributions for the extreme values of trace element concentrations. An alternative fractal approach to problems in petrology is to use self-affine fractals. The standard approach is to take a Fourier transform of a continuous signal (an example would be the concentration of a mineral along a linear track). If the Fourier coefficients scale as a power-law of the wavelength, the distribution is a self-affine fractal. Many well logs give this result. Multifractal analyses can also be applied to problems in petrology. DDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
