Welcome to WIKISPORE!
Our wiki is the open space where your ideas can be nurtured and bloom! 
It is created and maintained to empower experiments in wiki-making forms and new content.
The idea was inspired by a recurring theme that came up at the 2019 NYC Wiknic, that expanding partnerships and diversity requires greater flexibility with the starting of new "spore" mini-projects to support new directions for the Wikimedia movement.
 Wikispore Day mini-conference, on #1 anniversary July 19, 2020.Wikispore consists of Spores, which are mini-wikis as sections (like Art Spore) in its own namespace with pages (like Art:Richard Demarco Gallery). Exemplary pages can be awarded a laurel for excellence. 
See more INFO in Frequently Asked Questions and our main Policies & Practices (like Tripod principles).
Join us and become a Wiki farmer! There are few ways to help project thrive or just focus on existing Spore content to take root and develop, maybe even to pollinate ideas for a totally new Spore?!
 To access more features and interact better with the community, we recommend to log-in using your existing Wikimedia account. This works through the magic of OAuth single sign-in *(with any Wikipedia/Wikimedia account). By the way, there is a Meta-Wiki proposal page to launch Wikispore as a full 'sister project' and join the family of Wikimedia projects (like Wikipedia.org, Wikidata.org and others). Please consider to give us your explicit support!
