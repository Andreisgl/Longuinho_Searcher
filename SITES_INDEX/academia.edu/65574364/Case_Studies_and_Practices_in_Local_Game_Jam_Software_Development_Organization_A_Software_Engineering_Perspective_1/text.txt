Different kinds of game creation organizational forms are identified, followed by five field studies of different game development organizational forms that are described and examined. Attention is directed to problems in team-based software development projects as found in game making, such as teamwork processes for computer game software engineering (CGSE), game software requirements engineering, game software design, game making tools, game software reuse, and global CGSE. From these studies and results, it becomes possible to identify and outline eight observations, lessons learned, or learnable lessons for future computer game jam research opportunities that may be appropriate for consideration by game jam organizers, game d...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersResearch Challenges at the Intersection of Computer Games and Software Engineering2015 • Walt ScacchiThis paper provides an overview and review of R&D studies, findings, and practices that identify important problems that constitute an emerging program of future R&D opportunities relevant to established scholars and new students interested in computer games and software engineering (CGSE). This includes examining how computer games may be used to address longstanding, grand challenge problems in software engineering in new ways. The review also examines other challenges in game software requirements engineering, game software design, game software testing, teamwork processes in CGSE, global CGSE, and other closely related areas for CGSE research. From these results, it becomes possible to identify and outline possible areas for future CGSE research opportunities that may be appropriate for consideration by students, scholars, or research agencies seeking to build up scientific and technological capabilities in CGSE research and educational practice.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Future of Research and Challenges in Computer Games and Virtual World EnvironmentsWalt ScacchiDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Future of Research and Challenges in Computer Games and Virtual World Environments (co-authored with Walt Scacchi, Magda El Zarki, et al.)peter krappDownload Free PDFView PDFResearch Investigating Generation-Beyond-Next Computer Game Culture and Technology: A Collaborative Research Partnership between the UCI Game Culture and2008 • Walt Scacchireport documents progress and results obtained from our research study that is investigatingDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Gaming & Virtual WorldsAutonomous eMotorsports racing games: Emerging practices as speculative fictionsWalt ScacchiMotorsports games and simulated automobile racing occupy a dynamic genre of computer games for entertaining play, critical game studies and ‘auto-play’. This article utilizes the lens of speculative design to present six scenarios that seek to motivate the design of autonomous eMotorsports games and play experiences through alternative design fictions. These fictions serve to help identify and tease out how different socio-technical configurations emerging around autonomous vehicles, motorsports games, sim racing user interfaces and user experiences, embrace or exclude different stakeholders. These stakeholders can shape how autonomous eMotorsports games, game play and game viewing will emerge and prosper. These fictions also serve as a narrative web of possible socio-technical configurations open to critical review through: (1) transhumanist spectacle and spectating; (2) technofeminist and gendered framings of these configurations; and (3) whether digital artefacts configured to re...Download Free PDFView PDFLocalizing Global Game Jam: Designing Game Development for Collaborative Learning in the Social ContextShinji R YamaneMaking digital games can help people learn collaboratively. Recent advances in game education allow for experimental game development in a short time period with low cost. To examine the possibilities of game development and learning, we focus on the recent ``game jam'' approach in collaborative game development. The concept of game jam becomes well-known these days, however, its historical development, goals, and strategies have not yet been explored. To bring game jam into the education and learning, we first look at its historical development and key concept referencing Global Game Jam, the biggest annual game jam in the world, and then we discuss the recent case of ``localized'' Global Game Jam--style events embedded in the social context of a specific region.Download Free PDFView PDFResearch for AllSupporting engagement in research through a game design competitionAnne AdamsDigital games are an engaging medium that have previously been used for communicating research to a variety of audiences. However, there is an opportunity for engaging people more deeply by involving them in creating games. This article reports on a game design competition, based on participatory design principles and game jam practices, which challenged university students to design games within the context of a research project. Based on their interpretations of research on human error in health care, teams created four games to be disseminated online to a wider public audience. We outline the competition format and reflect on the extent to which it was successful.Download Free PDFView PDFHandbook of Science and Technology ConvergenceVirtual Meetings2016 • Walt ScacchiDownload Free PDFView PDFLearning Game Design and Software Engineering through a Game Prototyping Experience: A Case Study2016 • Walt ScacchiThis report describes a case study of small-scale effort in employing game playtesting as a starting point for learning about mainstream issues and challenges found in modern software engineering projects and practices. The goal is to be descriptive and informing through a qualitative rendering, rather than prescriptive and quantitative analysis. This study draws attention to the case of where a student with no prior experience in software development or programming must take on the task of learning how to make a game, and along the way learn about many common challenges in modern SE practice through personal discovery and experience. The game itself also imposes challenges in that we have chosen a new, unfamiliar game genre and domain that emphasizes science learning as its purpose for play. Along the way, we discuss issues in requirements, design, prototyping, testing, user experience assessment, and evolutionary software extension, all prior to a formal education in coding or int...Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the 2016 ITiCSE Working Group ReportsUnderstanding the benefits of game jamsMaria Emilia EchevesteDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
