The fundamental change in aesthetic perception engendered by immersion, a perception which is connected to the ideal of total-immersion in virtual space, identifies certain shifts in ontology which are relevant to a better understanding of the human being. This understanding was achieved through a broad inquiry into the histories of Virtual Reality, philosophy, and the visual arts and has lead to the formulation of an aesthetic theory of immersive consciousness indicative of immersive culture. The primary subject of this discourse is immersion then: an experience which will be identified within the dissertation as the indispensable characteristic of Virtual Reality. The understanding of immersion arrived at here will be used to fashion a synchronous theory of art particularly informed by encounters and concepts of immersion into virtuality. To sufficiently address this subject in a scholarly fashion, I have researched, found and accumulated aesthetic and philosophic examples of immersive tendencies, as found within the histories of art and philosophy, which subsequently contributed towards the articulation of what I have come to call immersive consciousness.Download Free PDFView PDFVersejunkies2013 Joseph Nechvatal interview by Edwin Kelly for Versejunkies2013 • Joseph Nechvatal2013 Joseph Nechvatal interview by Edwin Kelly for Versejunkies: the journal of intersemiotic translation 1.2 : a journal dedicated to the theory and practice of translation across mediumsDownload Free PDFView PDFOxford History of Art - After Modern Artsirghie alexDownload Free PDFView PDFVirus paper by Stéphane SikoraJoseph NechvatalDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Brooklyn Rail2015 Joseph Nechvatal interview with Thyrza Goodeve2015 • Joseph NechvatalTHE MIGRANT AS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR is a 2015 Joseph Nechvatal interview with Thyrza Goodeve published in the December/January 2015-2016 issue of The Brooklyn RailDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE MIGRANT AS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR: Joseph Nechvatal interviewJoseph NechvatalTHE MIGRANT AS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR: Joseph Nechvatal interviewed by Thyrza Nichols Goodeve for the Brooklyn RailDownload Free PDFView PDFInterview of Joseph Nechvatal by Nicolas Ballet recorded live on September 20th 2015 chez Nechvatal in Paris about Industrial Culture, Noise Music, and the New York Art Scene in the late-1970s and 1980s2015 • Joseph NechvatalInterview of Joseph Nechvatal by Nicolas Ballet recorded live on September 20th 2015 chez Nechvatal in Paris about Industrial Culture, Noise Music, and the New York Art Scene in the late-1970s and 1980sDownload Free PDFView PDF"Artistic research" or "Incomprehensible metaphysical poetics" ?, EAM, Rennes, 2016.Gábor DobóArtistic research” or “Incomprehensible metaphysical poetics”? Debates about Lajos Kassák’s Budapest-based Magazine, Dokumentum (1926–1927) Lajos Kassák’s avant-garde magazine Dokumentum (1926–1927) developed a complex artistic and social approach to contemporary culture; involving artistic, quest, and at the same time, investigation, which was, rather unusual for Hungarian literary criticism. Dokumentum magazine positioned itself as a crossover avant-garde organ of various artistic, aesthetic, social and even technical, political, urban designer and anthropological research, incorporating indeed the metaphysical quest and rational investigation. All the while, the conservative or moderate modernist Hungarian critics considered the journal simply the “newest far-left futurist magazine of Kassák.” As a result, the recapitulation of the main concerns of the Dokumentum magazine and the related comments of Hungarian critics allowed researchers to deduce the main aesthetic standpoints of the Hungarian culture of the late 1920’s. The self-description of Dokumentum suggests that it wanted to be a medium, through which, a new world appears to contemporary readers. One of the contributors of Dokumentum, in fact, described the editorship of the journal as the “embassy of a new society,” living in Budapest in 1927 in their “extraterritorial” way. This metaphor by, the poet and editor, Andor Németh represents the linking role of Dokumentum between present and future, national and international contexts, artistic and non-artistic ambiances. However, Németh highlighted also the special status of the magazine between isolation and interconnection in terms of the Hungarian cultural life. In contrast, Hungarian critics considered the magazine a subversive and a journal deeply concerned with politics. Hungarian intellectuals vigorously attacked the artistic and social aspect of Dokumentum, defending the aesthetic and political status quo of institutionalized Hungarian cultural life. The aesthetic concerns of critics about Dokumentum reveal that in fact they were more ideological in nature. Indeed, their judgments can be described as instruments for maintaining the contemporary cultural situation in Hungary. Kassák’s journal following European artistic trends from Russian Constructivism to French Surrealism and Purism, mixed up with idiosyncratic concepts of Hungarian avant-garde, remained isolated in Hungarian cultural life. The analyses of the debate about artistic and social quest and investigation of Dokumentum delineates the dynamics of the situation of Hungarian literature of the late 1920’s.Download Free PDFView PDFBefore and Beyond the Bachelor MachineJoseph NechvatalThis paper examines the importance of Marcel Duchamp's La Machine Célibataire (The Bachelor Machine) on Art and Technology in the 20th and 21st centuries.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
