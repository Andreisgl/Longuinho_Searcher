NME Originals: Goth
"The children of the night, what sweet music they make," Count Dracula.
Following recent acclaimed issues dedicated to Glam (Def Leppard's Joe Elliott bought five copies!) and Gods Of Rock, join us now as we sharpen a stake and wreath ourselves in garlic for a journey into the dark velvet world of the '80s Goth movement. Charting the careers of The Cure , Siouxsie & The Banshees, Joy Division, The Sisters Of Mercy, The Mission, Bauhaus, Southern Death Cult, Nick Cave and their brooding ilk, NME Originals: Goth reprints for the first time since their original publication, interviews with Robert Smith, Ian Curtis, Siouxsie Sioux, Peter Murphy and Carl from the Nephilim. NME Originals: Goth also offers a dark orgy of rare photos from the Batcave, eyewitness reviews of all the greatest Goth gatherings and '80s writer reactions to such Halloween classics as 'Bela Lugosi's Dead', 'Release The Bats' and 'Dawnrazor'.
NME Originals: Goth is on sale now. Black is back. Dig it.
