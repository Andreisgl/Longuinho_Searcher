The authors argue that the nearly eleven-foot-tall empty lattice draped with limp ropes ("snakes," as Hesse explicitly termed them) invokes numerous specters: the iconic suffering male body in the Vatican _Laocoön and His Sons_; Hesse's own body creating the work, a capable agent in contrast to the doomed Trojan priest; and, in its continuity with the viewer's space, the viewer's body as well. With the _Laocoon_, Hesse inserted herself as a woman artist into the long patriarchal history of its Vatican namesake. The sculpture also put her in a complex conversation with the Minimalists -- mostly men -- whose works, exhibited in the Primary Structures show that same year, ostensibly (but problematically) rejected the anthropomorphic. With its draped ropes and spectral Laocoön, Hesse's work resonates strongly with German-born Venezuelan artist Gego's monumental, irregularly enfolding net piece _Reticulárea_, adapted for a temporary installation in New York in 1969.Download Free PDFView PDFWoman's Art JournalJudy Chicago's The Dinner Party: The Curatorial Context2020 • Sally J .

Pan renders the female body with a synthesis of modernist styles and a psychological intensity that reflects her artistic conviction. This is particularly prominent in her self-portraits and female nudes that explore a new version of feminine beauty. A distinctive and confident style of femininity becomes acutely conspicuous when her paintings are compared to female figures in advertising posters that present jovial and commercialized images of modern women. Her unique perspective of modern womanhood redefines the self and femininity that introduces interiority, rarely expressed in Chinese paintings.Download Free PDFView PDFFilippone, For the Blood of Gaia_Betsy Damon's Quest for Living Water, 2018.pdfChristine FilipponeFor the Blood of Gaia: Betsy Damon’s Quest for Living Water Christine Filippone Applying feminist strategies of collaboration, consciousness-raising, and activism honed through her early career in the Feminist Art Movement, artist Betsy Damon addresses human-caused water scarcity through art as social practice. Her prints, performances, installations, and eco art works made since 1991, including Living Water Garden (fig.1) and Living Waters of Larimer (figs.2, 3) convey the importance of restoring sustainable systems, which, she believes, requires communities to take control of their water. She approaches the problem from the position of eco-justice, arguing that the privatization of natural resources is incompatible with the universal right of all life to clean water. Evocative of Damon’s concerns over the control and commodification of water, our current geological epoch has been preliminarily designated the Anthropocene, defined by human impact on the global environment so profound that it rivals the forces of nature. Most definitions of the Anthropocene arise from Earth systems science, which views the Earth as a total entity whose physical, chemical and biological global-scale cycles provide the support system for life. This conception of the Earth as a total entity in constant, cyclic flux affirms the Gaia Hypothesis proposed in the early 1970s by chemist James Lovelock and biologist Lynn Margulis, which asserted that biological life, with its ingestions, excretions, and biotic decomposition, have been essential to the maintenance of an atmosphere conducive to life. Within the system exist servomechanisms that sense chemical and physical tendencies adverse to life, enabling adjustments to be made. Thus, if all human and nonhuman components of the earth compose a single homeostatic system, a meta-organism or living planet, then its streams and rivers constitute its circulatory system, its blood. Necessary for the creation of sustainable water systems, Damon has long claimed, is living water, which continually flows, moves, has oxygen, an open system akin to a circulatory system. Living water is sensitive and responsive, possessing the properties of life to which it also gives rise, distinct from dead or stagnant water confined in reservoirs and dammed lakes, which deteriorates. A foundational source for her concept of living water was the book Sensitive Chaos: The Creation of Flowing Forms for Water and Air (1965), by German scientist Theodor Schwenk. Anticipating the Gaia Hypothesis, Schwenk wrote, “Water is always on its way somewhere at some point in one of its great or small circulatory systems... Together earth, plant world and atmosphere form a single great organism, in which water streams like living blood.” Issued seven years before the Gaia Hypothesis, Sensitive Chaos was published by the Anthroposophical Society of which Schwenk was a lifelong member. Schwenk’s belief in the Earth as an open system, a complex web of interconnected processes, was informed by the spiritual science of Rudolph Steiner, founder of the Anthroposophical Society. Natural science editor of the scientific writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Steiner’s pantheistic belief in the Earth as a physical, biochemical and spiritual unity has its roots in the work of Geothe and in that of his friend, 18th century Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt who first considered the name Gaia for his magnum opus Cosmos. Steiner named the Anthroposophical Society’s headquarters, which he designed and built himself in 1919 after Goethe. Evidence of the synergy (to use Buckminster Fuller’s term) between Schwenk’s beliefs and the Gaia Hypothesis is Schwenk’s inclusion of a testimonial by James Lovelock, author of the Gaia Hypothesis, on the book jacket of later editions of Sensitive Chaos. Damon described her quest to release the blood of Gaia: “Water comprises the miraculous molecules that shape and sustain all life on earth. Water is the connective tissue of all living systems. It forms the veins of the earth, the blood vessels in the human body.” In Living Waters of Larimer and Living Water Garden and in her current project with the Lakota, Damon continues to implement strategies of consciousness-raising, community-building inspired by feminism, using principles of connection learned from water. Her social practice dedicated to eco justice is consistent with philosophical approaches of ecofeminism, deep ecology, and strands of posthumanism that afford essential rights to nature, or Gaia.Download Free PDFView PDF"THE END OF THE GRAND TOUR? VIRTUAL SYMPOSIUM ON ARTIST RESIDENCIES: FUTURE, PLACE AND STATE" "THE END OF THE GRAND TOUR? VIRTUAL SYMPOSIUM ON ARTIST RESIDENCIES: FUTURE, PLACE AND STATE" Brochure2020 • Francisco GuevaraJoin us in “The End of the Grand Tour? Virtual Symposium on Artist Residencies: Future, Place and State”, organized by Arquetopia Foundation and Synergy Artist Residency Network, in collaboration with multiple institutions around the globe. “The End of the Grand Tour? Virtual Symposium on Artist Residencies: Future, Place and State” is an open-ended conversation, in an effort to continue the critical dialogue on the subject of artist residencies. This virtual symposium, which will be simultaneously happening in 18 different countries, will focus on the invention of place, mobility, tourism, and their historical roots as open-ended questions at the intersection of artist residencies and putting into relevance concepts such as dignity, solidarity, reciprocity, community, sustainability and social justice. The event is organized in sessions that will include virtual keynotes and round tables through a series of panels that will include the perspectives and experiences from artist residencies and cultural institutions, as well as the expertise of scholars from diverse backgrounds and different locations around the globe.Download Free PDFView PDF(A)ddressing Race in Winold Reiss’s Portraits from the 1920sDoris  BravoDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Foreign Languages and CulturesJournal of Foreign Languages and Cultures, Vol. 3 No. 12019 • Lauri Scheyer, Norman FinkelsteinScholarly journal in English published annually in June and December concentrating on critical and cultural theory, languages and literatures, translation, and innovative pedagogy.Download Free PDFView PDF"Objective" ArtJon  WoodsonDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
