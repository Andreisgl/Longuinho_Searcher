Even though representations of deceased laymen were a common feature in sepulchral art, precedent-making holy shrine, Nicola Pisano's tomb for Saint Dominic from 1267, did not include an effigy. Even much later elaborate shrines, such as the tomb of Saint Peter Martyr (1335-9) by Giovanni di Balduccio, refer to the deceased through a mourning scene, although that scene takes a prominent frontal place in the narrative relief. In Venice, however, we find a concentration of effigial tombs such as the one that Venetians acquired for relics of Saint Simeon by Marco Romano (1318). An earlier or coeval shrine for the same Old Testament prophet in Zadar is equally an effigial shrine, although the body is sculpted as a high relief rather than a three-dimensional sculpture. Equally as well, Filipo de'Santi's Venetian work for the deceased Blessed Odorico da Pordenone is an effigial tomb that...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPatrocinia Multa Erant Habentes: State, Parrocchia, and Colony -- Relic Acquisition in Medieval Venice in: Cuius Patrocio Tota Gaudet Regio.

The article examines the history of the head relic and the assumption that it may have replicated or connoted a shape of the Byzantine imperial crown, a kamelaukion. From the available evidence such reading has been rejected. Instead, it is proposed that it resembled the dome-shaped reliquary such as that of Saint James in Zadar dated to the end of the eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century. Furthermore, it is proposed that group I enamels that adorn the reliquary were not made in Constantinople, but in Dubrovnik between 1164 and 1180, given that they show a number of non-Byzantine stylistic and iconographical features and inscriptions in Beneventan script incompatible with enamel production in Constantinople.Download Free PDFView PDFFew Examples of Marian Devotion in the East Adriatic Urban Settlements in the Late Medieval and Early Modern PeriodZoran  LadićIn this article the authors examine creation and development of the cults of saints in the medieval and early modern communes situated on the East Adriatic shore particularly focusing on influence of Marian cult on pious life of inhabitants of East Adriatic urban settlements. Based on the data from unpublished and published written and visual sources the authors also analyses the creation and increase in popularity of Marian cult from the Early Middle Ages to Renaissance paying particular attention to historical reasons which influenced the flourishing of Marian cult in Istrian and Dalmatian communes in the late medieval Renaissance period. For this purpose the authors examined notary records, chronicles, pilgrim diaries as well as votive images from various Istrian and Dalmatian communes.Download Free PDFView PDFIl modello antoniano: tombe di santi su colonne o su cariatidi in area veneta nel TrecentoMichele TomasiDownload Free PDFView PDFDefining, Transforming, and Providing Sacred Presence: A Sarcophagus Reliquary in the Menil CollectionJackie MannThis thesis attempts a complete object biography of a fifth-century sarcophagus reliquary currently held by the Menil Collection in Houston. This thesis proposes that the Menil reliquary is a container with acute agency in its original context that continues into its modern museum context. This stone container has openings on its lid and front face, a pattern of carved birds and crosses, and is shaped like a Roman sarcophagus. The relics contained by this reliquary are completely concealed. This makes an analysis of their container even more vital, as the Menil reliquary carries the signifiers for the material inside. Without reliquaries surrounding them, relics would be unrecognizable fragments. Reliquaries define relics. Due to its iconographic program and complete circulation system for liquids, the Menil sarcophagus reliquary was displayed visibly in a late-antique pilgrimage church. A common belief in Late Antiquity was that sacred power could be transferred via touch. Liquids poured into the tops of sarcophagus reliquaries touched the relics, sources of sacred power, inside. When they exited the second opening in the reliquary, these substances had also become sacred material. Audiences of these reliquaries could then interact directly with the sacred power they desired by touching, tasting, and otherwise experiencing these sanctified fluids. Reliquaries with this ability, including the Menil reliquary, transformed and provided a means of contacting otherwise-inaccessible sacred presences. The Menil sarcophagus reliquary was a visible object that communicated the above abilities to its late-antique audience through its various physical features. The Menil reliquary continues to be a tangible point of recognition of and access to invisible, distant worlds in its modern location. As a museum object, the Menil sarcophagus reliquary has become a relic like those it once contained, while the institution of the Menil Collection acts a reliquary. This object has an ongoing vitality and, in both its late-antique and modern contexts, makes tangible the otherwise unattainable.Download Free PDFView PDFChurch Monuments'Monumentum aere perennius'? Precious-metal effigial tomb monuments in Europe 1080–1430: survey article (full text)2016 • Sophie Oosterwijk, Sally F BadhamProbably the most prestigious monuments produced in the Middle Ages were those constructed from (semi-)precious metals, sometimes enamelled or inlaid with real or fictive jewels. Some survive, especially in England and Germany. However, many more have been destroyed, especially in France, and are known of only through antiquarian sources. This preliminary materiality-based survey comprises 119 extant and lost examples throughout Europe in the 350-year period to 1430, starting with the monument to Rudolph of Swabia (d. 1080). It shows how magnificent such monuments could be, how widespread this type of monument once was and how it was favoured within certain families and locations, but also how much we have lost. To demonstrate the splendour of such memorials and the techniques involved, a case study is provided of the virtually unknown, but internationally important monument of Prince Afonso (d. 1400) in Braga Cathedral in northern Portugal, which has recently been the subject of detailed technical analysis.Download Free PDFView PDFRomanesque Saints, Shrines and Pilgrimage Conference AbstractsJohn McNeillComplete set of abstracts for the British Archaeological Association's 2016 'Romanesque Saints, Shrines and Pilgrimage' ConferenceDownload Free PDFView PDFCroatian Regions, Cities-Communes, and Their Population in the Eastern Adriatic in the Travelogues of Medieval European PilgrimsZoran  LadićIn this article, based on the information gathered from a dozen medieval pilgrim travelogues and itineraries, my aim has been to indicate the attitudes, impressions, and experiences noted down by sometimes barely educated and at other times very erudite clerical and lay pilgrims, who traveled to the Holy Land and Jerusalem as palmieri or palmarii ultra mare and wrote about the geographical features of the Eastern Adriatic coast, its ancient and medieval monuments, urban structures, visits to Istrian and Dalmatian communes, contacts with the local population, encounters with the secular and spiritual customs and the language, the everyday behavior of the locals, and so on. Such information is contained, to a greater or lesser extent, in their travelogues and journals. To be sure, this type of sources, especially when written by people who were prone to analyze the differences between civilizations and cultural features, are filled with their subjective opinions: fascination with the landscapes and cities, sacral and secular buildings, kindness of the local population, ancient monuments in urban centres, the abundance of relics, and the quality of wine, fish, and other foods, but also amazement, prejudices, misunderstandings, and rejection concerning the society, people, and customs in this region.Download Free PDFView PDFin Kaiser Karl IV – Die böhmischen Länder und Europa - Emperor Charles IV, Lands of the Bohemian Crown and Europe, eds.
