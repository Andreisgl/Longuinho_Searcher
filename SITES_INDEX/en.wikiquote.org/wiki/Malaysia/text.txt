Quotes[edit]
I lived in Malaysia for three years in the kind of uncertainty westerners face only in times of war. The five daily calls to prayer are the only predictable events in the capital city, Kuala Lumpur. The power cuts are frequent, the traffic jams continuous. Islam is the official religion, but materialism is the ruling creed. ... Islam is practised with ritual precision and with perfect reverence for its Arabian dimension. All Malays, including the royal family, look up to Arabs, the white men of the East.
Shabbir Akhtar,  Perspective: Ex-defender of the faith, The Times Higher Education Supplement on 22 August 1997. Also reproduced in Goel, Sita Ram (editor) (1998). Freedom of expression: Secular theocracy versus liberal democracy. [1] (Chapter 28)
In spite of the huge diversity in Malaysia in terms of religion, culture, race, ethnicity and so forth, we've really gone very far in developing this country.
Najib Razak (2012) cited in "Malaysia's PM hopes to forge a united nation" on CNN, 3 November 2010
Malaysia is a country unlike any other: full of promise and fragility. Its history, cultural and religious diversity make it a rich, compelling and surprising land. Chinese, Indian, Malay and, in a broader sense, Indonesian cultures live side by side, while Buddhism, Christianity and Islam all partake of its multi-layered heritage. Moreover, Malaysia possesses a first-rate economic and geostrategic potential.
Tariq Ramadan (2012) cited in "Islamic humanism can keep Malaysia from blindly mimicking West's mistakes" on ABC, 25 July 2012
Our great aim must be to make Malaysia a haven of peace, harmony and happiness. We must strive for this with all our strength. We must be brave, we must be fair and we must be just, so that, come what may, we shall be ready as united Malaysian people to meet it.
Tunku Abdul Rahman cited in "In the words of our nation's founder" on The Sun Daily, 4 February 2014
We need the international community to come together to ensure that Malaysia responds to the ongoing investigations into the misappropriation of government funds, known as the 1MDB scandal, and does not try to cover up any wrongdoing. The attorney-general’s statement is just another in a long line of incidents that raises questions about the impartiality of the judiciary and Malaysia’s commitment to fighting corruption
TI's Asia Pacific regional director Srirak Plipat said it is urgently calling for greater protection of those who bring corruption to light in Malaysia and swift investigations into the corruption crisis surrounding the government, quoted on Malaysia Kini (February 16, 2015), "TI fears Malaysia moving towards autocracy"
Malaysia fortunately has more than enough resources and wealth to address the issue of poverty. Therefore there is no excuse to not prioritize the problem at hand.
Anwar Ibrahim (2020) cited in: "Anwar says Malaysia rich, but many people still poor due to ingrained rent seeking culture" in Yahoo! News, 10 July 2020.
