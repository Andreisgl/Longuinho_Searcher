This research arises from the desire of the authors to verify attractiveness, usability, and communication effectiveness of the system with the end users while having such a multi sensorial experience in the museum. The employed strategy in the survey and the final results will be discussed in comparison with authors’ expectations, outlining best practices out of this massive study.Download Free PDFView PDFVIRTUAL MUSEUMS FOR LANDSCAPE VALORIZATION AND COMMUNICATION Commission II, WG VI/4Eva PietroniResearch in the domain of landscape virtual reconstructions has been mainly focused on digitization and recording inside GIS systems, or real time visualization, paying a minor attention to the development of a methodological approach for the landscape narration, combing different registers, conceptual, emotional incitements and, thus, able to arouse in the public a feeling of emotional " sensing " and self-identification. The landscape reflects also the human activities in the territory and the communities' cultural patterns, their sense of " belonging ". In a virtual museum of landscapes, the multidisciplinary approach, the multiplication of perspectives and voices, storytelling, acquire primary importance. A Virtual Museum of landscapes should integrate both holistic and delimited visions. The holistic vision requires a diachronic approach, including both present and past phases of life. On the other side, delimited, or " monographic " , representations are useful to go deeper into specific and exemplar stories, regarding specific groups of people. Beside, the emergence of new social media enhancing cultural interactions among people induce the creation of specific social platforms for Cultural Heritage for the active participation of a large number of stakeholders. Co-creation scenarios and tools can be particularly promising. Aton is an example of front-end VR social platform in the web end, for the efficient streaming of medium/large landscape, their exploration and characterization. The Tiber Valley Virtual Museum is an example of sensorial cultural landscape. Starting from the acquisition of topographical data through integrated technologies, several multi-sensory scenarios have been created, inside which visitors can feel embodied and involved.Download Free PDFView PDFISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information SciencesVirtual Museums for Landscape Valorization and CommunicationEva PietroniResearch in the domain of landscape virtual reconstructions has been mainly focused on digitization and recording inside GIS systems, or real time visualization, paying a minor attention to the development of a methodological approach for the landscape narration, combing different registers, conceptual, emotional incitements and, thus, able to arouse in the public a feeling of emotional “sensing” and self- identification.

We focus on three themes that emerged from the survey: (1) Visitors at this site skewed older, with nearly a quarter over 70; (2) Despite literature suggesting the opposite, visitors at New Harmony liked to learn from a tour guide; and, (3) Visitors said they wanted to “experience the past.” The very notion of a single “experience” of the past, however, is complicated at New Harmony and other historic sites because they interpret multiple periods of significance. Ultimately, our findings suggest immersive technologies must be suited for older visitors, utilize the tour guide, and facilitate visitors’ ability to “experience the past” in such a way that they feel immersed in multiple timelines at the same site.Download Free PDFView PDFDigitization of Museum and Art Gallery: A Framework for Enhancing User Interactivity and Personalization in On-site Environments2015 • Richard, Yu-Chang LiDigital curation is an emerging topic of interest in the current museum development. If on-site museum experience can be enhanced by digital technology, the development of digital curation in cultural expression can not only promote the role of museum in this digital era but also boost the value of cultural heritage more than ever before. This research focuses on the development of digital curation in cultural expression applications, such as museums and art galleries, with special attention to the user experience perspective. The goal is to provide a novel approach that helps to enhance visitors’ on-site museum experience through digital technology. We illustrate how the use of technology can improve the production process and increase the interaction and personalization between visitors and collections by evaluating a prototype that is developed based on this principle.Download Free PDFView PDFInterdisciplinary Science ReviewsCultivating Personalized Museum Tours Online and On-Site2009 • Lora AroyoDownload Free PDFView PDFHeritageMapping the Soundscape in Communicative Forms for Cultural Heritage: Between Realism and SymbolismEva PietroniThe dimension of sound plays a central role as a form of cultural representation. Sound is a means of knowledge and experiential involvement, as it is inextricably linked to place and space, mind and body, cultural context and emotion. This contribution aims to explore how sound design follows different paradigms and methods in the various media. Virtual reality, videogame, cinema and documentary have differently codified rules to provide acoustic verisimilitude to the simulated space, to orient or stimulate the user, to suggest contents or evoke events and to emotionally involve the public. These rules follow artistic principles closer to psychoacoustics than to scientific reproduction of sound in the simulated space. Under what conditions, however, is the scientific simulation of an acoustic space preferable to the more common paradigms of psychoacoustics? How could this be created? Immersive and non-immersive virtual reality for cultural heritage is currently the field of experim...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
