However, in the text I have made a few comparisons to foreign projects which single themselves out in this context. The Danish main title “Det Nye Folkebibliotek”, translates into English as “The New Public Library”. My research hypothesis being: the Danish public library has undergone a series of changes, and the changes and developments are ongoing; from being a mere collections of knowledge and materials such as books, to being active, outgoing, far reaching and versatile institutions focusing on the common good of society in a number of ways. Thus my main research question is this: how and by which means do the public libraries act differently now as opposed to earlier? Another relevant question is: which tactics do the public libraries employ in order to keep, and reinforce, their place as necessary cultural institutions in postmodern, postindustrial society today? A time period sometimes called “the Internet Age”?My empirical research and observations provide evidence that the public library no longer “just” is an institution for the loaning out of books etc. It has become a public domain focusing on lifting up society, educating the population / the users of the library, while at the same time bringing the users together in social contexts as well as cultural ones. In short, the libraries have taken on new functions and tasks, including some of the social functions earlier managed exclusively at local city halls. In order to study these new tendencies, I have applied two main methods of research: firstly, the case study, for which I have handpicked three public libraries in the metropolitan area of Copenhagen. Libraries which are similar in some ways, yet still have their different traits, although they are located within a limited geographical area. These three focus libraries have served as case studies and examples for my empirical research, active observation, and for my other primary research method: the semi-structured research interview.My three focus libraries are: •Biblioteket, Rentemestervej, Copenhagen Northwest•Ørestad Bibliotek, in the Eastern and newest part of the city•Blågårdens Bibliotek, in a central part of the city troubled by various social issuesAt each library I have conducted interviews with senior staff members, and gathered further information by active observation and photography, trying to catch everyday life with my eyes and camera. Part of my theory behind this research, has been the writings of Henrik Jochumsen, Casper Hvenegaard Rasmussen and Dorte Skot-Hansen, amongst others. From the latest book by the three aforementioned Danish scientists, authors and professors at RSLIS, I have found great inspiration and motivation, and what is more, scientific terms which capture some of the most vital tendencies of The New Library. These are: Public Domain, Placemaker and Icon.In this thesis I have done my best to apply these terms, and others, in order to answer my research questions, and thereby make my contribution to unveil why we need the public libraries now, more than ever, and which components, so speak, constitute the profile of the Danish public library of today. Including its new functions, profiles, vision and mission.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jon Hansen•  10  Education, Media and Cultural Studies, Library Science, Public LibrariesEarly Childhood Caries (ECC): what's in a name?It is evident from the number of published scientific papers on Early Childhood Caries (ECC) that interest in this problem has grown in recent years.

Many authors have been trying to devise a clear definition or classification for ECC. The aim of this review was to inventory the prevalence of ECC and to seek a consensus regarding definition and diagnosis. Further attention was paid to the aetiological factors including the role of microrganisms. Finally, education, parenting and treatment procedures were discussed. For this review, epidemiological studies on caries prevalence in children aged between 0 and 36 months were compiled through a systematic approach using Medline. This clearly showed that ECC continues to be a serious public health problem and that there is a great variety of definitions and diagnoses used worldwide, reflected in the prevalence data. This review confirms the multicausal aetiology and the need for further research.

Esse processo pode ser mais eficaz através dos recursos tecnológicos como o facebook, em evidência na sociedade atualmente. Este trabalho surgiu da necessidade aproximação na relação Biblioteca/usuário e da possibilidade de oferecer uma alternativa de comunicação com o serviço de referência da Biblioteca. Partindo da observação de que a maioria dos usuários utiliza frequentemente as redes sociais, pretendemos avaliar se a relação entre o serviço de referência e os usuários pode ser aprimorada através delas. Serão propostas, a partir daí, formas de aproximação do usuário com a biblioteca universitária e seus serviços. Esta avaliação será contínua devido à intermitência deste tipo de recurso e das relações com seus usuários.Save to LibraryDownloadby Debora  Do Nascimento•  4  Information Science, Library Science, Library and Information Science, Social MediaDeveloping First Year Student Information Literacy: Reflections on the Learning ProcessNormal 0 false false false EN-IE X-NONE X-NONE /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:&quot;Table Normal&quot;; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99;... moreNormal 0 false false false EN-IE X-NONE X-NONE /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:&quot;Table Normal&quot;; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:&quot;&quot;; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;} This article evaluates first year student’s engagement with information literacy as they make the transition to third level education.

However, learning environment is influenced by multiple factors such as institutional factors (leadership of the director, faculty, quality of the students, physical infrastructure tools at LRC (Learning resource centres) and regulating bodies, accreditation agencies and end customers i.e., industry (recruiters).  Given the advent web 2.0 technologies, there is need to provide active and two-way, student centric learning environment for effective learning and gaining of skill set. The paper explores these multiple aspects and its bearing on LRC for providing conducive learning environment.

The main problem is that there is no definition of this concept. The purpose of this article is an analysis of the concept of information from the position of classical logic. The main method of the article is a conceptual analysis. First, we briefly deal with the overview of the concepts of information, with concepts and their definition as such and with the scope of the concept of information. Then, we provide an analysis of 31 important definitions of the concept of information which were developed within the scope of information science and related fields, and we consider relations between the concept of information and the concepts in other disciplines. Conceptual analysis of the concept of information leads to the conclusion that information is probably a concept that somehow addresses the entire reality, thus that it is a term, which is in the classical logic described as transcendental. This fact, in the view of the fact that information science is a special field, seems to be a serious methodological problem. Problems associated with the broadness of the concept of information have three possible solutions: transformation of information science into the universal science, narrowing the concept of information to a special term, or replacement of the concept of information by a different one. At the end of the article, we briefly point out our solution to the problem.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jiří Stodola•  3  Library and Information Science, Concepts, InformationPublic libraries and cultural policy in the UKPurpose Public libraries in the UK are increasingly expected to provide arts activities and events as part of their usual operations.

The purpose of this paper is to summarise recent policy trends in this direction from both the perspective of libraries’ and the arts sector. A touring theatre project aimed at children and families is discussed in further detail to examine some of the outcomes of these policies.Design/methodology/approachThe paper will present a brief history of policy developments and debate in this area. Mixed method findings from the research element of “Among Ideal Friends” will be discussed, having used surveys and interviews with audiences and librarians, geodemographic profiling, box office records and library card data.FindingsPublic funding across both libraries and the arts has decreased at a national and local level, though both sectors are encouraged to work together to share expertise and community knowledge.Research limitations/implicationsThe primary funding for the project was an arts funding body. While a holistic approach to evaluation was taken, this limited any specific focus that might have been given to educational outcomes or cost-benefit analysis compared to other interventions.Practical implicationsPublic libraries can see the results and challenges of a successful regional touring theatre project for consideration in their own activity planning, especially those related to families and younger users.Social implicationsLibraries and Arts organisations have different priorities in regards to these areas. Though co-operative, the situation is not without tension. The topic is illustrative of some wider debates around cultural value, everyday participation and cultural democracy.Originality/valueThis paper offers a timely discussion of cultural policy in relation to libraries, e.g. The Society of Chief Librarians “Universal Cultural Offer” (October 2017).Save to LibraryDownloadby Richard Fletcher•  5  Literacy, Library Science, Cultural Policy, Library and Information ScienceSEJARAH PERAN SOSIAL PERPUSTAKAAN MASJIDAbstrak Sejak awal pembentukan masyarakat Islam yang dirintis oleh nabi Muhammad, perpustakaan masjid telah memainkan peran penting dalam perkembangan masyarakat Islam.

Unfortunately there is a dearth of science librarians on the continent and the need for science librarians is more crucial to help support meaningful scientific research and development on the continent. Why does the gap exist? What are Library and Information Science (LIS) schools doing to entice, attract, enroll, motivate, and train science librarians? What are the professional associations doing to promote the cause of science librarianship? What are academic and research libraries doing to retain and stop science librarians from invading or migrating to other niches. This paper attempts to provide answers to the above questions with input and insight from across the continent.Save to LibraryDownloadby Innocent A Awasom•  2  Library and Information Science, International librarianshipThe social library in three contexts: Programmes and perspectivesAcross different national contexts public libraries have dealt, in diverse yet comparable ways, with the multiple challenges stemming from globalization, migration, marginalization and technological developments.

This article argues, by way of dissecting three cases of library planning programmes which focused on centring libraries in their neighbourhoods, that we in recent decades witness the contours of a social library. Discussing experiences from initiatives in the UK, Canada and Denmark we, notwithstanding significant national differences, highlight common features – that libraries bring together already existing, but hitherto isolated institutional knowledge and competencies. We conclude by proposing a tentative typology of ‘the social library’.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hans Elbeshausen and +1Kristian Nagel Delica•  4  Community Development, Library and Information Science, Cultural Planning, Library PlanningUse of Information Resources by Student NursesSave to LibraryDownloadby Aderonke O L U F E M I Otunla•  3  Knowledge Management, Library and Information Science, Electronic Resources ManagementSurvey of Staff and Organization of Private Secondary School Libraries in Ondo West Local Government Area of Ondo StateSave to LibraryDownloadby Samuel Ogunniyi•  2  Library and Information Science, Data CollectionResearch on the Utilization and Evaluation of Library Resource Discovery Systems in ChinaAccording to the investigation of library resources discovery system construction in 20 universities in China, the aggregation discovery service provided by the multi-source aggregation function, the discovery function is based on... moreAccording to the investigation of library resources discovery system construction in 20 universities in China, the aggregation discovery service provided by the multi-source aggregation function, the discovery function is based on aggregation and the comprehensive revealing function. This article evaluates user usage and acceptance based on refinements of the functions mentioned above. The investigation shows that compared with the diversity of function, users are more concerned about the practicability, the intuition and the academy. Thus, systems should choose the best sources and pay attention to the metadata normalization, and enhance the correlation to standard datasets.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Library and Information Services (IJLIS), IGI Global•  4  Information Science, Library Science, Library and Information Science, Library and Information StudiesEvaluating The Library Website Of The Indonesian Ministry Of Education And Culture Through The End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) ModelThis study aims to investigate the level of the use of the Ministry of Education and Culture Library website through the End User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) model.

This type of research is explanative with a quantitative approach. Data collection was carried out by distributing questionnaires to 99 users of the Ministry of Education Library who used the library website. This research questionnaire was tested for validity and reliability using Cronbach's Alpha technique and IBM, SPSS, V25, software. The results show that user satisfaction using the Ministry of Education and Culture Library website can be considered as a good website. The average score of the Content dimension is 3.14, the Accuracy dimension is 3.07, the Format dimension is 3.17, the Ease of use dimension is 3.21, the Timeliness dimension is 3.05 and for user’s satisfaction is 3.04. These dimensions are on an interval scale of 2.52 - 3.27, thus it can be said that the website is good enough. This research recommends that the timeliness dimensions need to be improved in terms of quality to provide quick information for the users. Thus, the users will be satisfied with the website services provided by the Ministry of Education and Culture Library. Indeed, the importance of the library website should be measured and assessed periodically by using the Model End-User Computing Satisfaction to increase information services for users to develop national education.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Azwar•Library and Information ScienceProceedings from DocPerform Editorial: Is the World After All Just a Dream?

In the past 3 years, the service has grown tremendously; with more technologies being added to the collection, including Oculus Rift, VR One, HTC Vive, Leap Motion and others. This service has further enabled librarians in building relationships with their students, creating collaborative opportunities for academic and scholarly work  across disciplines, and providing k-12 outreach and engagement to support “STEAM” education at their local schools and community. These technologies have enabled the DeLaMare Library to support the University’s mission of teaching and learning, research, and outreach. This poster will highlight what virtual reality equipment has been curated, how the library provides the lending service, scholarly and academic work utilizing VR, and outreach efforts utilizing the equipment.

Political, cultural and socio-economic integrations arebecoming much easier and faster than before. This paper argues that the digitaldivide existing between developing and developed countries places Africa indisadvantaged position in the globalisation process leading to culturalimperialism. It challenges library and information professionals to try and bridgethis digital divide through sustained professional development, national andinstitutional framework, curriculum redesign and regional and international cooperation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ifeanyi J Ezema•  4  African Studies, Information Technology, Library and Information Science, Globalisation and DevelopmentBibliometric analysis of Annals of Library and Information Studies (2004-2013)The present study reports the results of the bibliometric analysis of Annals of Library and Information Studies (ALIS) for the period from 2004 to 2013.

The data collection was done by downloading the contents from the website of the journal. The analysis covers mainly the number of articles, authorship pattern, geographical distribution of contributions, types and forms of documents cited, length of the contributions etc. The study shows a trend of growth in the number of contributions every year. Out of the total number of 323 contributions, 120 (37.15%) are contributed by single authors while the remaining 203 (62.85%) are join authors' contributions. The study further finds that most of the contributions are from India (87.31%).Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Imran Khan•  4  Bibliometrics, Library and Information Science, Academic Journals, Bibliometric and citation analysisCan We Trust Information?Save to LibraryDownloadby Eric Ketelaar•  2  Library and Information Science, Library and Information StudiesInformation System Security: Self-Efficacy and Security Effectiveness In Florida LibrariesSave to Libraryby Daniel Phelps•  9  Management, Information Technology, Political Science, Library and Information ScienceInformation Ethics: On the Philosophical Foundation of Computer EthicsThe essential difficulty about Computer Ethics’ (CE) philosophical status is a methodological problem: standard ethical theories cannot easily be adapted to deal with CE-problems, which appear to strain their conceptual resources, and CE... moreThe essential difficulty about Computer Ethics’ (CE) philosophical status is a methodological problem: standard ethical theories cannot easily be adapted to deal with CE-problems, which appear to strain their conceptual resources, and CE requires a conceptual foundation as an ethical theory. Information Ethics (IE), the philosophical foundational counterpart of CE, can be seen as a particular case of ‘environmental’ ethics or ethics of the infosphere. What is good for an information entity and the infosphere in general? This is the ethical question asked by IE. The answer is provided by a minimalist theory of deserts: IE argues that there is something more elementary and fundamental than life and pain, namely being, understood as information, and entropy, and that any information entity is to be recognised as the centre of a minimal moral claim, which deserves recognition and should help to regulate the implementation of any information process involving it. IE can provide a valuable perspective from which to approach, with insight and adequate discernment, not only moral problems in CE, but also the whole range of conceptual and moral phenomena that form the ethical discourse.Save to LibraryDownloadby Luciano Floridi•  36  Information Systems, Business Ethics, Computer Science, Information TechnologyMódulos instruccionales para desarrollar destrezas de información en bibliotecas académicasSave to LibraryDownloadby Pura Centeno•  12  Information Literacy, Academic Libraries, Library and Information Science, Information Literacy AssessmentCompetencias y destrezas profesional en ambientes digitales en Ciencia de la InformaciónRESUMEN Análisis de las competencias y habilidades que capacitan a los profesionales de la información para desarrollar su actividad en el entorno digital.

Se ha buscado examinar el impacto de las tecnologías digitales en las tareas que ejecutan y en lasestructuras del mercado laboral. Los antecedentes y el estado de la cuestión se han elaborado a partir de la recopilación y revisión de fuentes documentales con autoridad en el asunto y con oportuno interés. Asimismo, se han contrastado las consecuencias de la digitalización en el ejercicio de la profesión desde los datos obtenidos en trabajos aplicados. La exposición comienza valorando la incidencia de la tecnología en la evolución disciplinar, junto a la caracterización de los sistemas que interactúan enlazados en la red. Hasta llegar a plantear la generación y difusión abierta de los recursos y la organización y recuperación de carácter semántico. Se describen las consecuencias de la digitalización y de la gestión digital en los perfiles y requisitos laborales. Se justifica la necesidad de unas competencias específicas de carácter transdisciplinar. Alcanzando, incluso, a las consecuencias que esta situación tiene para la formación universitaria. Las conclusiones destacan la ejecución de tareas desde métodos colaborativos de asociación en la red. Se valoran las características digitales de uestras profesiones y el tipo de profesional que busca un mercado de trabajo más complejo y transdisciplinar. Palabras-clave: Información y Documentación.

Likewise, the consequences of digitalization on the exercise of the profession have beencontrasted from the data obtained in applied works. The exhibition begins by assessing the impact of technology on disciplinary evolution, together with the characterization of the systems that interact linked in the network. To the point ofproposing the generation and open dissemination of resources and the organization and recovery of semantic character. The consequences of digitization and digital management on job profiles and requirements are described. The need forspecific transdisciplinary skills is justified. We are even reaching the consequences that this situation has for university education. The conclusions highlight the execution of tasks from collaborative methods of association in the network. The digital characteristics of our professions and the type of professional looking for a more complex and transdisciplinary job market are valued.Keywords: Library and Information Science.
