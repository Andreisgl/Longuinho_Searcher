It is therefore most suitable to honor him with the publication of a hitherto unpublished duplicate of the Sumerian King List (SKL), a major, albeit fragile, source for the reconstruction of the early history of Mesopotamia. 1 BT 14, a tablet fragment kept in the Brockmon Collection, University of Haifa, is a rather interesting duplicate of SKL. Its publication was signaled by the present author aproximately˜fteen years ago, in an article published in the anniversary volume for Miguel Civil. 2 In that article I pointed out and demonstrated that BT 14 joins the Nippur duplicate CBS 13994, which was designated as P 3 in Jacobsen's editio princeps of the King List (Jacobsen 1939: 6), and the contents and structure of the extant part of this duplicate were described (Klein 1991: 124). The join between the two fragments was established on the basis of the unique formula, giving the total of the regnal years of each hereditary (i.e., genetic) dynasty, a feature absent in all other duplicates of the SKL (Klein 1991: 125). Since our duplicate begins with the dynasty of Kis I and ends with Ur-nigin 3 of the Uruk IV dynasty; and since P 4 (CBS 13293 + CBS 13484) begins with the summary of the regnal years of the dynasty of Uruk IV, and ends with a ˜nal summary of all dynasties, 3 Glassner rightly concluded that our duplicate and P 4 constitute a two tablet recension of the SKL, designating it in his composite edition as text C (Glassner 2004: 117). The purpose of this article is to oˆer a transliteration 4 and a minimal commentary of BT 14 + CBS 13994 (i.e., the˜rst tablet of this recension), supplemented with a hand copy and a photograph of BT 14 (see plates below), thus ful˜lling an obligation owed for a long time to University of Haifa Faculty of Humanities. 5Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
