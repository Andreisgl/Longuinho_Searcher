The apps you love.From a place you can trust.
For over a decade, the App Store has proved to be a safe and trusted place to discover and download apps. But the App Store is more than just a storefront — it’s an innovative destination focused on bringing you amazing experiences. And a big part of those experiences is ensuring that the apps we offer are held to the highest standards for privacy, security, and content. Because we offer nearly two million apps — and we want you to feel good about using every single one of them.

Security for every app.At every level.
We ensure that apps come from known sources, are free of known malware, and haven’t been tampered with at the time of installation or launch.
100% of apps are automatically screened for known malware.
Over 16K apps use Apple health technologies like HealthKit, CareKit, and ResearchKit designed to protect patient privacy.
You choose what data to share. And with whom.
More about You choose what data to share. And with whom.
You choose what data to share. And with whom.
Each app is required to ask for your permission so you can choose what data to share. The first time a third‑party app wants to access your information — like your location, contacts, calendars, or photos — you receive an alert. Even if you grant access once, you can revoke it later. We also ensure that apps are denied access to certain sensitive data on your device, are unable to modify your device or OS, and are prohibited from obtaining complete access to your data.
Over 215K submissions rejected last year for violating privacy guidelines.
Apps can’t pull your data from other apps.

When you download an app, it should work as promised. Which is why human App Reviewers ensure that the apps on the App Store adhere to our strict app review standards. Our App Store Review Guidelines require apps to be safe, provide a good user experience, comply with our privacy rules, secure devices from malware and threats, and use approved business models.
 Learn more about the App Store Review Guidelines
Every week, over 500 dedicated experts around the world review over 100K apps.
Over 1M submissions rejected for objectionable, harmful, unsafe, or illegal content.
You should never have to worry about inappropriate content.

You should never have to worry about inappropriate content.
We strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store. But we also take steps to make sure apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and we reject apps with any content or behavior that we believe is over the line — especially when it puts children at risk. Every app has an assigned age rating, so parents can determine what is appropriate for their children.
No surprise purchases.
More about No surprise purchases.
No surprise purchases. 
Apps must follow an approved business model and clearly show you the price, tell you what you get with your purchase, and explain subscription-renewal terms up front. Apple sends a receipt each time you use our in‑app purchase feature, and you can also view those purchases and subscriptions in your account. So you won’t get bills out of the blue.
Every day, moderators review worldwide App Store charts for quality and accuracy.
In 2020, we removed over 80M user reviews that were considered spam.
We have removed over 2.3M apps because they haven’t been updated or don’t work on our latest OS releases.

Apple products use industry-leading technology to bring apps to life — so you can experience more of the amazing things your devices are capable of. Thanks to hardware and software designed to work together, you get more out of your apps — from things you take for granted, like supersmooth scrolling, to seeing how a new sofa might look in your living room before you buy it.

We help app developers take advantageof our latest hardware technologies.
We give developers the tools and support to build cutting‑edge technologies into their apps right away — which means they’re yours to enjoy right away. Like when an app uses Face ID or Touch ID for secure access — while keeping the underlying authentication data from your face or fingerprint private. Or when a game controller syncs up easily with a new game on your iPhone. And with our innovations in augmented reality and machine learning, you’ll be seeing even more amazing features in the years to come.
