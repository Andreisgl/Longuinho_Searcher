The past decade has seen the rapid advancement, development, adoption and diffusion of HIT. In general, Health Information Technology is a broad concept and encompasses various functions (i.e., clinical, administrative, managerial) and various goals (i.e., improving efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of the health care system; reducing medical errors; interconnecting clinicians and health care professionals; reducing health care costs; decreasing paperwork; and facilitating the speed of health care delivery). Therefore, the study of HIT is inherently challenging as it involves many facets that are often interconnected. The rapid advancement and proliferation of HIT in the last decade has stimulated an increased interest among academicians in understanding the key drivers of HIT adoption and diffusion. The focus of this dissertation is to assess the value, significance and adoption patterns of HIT at both micro (i.e., physician) and macro (i.e., hospital) levels using alternative theoretical lenses and methodologies. The overall results indicate that the adoption of HIT in its current form at the macro level is not necessarily dependent on organizational, financial or environmental characteristics of hospitals but is more a reflection of targeted policies for facilitating HIT adoption among the late majority hospitals. With the passage of time, the importance of hospital characteristics in terms of HIT adoption is diminishing; particularly for the long-existing HIT applications. On the contrary, the adoption of HIT at the micro level is at least partially driven by organizational factors, such as social and financial influence. Therefore, there is a disconnect between drivers and diffusion of HIT adoption at macro versus micro levels. Successful HIT adoption requires bridging the gap between HIT adoption at the macro and micro levels by promoting the potential benefits of HIT adoption and taking into consideration the unique needs of end-users.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Trillion Dollar Conundrum: Complementarities and Health Information Technology2012 • Avi GoldfarbDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Healthcare EngineeringPrevalence of Electronic Health Records in U.S. Hospitals2015 • Martin  GaynorDownload Free PDFView PDFAdoption of electronic health records , use and acceptance factors2013 • Peter StropkoElectronic health records (EHR) may represent potential beneficence from different aspects, because they are alleged to increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and health, and decrease costs. User adoption is essential in order to realize the benefits of an EHR. While EHR integration nationwide by physicians and other healthcare providers is critical for continuity of patient care, the literature provides evidence of failed clinical system implementations, due to lack of adoption by users (Lorenzi & Riley, 1995; Lorenzi, Riley, Ball, & Douglas, 1995). As the key coordinator and provider of patient care, physician acceptance of an EHR application will determine the overall success of a product’s implementation (Anderson, 1997; Lorenzi & Riley, 1995; Lorenzi, Riley, Blyth, Southon, & Dixon, 1997). However, prior research indicates that physicians will not use a product that interferes with their workflow, changes the way they care for patients or places limitations...Download Free PDFView PDFEssays on health economics and technology adoption2011 • David AutorThis thesis studies the economics of technology adoption in the healthcare industry.

In this study, we aim to assist administrators in understanding the characteristics of top performing hospitals. We utilized data from the Health Information and Management Systems Society and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid to assess 1039 hospitals. Inputs considered were full time equivalents, hospital size, and technology inputs. Technology inputs included personal health records (PHR), electronic medical records (EMRs), computerized physician order entry systems (CPOEs), and electronic access to diagnostic results. Output variables were measures of quality, hospital readmission and mortality rate. The analysis was conducted in a two-stage methodology: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Automatic Interaction Detector Analysis (AID), decision tree regression (DTreg). Overall, we found that electronic access to diagnostic results systems was the most influential technological characteristics; however organizational characteristics were more important than technological inputs. Hospitals that had the highest levels of quality indicated no excess in the use of technology input, averaging one use of a technology component. This study indicates that prudent consideration of organizational characteristics and technology is needed before investing in innovative programs.Download Free PDFView PDFDecision SciencesIT Governance Characteristics, Electronic Medical Records Sophistication, and Financial Performance in U.S. Hospitals: An Empirical Investigation2013 • Randy Bradley, Monica Chiarini  TremblayDownload Free PDFView PDFInformation and Communication Technologies in HealthcareHealth Information Technology in the United States2011 • Stuart  BrotmanDownload Free PDFView PDFHow nurses perceive the impact of health IT applications on their performance and satisfaction: Examining the organizational, social, and personal factors2016 • Sadaf AshtariDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
