I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.20.3 and 1.19.4.
These releases fix 3 security related bugs that could affect users of
MediaWiki. Download links are given at the end of this email.
* By default, the curl library passed 'true' to CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
when establishing an SSL connection, instead of '2'.
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44135>
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42441>
* MediaWiki developer Krenair discovered that the full user object,
including password hash, could be returned when unblocking a user by
the API. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the user to have
permissions to unblock users, by default this is limited to users in
the sysop group.
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43518>
* MediaWiki developer Platonides discovered that the maintenance
script mwdoc-filter.php did not check if it was being run via the CLI,
and could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files if PHP's
register_globals was enabled and the .htaccess file in the maintenance
directory, which by default denies access for all users, was disabled.
