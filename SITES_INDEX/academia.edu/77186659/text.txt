My Last Name, a Space of Compliance and Resistance to White Supremacy in the U.S.Carmen Hernandez-OjedaFourteenth International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, May 2018. In this performance autoethnography, I reflect upon the ways in which my last name becomes a space of compliance and resistance to white supremacy in the U.S. Like millions of individuals in the Southwest of Europe and Latin America, I have two family names—Hernández Ojeda. Yet in the U.S., despite its huge Latinx population, having two last names may turn into a bureaucratic ordeal. Even though Hernández is one of the most popular last names in the Spanish speaking world, many people in the U.S. label it as a middle name and thus, my documents often end up misplaced or lost—which places me in a vulnerable position as an immigrant on a student visa. To prevent legal problems, I decided to self-impose a hyphen in between my disruptive family names, and comply with the cultural white supremacist regime of the single last name. Likewise, the same protective purpose led me to stop using the accent mark on Hernández. Many computer programs only recognize the English alphabet and often, either the system rejects my accented last name or my “á” is transformed into a meaningless symbol. Whenever I see my own hyphenated last name and its naked “a,” or whenever I anglicize the pronunciation of my last name, it reminds me of how much I bend and conform; how much I have to transform my name—and other selves of my identity— if I want to exist and survive within a dominant white culture. Nonetheless, thinking of Sandoval’s differential mode of oppositional consciousness, my assimilated last name becomes a space of resistance as well. I resist with every accent mark that I am able to type on my last name and others’. I resist by having my non-white last name being visible in public spaces designed for and by white people. In the end, no hyphen can erase me and the stories of struggle, social justice, and hope that I carry with me.Download Free PDFView PDFTheory and Practice of Cryptography Solutions for Secure Information SystemsJosef Pieprzyk, Atilla Elçi, Rajan Shankaran, Alexander ChefranovThis is a fast track publication opportunity.

Video games have challenged this concept, as the distance between game players and characters is greatly reduced, if not completely removed, in virtual environments. Games encourage the internalization and psychological merging of a player’s and a character’s mind (Oatley, 1999), a multidimensional concept known as character attachment (CA; Authors, 2008a). Data from our study suggest that dimensions of CA are useful in understanding both pro- and anti-social gaming motivations. Pro-social gamers identify more strongly with their characters, while anti-social gamers are more likely to suspend their disbelief of the game environment and not take responsibility for their virtual actions. Pro-social gaming was more prevalent in older gamers, and younger male game characters were motivated by anti-social reasons.Download Free PDFView PDFDatasets Líneajulian  foreroDownload Free PDFView PDF2015 AERA: “Performance-Based Funding and State Investment in Higher Education”Jennifer DelaneyDelaney, J.
