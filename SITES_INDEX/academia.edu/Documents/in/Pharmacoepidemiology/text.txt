In this study, we investigated the prevalence of perceived medication sensitivity in the general population and its relationship to symptom complaints, information seeking about medications, use of medical care and demographic factors. A nationally representative sample of 1000 New Zealand residents completed the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines scale and symptoms experienced during the previous 7 days. Demographic data and medical visits, medication use and information seeking about medicines were also collected. Over 20% of the general population reported being very sensitive to the effects of medication (20.2%) and that small amounts of medicines can upset their body (25.3%).

(2) Methods: Incident cases of nrNSCLC recorded between 2009 and 2019 (cohort entry) in the pathology registry of the regional administrative healthcare database of Tuscany were identified. Records of antineoplastic therapies delivered up to 4 months following cohort entry were classified as chemotherapy, target therapies, immunotherapies, and undefined monoclonal antibodies. First-line treatment and survival of patients receiving drug treatment was described. Analyses were stratified according to histology, gender, and cohort entry year. (3) Results: 4393 incident cases of nrNSCLC were included. Women with non-squamous-NSCLC received target-therapy more frequently than men (14.9\% vs. 6.5\%). Immunotherapy incidence of use varied between 3.8\% (2017) and 9.1\% (2019). The 2-year survival rate increased over time: for non-squamous-NSCLC, it was 22.3\% (2009–2011) and 30.6\% (2018–2019), while for squamous-NSCLC, it was 13.5\% and 22.5\%, respectively. After multivariate analysis, a low reduction in mortality risk in 2018–2019 vs. 2009–2011 was found (non-squamous: HR: 0.95 CI95\%: 0.92–0.98; squamous: HR: 0.94 CI95\%: 0.90–0.98). Among non-squamous NSCLC, median survival was longer in women than in men (389 vs. 276 days). (4) Conclusion: In light of sex-related biomolecular differences, among non-squamous NSCLC, women received target-therapy more frequently than men. Survival seemed to slightly improve over the study period for both histologies, despite a poor reduction in mortality risk was still observed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marina Ziche and +1Andrea Spini•  14  Pharmacoepidemiology, Survival, Sex Difference, Record LinkageInappropriate medication prescribing in community-dwelling elderly people living in IranSave to LibraryDownloadby Anick Bérard•  19  Geriatrics, Pharmacoepidemiology, Drug interactions, IranFormulation and Evaluation of Metformin Hydrochloride Microspheres by Solvent Evaporation MethodThe aim of the present study was to formulate and evaluate Metformin HCl microspheres to produce a drug delivery system with better pharmaceutical and therapeutic properties.

Metformin HCl microspheres were prepared by using ethyl cellulose as a release retardant polymer by solvent evaporation method .Formulations F1, F2 and F3 were prepared using ethyl cellulose in the drug polymer ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. A plasticizer (N-dibutyl phthalate) was added in formulations F4,F5 and F6 .The prepared microspheres were evaluated for the parameters like Percentage yield, Particle size analysis, Micromeritic properties like angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index, Hausner’s ratio, melting point determination, drug content estimation, microencapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release studies. The in vitro release of Metformin HCl was slow and extended over longer period of time. As the concentration of polymer was increased, the drug release was decreased. The drug release was found to be slow in formulations F4, F5 and F6 when compared to F1, F2 and F3. Thus the study clearly indicated a promising potential of sustained release Metformin HCl microspheres containing ethyl cellulose as rate controlling polymer for effectively treating diabetes mellitus.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsEVALUATION OF ANTIULCER ACTIVITY OF HEPG R.Br USING INDOMETHACIN AND PYLORUS LIGAITON INDUCED GASTRIC ULCER IN RATSPeptic ulcer is a disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract that is caused by gastric acid.

There are various chemical agents available for the treatment of peptic ulcers, but claim serious side effects. Herbal drugs are preferred over chemical agents due to their relatively less toxicity, better acceptability and better compatibility with human body. Lesser adverse effects, economical, effective and easy availability. The present research has been carried out to investigate antiulcer activity of Hydroalcoholic leaf extract of Pisonia grandis R.Br (HEPG) using Indomethacin induced gastric ulcer and Pylorus ligation induced gastric ulcer in wistar rats. Ulcer score, ulcer index and number of ulcers were determined for indomethacin and pylorus ligation induced gastric ulcers. Antiulcer effect of Pisonia grandis R.Br (HEPG) was compared with standard drug omepprazole (20mg/kg). These observations helped us to conclude that Hydroalcoholic leaf extract of Pisonia grandis R.Br had significant antiulcer properties.Save to LibraryDownloadby P SUBATHIRADEVI•  18  Pharmacology, Pharmacoepidemiology, Pharmacogenomics, PharmacovigilanceData mining for signals in spontaneous reporting databases: proceed with cautionSave to LibraryDownloadby Wendy Stephenson•  8  Pharmacoepidemiology, Data Mining, Risk assessment, HumansStudies on Co-Ordination Polymers of 5,5’-(6-(4-Methoxy Phenoxy)-1,3,5-Triazine-2,4-Diyl)Bis(Azanediyl)Diquinolin-8-OlA novel is ligand namely 5,5'-(6-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diyl)bis (azanediyl)diquinolin-8-ol (PBDQ-6) has been prepared and characterized.

It has the half-life of 6 hr and oral bioavailability of 25% due to first pass metabolism. The total daily dose of Carvedilol is 25 mg, hence it required frequent dosing. Transdermal patches of Carvedilol were prepared for sustained release and improve bioavailability of drug and patient compliance. Different formulations were prepared by varying the amount of HPMC-K4M and Eudragit RS-100 by solvent casting method. The prepared formulations were evaluated for various parameters like thickness, tensile strength, folding endurance, % elongation, % moisture content, % moisture uptake, % drug content, In-vitro drug release, In-vitro permeation and skin irritation study. A 32 full factorial design was applied to check the effect of varying the amount of Eudragit-RS 100 (X1) and amount of HPMC-K4M (X2) on the responses i.e. tensile strength and percentage drug released in 20 hr (Q20) as dependent variables. Regression analysis and analysis of variance were performed for dependent variables. In-vitro release data were fitted to various models to ascertain kinetic of drug release. The best selected formulation is subjected to in-vitro skin permeation and skin irritation study. Batch F7 was considered optimum batch which contained 400 mg of Eudragit RS-100 and 600 mg of HPMC-K4M, showed release 95.73% up to 24 hr and was more similar to Zero order release kinetics (r2=0.982). Batch F7 showed flux of 125.8 μg/cm2/h, hence the patch area of 1.33 cm2 would be expected to deliver targeted flux of 83.72μg/cm2/h.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsAnalytical method development & validation for related substances method of Busulfan injection by Ion chromatography MethodA new simple, accurate, precise and reproducible Ion chromatography method has been developed for the estimation of Methane sulfonic acid in Busulfan injectable dosage.

Initially an attempt was given to mask the bitter taste of the drug by inclusion complexation with β-Cyclodextrin using kneading method. But from gustatory evaluation, it was found that β-Cyclodextrin was not proven good for effective taste masking. So, another attempt was given to mask bitter taste of Levocetrizine diHCl by Kyron T-114 (weak cation exchange resin). It is a water-insoluble, high molecular weight, cross linked polymer of methacrylic acid. Kyron T-114 is inexpensive and this method is simple, rapid and cost-effective method for taste masking. Ion exchange resin complex was prepared by the batch technique and various parameters viz. resin activation, drug: resin ratio, pH, temperature, swelling time and stirring time were optimized to successfully formulate the tasteless Drug Resin Complex (DRC). Maximum drug loading was obtained when the resin was activated by acid treatment, with 1:3 drug: resin ratio, soaked in water for 90 min. and stirred with the drug for 240 minutes, pH maintained 5.5 and temperature maintained 30áµ’C. Complexation was confirmed by FT-IR and DSC study. The drug resin complex was evaluated for taste in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation. The volunteers rated the complexes as tasteless and agreeable. Drug release from DRC in salivary pH was insufficient to impart bitter taste. Complete drug release was observed at gastric 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2). Formulation of drug resin complex was confirmed by FT-IR and DSC studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsFormulation and Evaluation of Enteric Coated Delayed Release Tablets of Omeprazole for Duodenal UlcerThe objective of present study was to develop pharmaceutically elegant and stable enteric coated tablet formulation for highly unstable drug in acidic environment using pH dependent polymers.

Omeprazole is a specific and non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme H+/K+-ATPase. It is unstable in conditions of low pH and required protection from the effects of gastric acid when given orally so it is formulated in the form of enteric coated dosage forms. The core tablets were prepared by direct compression method using different concentration of crospovidone as a super disintegrant. Formulations showing less disintegration time were first subcoated with HPMC 15 cps upto 3% weight gain, followed by enteric coating with Eudragit L 100, Eudragit L 100-55 and Cellulose acetate phthalate. Pre and post compression evaluation of core and coated tablets were carried out. In vitro drug release studies were conducted in acidic and basic media to determine the appropriate coating ratio. All batches enteric coated with 8% weight gain of three polymers showed stable coating in 0.1 N HCl for 2 hours. Formulated batch F11 with 7% weight gain of Eudragit L 100-55 showed stable coating in 0.1 N HCl and had shown complete drug release in phosphate buffer pH 6.8. The prepared enteric coated tablets exhibited good physical and chemical stability, when subjected to accelerated stability studies. Further, when compared to marketed formulation (OPT tablet 20 mg Omeprazole), the prepared enteric coated tablets showed excellent similarities with marketed product (with respect to drug content, disintegration time and drug release) thereby establishing bioequivalence with marketed product.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsOverview on Impurity ProfilingImpurity profiling is the process of acquiring and evaluating data that establishes biological safety of an individual impurity.

Impurity is considered as any other organic material, besides the drug substance, or ingredients, arise out of synthesis or unwanted chemicals that remains with API’s. The control of impurities is currently a critical issue to the pharmaceutical industry. International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) formulated guidelines regarding the control of impurities. Various regulatory authorities like ICH, USFDA, Canadian Drug and Health Agency are emphasizing on the purity requirements and the identification of impurities in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient’s (API’s). Identification of impurities is done by TLC, HPLC, The advent of hyphenated techniques has revolutionized impurity profiling, by not only separation but structural elucidation of impurities as well. The most exploited techniques, for impurity profiling of drugs are LC-MS-MS, LC-NMR, LC-NMR- MS, GC-MS, and LC-MS.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsA Mild and Efficient Synthesis of Benzimidazole by Using Zinc Chloride Under Solvent Free ConditionA straightforward, efficient and more sustainable solvent-free method has been developed for the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives to achieve yields that were comparable to or better than, those in conventional media.

Several types of medicinal plants are exists in the nature and effective in different type of disease. Peptic ulcers are a broad term that includes ulcers of digestive tract in the stomach or the duodenum. The formation of peptic ulcers depends on the presence of acid and peptic activity in gastric juice plus a breakdown in mucosal defenses. There are two major factors that can disrupt the mucosal resistance to injury: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) example, aspirin and Helicobacter pylori infection. Numerous natural products have been evaluated as therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including peptic ulcer. This article reviews the anti-acid/anti-peptic, gastro-protective and/or antiulcer properties of the most commonly employed herbal medicines. This article will be concerned only the pharmacology of that plant which shows the antiulcer and gastro-protective effects and among all the plants which one is more potent for anti-ulcer activity.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsPharmacognostical standardisation of The Roots of Ziziphus Oenoplia (l.) mill, RHAMNACEAEZiziphus oenoplia Linn., Mill, is a commonly occurring thorny shrub found to have many uses such as anthelmintic, antiseptic, hepatoprotective, stomachalgia, digestive etc. It is also used in ascaris infection and healing of wounds.

It is indicated for the relief of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Aceclofenac is BCS class II drug with low solubility and high permeability. Micronization technique is used to increase the solubility and thus dissolution of Aceclofenac. The micronization was done using jet mill micronizer. The initial particle size of drug is 297.33 µ (D90) which was reduced to particle size 121.87 µ (D90) with single micronization, particle size 116.08 µ (D90) with double micronization and 89.23 µ (D90) with triple micronization of drug. It was observed that the solubility and thus dissolution of Aceclofenac was increased in principle media of 6.8 phosphate buffer and discriminating media 4.5 Acetate buffer with single, double and triple micronization. Thus, it can be justified that micronization is one of the good technique for enhancement of solubility of Aceclofenac by reduction of particle size of drug.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsAn Overview on Osmotic Controlled Drug Delivery SystemThis paper reviews constructed drug delivery systems applying osmotic principles for controlled drug release from the formulation.

Osmotic devices which are tablets coated with walls of controlled porosity are the most promising strategy based systems for controlled drug delivery. In contrast to common tablets, these pumps provide constant (zero order) drug release rate. When these systems are exposed to water, low levels of water soluble additive is leached from polymeric material i.e. semipermeable membrane and drug releases in a controlled manner over an extended period of time. The main clinical benefits of oral osmotic drug delivery system are their ability to improve treatment tolerability and patient compliance. These advantages are mainly driven by the capacity to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, independent of the drug chemical properties, of the patient’s physiological factors or following food intake. This review brings out the theoretical concept of drug delivery, history, advantages and disadvantages of the delivery systems, types of oral osmotic drug delivery systems, factors affecting the drug delivery system and marketed products.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsISSUE LEADERSHIP THEORY AND ITS STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP IN GLOBAL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS: BUILDING TRUST AND SOCIAL CAPITALTo function effectively in both the near and distant future, leaders in global organizations must understand, develop and exercise trust and social capital.

The competitive landscape in the new millennium necessitates that firms develop strategic flexibility. To do so, they must continuously renew their knowledge stock and produce innovations. To implement these strategies, leaders must build effective relationships among members and units in the organization. This relational capital is based on trust and eventually leads to the development of internal social capital. Leaders must also build effective relationships with external constituencies. This is often accomplished through strategic alliances. Similarly, leaders must build mutual trust among alliance partners that over time leads to the development of external social capital. When employees trust leaders, they are more likely to be committed to the organization’s goals, willing to develop firm-specific knowledge and likely to exercise creativity.

Effective PAT implementation comprise of science-based understanding of the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of all elements of the proposed drug product. The overall PAT venture is promising for delivering an integrated systems approach for quality design, process analysis, understanding and control, continuous improvement, knowledge and risk-based management. The incorporation of early PAT devices, increase process efficiency and safety by acting on data in real time and by eliminating sampling. PAT applications, increase detailed knowledge of processes, leading to increased robustness and greater processing opportunities. Modern developments in analytical technologies provide chemical and analytical insights for all types of chemical reactions and process monitoring such as drying, distillations, crystallizations, hydrogenations, and others.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsIncreased use of second generation antipsychotic drugs in primary care: potential relevance for hospitalizations in schizophrenia patientsSave to LibraryDownloadby Adrián LLerena•  21  Primary Care, Epidemiology, Pharmacoepidemiology, Primary Health CareAn overview of Preparation, Evaluation and Applications of Multiple EmulsionsMultiple emulsions are also known as emulsions of emulsions, liquid membrane system or double emulsion.

Multiple emulsions are polydispersed systems where both oil in water & water in oil emulsions exist simultaneously. This review focuses on preparation, characterization and potential applications of multiple emulsions. Multiple emulsions can be classified as water-in oil-in water (W/O/W) or oil-in-water-in-oil (O/W/O) emulsions. This review described five methods to prepare multiple emulsions viz. two-step emulsification method, modified two-step emulsification method, phase inversion method, membrane emulsification & micro channel emulsification method. The Multiple emulsion is characterized by average globule size & size distribution, area of interfaces, number of globules, rheological evaluation, zeta potential, percentage drug entrapment, In-vitro drug release. Multiple emulsions have been proposed to have numerous uses including their use as prolonged drug delivery system.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsFORMULATION AND EVALUATION OF ORODISPERSIBLE TABLETS OF BACLOFENSave to LibraryDownloadby sayali kapure•  40  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsA Review on Mucoadhesive Microspheres as a Novel Drug Delivery SystemThe objective of this article is to review the principles underlying the development and evaluation of mucoadhesive microspheres and the research work carried out on these systems.

Mucoadhesion is a topic of current interest in the design of drug delivery systems. Mucoadhesion is commonly defined as the adhesion between two materials, at least one of which is a mucosal surface. Mucoadhesive microspheres may be designed to enable a prolonged residence time at the site of application or absorption and facilitate an intimate contact with the underlying absorption surface and thus contribute to improved and/or better therapeutic performance of drugs. In recent years such mucoadhesive microspheres have been developed for oral, buccal, nasal, ocular, rectal and vaginal routes for either systemic or local effects. This review article aims to provide an overview of the various aspects of mucoadhesion, mucoadhesive materials, factors affecting mucoadhesion, evaluating methods, and various mucoadhesive drug delivery systems.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsEfficacy and safety of biologics in relapsing polychondritis: a French national multicentre studyObjectives To assess the efficacy and the safety of biologics in a cohort of patients with relapsing polychondritis (RP).

Methods We conducted a French multicentre retrospective cohort study including patients treated with biologics for RP. Efficacy outcomes were clinical response (partial or complete) and complete response during the first 6 months of exposure, plus daily corticosteroid dose at 6 months. Other outcomes were adverse drug reactions (ADRs), persistence of biologics and factors associated with a response. Results This study included 41 patients exposed to 105 biologics (tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, n=60; tocilizumab, n=17; anakinra, n=15; rituximab, n=7; abatacept, n=6). Overall response rate during the first 6 months of exposure was 62.9%. Complete response rate was 19.0%. Reduced corticosteroid doses were highly variable among patients. ADRs were mostly infections (n=42). Reasons for biologic withdrawal (73.3%) were insufficient efficacy (34.3%; ranging from 23.5% for tocilizumab to 72.7% for etanercept), loss of efficacy (18.1%) and ADRs (20.9%; mostly for anakinra: 46.7%). Persistence was comparable among biologic classes. Among TNF inhibitors, the highest persistence was observed with adalimumab. Differences in clinical response rates were observed depending on biologics and organ involvement. There were trends towards a lower response rate in cases with associated myelodysplastic syndrome and for a higher response rate for nasal/auricular chondritis, sternal chondritis and concomitant exposure to non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Conclusions This study describes the efficacy of biologics for refractory RP. However, the number of complete responses was low and there were concerns about the risk of ADRs, particularly infections.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aurore  Palmaro and +1Maryse  Lapeyre-mestre•  2  Pharmacoepidemiology, Clinical EpidemiologyEvaluation of Anti-Cataract Activity of Asparagus Racemosus Root Extract using In-Vitro Model of Goat LensThe aim of the present work to evaluate the anticataract activity of aqueous extract of Asparagus racemosus root using in vitro model of goat lens.

In the in vitro study, goat lenses were incubated in artificial aqueous humor containing 55 mM glucose (cataractogenesis) with aqueous extract of Asparagus racemosus root (AEAR) at different concentrations of 250 μg/ml and 500μg/ml at room temperature for 72 hours. Biochemical parameters studied in the lens were electrolytes (Na+, Ca+, and K+), total proteins, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and Catalase. Photographic evaluation was also done. AEAR significantly prevented the glucose induced changes in biochemical parameters like sodium, calcium, and potassium, total proteins, MDA, SOD, GSH and Catalase. Photographic evaluation also indicated that AEAR prevented the opacity of the lens compared to model control group in vitro. These results suggest that prevention of cataract by aqueous extract of Asparagus racemosus root may be through a mechanism involving free radical scavenging, preventing lipid peroxidation and direct antioxidative capacity.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsOverview of drug data within french health insurance databases and implications for pharmacoepidemiological studiesIn this study, we aimed to provide an updated overview of drug data contained in the French health insurance database (SNIIRAM) and its associated national representative sample (EGB).

This paper identified most common problems concerning drug data: (i) change in level of coverage of drugs of interest (drug no more eligible for reimbursement, or no more prescription-only), (ii) break in patient eligibility (in connection with change of healthcare plan or patients’ identifier), and (iii) technical and regulatory issues. We provide a brief checklist to enable a structured identification of these issues. The impact of gap in drug data availability on study validity will depend on the research question, drug, setting and population of interest. The French health insurance database and associated sample are valuable resources for pharmacoepidemiological research. There is a need to pursue further methodological and validation studies to promote accurate and transparent use of French health insurance databases for pharmacoepidemiology.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aurore  Palmaro and +3Guillaume  MoulisFabien  DespasJulie Dupouy•  3  Pharmacoepidemiology, Health Services Research, Pharmacology, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacoeconomicsDipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor Associated Pancreatic Carcinoma: A Review of the FDA AERS DatabaseStudy Objective: To describe the comparative incidence of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and pancreatic carcinoma as reportedly available in the FDA AERS database.

To date, there is limited literature concerning regarding the association between DPP-4 inhibitors and pancreatic carcinoma. Our goal was to provide health care practitioners a general understanding of the drug-disease occurrence.Design: Retrospective cohort studyData Source: We used Empirica Signal software to query AERS from November 1968 to December 31, 2013. The software was used to calculate a disproportionality statistic, namely the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM), for reports of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors -associated pancreatic carcinoma. The FDA considers an EBGM significant if the 5th percentile of the distribution is at least two (EB05 > 2.0). With use of a disproportionality analysis, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors was compared with all agents listed in AERS.Measurements and Main Results: One hundred fifty six patients who experience pancreatic carcinoma while receiving dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor therapy.  An EB05 of 10.3 was determined for sitagliptin compared to all other agents included in AERS. Based on the available data patient characteristics were: 44% males, average age of 70 y/o and average duration of treatment with sitagliptin of 460 days.  At the time of the report none of the reported cases recovered and of these there were 28 reported deaths within the sitagliptin patients.Conclusion:  There appears to be a statistical association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor use and pancreatic carcinoma. Causality cannot be inferred from the data provided. Additional clinical studies are needed to further explore this statistical association.Save to LibraryDownloadby Robbert P. van Manen•  6  Pharmacoepidemiology, Pharmacovigilance, Drug Safety, Medicine, Pharmacovigilance, Pharmacology, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacoeconomicsNextLast »Related TopicsPharmacovigilanceFollowFollowingPharmacoeconomicsFollowFollowingMaster in Business administrationFollowFollowingPharmacyFollowFollowingHollywoodFollowFollowingClinical PharmacologyFollowFollowingPharmacy PracticeFollowFollowingPharmacogenomicsFollowFollowingPharmacologyFollowFollowingMaterial Requirement PlanningFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
