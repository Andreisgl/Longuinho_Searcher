Whereas controlled processes are slow and effortful, automatic processes are fast and involuntary. Over the past decade, we have propelled a research trajectory investigating how top-down influence in the form of suggestion can allow individuals to modulate the automaticity of cognitive processes. Here we present an overarching array of converging findings that collectively indicate that certain individuals can derail involuntary processes, such as reading, by " unringing " the proverbial bell. We examine replications of these effects from both our own laboratory and independent groups, and extend our Stroop findings to several other well-established automatic paradigms, including the McGurk effect. We thus demonstrate how, in the case of highly suggestible individuals, suggestion seems to wield control over a process that is likely even more automatic than the Stroop effect. Finally, we present findings from two novel experimental paradigms exploring the potential of shifting automaticity in the opposite direction e i.e., transforming, without practice, a controlled task into one that is automatic. Drawing on related evidence from the neuroscience of contemplative practices, we discuss how these findings pave the road to a more scientific understanding of voluntary control and automaticity, and expound on their possible experimental and therapeutic applications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael Lifshitz and +1I.

First we review behavioral economic research that explains and documents the contribution of temporal discounting to addiction. This is followed with recent insights from neuroeconomics that may provide an explanation of why drug dependent individuals discount the future. Specifically, neuroeconomics has identified two competing neural systems that are related to temporal discounting using brain-imaging techniques that examine the relative activation of different brain regions for temporal discounting. According to the competing neural systems account, choices for delayed outcomes are related to the prefrontal cortex (i.e., the “executive system”) and choices for immediate outcomes are related to the limbic brain regions (i.e., the “impulsive system”). Temporal discounting provides a useful framework for future imaging research, and suggests a novel approach to designing effective drug dependence prevention and treatment programs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Samuel G .

Because age is one of the highest risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, the need for automated brain image analysis has significantly increased. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used modality to image brain. MRI provides high tissue contrast; hence, the existing brain image analysis methods have often preferred the intensity information to others, such as texture. Recently, an easy-to- compute texture descriptor, local binary pattern (LBP), has shown promise in various applications outside the medical field. In this paper, after extensive experiments, we show that rotation-invariant LBP is invariant to some common MRI artifacts that makes it possible to use it in various high-level brain MR image analysis applications.Save to LibraryDownloadby ahmet ekin•  18  Algorithms, Brain Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, AgingTheory of mind impairments in euthymic bipolar patientsSave to LibraryDownloadby Isabel Dziobek•  18  Brain Imaging, Bipolar Disorder, Social Cognition, Theory of MindSegmentation de tumeurs cérébrales et intégration dans un modèle de l'anatomie Brain tumor segmentation and integration in an anatomical modelAn original methodology is proposed for the representa- tion, using MRI acquisitions, of cereberal structures in the presence of non-infiltrating pathology.

The implantation of probes causes acute tissue damage, partially due to vasculature disruption during probe implantation. This trauma can cause abnormal electrophysiological responses and temporary increases in neurotransmitter levels, and perpetuate chronic immune responses. A significant challenge for investigators is to examine neurovascular features below the surface of the brain in vivo. The objective of this study was to investigate localized bleeding resulting from inserting microscale neural probes into the cortex using two-photon microscopy (TPM) and to explore an approach to minimize blood vessel disruption through insertion methods and probe design. 3D TPM images of cortical neurovasculature were obtained from mice and used to select preferred insertion positions for probe insertion to reduce neurovasculature damage. There was an 82.8 ± 14.3% reduction in neurovascular damage for probes inserted in regions devoid of major (>5 µm) sub-surface vessels. Also, the deviation of surface vessels from the vector normal to the surface as a function of depth and vessel diameter was measured and characterized. 68% of the major vessels were found to deviate less than 49 µm from their surface origin up to a depth of 500 µm. Inserting probes more than 49 µm from major surface vessels can reduce the chances of severing major sub-surface neurovasculature without using TPM.Save to LibraryDownloadby Takashi D Y Kozai•  15  Image Processing, Brain Imaging, Brain-computer interfaces, Multiphoton MicroscopyRole of Drosophila calcium channel cacophony in dopaminergic neurodegeneration andneuroprotectionSave to LibraryDownloadby Lyle Wiemerslage•  9  Brain Imaging, Obesity, Parkinson's Disease, DiabetesAbstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brainSave to LibraryDownloadby laurent  COHEN•  11  Cognitive Science, Brain Imaging, Brain, HumansNicotine-induced brain metabolism associated with anger provocationSave to LibraryDownloadby Jean  Gehricke and +3Sandra LoughlinLarry D.

Differentiating structural causes of altered mental status from metabolic etiologies is of utmost importance in diagnostic approach and management of the patients. Among many biomarkers proposed to help stratifying patients with altered mental status, spinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase appears to be the most promising biomarker to predict cellular necrosis. In this cross sectional study we measured spinal fluid level of lactate dehydrogenase in children 2 months to 12 years of age admitted to a single center intensive care unit over one year. Spinal fluid level of lactate dehydrogenase in 40 pediatric cases of febrile seizure was also determined as the control group. The study group included 35 boys (58.3%) and 25 girls (41.7%). Their mean age was 2.7+/-3 years and their mean spinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase level was 613.8+/-190.4 units/liter.

Neuroimaging studies that focus on this age range may provide unique insights into the onset and course of psychosis. In this review, we examine the evidence from 2 unique longitudinal cohorts that span the ages from early childhood through young adulthood; a study of childhood-onset schizophrenia where patients and siblings are followed from ages 6 through to their early twenties, and an ultra-high risk study where subjects (mean age of 19 years) are studied before and after the onset of psychosis. From the available evidence, we make an argument that subtle, regionally specific, and genetically influenced alterations during developmental age windows influence the course of psychosis and the resultant brain phenotype. The importance of examining trajectories of development and the need for future combined approaches,using multimodal imaging together with molecular studiesis discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nora S Vyas•  12  Neuroscience, Abnormal Psychology, Psychosis, Brain ImagingCREATING MEANING WITH PRINT: THE TRANSACTIVE MODEL OF READINGThis short article describes and demonstrates the 3 cueing systems the brain used to identify words during the act of reading.

These issues concern trust between the human user and automated or AI tools of interest, resilience, safety, and transparency. To tackle these issues, we advocate the development of practical AI-ATCO teaming frameworks by bringing together concepts and theories from neuroscience and explainable AI (XAI). By pooling together knowledge from both ATCO and AI perspectives, we seek to establish confidence in AI-enabled technologies for ATCOs. In this review, we present an overview of the extant studies that shed light on the research and development of trusted human-AI systems, and discuss the prospects of extending such works to building better trusted ATCO-AI systems. This paper contains three sections elucidating trust-related human performance, AI and explainable AI (XAI), and human-AI teaming. [COPYRIGHT CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, J. Y.

This measure provides us with information on a patient&#39;s clinical situation and adverse treatment effects. Radiotherapy has been regarded as the main cause of cognitive decline in these patients, because children with brain tumours can develop intellectual deterioration caused by radiotherapy. In long-term surviving patients, radiotherapy may indeed lead to cognitive deficits, or even dementia. Recent studies, however, have made clear that focal radiotherapy in patients with glioma is not the main reason for cognitive deficits. The tumour itself and other medical treatments contribute largely to the cognitive deficits. Cognitive function is now also recognised as an independent prognostic factor in the survival of glioma patients. Additionally, cognitive deterioration can be the first indicator of progressive disease after trea...Save to LibraryDownloadby Martin Klein•  17  Brain Imaging, Radiotherapy, Brain, HumansMapping perception to action in piano practice: a longitudinal DC-EEG studyPerforming music requires fast auditory and motor processing.

Regarding professional musicians, recent brain imaging studies have demonstrated that auditory stimulation produces a co-activation of motor areas, whereas silent tapping of musical phrases evokes a co-activation in auditory regions. Whether this is obtained via a specific cerebral relay station is unclear. Furthermore, the time course of plasticity has not yet been addressed. Changes in cortical activation patterns (DC-EEG potentials) induced by short (20 minute) and long term (5 week) piano learning were investigated during auditory and motoric tasks. Two beginner groups were trained. The &#39;map&#39; group was allowed to learn the standard piano key-to-pitch map. For the &#39;no-map&#39; group, random assignment of keys to tones prevented such a map. Auditory-sensorimotor EEG co-activity occurred within only 20 minutes. The effect was enhanced after 5-week training, contributing elements of both perception and action ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Eckart Altenmüller•  25  Cognitive Science, Music, Brain Imaging, Auditory PerceptionThe Architecture of Cognitive Control in the Human Prefrontal CortexThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control: the ability to coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals.
