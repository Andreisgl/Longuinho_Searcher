Kennedy (ed.), Brill’s Companion to the Reception of Aeschylus, Leiden; Boston: Brill 2017, 179-202.Christos SimelidisAeschylus was rather less known in Byzantium than Euripides and Sophocles, but was nonetheless read at schools and there survive several references, citations and allusions in a variety of texts. A selection of three plays, Prometheus Vinctus, Septem contra Thebas, and Persae, the so-called ‘Byzantine triad’, is found in many more manuscripts than the rest, often with marginal commentaries for school use. The manuscript transmission is not good for the rest of the plays and there are cases where it is impossible to recover what Aeschylus wrote. There are also a number of variant readings that are difficult to evaluate, and it is unclear if these are ancient or simply the conjectures of Byzantine scholars. Modern scholars sometimes allow for two incompatible views: a very limited number of independent witnesses throughout Byzantium and, at the same time, a significant number of variant readings which they do not assign to Byzantine scholars. Demetrius Triclinius (fourteenth century) was the leading Byzantine scholar on Greek tragedy and made an original and lasting contribution to the textual criticism of Aeschylus. Some early Church Fathers (e.g., St Basil, Theodoret of Cyrus) refer positively to Aeschylus’ grandiloquence, while later Byzantine scholars (Michael Psellus, John Tzetzes) consider Aeschylus difficult and obscure. Psellus (eleventh century) anticipated some of the arguments used recently to challenge the authenticity of Prometheus. Eustathius of Thessalonica (twelfth century) is the first to report that the Byzantine political verse was thought to be similar to some trochaic tetrameter catalectics found in Persae. Several Byzantine authors, mostly from the twelfth century, cite or allude to Aeschylean lines. Such allusions are usually linguistic borrowings intended to impress a learned audience and they are not meaningful in an intertextual way. Some Aeschylean phrases also became proverbial (sometimes already in Late Antiquity) and occur in several Byzantine authors.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMedioevo greco 19The Tragedies from a Byzantine Perspective: Book Epigrams on Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides2019 • Maria Tomadaki, Emilie M. van OpstallThe present article contributes to the understanding of the reception of ancient drama in Byzantium by examining a wide range of book epigrams, that accompany the classical tragedies in Byzantine manuscripts. These epigrams –hypotheseis, encomiastic poems, verse scholia, titles and colophons– are mostly related to the so-called triads, the set of tragedies used in the Byzantine school curriculum. The article begins with an introduction on the main characteristics of the book epigrams (section I), continues with three sections dedicated to Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides (sections II-IV) and ends with one section on the short epigrams marking the ending of the tragedies in the manuscripts (section V). The article offers short overviews of the book epigrams attached to the work of each tragedian and discusses a number of remarkable examples, providing insight into Byzantine reader responses to ancient drama.Download Free PDFView PDFR.F.

Particularly interesting is the possibility of a Late Antique hypomnema on PV still surviving in the Middle-Byzantine age: it could be the same as the hypomnema implied by some misplaced lemmas among the Medicean scholia on PV, probably the remaining traces of a wrong transcription.Download Free PDFView PDFBrill's Companion to the Reception of AeschylusTheodore ZiolkowskiDownload Free PDFView PDFBook Review di R.

Aristotle argued that tragedy originated from Dithyramb (see the Tragic Chorus in Ancient Literary and Philosophical Theory, and Dithyramb), and this may explain its pervasive presence, but tragic authors make the chorus allude to and perform in several other lyric genres (see Relation to Lyric Genres). Recent research on the tragic chorus has focused on performance (see Music, and Dance) and on the social interpretation both of choruses within the play (see Choral Identity) and of the chorus in social life (see Political and Ritual Dimensions, and Performance, Competition, and the Dramatic Festivals). Most of the choral sections were sung (“lyric sections”); they were written in meters that were sharply different from those of recited speech, and much more complex (see Lyric Meters). The language of sung sections was also distinctive (see Style). Choral sections are especially long and complex in Aeschylus (see especially Agamemnon), but their role is equally crucial for the interpretation of the plays of Sophocles and Euripides (see e.g., Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Antigone; Euripides’ Medea, Trojan Women, and Bacchae). The chorus virtually disappeared from 4th-century tragedy, except for short interludes, but in the only extant 4th-century tragedy, the Rhesus attributed to Euripides (see Pseudo-Euripides, Rhesus), the chorus still has a crucial part in the plot.
