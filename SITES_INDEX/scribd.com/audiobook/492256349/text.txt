This fine, affecting memoir will stay with me for a very long time.”—Meg Wolitzer, author of The Female Persuasion“In this vividly written memoir novelist O’Hara shares a painful but ultimately beautiful account of her daughter Caitlin’s life with cystic fibrosis. . . . Her compelling story will resonate with anyone seeking a light in the darkest depths of grief.”—Library JournalIn the vein of The Year of Magical Thinking and Beautiful Boy, an emotionally raw and inspiring memoir that illuminates a mother’s grief over the loss of her adult child and considers the hope of soulful connections that transcend the boundary of life and death.When their only child was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) at the age of two, Maryanne O’Hara and her husband were told that Caitlin could live a long life or be dead in a matter of months. Thirty-one years later, Caitlin lost her battle with this devastating disease following an excruciating two-year wait on the transplant list and a last-minute race to locate a pair of healthy lungs. The sudden spiral of events left Maryanne in an existential crisis, searching to find an answer to the eternal question: Why we are here? During her final years, Caitlin had become a source of wisdom and comfort for her mother—the partner with whom she shared a deep spiritual quest to understand what it meant to have a soul. After Caitlin’s passing, Maryanne began to notice signs—poignant, persistent synchronicities that seemed to lean toward proof of Caitlin’s enduring presence.Weaving together a series of interconnected meditations with illuminating glimpses of life rendered via text messages, e-mails, and journal entries, Little Matches is a profound reflection on life and death, motherhood, the pain of chronic uncertainty, and finding inspiration in the unexpected sparks that light our way through the darkness.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextMedicalSelf-ImprovementNew Age & SpiritualityLanguageEnglishPublisherHarperAudioRelease dateApr 20, 2021ISBN9780063027787Switch to ebookStart your free  daysPlay sampleSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to Little MatchesRelated audiobooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextWhat Does It Feel Like to Die?: Inspiring New Insights into the Experience of DyingAudiobookWhat Does It Feel Like to Die?: Inspiring New Insights into the Experience of DyingbyJennie DearRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save What Does It Feel Like to Die?: Inspiring New Insights into the Experience of Dying for laterThe Perfect Other: A Memoir of My SisterAudiobookThe Perfect Other: A Memoir of My SisterbyKyleigh LeddyRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save The Perfect Other: A Memoir of My Sister for laterCrossing the River Sorrow: One Nurse's StoryAudiobookCrossing the River Sorrow: One Nurse's StorybyJanet RichardsRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Crossing the River Sorrow: One Nurse's Story for laterThe Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and DyingAudiobookThe Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and DyingbyNina RiggsRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save The Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and Dying for laterEyes to the Wind: A Memoir of Love and Death, Hope and ResistanceAudiobookEyes to the Wind: A Memoir of Love and Death, Hope and ResistancebyAdy BarkanRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Eyes to the Wind: A Memoir of Love and Death, Hope and Resistance for laterThe Blink of an Eye: A Memoir of Dying--and Learning How to Live AgainAudiobookThe Blink of an Eye: A Memoir of Dying--and Learning How to Live AgainbyRikke Schmidt KjærgaardRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save The Blink of an Eye: A Memoir of Dying--and Learning How to Live Again for laterWidowish: A MemoirAudiobookWidowish: A MemoirbyMelissa GouldRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Widowish: A Memoir for laterUntil I Say Good-Bye: My Year of Living with JoyAudiobookUntil I Say Good-Bye: My Year of Living with JoybySusan Spencer-WendelRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Until I Say Good-Bye: My Year of Living with Joy for laterWhen Force Meets Fate: A Mission to Solve an Invisible IllnessAudiobookWhen Force Meets Fate: A Mission to Solve an Invisible IllnessbyJamison HillRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save When Force Meets Fate: A Mission to Solve an Invisible Illness for laterShe Danced with Lightning: My Daughter's Struggle with Epilepsy and Her Boundless Will to LiveAudiobookShe Danced with Lightning: My Daughter's Struggle with Epilepsy and Her Boundless Will to LivebyMarc PalmieriRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save She Danced with Lightning: My Daughter's Struggle with Epilepsy and Her Boundless Will to Live for laterThe Beginning of Everything: The Year I Lost My Mind and Found MyselfAudiobookThe Beginning of Everything: The Year I Lost My Mind and Found MyselfbyFindawayRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save The Beginning of Everything: The Year I Lost My Mind and Found Myself for laterWeekends at BellevueAudiobookWeekends at BellevuebyFindawayRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Weekends at Bellevue for laterMy Glory Was I Had Such Friends: A MemoirAudiobookMy Glory Was I Had Such Friends: A MemoirbyAmy SilversteinRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save My Glory Was I Had Such Friends: A Memoir for laterSlow Dancing with a Stranger: Lost and Found in the Age of Alzheimer'sAudiobookSlow Dancing with a Stranger: Lost and Found in the Age of Alzheimer'sbyMeryl ComerRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Slow Dancing with a Stranger: Lost and Found in the Age of Alzheimer's for laterAmerican Daughter: A MemoirAudiobookAmerican Daughter: A MemoirbyStephanie Thornton PlymaleRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save American Daughter: A Memoir for laterGone: A Memoir of Love, Body, and Taking Back My LifeAudiobookGone: A Memoir of Love, Body, and Taking Back My LifebyLinda K.
