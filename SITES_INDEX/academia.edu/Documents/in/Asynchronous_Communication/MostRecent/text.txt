Among all such visual decision making problems, those with discrete action spaces often tend to have underlying compositional structure in the said action space. Such action spaces often contain actions such as go left, go up as well as go diagonally up and left (which is a composition of the former two actions). The representations of control policies in such domains have traditionally been modeled without exploiting this inherent compositional structure in the action spaces. We propose a new learning paradigm, Factored Action space Representations (FAR) wherein we decompose a control policy learned using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into independent components, analogous to decomposing a vector in terms of some orthogonal basis vectors. This architectural modification of the control policy representation allows the agent to learn a...Save to LibraryDownloadby Sahil Sharma•  8  Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning, Q LearningE-Learning and Students' Motivation: A Research Study on the Effect of E-Learning on Higher EducationThe information technology educational programs at most universities in Egypt face many obstacles that can be overcome using technology enhanced learning.

An open source Moodle e-learning platform has been implemented at many universities in Egypt, as an aid to deliver e-content and to provide the institution with various possibilities for implementing asynchronous e-learning web-based modules. This paper shows that the use of interactive features of e-learning increases the motivation of the undergraduate students for the learning process.Save to LibraryDownloadby Samir Abou El-Seoud•  5  Computer Science, Higher Education, Asynchronous Communication, E LearningPerformance Evaluation of Choreographies and Orchestrations with a New Simulator for Service CompositionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Feliz Batista•  6  Computer Science, Service Oriented Architecture, Quality of Service, ImplementationTeaching during COVID-19: reflections of early-career science teachersThe unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic required that instruction be shifted online through asynchronous, synchronous, or hybrid models of instruction.

This created a need for many K-12 teachers to dramatically rethink how teaching and learning occurred in their classrooms. In this study, we investigate the experiences of early-career science teachers who were in their first year of teaching when the pandemic struck. Using a comparative case study and an analytical framework focused on technology-related leader practices, we explore the unique opportunities for technology-based leadership that emerged for early-career teachers during the pandemic. We posit that the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic presented novel opportunities for early-career teachers to assume leadership roles that were embedded within the classroom teaching experience, which created unique opportunities for innovation and leadership in teaching.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeanna Wieselmann•  6  Medicine, Asynchronous Communication, Online Teaching, PandemicEngaging the Community Through a Consultancy-Based Group PracticumUpon discovering inequities and foundational issues with the previous practicum projects completed individually by each EdD student, Frostburg State University transformed its practicum into a consultancy-based group project that students... moreUpon discovering inequities and foundational issues with the previous practicum projects completed individually by each EdD student, Frostburg State University transformed its practicum into a consultancy-based group project that students complete remotely. In this revised experience, student teams respond to problems of practice as presented by community partners within diverse educational settings. This article explicates the structure, format, and process of the new practicum experience, describes how it aligns with CPED’s guiding principles for program design, and provides rich benefits for EdD students and local educational organizations. We also explain how we have continued to revise the practicum to address challenges that have arisen.Save to LibraryDownloadby Heather Hurst•Applying Theory and Research to PracticeThis essay describes the pedagogical practices and learning activities of an EdD course redesigned to help students develop scholarly practitioner identities by weaving together the program’s previously disparate strands of educational... moreThis essay describes the pedagogical practices and learning activities of an EdD course redesigned to help students develop scholarly practitioner identities by weaving together the program’s previously disparate strands of educational leadership, theory, practice, research, and social justice.

While online courses cannot replace traditional forms of learning, this form of teaching and learning has been and is the most effective solution. How to effectively teach and learn online is still a question of interest to many. The study aimed to determine the relationship between factors that promote learner satisfaction and e-learning outcomes among online learners of nine private universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from the learner's perspective.

A new methodology connects the efforts of User eXperience researchers with those of subject matter experts (domain scientists, curators, researchers, and so on) and developers. This allows constructing a knowledge graph representing the relationships among goals, tasks, workflows, and services. A reasoner empowers authorized users to have their goals met with suitable workflows that are dynamically generated and executed. Student teams have applied the new methodology to support users interested in tweets, web pages, or electronic theses and dissertations, as well as those curating and experimenting with those collections. Exploration is thus broadened across content types and their elements, with an extensible set of services, to address an arbitrary set of stakeholde...Save to LibraryDownloadby Prashant Chandrasekar•Digital LibraryThe Post-Secondary Networked Classroom: Renewal of Teaching Practices and Social InteractionThe application and use of telelearning technologies in post-secondary education is evolving from peripheral activities to central approaches.

Educators are re-discovering collaborative education as they understand how electronic conferencing can support and empower teaching and learning. As students build knowledge collaboratively, asynchronous conferencing elevates engagement and participation, and increases thinking and understanding. This article presents the teaching practices of post-secondary educators who integrated asynchronous electronic conferencing in over one hundred mixed-mode courses at eight North American institutions between 1996 and 1999. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied to assess their practices and to further understand the correlation between the use of electronic conferencing and the degree of collaboration achieved. Based on the findings, pedagogical approaches for the use of electronic conferencing are provided, and are grouped acco...Save to LibraryDownloadby Milton Campos•  12  Computer Science, Teaching and Learning, Social Interaction, Online LearningWeb-Based Islamic Education LearningSave to LibraryDownloadby Cecep Nurul Alam•  4  Sociology, Computer Science, Islam, Web ApplicationThe Effect of Flipped Instruction on Special Education Preservice Teachers' PerceptionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Cynthia Massey•  7  Perception, Mathematics Education, Student Engagement, Asynchronous CommunicationPerspective Chapter: Online courses: An Antidote to Traditional AndragogyAndragogy is beset by socio-economic challenges that stifle performance of the learner.

Barriers to optimal performance should be unveiled, explicated and exterminated by mitigating options like online courses. The barriers are heterogeneous since they are influenced by the thrust of the particular national curricula. The socio-economic status of a nation state has some influence on the adherence to traditional andragogy which cherishes the status quo. The face-to-face tuition dominated by the lecturer is generally considered to be virtuous in traditional andragogy. During times of no turbulence in education, online courses are the penultimate option. Providential education turbulence caused by contagious pandemics like COVID 19 has precipitated the need for online courses. The online courses should not be reactively considered but should be embraced as the contemporary ‘normal’ in andragogySave to LibraryDownloadby davison zireva•Interaction Dynamics in AEC Global TeamworkSave to LibraryDownloadby Naohiro Matsumura•  9  Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer SciencePengembangan E-Modul Pada Materi Penjumlahan dan Pengurangan Pecahan Kelas V SD Negeri 27 AmpenanPelaksanaan proses pembelajaran materi penjumlahan dan pengurangan pecahan bahan ajar kontekstual jarang digunakan karena materi didalamnya bersifat terbatas.

Both teachers and students have had to discover new online learning methods and tools in order to cope with the new phase. Some teachers relied on virtual meetings and synchronous instruction, whereas others either solely relied on asynchronous instruction through e-assignments or combined the latter to other methods like synchronous e-meetings. While the integration of synchronous tools in distance instruction seems to be more relevant, asynchronous assignments may have an important potential in e-learning given that not all students can access the course at the same time. Indeed, one of the advantages of asynchronous e-assignments is learning anytime, anywhere. For this, the in-hand paper seeks to focus on online assignments and their efficiency to university EFL students. Our purpose is to discover how students view these assignments, and whether they are efficient in learning according to them. We also wish to investigate whether students prefer synchronous online meetings or asynchronous learning tools like e-assignments. In this regard, the sample is made up of fifth-year EFL students at ENSB. By and large, the main findings of this study demonstrate that the majority of EFL students consider asynchronous e-assignments as an efficient e-learning tool.Save to LibraryDownloadby Neema Ghenim•The Algorithmic Autoregulation Software Development MethodologyO artigo apresenta uma nova metodologia para a coordenação do trabalho de uma equipe dispersa fisicamente chamada Autorregulação algorítmica (AA).

A metodologia se baseia em conceitos recentes de redes sociais e mérito individual. Os membros da equipe assumem papéis igualitários e se mantêm logados voluntariamente a sessões de AA por parte do seu tempo (por exemplo, duas horas por dia), criando logs periódicos — frases curtas — que desejam compartilhar com os demais envolvidos nas atividades da equipe. Estes logs são agregados publicamente em um website e são validados pelos pares após o fim da sessão, da mesma forma que se faz na revisão de código. Preferencialmente, um breve screencast é gravado ao final de casa sessão para tornar os logs de AA mais compreensíveis.

In this way, GPGPUs or Xeon Phi cards are attached to the nodes to improve its performance. Both types of processors, CPUs and coprocessors, have many differences, like their architecture, the clock rate of the processors and the operation of the related memory. These are the main factors that conform an heterogeneous multiprocessor. A parallel program that wants to achieve the sum of the performance of both types of processors, must consider not only the complexity of the parallel algorithm, but also the differences in the architecture of processors, increasing its complexity. As a contribution on this problem, this paper presents a model of parallel execution based on Petri Nets, called PN-PEM, that is used not only to model a parallel algorithm, but also to execute it directly on a computer with heterogeneous multiprocessors.

Also, computers with multiple sockets to insert multicore chips are based on a complex hardware design and are becoming more common. To parallelize the algorithms that run on this type of computers in order to obtain a higher performance rate, is a goal that can only be achieved by taking into account hardware architecture. As hardware evolves, so must software. This leads to old parallelization strategies quickly become obsolete. This paper presents a series of alter- natives for parallelization the LU factorization algorithm and its results intended to running on a multicore system. Simple strategies lead to poor results. This study presents complex strategies that merge double levels of parallelism with asynchronous scheduling whose results reach up to the State-of-the-art in the field and even go further.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gustavo Wolfmann•  5  Computer Science, Parallel Computing, Software, Asynchronous CommunicationParallel Asynchronous Modelization and Execution of Cholesky Algorithm using Petri NetsParallelization of algorithms with hard data dependencies has a lack of task synchronization.

Synchronous parallel versions are simple to model and program, but inefficient in terms of scalability and processors use rate. The same problem for or Asynchronous versions with elemental static task scheduling. Efficient Asynchronous algorithms implements out of order execution and are complex to model and execute. In this paper we introduce Petri Nets as a tool that simplifies the modeling and execution of parallel asynchronous versions of these kind of algorithms, while using an efficient dynamic task scheduling implementation. The Cholesky factorization algorithm was used as testbed. Simulations was done as a proof of concept, based on real execution times on GPGPU’s, and shows excellent performances.

The DC nanogrid is a recent way to solve problems presented in traditional power generation, such as low efficiency, pollution, and cost increase. The complexity of this kind of system is high due to the interconnection of all the composing elements, making the use of HIL simulation attractive due to its advantages regarding computational power and low solution time. However, when a nanogrid is simulated in commercial and personalized platforms, all the elements presented are solved at the same integration time, even if some elements could be solved at smaller integration times, causing a slowdown of the system solution.

As online course developers try to replicate the best practices of traditional classrooms, the asynchronous technology of the Internet has added great capability while also increasing the confusion that distance in space and time can add to the learning process. This study conducted a qualitative survey of online learning teams using content analysis by three researchers and grounded theory by the fourth researcher. Analysis of the rich text responses prompted the researchers to propose a model for online team development that reflected the functionality or dysfunctionality of teams.

Viability is conditional on whether deceivers incorporate different features in their TAC messages than truth tellers do and on whether these differentiating features support deception indicators suitable for automation. We propose that deceivers incorporate different features in their messages to realize impression-management goals. They avoid message features people associate with lying (defensive-targeted features) and include message features people associate with truth telling (promotive-targeted features). In a series of three studies, we assessed features that may be part of deceivers&#39; impression-management strategies and then assessed whether deceivers&#39; messages contain different levels of these features than truth tellers&#39; messages.
