Keep linguistic diversity alive and preserve the fragile treasure of orality by recording the words, phrases and proverbs of your language.
You will contribute to forming a unique multilingual audiovisual corpus and improve the visibility and vitality of your language as you speak or sign it.
You will interact with a community of individuals around the world who are sensitive to regional accents, sign languages, minority languages, and their diffusion.
The words, phrases, songs collected thanks to you will improve some of the Wikimedia projects (such as Wikipedia and the Wiktionary) and will help specialists in their work.
