Fairy tales existing within the current traditional western fairy tale canon are believed to be imbued with patriarchal ideology which idealises gender stereotypes: men are portrayed as powerful, active, and dominant heroes, while women are seen as weak, submissive and passive heroines. These stereotypes have become a cultural norm, and constant exposure may negatively influence a person’s sense of self and their belief in others’ capabilities or worth. Thus, alternate discourses should be made available to challenge these traditional beliefs. Re-visions aim to challenge dominant discourses by using in this case familiar fairy tales as archetypes upon which to superimpose ulterior narratives to act as a ‘critiquing voice’. “Sleeping Beauty” in its verbal and visual forms is used in this research as an archetype through which to critique patriarchal discourse. To achieve the aim of this study, an understanding of the term ‘agency’ from a feminist perspective is explored in order to gauge how a lack of agency in Charles Perrault’s “Sleeping Beauty” may be corrected through re-visionist techniques. Re-visions that have attempted to challenge traditional beliefs have sometimes reversed conventionally ascribed gender roles and in so doing have ‘fractured’ feminist ideals. By employing specific re-visionist strategies, such fracturing is avoided by recuperating traditionally regarded ‘feminine’ characteristics such as waiting. These narrative strategies are applied within the studio work “Soliloquy: the untold story of Sleeping Beauty’s dreams”.

Instead of feminist art or feminist-inspired art, I argue that the reification of 'making' gets uncannily or subliminally mapped onto 'women's art' in an uncritical celebration of pleasure and skill.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Art Journal, "Francesca Woodman Reconsidered: A Conversation with George Baker, Ann Burke Daly, Nancy Davenport, Laura Larson, and Margaret Sundell""Francesca Woodman Reconsidered: A Conversation..."Ann Burke DalyDownload Free PDFView PDFFrancesca Woodman: Death and the Image, One More Timepeggy phelanDownload Free PDFView PDFBordercrossings Anna LovattDownload Free PDFView PDFRefashioning materiality: a study of affect and embodied perception in Francesca Woodman's fashion photographyJemma  CraigDownload Free PDFView PDFGlobal Feminisms: New Directions in Contemporary ArtIntroduction: Toward Transnational Feminism2007 • Maura ReillyDownload Free PDFView PDFMFA graduate workFrancesca Un Figured2016 • Tara Hakim“…and, boy, did she talk!… like a schoolmarm on crack. I enjoyed listening because once she took off, the conversation was full of twists and turns; you never knew where she would lead you or where you’d land.”1 She is Francesca Woodman and, just like her friend Betsey Berne described Woodman’s inherent complexity, seemingly full of contradictions, the search into Woodman’s work and life leaves one with the very same complexity; faced with contradictions, twists and turns, and multiple destinations. Inspired by 41 False Starts by Janet Malcolm, specifically the long profile of the painter David Salle, I employ Malcolm’s method, although not in number, to reflect the many, arguably correct, understandings of Francesca Woodman's work that lead to a fragmented, not so fulfilled search for meaning.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
