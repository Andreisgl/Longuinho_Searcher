Dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aealbopictus. Children are the usual victim of dengue infection, there is paucity of published data regarding dengue infection in children in our country. We conducted a cross sectional descriptive study in the Dept. of paediatrics, Dhaka shichu(children) hospital, Dhaka Bangladesh during the period from January 2018 to November 2018 among the children having Dengue infection and who were admitted in the selected hospital. Eighty two (82) patients were enrolled in our study by using a purposive sampling technique. A detailed history was taken; clinical examinations and relevant investigations were done in every patient. The mean age of the patients was 6.5±3.5 years with almost similar male and female ratio. Among eighty two (82) patients, 41.47% presented with dengue fever (DF), the rest (58.53%) presented with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Most of the patients presented with high grade continued type of fever (71.95%), followed by vomiting (64.63%), abdominal pain (59.75%), Itchy rash was the most important characteristic signs (69.51%). Flushed appearance observed in 56.09%, subconjunctival haemorrage was (29.26%). Platelet count less than 100X10 9 /L were found in 37.80% patients. Tourniquet test was positive in 37.80% of cases. All of the patients had packed cell volume (PCV) less than 45%. Raised serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed in 45.12% of children. IgM or/with IgG antibodies for dengue virus were positive in 100% patients. Majority (97.56%) of the patients completely recovered from the disease and only 2.44% died. High grade continued fever, vomiting with abdominal pain and itchy skin rash (with normal platelet count) were the presenting features.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of MedicineDengue: A Practical Experience of Medical Professionals in Hospital2012 • Quazi Tarikul IslamDownload Free PDFView PDFCLINICAL PRESENTATION OF DENGUE IN 150 ADMITTED CASES IN DHAKA MEDICAL COLLEGE2006 • Anup SahaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of  …Clinical Profile and Outcome of Patients with Dengue Syndrome in Hospital Care2011 • Professor Md Robed AminDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of the Association of Physicians of IndiaValidity of tourniquet test in dengue haemorrhagic fever1999 • Ashutosh BiswasDengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), a public problem in most of the tropical countries of South-East Asia, is diagnosed on the basis of demonstrating an increased capillary permeability and thrombocytopenia with concurrent haemoconcentration. Tourniquet test has been recommended as the initial screening procedure of patients with suspected DHF, particularly grade I DHF. The objective of the present study was to study the value of this test as an indicator of haemorrhagic tendencies in patients of DHF. One hundred and ten adult patients hospitalized with DHF during outbreak of DHF in 1996 in north India were prospectively studied. The diagnosis of DHF was considered on the basis of haemoconcentration &gt; 20%, evidence of transudation, or presence of shock along with thrombocytopenia. A tourniquet test was conducted in these cases in the standard method. Of the 110 patients of DHF studied, 62 patients (56.4%) had bleeding but tourniquet test was positive in only half of these patients. ...Download Free PDFView PDFJPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical AssociationOutbreak of dengue fever in Karachi 2006: a clinical perspective2009 • Muhammad TariqThis study reports clinical manifestations and spectrum of severity of dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in adult patients admitted during 2006 outbreak in Karachi. A rough estimation of cost of care was also calculated. A cross-sectional study was done at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi from January to December 2006. Patients suspected of having DF with positive dengue IgM antibodies were included and records were reviewed. Patients were divided into DF, DHF and DSS as per WHO classification, and the severity of clinical manifestations was determined. A total of 278 (65.72%) of 423 patients admitted with suspected dengue illness had positive IgM titer. Mean age was 31 +/- 12.9 years, with 168 (60%) males and 110 (40%) females. Common presenting symptoms were fever (100%), vomiting (78%), epigastric pain (52%), bleeding tendencies (34%), and erythematous rash (33%).

Standard protocol treatment followed and the cases were followed up daily for the clinical parameters and blood parameters till improvement seen clinically and haematologically. The frequency of various signs and symptoms were compared between the non severe dengue (NSD) and severe dengue fever (SDF). 51% of the children were between 5-9 years of age. The mean age is 6.87 years for NSD and 6.3 years for SDF. Fever (100%), pain abdomen (74%), vomiting (70%), rash (68%) and headache (52%) were the most common symptoms. Vomiting, pain abdomen and headache being more commonly seen in children with SDF. Hepatomegaly (95%), petechiae (61%), splenomegaly (46%) and edema (34%) were among the most common signs in both NSD and SDF. Petechiae and splenomegaly were more common in children with severe dengue.Download Free PDFView PDFInnovative PublicationStudy of dengue fever cases at a tertiary care hospital in Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, North India2016 • IP Innovative Publication Pvt. Ltd.Introduction: Dengue viral infection is one of the most important mosquito born diseases of the Indian sub-continent and has become a major health problem. In recent decades, the geographical distribution of the virus and the mosquito vector has expanded, the epidemic activity increased, and DHF has emerged in new geographical regions; the reasons of which are complex and not fully understood. So in our study, we tried to find out the varied presentation of dengue patients who had been admitted in a tertiary care hospital in Srinagar city of Pauri Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. Methodology: This being a retrospective study, the patients were selected from outpatient department and indoor of HNB Base teaching hospital, a tertiary care centre in the state. We included 147 patients suffering from dengue fever in the study period from July 2015 to Dec 2015. Demographic, clinical, haematological, and biochemical laboratory data was recorded from case files in a pre-designed format. Results: We enrolled 147 patients in the study who were diagnosed with Dengue infection as per WHO guidelines. No patient died in this study. The most common symptoms were fever (100%, 147 cases), myalgia (47.61%, 70 cases) and headache (29.93%, 44 cases).Other commonly found symptoms included rash (18.37%, 27 cases), vomiting (15.65%, 23 cases), arthralgia (10.88%, 16 cases), retro-orbital pain (9.52%, 14 cases) and abdominal pain (8.2%, 12 cases). On clinical examination, hepatomegaly was seen in 5 patients (3.4%) and splenomegaly in 2 patients (1.36%). 2pts (1.36%) had pleural effusion and 2 pts (1.36%) had ascites. Haemorrhagic manifestations in the form of upper GI bleed were seen in 2 patients (1.36%). Neurological manifestations were seen in 6 patients (4.08%) while shock was seen in 1 patient (0.68%). Conclusion: Dengue infection poses a huge burden to the health-care system; its spectrum ranges from mild self-limiting illness to severe fatal disease. It can have varied and multi-systemic manifestations which can go unrecognized. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for atypical manifestations. Community awareness, early diagnosis and management and vector control measures need to be strengthened in order to reduce the increasing number of dengue cases.Download Free PDFView PDFClinical Profile and Outcome of Dengue Fever from a Tertiary Care Centre at Aurangabad Maharashtra India: An Observational StudyIOSR JournalsDownload Free PDFView PDFDengue Bulletin6.
