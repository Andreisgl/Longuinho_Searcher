This issue, though often marginalized, is of great significance to the study of Greco-Roman antiquity as it engages a divergence of issues which are discussed throughout this essay. The strengths and weaknesses of the old, but influential, studies on ‘blackness’ and recent discussions on Greco-Roman racial thought are meticulously examined. Also, major controversies surrounding the debate, such as the 'Egyptian race controversy' and the issue of Black identity and Slavery are addressed. Overall, this discussion provides an in-depth analysis on Greco-Roman constructions of black identities, the extent of black social mobility and the complexity of anti-black racism. Ultimately, this discussion demands a re-thinking of the role of blackness in the Greco-Roman racial discourse.Download Free PDFView PDFHerodotus and the Black BodyTalawa AdodoHerodotus’ view of Blackness is discussed only in relation to his 2.104 passage where he describes the Egyptian physical appearance. This is a consequence of the modern debate on ancient Egyptian racial identity. Inevitably, commentators on 2.104 have been heavily concerned with defending their predispositions about ancient Egyptian racial identity. As a result, there has been no critical engagement with Herodotus’ conceptualization of Blackness. This analysis uses critical race theory to address this methodological problem. Contrary to the consensus in Greco-Roman studies, Blackness was a factor in ancient Greek racial thought. It is evident that Herodotus’ own understanding of Blackness did not differ from the general Greek worldview. Ultimately, this analysis shows that Blackness was a significant aspect of Herodotus’ ethnography for particular racial groups.Download Free PDFView PDFMisreading Black Others in Greco-Roman AntiquityTalawa AdodoThis essay is a review article for *Rethinking the Other in Antiquity* by Erich S.

This article is meant as reflection on question of how racism was understood in ancient cultures. Ancient people, Greeks, Romans, founders of modern Europe and its system of values were in constant contact with nationalities, which were different in many ways, including skin colour. Our aim is to understand, how they saw people of different skin colour – if they condemned dissimilarity or were without prejudice. Based on (not only) literary point of view of ancient authors, this paper tries to answer old question, whether racism against blacks was born already in ancient Rome and the most glorious civilization of Europa's history was based on racial segregation, or the idea of superiority based on colour of one's skin is really modern past's invention.Download Free PDFView PDFAnténor Firmin, the ‘Egyptian Question’ and Afrocentric Imagination by Celucien L.

As an Author, Cultural Practitioner, Media Arts Specialist, and Publisher who spent more than thirty years studying Media Arts, I have decided to utilize the character Job featured in the text Job 38. In this space Job appears to be comparing1 God’s eternity with his own time, God’s omniscience with his own ignorance, and God’s omnipotence with his own inability will be applied as a pretext to frame this conversation in a figurative, metaphorical, philosophical, and symbolical context. 1 https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/job/38.html 2 of 245 My lens will be use to focus and encourage this conversation since it can be characterized as a word picture, which is also applied as a cultural, social, and a theoretical construct namely Civilization. This construct when activated has caused different groups to learn from one another. For example, in this space “Civilization " was already staged so that human beings could act as conduits to practice or live out the same. Fernand Braudel2 makes the telling point that in varying degrees; the present is the outcome of other experiences much longer ago. It is the fruit of past centuries, and even of 'the whole historical evolution of humanity until now'. That the present involves so vast a stretch of the past should by no means seem absurd - although all of us naturally tend to think of the world around us only in the context of our own brief existence.

Now, two major studies of modern humans’ Y chromosomes suggest that ‘Y- chromosome Adam’ and ‘mitochondrial Eve’ may have lived around the same time after all. After much deliberation, it is my intention to share the views of anthropologist, authors, ethnographers, theorist, and experts on the subject “Civilization” in light of the aforementioned statements.

This set of associations creates an underlying semantic system that normalised the assumed superiority of those labelled white and the assumed inferiority of those labelled black. The use of this dichotomy as a human categorising device cannot be separated from its symbolic use. It is therefore incumbent on egalitarians to abandon either the symbolic or the categorical use of the dichotomy. I argue that abandoning the categorical use is the preferable option because the negative symbolism of the term ‘black’ is deeply embedded in the English language and in Christianity.Download Free PDFView PDFColor Symbolism and Ascetic Piety: Moses the BlackMauricio LapchikMoses the Black was, undoubtedly, the most prominent ‘Black Monk’ in Late Antiquity, whose fame spread far from the desert of Scetis, and was regarded as a model of Christian virtue. Also known as the Ethiopian Moses, this figure was one of the most prominent desert fathers. His life and sayings were preserved in four ancient sources, where he is characterized as an ideal monk: Palladius’ Lausiac History (c. 420); Sozomen’s Ecclesiastical History (c. 443-448); the Apophthegmata patrum (early 6th century); and in the Acta Sanctorum (10th century). The story of Moses is a story about a Black man, who possessed a high degree of devotion and repentance. His skin and his negative past symbolized a kind of imperfect existence, which is polarized to the ideal ascetic religious life. Moses the Black, who used to be a robber and – probably – a murderer, symbolically, ceased to be black. He was able to abandon his blackness, and as it was demonstrated, to reject his nationality, by escaping from his ethiopianess and ‘washing himself white.’ If ascetic life is the wisest choice for an Ethiopian, why it would not be for a non-Ethiopian?Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
