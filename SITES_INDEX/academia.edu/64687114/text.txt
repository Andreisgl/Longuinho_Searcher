Visual characteristics of packed food products are important for consumers in the evaluation of ready-to-eat vegetables: the absence of colour modifications (browning and whitening of the cut surface, yellowing of green vegetables) as well as the absence of mechanical damages is the principal priorities. The removal of natural protection observed during minimal processing involves desiccation and wilting phenomena which can successively favour microbial growth and enzymatic reactions , activation of phenolic metabolism, lignin production and colour change. In particular, the results of dehydration and lignin synthesis by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and/or of multiple deteriorative reactions by peroxidase (POD) are responsible of surface whiteness, off-flavours development, firmness loss and high respiration rate . Furthermore, PAL...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInnovative Food Science & Emerging TechnologiesEvaluation of a pre-cut heat treatment as an alternative to chlorine in minimally processed shredded carrot2010 • Marta AbreuThe effect of a pre-cut heat treatment (100 °C/45 s) as an alternative decontamination treatment to chlorinated-water (200 ppm active chlorine/1 min, 5 °C) was evaluated in minimally processed carrot (shredded). The quality of shredded carrots was studied just after minimal processing and during storage at 5 °C (10 days) by evaluating microbial (total mesophilic aerobic, yeast and moulds and lactic acid bacteria counts), physical–chemical (soluble solids content, pH, titratable acidity, whiteness index), physiological (peroxidase activity and headspace analysis) and sensorial attributes (colour, fresh-like appearance, aroma and general acceptance). The relationships between sensory perception of undesired changes, microbial contamination threshold, physico-chemical and physiological indices were investigated and compared between heat-treated and control samples. The use of heat in pre-cut carrot proved to be more efficient than chlorinated-water concerning microbial control (threshold concentration of 7 Log10 cfu g− 1), providing an acceptable fresh-like quality product during 10 days of storage (5 °C), which corresponds to a 3-day shelf-life extension compared to control samples. Heat-treated shredded carrot showed lower respiratory and POD activities than chlorinated samples suggesting that the use of heat provides a metabolic activity lowering effect besides the microbial effect which could be important to shelf-life extension of the fresh-cut product.In minimally processed vegetables, namely in shredded carrot, chlorine solutions have been widely used by the industry for sanitization purposes. However, reduced microbiological efficiency allied to sensorial changes and eventual formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds pointed out the need for alternative decontamination methodologies. Also, the evermore conscious consumers are demanding minimization of the potentially negative impact of food processing on human health and the environment. From the practical experience of a fresh-cut industry directly involved in the R&D research project which supported this study, the marketability of minimally processed shredded carrot is limited due to rapid microbial growth and colour loss (decrease of orange intensity and/or whitening of the shreds). As a result, a pilot-plant scale study was performed, evaluating quality attributes of shredded carrot processed according to a clean pre-cut alternative decontamination process.Download Free PDFView PDFInnovative Food Science & Emerging TechnologiesQuality attributes of shredded carrot ( Daucus carota L. cv. Nantes) as affected by alternative decontamination processes to chlorine2009 • Marta AbreuThe effects of alternative decontamination processes to chlorine: ozonated-water (1 ppm/5 min), hot water (100 °C/45 s) and ultrasonication (45 kHz/1 min), applied pre- or post-cut in the technological diagram of minimal processing of carrots were tested. Ultrasonication in chlorinated-water and thermo-ultrasonication as combined processes applied just in pre-cut carrot were also tested. The initial microbial load reduction, soluble solids content, pH and sensorial attributes of shredded carrot just after processing were evaluated. Decontamination processes applied on pre-cut carrot provided maintenance of fresh-like sensorial quality, regardless the type of treatment, due to diminished leaching phenomena which is critical for shredded carrot. Chlorination, ozonization and ultrasonication achieved ca. 1 Log10 reduction of initial microbial load. No additional decontamination effect in combined processes was observed. The use of heat in pre-cut carrot proved to be the most efficient process regarding microbial reduction (3 Log10 units) providing, as well, an acceptable fresh-like quality product.The major constraint for marketability of minimally processed shredded carrot is its limited shelf-life due to rapid microbial growth and colour loss (decrease of orange intensity and/or whitening of the shreds). These questions arise from the practical experience of a fresh-cut industry directly involved in the R&D research project which supported this study. Chlorine solutions have been widely used to sanitize fruit and vegetables in the fresh-cut industry. However, reduced microbiological efficiency allied to the eventual formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds pointed out the need for alternative methodologies. The present work aimed the evaluation of clean alternative decontamination processes applied both to pre- and post-cut carrot for the production of shredded carrot, operating under conditions of industrial practice at pilot-plant scale.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of food  …Sanitation procedure affects biochemical and nutritional changes of shredded carrots2007 • Rogerio Sotelo-MundoDownload Free PDFView PDFAfrican Journal of Agricultural ResearchPhysiological and chemical quality of carrots subjected to pre-and postharvest treatments2011 • Tilahun WorknehDownload Free PDFView PDFEffect of some postharvest treatments on the quality and shelf life of three cultivars of carrot (Daucus carota L.) during storage at room temperatureBonaventure MaalekuuDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Effects of Calcium Chloride and Ascorbic Acid Treatment on Ready-to-use Carrot ShredsJournal of Life Sciences ISSN 1934-7391  David PublishingThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of calcium and ascorbic acid treatments on the quality of carrot shreds during storage. Towards this aim, carrot shreds were dipped into a 5 L solution of 2 g/L ascorbic acid containing 1%, 3%, or 5% CaCl 2 (Ca + AA) for 3 min at room temperature (~20 °C). In case of the control group (control, C), samples were dipped into distilled water for the same time interval. Subsequent to treatment, carrot shreds were stored in a cold room at 5 ± 1 °C, 85-90% RH for a period of 11 days. Color values (L*, a* b*), whiteness index, saturation index, hue angle values, visual quality, firmness scores, bitterness scores, total soluble solids (TSS) and electrolyte leakage measurements were conducted at various sampling dates. The results from this study demonstrated that brightness of carrot shreds was augmented by calcium and ascorbic acid treatments irrespective of the dosage used. Whiteness index values for the 5% Ca + AA treated samples were observed to be low whereas saturation indices of 5% Ca + AA and 3% Ca + AA treated carrot shreds were higher as compared to other treatments. This study concludes that treatment with calcium at high doses improves the color quality of carrot shreds under storage conditions. Visual quality and firmness of carrot shreds was maintained till day 4 of storage, thereafter it declined as compared to the control group. Bitterness of carrot shreds was also observed to increase upon treatment with calcium and ascorbic acid. However, calcium treatment of the test carrot shreds was seen to decrease weight loss and cause an increase in the TSS under storage conditions.Download Free PDFView PDFEffect of Hot Water Treatment with Organic Additives in Fresh Cut Carrot2021 • sadia arfinFresh cut carrot (Daucus carota L.) slices were treated with hot (60°C) water and hot aqueous solution (2% sodium chloride, 2% citric acid and 10% lime juice) for 1 min and then surface water was removed. Following treatment, fresh-cut carrot slices were kept in a polypropylene (PP) box and stored in a refrigerator (4±1°C and 50±5% RH) for 12 days. The effectiveness of the treatments in extending shelf life was evaluated by determining respiration rate, firmness, weight loss, external colour, whiteness index (WI), some chemical parameters (ascorbic acid content, TSS, acidity, pH, total sugar, reducing sugar and beta carotene), total bacterial count (TBC) and sensory quality. The highest increment of WI (48.4%) was observed without heattreated carrot slices. On the other hand, WI was increased by 12.1% and 21.7% in carrot slices treated with hot aqueous solution of 2% citric acid and with hot aqueous solution of 2% sodium chloride respectively at 12 days of storage.

Packages of carrots were stored at 1 ± 0.5C and ambient temperature (17.5–31.4C). The anolyte water dipping treatment was found to be as effective as chlorinated solutions in controlling growth of aerobic bacteria, molds, yeasts and coliform bacteria during storage. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in microbiological changes on carrots dipped in anolyte water for 5, 10, and 20 min. Exposure of carrots to anolyte water for as short as 5 min can be used effectively to reduce and limit growth of aerobic bacteria, molds, yeasts and coliform bacteria. Losses in firmness and physiological weight were higher in carrots dipped in chlorinated water. Anolyte water treatments had no effect on total soluble solid content, pH value, firmness and the overall visual appearance of carrots.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Food ScienceQuality of Shredded Carrots as Affected by Packaging Film and Storage Temperature2000 • Catherine Barry-ryanDownload Free PDFView PDFWorld Applied Sciences JournalEffects of coating methods and storage periods on some quality characteristics of carrot during ambient storageMahdi HosseiniDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
