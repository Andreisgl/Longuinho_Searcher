However, these community-level transition processes are complex and require deliberate and collective planning. Under this context, the purpose of this study is to understand the energy actions taken at the local level, as well as to analyze the differences between the neighborhoods’ green energy transitions in terms of their socio-economic aspects, using a big data perspective. The paper is addressing the following question: what was the role that the pandemic played in accelerating or slowing Boston’s green investments, and to what extent do different racial and socioeconomic groups invest in green technologies during this period? The study aims to answer these research questions using the City of Boston as a case study to reveal different neighborhoods’ paths in achieving the transformation of city ecosystems towards green neu...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Most likely, the community’s needs and behaviors play a role in facilitating or hindering any connections between these urban areas. Accordingly, relationships between communities may differ or be similar based on their respective characteristics. This paper aims to demonstrate that communities are close based on the needs they share, regardless of their ethnicity or geographic location. In this study, a time series analysis of neighborhoods’ needs is explored to gain a deeper understanding of the communities’ network. The study takes into account the co-occurrence of complaints/reports from residents regarding the same issue. The dataset was retrieved from the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI) and the 311 system that describe the features of neighborhoods regarding non-emergency issues.

The interactions between different sectors in a territory are still not easily observable. We test the complexity of the economic structure at a local level, given the availability of data at a very granular scale. This could greatly assist in observing sectors or/and locations that play a dominant role in the regional economy. Thus, in order to interpret the economic structure of a territory, we used cluster-based analysis. The analysis helps in evaluating the interconnections among sectors that constitute a cluster. A novel method of describing the territorial economic structure is presented by applying Social Network Analysis (SNA) within cluster-based analysis to characterize the importance of both location and economic interconnections. In this study, we focus on the industrial agglomerations in Calabria, Italy, to underpin the potential of the region’s industries by using ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Enhancement of Territorial Resources through Urban Regeneration and Innvation-Led Initiatives.

The paradigm of Local Development, through the logic of territorial milieu, becomes an innovative way of building integrated strategies and, at the same time an expression of a diversified, characterizing identity of the territorial systems. The theoretical basis of the territorial milieu, perceived as integration between local identity and innovation, stems from the GREMI model, which introduces the concept of milieu innovateur. The territorial milieu, with integrated urban/territorial management tools, distributes competitive advantages through the network while avoiding the risk of creating disparities between winning and losing areas in a competitive territorial system.

From Territorial Identity to Territorial Branding: Tourism-led Revitalization of Minor Historic Towns in Reggio CalabriaReggio Calabria in Southern Italy boasts many well-preserved minor historic towns (MHTs) of Greek... more Reggio Calabria in Southern Italy boasts many well-preserved minor historic towns (MHTs) of Greek origins. These MHTs are characterized by a strong territorial identity with small-sized centers, often isolated from urban basins. However, these MHTs suffer from continuing degradation due to depopulation and stagnating local socioeconomic development (LSED). This article, grounded on an asset-based endogenous approach and system-based relational approach to tourism development, maintains that tourism development is an effective tool to revitalize these towns while promoting LSED. It therefore attempts to explore a tourism-led revitalization model for MHTs where territorial identity and territorial branding are respectively fundamental assets and means. To this end, the research first investigates the constituents of territorial identity, the existing problems that the territorial identity is facing, territorial branding approaches and practices in the MHTs in relation to the two appro...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Landscape has been increasingly considered relevant to development, as an aggregation of economic, sociocultural and environmental dynamics. Yet, how landscape can actually be turned into competitive advantages critical to the development process is unclear. This is particularly evident in rural areas, where landscape degradation and weak economic fabrics are common problems. The proposed landscape approach aims to combine and balance, simultaneously, the development of innovation economies and landscape regeneration practices in order to produce a concurrent positive effect on rural development and rural landscapes. This research, based on literature review, adopts a qualitative approach based on explanatory comparative analysis of case studies. It first constructs an improved landscape approach (ILA), expounding its components, i.e. landsc...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Given these needs, the role of regional clusters has been recently coupled with the concept of Smart Specialization Strategy (S3). This paper aims at contributing to the debate on the role of clusters in the arduous implementation of S3, towards investigating the potentials of the clusters life cycle (CLC) and spatial analysis to guide the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP). This argument is theoretically discussed on the base of literature evidence. Firstly, the concept of S3, its relation to clusters and the emerging EDP gaps are presented. Secondly, the potentials of CLC and spatial analysis are investigated by (i) studying the literature and selecting a set of indicators, accounting for clusters stage-specific and spatial attributes. (ii) framing the indicators into a model and providing a qualitative judgment of their strength at each stage of the CLC (iii) interpreting the model towards testi...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim is to demonstrate how innovation has become part of the urban settlement dynamics towards regeneration processes. Spurring innovation through knowledge-based economy has been driving the design of public development policies. Knowledge generates economic growth by stimulating the potential of entrepreneurship and innovation. In this context, cities are emerging as knowledge hubs, able to attract high-skilled workers, generate creativity and innovation and provide advanced services and infrastructures connected through formal and informal network systems. Findings from the MAPS-LED project (Horizon-2020) show how in specific urban areas the knowledge dynamics in activating the concentration of innovation generate spillover effects, which supported by urban planning tools, allow the expansion of innovation and the generation of physical transformations.

Urban areas are affected by the side effects of rapid urbanisation processes which need to be tackled quickly. The European Union placed the nature-based urban regeneration topic on the top of EU research areas&#39; priorities in order to improve the well-being in urban areas, increase the sustainable use of energy and boost carbon sequestration. The aim of the paper is to understand how the introduction of nature-based solutions in innovation-led urban regeneration can contribute to the realisation of a green district in a central neighbourhood of the Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria (IT). The proposal will be framed into an urban regeneration model in order to propose a replicable model to apply in other distressed urban areas impacting on the social, economic and environmental dimension.

The “Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics” (MONUM) in Boston, Massachusetts (USA) proves a representative case of innovation in the public sector. As a new type of government agency, it is essentially an open innovation lab dedicated to innovative evidence-based policymaking. Following a new dynamic organizational pattern in urban governance, MONUM is conducive to project-oriented social innovation practices and horizontal multi-sectoral collaboration among the three societal sectors: public, private, and civil. Its results suggest that first, the peculiarity of MONUM lies in its hybrid and boundary-blurring nature. Second, new institutional forms that experiment with urban governance can rely on multi-sectoral collaboration. Third, MONUM has experimented with a systemic approach to social innovation following the “design thinking theory.” The MON...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rooted in the deinstitutionalization of public services, the European Union and national policy effort is pushing towards the organization of community-based alternatives in response to the evolving needs of local communities. As the pandemic has shown, service accessibility has proven to be a key concern element that needs to be addressed to increase communities’ and cities’ resilience. In this direction, the paper aims to propose data-driven alternative approaches to assess urban systems’ accessibility and connectivity as an element of leveraging the resilience-oriented planning process and facilitating community-based development. The methodological approach focuses on the case of the Calabria region, where community-based alternatives for the provision of public services found difficulties to...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For the most vulnerable economies and population groups, the ongoing pressures and the associated socio-economic cost are twofold. On the one hand, the post-pandemic scenario indicates larger long-term detrimental effects (and slowpaced recovery) across territorial settings with weak institutional capacity, insufficient public healthcare, low social cohesion along with poor digital and technological development. On the other hand, the cross-domain decarbonization/climate neutrality objective poses additional transition-related risks, which will be felt very differently across different regions (EC 2019). In May 2020, the European Commission has proposed a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget boosted by Next Generation EU, an emergency temporary recovery instrument, to he...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It discusses how the macro-innovation eco-ecosystem is composed by a variety of interconnected micro-innovation eco-systems, mutually reinforcing each other and making the entire &quot;territorial&quot; system successful. The spatial configuration of these micro-innovation ecosystems at the urban scale has been specifically investigated, thus leading to theorize that the Innovation District may act as enabler for place-based innovation. Evidence from the Boston case study shows that there is not a single magic recipe for the successful implementation of place-based and social innovation-driven strategies. On the contrary, the variety of place-grounded combinations of micro and macro initiatives, embedded in the social and spatial fine grain of places and encompassing a diversity of actors, can create the conditions enabling places to thrive...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
