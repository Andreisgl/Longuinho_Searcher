In this paper, drawing on a qualitative study of Syntagma Square in Athens, Greece, we confirm that spontaneous, self-organised movements, such the Aganaktismenoi (Indignant) movement, could function as intermediaries between protest and resistance, leading to the institution of urban practices of commoning. We argue that the innovative attributes of such movements inspire and trigger the introduction of new decision-making mechanisms, social relationships and political subjectivities and the institution of solidarity and collective forms of social reproduction. We conclude that these initiatives constitute a radicalization of political struggles and have a positive effect both in terms of increased civic participation and the emergence of new collective identities and political subjectivities.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersUrban Geography"Insurrection is not a spectacle": Experiencing and contesting touristification in Exarcheia, Athens2021 • Dimitris Pettas, Vasilis Avdikos, Eirini  IliopoulouDuring the last few years, Athens is experiencing a substantial increase in tourist inflows, while transforming from a one-day stop destination during summer to a year-round, city-break destination. This overall shift in the city's touristic identity was driven by a series of trends and events that increased Athens' popularity. Through a multi-method qualitative research, this paper explores the role of the aforementioned developments in the emergence of Athens as a city-break destination and explores ongoing processes of touristification. The study focuses on the central district of Exarcheia, where grassroots political activity and creativity co-exist in high densities. Due to the increased touristic traffic in the area, specific, often interrelated problematic conditions emerge concerning housing, residents' everyday life and local businesses' activity. At the same time, political groups and precarious creative professionals are facing substantial threats due to touristification. Building on the case of Exarcheia, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion concerning touristification, highlighting its heavily context-dependent character to gentrification and the multiple ways social movements operate in tension with relevant processes.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Spatial Dimensions of the Greek Protest Campaign against the Troika's Memoranda and Austerity, 2010-13Chapter 6 in Edited volume: Street Politics in the Age of Austerity, From the Indignados to Occupy edited by Ancelovici, Dufour and Nez2016 • Maria KousisChapter 6 [Maria Kousis]: The Spatial Dimensions of the Greek Protest Campaign against the Troika’s Memoranda and Austerity, 2010-2013Download Free PDFView PDFCommoning Against The Crisis (In Castells, M. et al, Another Economy is Possible)Giorgos KallisDownload Free PDFView PDFCommoning Against The CrisisAngelos VarvarousisPublished this week by Polity Press, in a volume edited by Manuel CastellsDownload Free PDFView PDFTriple C(Digital) Activism at the Interstices: Anarchist and Self-Organizing Movements in Greece2017 • Dr Michail TheodosiadisThe paper traces the history and evolution of the anarchist and self-organising movements in Greece, paying attention to their communicative practices and their implications for political praxis. After years of repression, and following the hegemony of the social democratic Pasok, and subsequently Syriza, the movements are currently coming to their own. Beginning with a brief history of the movements and more broadly of the left in Greece, the paper focuses on the current moment, determined by three events: the revolt of 2008, the movement of the squares in 2011, and the rise and u-turn of Syriza in 2015. Examining the critiques, discourses and communicative practices of the antagonistic movement as a whole, the paper argues that these constitute an alternative path to organizing beyond populist hegemony. Equally, the antagonistc movement tries to eschew the problems associated with the so-called folk politics, by paying attention to the growth of the movement through combining affect and experience, new learning and action, and through ultimately contributing to fundamental shifts in political subjectivities.Download Free PDFView PDFRage and Protest: The case of the Greek Indignant movementMarilena SimitiIn 2011 numerous Occupy and anti-austerity protests took place across Europe and the United States. Passionate indignation at the failure of political elites became a mobilizing force against formal political institutions. In Greece a mass movement known as the Aganaktismeni (the Indignant) became the main agent of social resistance to the memorandum signed by the Greek government, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The Greek movement did not take the form of a social movement sharing a collective identity. Left-wing protestors played a prominent role. Protestors embracing right-wing populist frames also participated actively in collective mobilizations, while segments of the extreme right attempted to manipulate rage to their advantage. During the Greek Indignant movement civil society remained a terrain contested by conflicting political forces. This unique feature of the Greek movement posed a completely different challenge to the principles of diversity and inclusiveness than the one debated within the Spanish Indignados and the Occupy protests. Furthermore, it illustrates that rage and indignation may spark dissimilar forms of political contention. Hence, rage and indignation do not merely motivate ‘passive citizens’ to participate in collective protest. They are linked to cognitive frames and individual preferences, which influence protestors’ claims and mobilizations’ political outcomes. Accordingly, advances in democratization and inclusive citizenship are only one of the possible outcomes of mobilizations prompted by rage and indignation.Download Free PDFView PDFAnti-austerity mobilization and protest 2010-2014 in GreeceMarkos VogiatzoglouDownload Free PDFView PDFQuaderns-e de l'Institut Català d'AntropologiaAthens Urban Space Riots: From December 2008 Revolt to Mobilizations in the Era of Crisis2013 • Haris TsavdaroglouDownload Free PDFView PDFCommons: A Social Outcome of the movement of the squaresAngelos VarvarousisThis paper examines the evolvement of the "movement of the squares" following the end of the more visible cycles of mobilization of the square occupation. We argue that a crucial aspect of this evolution lies in the creation of a social infrastructure of alternative (re)productive projects in the form of commons. We call this type of outcomes "social" in order to distinguish them from the cultural, political and biographical outcomes underlined in typologies on the consequences of social movements. Bridging social movement studies with the literature on the commons, we build a conceptual framework of their relationship. Through a comparative analysis of the movements in Athens and Barcelona, we show how the commoning practices of the square encampments gave rise to more durable commons disseminated across cities´ social fabrics. We identify both direct and indirect mechanisms of movements´ transmutation into commons, and distinguish the former into transplantation, ideation, and breeding processes. Our second aim is to scrutinize the political dimension of these commons in relation to what has been framed as the "post-political condition". We maintain that the post-square commons constitute political and politicizing actions for activists and users for their effects on everyday life, for their capacity to link their practices with broader, structural dynamics of injustice, inequality and exclusion, and for their selective engagement with counter-austerity politics.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Greek Society in Crisis and in Motion - Building The Material Bases for an Alternative Society from the Bottom Up2016 • Antonios  Broumas, Georgia BekridakiIn the last five years, Greece has been hit by a vicious circle of relentless neoliberal restructuring programs. During the years of the crisis, throughout the country urban and rural communities of struggle have been formed, which tend to employ instituent practices and to acquire constitutive characteristics, in order to collectively address unmet social needs / desires and ensure their collective survival. In this context, socially reproductive commons in germ form have emerged with social and solidarity economy initiatives in their peripheries, alternative forms of life in common have been shaped and societies have been set in motion with the potential to establish the material foundations of their collective autonomy. Within this huge gap of social (re)production, the constituent power of social movements emerges as a resurgent force with the potential to address these needs and desires and, correspondingly, shape life in common. In the neoliberal era, this constituent counter-power emerges as the main social force which contends the dominant force of the capital-state complex.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
