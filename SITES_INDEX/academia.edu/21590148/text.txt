The World Development Report 2016 on Digital Dividends argues that first-generation supply-side policies for the ICT sector, which aimed at universal access and affordability, have proved highly successful for voice services and selected applications such as mobile payment services using the same 2G platform as the voice service. With the growth of the ICT sector and the development of bandwidth-heavy applications, the policy focus is progressively shifting from solving supply-side challenges (such as how to ensure affordable universal access to networks) to addressing demand-side challenges (such as how to ensure that networks are open and safe). This will allow individuals, governments, and enterprises to take full advantage of the digital revolution and reap the Digital Dividend. This article reviews the state of the sector’s performance in AFCW3 countries and highlights a lagging reform agenda along with risks of the emergence of a cozy oligopoly market structure, issues related to distressed state-owned operators, ineffective implementation of universal access and service policies and programs, and inappropriate taxation of the sector. The note makes the case for governments to tackle the unfished reform agenda if the sector is to achieve better development outcomes in terms of faster growth, more jobs as well as better services.Download Free PDFView PDFASEF Outlook Report 2016/2017: Connectivity: Facts and PerspectivesAre We That Globally Connected? Lessons from the Many Connectivity IndicesYvonne Guo, thierry schwarz• What happened to globalisation and why has it been replaced by connectivity? • Which are the most connected countries in Asia and Europe? • What do we actually measure when we measure connectivity? • Why, in most connectivity indices, do small and rich countries look better connected than larger ones? • Is the progress towards more connectivity an inexorable trend? • Are higher levels of connectivity necessarily contributing to the well-being of the world? • And what if we could develop a Sustainable Connectivity Index for Asia and Europe? Those are some of the questions addressed by this paper.Download Free PDFView PDFDigital inclusion – recent trends and messagesSian HerbertThis annotated bibliography collates extracts from recently published flagship policy reports on digital inclusion in international development, highlighting the key messages, trends and issues. The digital inclusion agenda seeks to close the gaps in access to, and adoption of, fast evolving information and communication technology (ICTs) services, particularly mobile phones and the internet. It is an important aspect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as both an end and a means to the cross-cutting policy aim of ‘leaving no one behind’. The potential gains from digital technologies are high, however they often remain unrealised (World Bank, 2016).Download Free PDFView PDFOradea Journal of Business and EconomicsMOBILE BROADBAND AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA2019 • Oluseye AjuwonThe scale of diffusion of mobile wireless broadband technology and its transformational effect across all sectors of the economy cannot be over emphasised. It enables the creation of new business processes/product innovation, thereby boosting job creation, as well as raising economic growth and productivity. This suggests that the mobile broadband is a general-purpose technology capable of producing a protracted critical mass effect at a certain threshold of penetration. It is against this backdrop that this paper examines the impact of mobile broadband on economic growth in Nigeria. Using the Endogenous Growth Model, we employ ARDL Bounds Testing Approach and Toda Yamamoto Granger Causality test on quarterly data from 2001 to 2016, to estimate the growth effect of mobile broadband. The findings show that mobile broadband is impacting economic growth positively in the Nigerian economy. It is therefore imperative for policymakers to design policies that will increase access to broadband infrastructure to both the unserved and underserved. It is also imperative to enact policies and regulations that can stimulate the economic impact of mobile broadband technology by strengthening the capacity of the economy to fully absorb the transformational benefits and make productive use of it as a General-Purpose Technology.Download Free PDFView PDF1.

Rural youth face particular constraints in terms of labour market participation, including smaller social networks, low literacy rates, less work experience and limited access to capital (Robalino et al, 2013). Youth employment programmes have the potential to address these constraints, but they are often characterized by low enrolment, high dropout and uncertain returns. While the growth of digital technology offers new opportunities to address some of the issues associated with youth employment, research on their impacts is limited and results are mixed. We review existing research on the impact of digital initiatives on youth in the education, agriculture, financial and employment sectors, before proposing several ways forward for using digital technology to improve the impact of these programmes.Download Free PDFView PDFAngelo King Institute for Economic and Business StudiesAn ASEAN Digital Single Market: Boosting the Aspiration for a Single Market in the Digital Era Working Paper Series 2019-08-0582019 • Paul John PenaAdvancements in information and communications technologies have changed the way individuals, firms, and nations create and exchange value across borders. Value comes in the form of goods, services, information, and data, but may also include talent, capital, ideas, and even culture. Southeast Asia is a thriving digital economy with the prospect of becoming a US$200B economy by 2025. However, new forms of protectionist measures arise, which may impede the free flow of value within the region. An aspirational digital single market concept and the changing dynamics of digital trade are explored. A digital economic integration framework that is interoperable, inclusive, and agile is proposed to address both barriers to the creation of an ASEAN digital single market. Requisite conditions for policy solutions are identified, and an empowered digital transformation board with the task of leading the change agenda is proposed as a critical governance enabler across the region.Download Free PDFView PDFAn ASEAN Digital Single Market: Boosting an aspiration for a Single Market in the digital eraPaul John PenaAdvancements in information and communications technologies (ICT) have changed the way individuals, firms and nations create and exchange value across borders. "Value" may come in the form of goods, services, information and data, but may also include talent, capital, ideas, and even culture. The goal of regional economic integration is the progressive liberalisation of trade that engenders a free flow of value across borders through the elimination or reduction of barriers. Southeast Asia is a thriving digital economy with the prospect of becoming a 200B US Dollar economy by 2025. However, given the growing opportunities in digital, new forms of protectionist measures arise which may impede the free flow of value within the region. An aspirational Digital Single Market concept and the changing dynamics of digital trade are explored. A Digital Economic Integration Framework that is interoperable, inclusive, and agile is proposed to address both barriers to and opportunities in the creation of an ASEAN Digital Single Market (DSM) grounded on requisite infrastructure and policy conditions and necessary protection of rights to better internet access and human capital upgrading, privacy and security. A sequencing of key strategic initiatives is proposed supporting the argument that the creation of an ASEAN DSM now will further galvanise economic integration, deliver its Single Market ambition and close – and eventually eliminate – the gap between offline and digital trade.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
