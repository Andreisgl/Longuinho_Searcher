Flawless work! Intuitive design and features that require no learning curve to use. While downloading the entirety of wikipedia takes a long time, the program itself is very easy to install. Accessing Wikipedia offline is a worthwhile concept, and Xowa nails it.
Great support/documentation for setup and install with continuous updates for improvement and compatibility.
Thank you gnosygnu!

With all my heart, thank you for this awesome software Mr.Gnosygnu. In my village don't have high speed internet. But now all school and college students in my village, use this software on thier laptop's. Most of the TPEVR Polytechnic College students use this software on thier laptops. Guess how many laptops:....... 500+ laptop's install XOWA and use Wikipedia Offline.
It performing very well...
It looks like online Wikipedia......
Once again Thank You sir......

I like this software, it makes having a complete local copy of the entire Wikipedia database super simple. I would like to see the user interface improved some what, so that it matches the host operating system better (Windows 7 in my case). Such as offering transparency for systems capable of doing that. Otherwise I can not find any technical issues with this software. Big thanks to the developer for making such a great software application.
