Students’ Experience of Assessment in Online Higher Education During COVID-19Suddenly and unplanned, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020 required teaching course... more Suddenly and unplanned, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020 required teaching courses pass from physical classroom to the online alternative, posing numerous didactical challenges, assessment being one of the crucial among them. As the choice of assessment methods can result in different measures of learning outcomes, the choice of the appropriate online options in a short time, became demanding as they should have conveyed reliability, validity and uniqueness. On the one hand, one of teachers&amp;#39; greatest concerns was to ensure that genuine students&amp;#39; knowledge and skills were assessed, and to reduce the probability of their cheating. On the other hand, teachers were aware that students needed time and effort to adapt to the new learning situation. Focusing on the unexpected and quick shift from face-to-face education to the online variant, this paper explored techniques employed in assessment of students&amp;#39; achievement, as well as students&amp;#39; experience with the changed circumstances in the assessment processes. The objectives of this research were 1) to examine the assessment methods used in the online higher education, and 2) to compare written and oral/performing online assessment methods with the usual face-to-face assessment methods, specifically depending on the level of students&amp;#39; adjustment to online education. The sample comprised 272 university students, and the questionnaire was administered online in June 2020 referring to the semester that had begun in March and ended in June. In order to explore the first objective, students were asked what types of assessment they had experienced and how vastly they had been used. To answer the second objective students compared eight features between online and face-to-face assessment. More specifically, answers were compared among three groups of students: those who reported to have not adjusted to online education; those that admitted to have had difficulties at the beginning, but mastered it; and students that had found it easy to cope from the start. Regarding the first objective, results revealed that in most courses they had written assessment, shorter written assessments being most frequently applied, followed by the longer ones, and then oral assessments. For the oral/performing assessment the most frequent platform was Big Blue Button, and for the written assessment it was Moodle. Concerning the second objective, students reported that oral/performing assessment and short-time written exams were more stressful than the usual face-to-face assessment. However, in other features they estimated that online and usual face-to-face assessment were alike: providing time, level of difficulty, easiness in checking knowledge, skills and attitudes, objectivity, and taking time to get feedback. The effect of students&amp;#39; adjustment was significant in some of the comparisons of online and face-to-face assessment. To conclude, students&amp;#39; experience with the shift from face-to-face to online assessment revealed that the existing online learning platforms could serve the assessment purposes to a great measure, allowing teachers to employ methods that provide many similarities with the usual face-to-face practice. The most pronounced disadvantage of online assessment was higher level of provoked stress when oral/performing and shorter written exams were implemented. It should probably be ascribed to the unexpected circumstances and a lack of teachers&amp;#39; and students&amp;#39; gradual preparation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
ONLINE TEACHING DURING COVID-19 FROM THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' PERSPECTIVEProceedings of INTED2021 Conference,  2021Recently online teaching has become a fast-growing and developing reality in higher education wor... more Recently online teaching has become a fast-growing and developing reality in higher education worldwide. Despite similarities between them, didactical features of online lectures differ from those in face-to-face teaching. Online teaching requires adaptation of methods and techniques that "eteachers" and "e-students" need to acquire and deliver, striving for the same learning outcomes. The quality of teaching, its methods and techniques determine advantages and disadvantages of the teaching process and of the online education. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spring 2020, Croatian higher educational system abruptly switched from face-to-face teaching to the online variant. The main issue was that all the courses that had initially been conceptualised and implemented only as face-toface, had to adjust to an online form that had previously not been envisioned. Relying on their previously acquired information and communication competences, as well as on their abilities to learn, teachers and students had to adapt to the new situation. This research, focused on students' point of view, had two objectives: 1) to explore the didactical methods used in the online higher education, and 2) to compare students' experiences of online and face-to-face education, specifically depending on their level of adjustment to online education. The sample comprised 272 university students, and the online questionnaire was administered in June 2020. The first objective was tackled with students' assessments of how vastly various teaching methods and techniques had been employed in the online courses in the March-June semester and how useful they had found them. Answers showed that teachers had (almost) always lectured and showed presentations. Then, in descending order, they had used e-mails, chat, other material from Internet and video streaming. Highly similar order was kept when students assessed the usefulness of those methods. Students reported that they had mostly taken part in lectures, in descending order, by listening, watching, chatting, replying to e-mails and to polls. They found their active participation more useful than it had been practiced. For the second objective students compared online and face-to-face education experience on an 18 items scale, and listed advantages and disadvantages of online education. Students' answers were compared regarding their self-assessed level of adjustment to online education: not adjusted, adjusted from the start, or adjusted gradually. Results reveal that students identified many similarities between online and face-to-face lectures, and they were not completely for or against online education. They placed as highest advantages of online education-personal benefits, time-related benefits, and features of the online lecture delivery. When ranking disadvantages, they put delivery of lectures and too many obligations on the top. Then lack of social interactions, technical problems and personal detriments followed. Students with better adjustment assessed online education more positively. It can be concluded that online lectures delivery in this research managed to resemble the face-to-face variation a lot. Students were almost polarised in their preferences towards online education, but they identified a great need for improvement of the online lectures delivery.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its frame does not allow one to move out of it, and a mode of behaviour which attempts any change is severely punished. This kind of society has strict written and unwritten rules, and it seems that the second kind are more harmful and painful for the individual than the first. In 19th century, European society was strongly patriarchal, and a phenomenon which confirms this is the fact that many female writers published their works under a male pseudonym. A patriarchal system attempts to prevent women from any artistic and scientific form and expression, as they are labelled as less intellectually able or talented, but by choosing a male pseudonym they found a way to reach their goal. An author writes about what he knows, what surrounds him and/or what he notices, feels and thinks.

La memoria visiva comprende il ricordo della forma fisica del testo – per esempio la forma testuale di una poesia (goccia o anguilla), e il quadro mentale che un testo disegna. L’immagine che il testo crea sullo schermo mentale può derivare da: a) una metafora ; b) una descrizione breve o lunga di un personaggio, ambiente o paesaggio ; c) una narrazione o descrizione di un movimento fisico o stato psicologico accompagnato da una particolare azione.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ha studiato la matematica e geometria, ha (ri)scoperto la poesia e il teatro pagano con soddisfazioni inaspettate in campi impensabili. Ha conosciuto da vicino i popoli così vicini e così lontani allo stesso tempo confermando le sue idee e convinzioni sull’importanza dell’educazione. Ha sperimentato le collisioni tra culture diverse riuscendo a sopravvivere. In Dalmazia ha vissuto tutto il vivibile che la vita gli offriva, per mettere in atto, una volta a Venezia, solo le lezioni imparate ed esercitate. Tra le conoscenze teoriche e pratiche lungo il triennio, Gozzi ebbe un guadagno inaspettato: Innocenzio Massimo, nobile di Padova, l’amico per la vita.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Through the same kind of materials it is possible to understand what the city of Vienna meant to Venetians and means to Italians, and which functions had and has. The written word brigs information on how “strangers” saw and see Venice, and which meanings the city offers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Eco has a particular kind of amnesia – he doesn’t remember his name or who he is, but he remembers all the literary works he has ever read, including comics. Eco creates a collage of citations underlining the concept of the individual encyclopaedia which can be represented as a puzzle, but the individual with his personality and creativity is a piece of puzzle itself which creates a literary representation of modern views of quantum physics, especially the concept of the system of systems and the web of relations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

L’articolo offre l’analisi dell’angolazione teorica e pratica di Calvino verso la fiaba, i classici cioè l’antologia scolastica e l’antologia personale. Nella fiaba Calvino individua gli elementi costituenti gli oneri dell’insegnare e del divertire, e la definisce come una lezione sulla vita pratica, ma anche indicazione sull’ordine sociale, sulla mentalità, e sulla cultura del popolo che l’ha creata e rimandata. Il problema principale delle antologie scolastiche è la non-lettura condizionata dall’imposizione delle opere scelte. Il caso più felice, secondo Calvino, è quello dell’antologia personale basata sulle scelte e sugli interessi individuali, nell’ambito della quale un’opera classica assume il proprio significato perché letta, riletta e amata per tutta la vita.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An author writes about what he knows, what surrounds him and/or what he notices, feels and thinks. Considering that a patriarchal society system is highly defined, female and male points of view, their angles of reflection and aims are obviously different. In novels, choice of character and situation and the description of such, can easily reveal an author’s gender. These approaches will be illustrated by analysing the work of Vincenza Speraz, who lived in North Italy between the 19th and 20th centuries, and published her works under the pseudonym Bruno Sperani.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I panorama è molto variegato e rispecchia, nella forma e nei temi, le specificità delle diverse epoche. Esplorando le varie voci femminili si scopre che le donne hanno portato ai massimi livelli anche i generi considerati di consumo o marginali, trovando in essi degli espedienti idonei a esprimere le loro visioni e le loro idee nonché a descrivere la società che le circondava. Negli ultimi decenni del XX secolo vengono delineandosi diverse teorie incentrate sulla letteratura al femminile, le quali non si escludono a vicenda, anzi si completano, il che dona alla tematica, allo studio e alla ricerca la facoltà di addentrarsi in approcci sempre nuovi e attuali.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The written word brigs information on how “strangers” saw and see Venice, and which meanings the city offers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Eco has a particular kind of amnesia – he doesn’t remember his name or who he is, but he remembers all the literary works he has ever read, including comics. Eco creates a collage of citations underlining the concept of the individual encyclopaedia which can be represented as a puzzle, but the individual with his personality and creativity is a piece of puzzle itself which creates a literary representation of modern views of quantum physics, especially the concept of the system of systems and the web of relations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
La fiaba, i classici, un'antologia - i passi di CalvinoL’esperienza di Calvino comprende lo studio della fiaba e l’analisi critica di molti scrittori. L... more L’esperienza di Calvino comprende lo studio della fiaba e l’analisi critica di molti scrittori. L’articolo offre l’analisi dell’angolazione teorica e pratica di Calvino verso la fiaba, i classici cioè l’antologia scolastica e l’antologia personale. Nella fiaba Calvino individua gli elementi costituenti gli oneri dell’insegnare e del divertire, e la definisce come una lezione sulla vita pratica, ma anche indicazione sull’ordine sociale, sulla mentalità, e sulla cultura del popolo che l’ha creata e rimandata. Il problema principale delle antologie scolastiche è la non-lettura condizionata dall’imposizione delle opere scelte. Il caso più felice, secondo Calvino, è quello dell’antologia personale basata sulle scelte e sugli interessi individuali, nell’ambito della quale un’opera classica assume il proprio significato perché letta, riletta e amata per tutta la vita.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Female Authors under the Mask of a Male Pseudonym – some Approaches to Revealing Authors’ GenderA patriarchal society has very clear and rigid norms.

Its frame does not allow one to move out of it, and a mode of behaviour which attempts any change is severely punished. This kind of society has strict written and unwritten rules, and it seems that the second kind are more harmful and painful for the individual than the first. In 19th century, European society was strongly patriarchal, and a phenomenon which confirms this is the fact that many female writers published their works under a male pseudonym. A patriarchal system attempts to prevent women from any artistic and scientific form and expression, as they are labelled as less intellectually able or talented, but by choosing a male pseudonym they found a way to reach their goal. An author writes about what he knows, what surrounds him and/or what he notices, feels and thinks. Considering that a patriarchal society system is highly defined, female and male points of view, their angles of reflection and aims are obviously different. In novels, choice of character and situation and the description of such, can easily reveal an author’s gender. These approaches will be illustrated by analysing the work of Vincenza Speraz, who lived in North Italy between the 19th and 20th centuries, and published her works under the pseudonym Bruno Sperani.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Il ruolo della donna nel panorama storico-leterarioL’indagine retrospettiva presenta la consistente e valida produzione letteraria delle più rinomat... more L’indagine retrospettiva presenta la consistente e valida produzione letteraria delle più rinomate scrittrici, produzione che fino alla metà del Novecento è stata tenuta ai margini degli interessi degli studi umanistici. I panorama è molto variegato e rispecchia, nella forma e nei temi, le specificità delle diverse epoche. Esplorando le varie voci femminili si scopre che le donne hanno portato ai massimi livelli anche i generi considerati di consumo o marginali, trovando in essi degli espedienti idonei a esprimere le loro visioni e le loro idee nonché a descrivere la società che le circondava. Negli ultimi decenni del XX secolo vengono delineandosi diverse teorie incentrate sulla letteratura al femminile, le quali non si escludono a vicenda, anzi si completano, il che dona alla tematica, allo studio e alla ricerca la facoltà di addentrarsi in approcci sempre nuovi e attuali.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
