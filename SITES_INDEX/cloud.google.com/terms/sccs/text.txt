                    STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES
SECTION I 
Clause 1 
Purpose and scope
(a) The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is
                      to ensure compliance with the requirements of Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the
                      Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural
                      persons with regard to the processing of personal data and
                      on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection
                      Regulation) (1) for the transfer of personal
                      data to a third country. 
(b) The Parties: 
(i) the natural or legal
                      person(s), public authority/ies, agency/ies or other
                      body/ies (hereinafter ‘entity/ies’) transferring the
                      personal data, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each
                      ‘data exporter’), and
(ii) the entity/ies in a
                      third country receiving the personal data from the data
                      exporter, directly or indirectly via another entity also
                      Party to these Clauses, as listed in Annex I.A
                      (hereinafter each ‘data importer’)
have agreed to these standard contractual clauses
                      (hereinafter: ‘Clauses’).
(c) These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of
                      personal data as specified in Annex I.B. 
(d) The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes
                      referred to therein forms an integral part of these
                      Clauses.
Clause 2 
Effect and invariability of the Clauses
(a) These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards,
                      including enforceable data subject rights and effective
                      legal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article
                      46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with respect to
                      data transfers from controllers to processors and/or
                      processors to processors, standard contractual clauses
                      pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
                      provided they are not modified, except to select the
                      appropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in
                      the Appendix. This does not prevent the Parties from
                      including the standard contractual clauses laid down in
                      these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other
                      clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do
                      not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or
                      prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data
                      subjects. 
(b) These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to
                      which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679.
Clause 3 
Third-party beneficiaries
(a) Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses,
                      as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter
                      and/or data importer, with the following exceptions: 
                    
(i) Clause 1, Clause 2,
                      Clause 3, Clause 6, Clause 7; 
(ii) Clause 8 – Clause
                      8.1(a), (c) and (d) and Clause 8.9(a), (c), (d), (e), (f)
                      and (g); 
(iii) Clause 9 – Clause 9(a),
                      (c), (d) and (e); 
(iv) Clause 12 – Clause
                      12(a), (d) and (f); 
(v) Clause 13; 
(vi) Clause 15.1(c), (d) and
                      (e); 
(vii) Clause 16(e); 
(viii) Clause 18 – Clause
                      18(a) and (b); 
(b) Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data
                      subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Clause 4 
Interpretation 
(a) Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in
                      Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have the same
                      meaning as in that Regulation. 
(b) These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the
                      light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(c) These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that
                      conflicts with rights and obligations provided for in
                      Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Clause 5 
Hierarchy 
In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and
                      the provisions of related agreements between the Parties,
                      existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered
                      into thereafter, these Clauses shall prevail. 
Clause 6 
Description of the transfer(s) 
The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the
                      categories of personal data that are transferred and the
                      purpose(s) for which they are transferred, are specified
                      in Annex I.B.
Clause 7 – Not used
SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
Clause 8 
Data protection safeguards 
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable
                      efforts to determine that the data importer is able,
                      through the implementation of appropriate technical and
                      organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under
                      these Clauses. 
8.1 Instructions 
(a) The data exporter has informed the data importer that
                      it acts as processor under the instructions of its
                      controller(s), which the data exporter shall make
                      available to the data importer prior to processing.
(b) The data importer shall process the personal data
                      only on documented instructions from the controller, as
                      communicated to the data importer by the data exporter,
                      and any additional documented instructions from the data
                      exporter. Such additional instructions shall not conflict
                      with the instructions from the controller. The controller
                      or data exporter may give further documented instructions
                      regarding the data processing throughout the duration of
                      the contract. 
(c) The data importer shall immediately inform the data
                      exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.
                      Where the data importer is unable to follow the
                      instructions from the controller, the data exporter shall
                      immediately notify the controller. 
(d) The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the
                      same data protection obligations on the data importer as
                      set out in the contract or other legal act under Union or
                      Member State law between the controller and the data
                      exporter
                      (5).
                    
8.2 Purpose limitation 
The data importer shall process the personal data only
                      for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in
                      Annex I.B., unless on further instructions from the
                      controller, as communicated to the data importer by the
                      data exporter, or from the data exporter. 
8.3 Transparency 
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these
                      Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the
                      Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To
                      the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other
                      confidential information, including personal data, the
                      data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix
                      prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful
                      summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able
                      to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On
                      request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with
                      the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible
                      without revealing the redacted information. 
8.4 Accuracy 
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data
                      it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it
                      shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In
                      this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data
                      exporter to rectify or erase the data. 
8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for
                      the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the
                      provision of the processing services, the data importer
                      shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all
                      personal data processed on behalf of the controller and
                      certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or
                      return to the data exporter all personal data processed on
                      its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is
                      deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to
                      ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local
                      laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return
                      or deletion of the personal data, the data importer
                      warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with
                      these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and
                      for as long as required under that local law. This is
                      without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the
                      requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to
                      notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the
                      contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has
                      become subject to laws or practices not in line with the
                      requirements under Clause 14(a). 
8.6 Security of processing 
(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the
                      data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and
                      organisational measures to ensure the security of the
                      data, including protection against a breach of security
                      leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
                      alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data
                      (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the
                      appropriate level of security, they shall take due account
                      of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the
                      nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and
                      the risks involved in the processing for the data subject.
                      The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse
                      to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during
                      transmission, where the purpose of processing can be
                      fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the
                      additional information for attributing the personal data
                      to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain
                      under the exclusive control of the data exporter or the
                      controller. In complying with its obligations under this
                      paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the
                      technical and organisational measures specified in Annex
                      II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to
                      ensure that these measures continue to provide an
                      appropriate level of security. 
(b) The data importer shall grant access to the data to
                      members of its personnel only to the extent strictly
                      necessary for the implementation, management and
                      monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons
                      authorised to process the personal data have committed
                      themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
                      statutory obligation of confidentiality.
(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning
                      personal data processed by the data importer under these
                      Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures
                      to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its
                      adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify,
                      without undue delay, the data exporter and, where
                      appropriate and feasible, the controller after having
                      become aware of the breach. Such notification shall
                      contain the details of a contact point where more
                      information can be obtained, a description of the nature
                      of the breach (including, where possible, categories and
                      approximate number of data subjects and personal data
                      records concerned), its likely consequences and the
                      measures taken or proposed to address the data breach,
                      including measures to mitigate its possible adverse
                      effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to
                      provide all information at the same time, the initial
                      notification shall contain the information then available
                      and further information shall, as it becomes available,
                      subsequently be provided without undue delay. 
(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the
                      data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with
                      its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in
                      particular to notify its controller so that the latter may
                      in turn notify the competent supervisory authority and the
                      affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of
                      processing and the information available to the data
                      importer. 
8.7 Sensitive data 
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing
                      racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
                      philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic
                      data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
                      identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a
                      person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating
                      to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter
                      ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the
                      specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out
                      in Annex I.B. 
8.8 Onward transfers 
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data
                      to a third party on documented instructions from the
                      controller, as communicated to the data importer by the
                      data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed
                      to a third party located outside the European Union
                      (6)
                      (in the same country as the data importer or in another
                      third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third
                      party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the
                      appropriate Module, or if:
(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from
                      an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer; 
(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate
                      safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679; 
(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the
                      establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the
                      context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial
                      proceedings; or 
(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect
                      the vital interests of the data subject or of another
                      natural person. 
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data
                      importer with all the other safeguards under these
                      Clauses, in particular purpose limitation. 
8.9 Documentation and compliance 
(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal
                      with enquiries from the data exporter or the controller
                      that relate to the processing under these Clauses. 
                    
(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance
                      with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall
                      keep appropriate documentation on the processing
                      activities carried out on behalf of the controller. 
                    
(c) The data importer shall make all information
                      necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations
                      set out in these Clauses available to the data exporter,
                      which shall provide it to the controller. 
(d) The data importer shall allow for and contribute to
                      audits by the data exporter of the processing activities
                      covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if
                      there are indications of non-compliance. The same shall
                      apply where the data exporter requests an audit on
                      instructions of the controller. In deciding on an audit,
                      the data exporter may take into account relevant
                      certifications held by the data importer. 
(e) Where the audit is carried out on the instructions of
                      the controller, the data exporter shall make the results
                      available to the controller.
(f) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by
                      itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may
                      include inspections at the premises or physical facilities
                      of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be
                      carried out with reasonable notice. 
(g) The Parties shall make the information referred to in
                      paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any
                      audits, available to the competent supervisory authority
                      on request.
Clause 9 
Use of sub-processors 
(a) The data importer has the controller’s general
                      authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from
                      an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically
                      inform the controller in writing of any intended changes
                      to that list through the addition or replacement of
                      sub-processors at least 30 days in advance, thereby giving
                      the controller sufficient time to be able to object to
                      such changes prior to the engagement of the
                      sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the
                      controller with the information necessary to enable the
                      controller to exercise its right to object. The data
                      importer shall inform the data exporter of the engagement
                      of the sub-processor(s). 
(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to
                      carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the
                      controller), it shall do so by way of a written contract
                      that provides for, in substance, the same data protection
                      obligations as those binding the data importer under these
                      Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary
                      rights for data subjects.
                      (9)
                      The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the
                      data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8.
                      The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor
                      complies with the obligations to which the data importer
                      is subject pursuant to these Clauses. 
(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data
                      exporter’s or controller’s request, a copy of such a
                      sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments. To
                      the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other
                      confidential information, including personal data, the
                      data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior
                      to sharing a copy.
(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to
                      the data exporter for the performance of the
                      sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the
                      data importer. The data importer shall notify the data
                      exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its
                      obligations under that contract. 
(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party
                      beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the
                      event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased
                      to exist in law or has become insolvent – the data
                      exporter shall have the right to terminate the
                      sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor
                      to erase or return the personal data. 
Clause 10 
Data subject rights 
(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data
                      exporter and, where appropriate, the controller of any
                      request it has received from a data subject, without
                      responding to that request unless it has been authorised
                      to do so by the controller. 
(b) The data importer shall assist, where appropriate in
                      cooperation with the data exporter, the controller in
                      fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’
                      requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.
                      In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the
                      appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking
                      into account the nature of the processing, by which the
                      assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the
                      extent of the assistance required. 
(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a)
                      and (b), the data importer shall comply with the
                      instructions from the controller, as communicated by the
                      data exporter. 
Clause 11 
Redress 
(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a
                      transparent and easily accessible format, through
                      individual notice or on its website, of a contact point
                      authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly
                      with any complaints it receives from a data subject.
(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one
                      of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses,
                      that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue
                      amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each
                      other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate,
                      cooperate in resolving them. 
(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party
                      beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer
                      shall accept the decision of the data subject to: 
                    
(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in
                      the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of
                      work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to
                      Clause 13; 
(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the
                      meaning of Clause 18. 
(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be
                      represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or
                      association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1)
                      of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 
(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is
                      binding under the applicable EU or Member State law. 
                    
(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the
                      data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and
                      procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with
                      applicable laws. 
Clause 12 
Liability
(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for
                      any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of
                      these Clauses.
(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data
                      subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive
                      compensation, for any material or non-material damages the
                      data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject
                      by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under
                      these Clauses. 
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter
                      shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject
                      shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any
                      material or non-material damages the data exporter or the
                      data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data
                      subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights
                      under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the
                      liability of the data exporter and, where the data
                      exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller,
                      to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU)
                      2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as
                      applicable. 
(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held
                      liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data
                      importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to
                      claim back from the data importer that part of the
                      compensation corresponding to the data importer’s
                      responsibility for the damage. 
(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any
                      damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach
                      of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly
                      and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to
                      bring an action in court against any of these
                      Parties. 
(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable
                      under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back
                      from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation
                      corresponding to its/their responsibility for the
                      damage. 
(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a
                      sub-processor to avoid its own liability.
Clause 13 
Supervision
(a) Where the data exporter is not established in an EU
                      Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of
                      application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with
                      its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative
                      pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679: The
                      supervisory authority of the Member State in which the
                      representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of
                      Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in
                      Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory
                      authority. 
Where the data exporter is not established in an EU
                      Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of
                      application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with
                      its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a
                      representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679: The supervisory authority of one of the
                      Member States in which the data subjects whose personal
                      data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the
                      offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour
                      is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C,
                      shall act as competent supervisory authority. 
(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the
                      jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent
                      supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring
                      compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data
                      importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits
                      and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory
                      authority, including remedial and compensatory measures.
                      It shall provide the supervisory authority with written
                      confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.
                    
SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
Clause 14 
Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses
(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to
                      believe that the laws and practices in the third country
                      of destination applicable to the processing of the
                      personal data by the data importer, including any
                      requirements to disclose personal data or measures
                      authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data
                      importer from fulfilling its obligations under these
                      Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and
                      practices that respect the essence of the fundamental
                      rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary
                      and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one
                      of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation
                      (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these
                      Clauses.
(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in
                      paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular
                      of the following elements: 
(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including
                      the length of the processing chain, the number of actors
                      involved and the transmission channels used; intended
                      onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of
                      processing; the categories and format of the transferred
                      personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer
                      occurs; the storage location of the data
                      transferred; 
(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of
                      destination– including those requiring the disclosure of
                      data to public authorities or authorising access by such
                      authorities – relevant in light of the specific
                      circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable
                      limitations and safeguards
                      (12); 
                    
(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or
                      organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the
                      safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied
                      during transmission and to the processing of the personal
                      data in the country of destination. 
(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the
                      assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best
                      efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant
                      information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate
                      with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these
                      Clauses. 
(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under
                      paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent
                      supervisory authority on request. 
(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter
                      promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for
                      the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe
                      that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not
                      in line with the requirements under paragraph (a),
                      including following a change in the laws of the third
                      country or a measure (such as a disclosure request)
                      indicating an application of such laws in practice that is
                      not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). The
                      data exporter shall forward the notification to the
                      controller.
(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e),
                      or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe
                      that the data importer can no longer fulfil its
                      obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall
                      promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or
                      organisational measures to ensure security and
                      confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or
                      data importer to address the situation, if appropriate in
                      consultation with the controller. The data exporter shall
                      suspend the data transfer if it considers that no
                      appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured,
                      or if instructed by the controller or the competent
                      supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data
                      exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract,
                      insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data
                      under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than
                      two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to
                      termination only with respect to the relevant Party,
                      unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the
                      contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause
                      16(d) and (e) shall apply. 
Clause 15 
Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities
15.1 Notification 
(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter
                      and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if
                      necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it: 
                    
(i) receives a legally binding request from a public
                      authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws
                      of the country of destination for the disclosure of
                      personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such
                      notification shall include information about the personal
                      data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis
                      for the request and the response provided; or 
(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public
                      authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these
                      Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of
                      destination; such notification shall include all
                      information available to the importer. 
The data exporter shall forward the notification to the
                      controller.
(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the
                      data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of
                      the country of destination, the data importer agrees to
                      use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the
                      prohibition, with a view to communicating as much
                      information as possible, as soon as possible. The data
                      importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to
                      be able to demonstrate them on request of the data
                      exporter. 
(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of
                      destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data
                      exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the
                      contract, with as much relevant information as possible on
                      the requests received (in particular, number of requests,
                      type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether
                      requests have been challenged and the outcome of such
                      challenges, etc.). The data exporter shall forward the
                      information to the controller. 
(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information
                      pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the
                      contract and make it available to the competent
                      supervisory authority on request. 
(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the
                      obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e)
                      and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where
                      it is unable to comply with these Clauses. 
15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation 
(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of
                      the request for disclosure, in particular whether it
                      remains within the powers granted to the requesting public
                      authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful
                      assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds
                      to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of
                      the country of destination, applicable obligations under
                      international law and principles of international comity.
                      The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue
                      possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the
                      data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to
                      suspending the effects of the request until the competent
                      judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not
                      disclose the personal data requested until required to do
                      so under the applicable procedural rules. These
                      requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of
                      the data importer under Clause 14(e).
(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal
                      assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure
                      and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the
                      country of destination, make the documentation available
                      to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to
                      the competent supervisory authority on request. The data
                      exporter shall make the assessment available to the
                      controller. 
(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum
                      amount of information permissible when responding to a
                      request for disclosure, based on a reasonable
                      interpretation of the request. 
SECTION
                      IV – FINAL PROVISIONS 
Clause 16 
Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination 
(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data
                      exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for
                      whatever reason. 
(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of
                      these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the
                      data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data
                      to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or
                      the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to
                      Clause 14(f). 
(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the
                      contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of
                      personal data under these Clauses, where: 
(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of
                      personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph
                      (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored
                      within a reasonable time and in any event within one month
                      of suspension; 
(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent
                      breach of these Clauses; or 
(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding
                      decision of a competent court or supervisory authority
                      regarding its obligations under these Clauses.
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory
                      authority and the controller of such non-compliance. Where
                      the contract involves more than two Parties, the data
                      exporter may exercise this right to termination only with
                      respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have
                      agreed otherwise. 
(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the
                      termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c)
                      shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be
                      returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety.
                      The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data
                      importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the
                      data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the
                      data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with
                      these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the
                      data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the
                      transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that
                      it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses
                      and will only process the data to the extent and for as
                      long as required under that local law. 
(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by
                      these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a
                      decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU)
                      2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to

                      (1)
                      Where the data exporter is a processor subject to
                      Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union
                      institution or body as controller, reliance on these
                      Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing)
                      not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures
                      compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725
                      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
                      October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with
                      regard to the processing of personal data by the Union
                      institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free
                      movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No
                      45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295,
                      21.11.2018, p. 39), to the extent these Clauses and the
                      data protection obligations as set out in the contract or
                      other legal act between the controller and the processor
                      pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are
                      aligned. This will in particular be the case where the
                      controller and processor rely on the standard contractual
                      clauses included in Decision 2021/915. 
                      (2)
                      Not applicable 
                      (3)
                      Not applicable 
                      (4)
                      Not applicable 
                      (5)
                      See Article 28(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, where
                      the controller is an EU institution or body, Article 29(4)
                      of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. 
                      (6)
                      The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA
                      Agreement) provides for the extension of the European
                      Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland,
                      Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection
                      legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is
                      covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated
                      into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the
                      data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not
                      qualify as an onward transfer for the purposes of these
                      Clauses. 
                      (7)
                      Not applicable 
                      (8)
                      Not applicable 
                      (9)
                      This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor
                      acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in
                      accordance with Clause 7. 
                      (10)
                      Not applicable 
                      (11)
                      Not applicable 
                      (12)
                      As regards the impact of such laws and practices on
                      compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be
                      considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements
                      may include relevant and documented practical experience
                      with prior instances of requests for disclosure from
                      public authorities, or the absence of such requests,
                      covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This
                      refers in particular to internal records or other
                      documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in
                      accordance with due diligence and certified at senior
                      management level, provided that this information can be
                      lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical
                      experience is relied upon to conclude that the data
                      importer will not be prevented from complying with these
                      Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant,
                      objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider
                      carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient
                      weight, in terms of their reliability and
                      representativeness, to support this conclusion. In
                      particular, the Parties have to take into account whether
                      their practical experience is corroborated and not
                      contradicted by publicly available or otherwise
                      accessible, reliable information on the existence or
                      absence of requests within the same sector and/or the
                      application of the law in practice, such as case law and
                      reports by independent oversight bodies.
APPENDIX
EXPLANATORY NOTE: 
It must be possible to clearly distinguish the
                      information applicable to each transfer or category of
                      transfers and, in this regard, to determine the respective
                      role(s) of the Parties as data exporter(s) and/or data
                      importer(s). This does not necessarily require completing
                      and signing separate appendices for each transfer/category
                      of transfers and/or contractual relationship, where this
                      transparency can achieved through one appendix. However,
                      where necessary to ensure sufficient clarity, separate
                      appendices should be used.
