These contaminants pollute the soil, air and water and ultimately enter the food chain. Several physical, chemical and biological techniques have been developed to remove these contaminants; however, these methods are quite costly and not environmentally sound. Specifically, organic contaminants like pesticides, phenols, oils, pharmaceuticals and dyes are entering aquatic habitats and damaging these ecosystems. Application of aquatic macrophytes for the removal of organic contaminants has proved to be an eco-friendly and efficient tool to remediate aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic macrophytes such as Eichhorn crassipes, Elodea canadensis, Lemna minor, Pistia stratiotes, and Trapa natans can be used for reclamation of contaminated waste and wastewater systems. In addition, these plants help in carbon sequestration, and the biomass of these plants may be used to produce bioenergy (biofuel) at the same time. In this chapter, the potential of aquatic macrophytes for phytoremediation and bioenergy production along with carbon sequestration have been thoroughly discussed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They possess a paramount advantage of non-competitiveness with food crops over the first or second generation biofuel feedstocks. Specifically, low lignin content and higher concentrations of polysaccharides make these plants very attractive for biogas and liquid biofuel production. However, a regular supply of biomass is a limitation that can be overcome by employing harvesting techniques with sustainable measures, which ensure rapid regrowth of biomass for the next cycle. Harvesting of both aquatic macrophytes (weeds) as well as macroalgae is achieved by either manual or mechanical means. Following regular supply through effective harvesting, biofuel production can be further restricted due to their complex structural make-up. In order to improve the biofuel production, various pretreatment methods have been explored to disrupt the complex structure o...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The metals copper, aluminum, copper alloys (bronze), and elastomers caused significant levels of corrosive in biodiesel and biodiesel blend as opposed to low corrosion with petrodiesel. Specimens of stainless steel showed significant resistance to corrosion in biodiesel samples as compared to copper, aluminum, and copper alloys, but the level of corrosion was still higher than that in petrodiesel. Common methods adopted for measurement of corrosion include weight loss through static emersion tests, and electrochemical techniques by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or on Potentiostat/Galvanostat. The surfaces of the specific metal strips were analyzed by optical, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopy, revealing the nature and extent of corrosion.

The instruction of CSRS in institutions of higher education is increasing worldwide. The extent to which US MBA programs have developed academic programs and centers focused on CSRS could potentially be a way for business schools to distinguish themselves from other schools. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a Web-based search of the Web sites of the top-100 US MBA programs to ascertain the extent to which they have developed CSRS-related academic programs and centers. They then look specifically at the full-time MBA main Web page to ascertain to what extent these programs promote CSRS material.
