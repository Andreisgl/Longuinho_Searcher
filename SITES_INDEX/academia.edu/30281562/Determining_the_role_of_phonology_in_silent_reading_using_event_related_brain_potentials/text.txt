Participants read target words which were phonologically related, semantically related, both phonologically and semantically related or unrelated to a masked prime word. In experiment 1, participants performed a phonological task (decide whether targets rhymed with a previously heard rhyme). The phonological relation elicited a frontal negativity whereas the semantic relation elicited a left anterior negativity, both followed by an N400 at centro-parietal sites. In experiment 2, participants performed a semantic task (decide whether targets belonged to a previously presented semantic category). In contrast to experiment 1, phonological and semantic relations elicited an N400 over frontal sites. Together, these results demonstrate that phonological and semantic proc...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Psychological StudiesNaming Abilities and Orthographic Recognition during Childhood an Event-Related Brain Potentials Study2013 • Fabiola Gómez-velázquezDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroImageLinking semantic priming effect in functional MRI and event-related potentials2005 • Norihiro SadatoDownload Free PDFView PDFBrain and LanguageEvent-related brain potentials elicited during word recognition by adult good and poor phonological decoders2006 • Frances MartinDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
