Ndonga Wikipedia
--81.39.216.147 00:30, 1 July 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
In my opinion the Ndonga Wikipedia should be kept, but I want to hear your opinion. It has four stubs (if you count the list of the books of the bible), one image-only page, and the Main Page. The Recent changes log shows no activity apart from spam cleanup. -- Prince Kassad 21:47, 12 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Support closing
I feel it better be closed. I do have admin access to that wiki but I visit it only very infrequently. I have just been there and I found that every single page had been vandalised once again. This wiki has zero real activitiy and near zero content. Absolutely, this is a classical case for the incubator. --Johannes Rohr 07:43, 25 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support closure. Better to be put in the Incubator. Sr13 20:25, 28 March 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support. With 3 articles and about zero community/activity, it's definitely a good case for the Incubator, where it should be given the chance to evolve. Malafaya 14:15, 12 April 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support. I'm not sure I fully understand how the Incubator works, but surely it's meant for something like this, which would be fantastic to have, but is not really "an encyclopedia" (yet). I mean, it contains less text in its own language than your average personal ad. AshleyMorton 10:29, 23 April 2008 (UTC) (By the way, I know that my vote might not count, because I actually only signed up for a Meta account today, but I have been a sporadic editor at en. and occasionally at fr. for several years.)Reply[reply]
Support No activity, 5 articles, non-existing localisation, lots of spam activity. Move contents to Incubator and close until it has an actual community and proves to be viable. Siebrand 15:25, 18 May 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support - The Incubator is the best place for this wiki. --Jorunn 19:37, 18 May 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support The arguments against moving this wiki to the Incubator are either very weak or non-existent. Leptictidium 11:09, 8 September 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support Put it in the incubator. It's one of the most useless Wikis. Filper01 08:40, 19 February 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support Move to incubator.  This is the best place for it at this point in its' development.  It has no active community.  Cheers, Razorflame 07:20, 2 March 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support No real content, only target for vandals. Hugo.arg 14:42, 23 March 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
support: dead as a horse and there are hardly any real arguments of the oppose-side (only votes). --OosWesThoesBes 16:50, 1 April 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support Spamlink existed on the main page for nearly two months! --Filemon 15:54, 14 April 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
And before that the main page said for one and a half month that it was the Wikipedia in Drèents (Dutch Low Saxon). This was inserted by one of the main contributors to that wiki. --Jorunn 00:48, 30 April 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support There's no real content. Move it to the incubator. Bloodmerchant 15:48, 21 June 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Ndonga Wikipedia is absolutely useless. Consequently, I Support. Pmlineditor 12:33, 11 July 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support: lacked enough activity. Alexius08 16:03, 2 August 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
 Strong support: I definitely agree. This wiki should go into the incubator because I've head that all the articles were vandalised and because the wiki has been up for 3 years and there is no progress. Heck, if it doesn't accumulate more info in the incubator, it may be rejected even further into the Incubator Plus. I agree. Rascal the Peaceful 13:22, 29 August 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support Obviously nobody maintains the wiki, so it should be moved to the incubator wiki until some native speaker of the language comes along to improve the Mediawiki translations and adds content. --თოგო (D) 10:12, 31 August 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Support Twenty articles, mostly one-line-stubs. No progress. Bin it. Microchip08 sewb 11:25, 7 December 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Like I said, it passes my three-article-threshold so I won't support my own request. -- Prince Kassad 21:47, 12 December 2007 (UTC) Wait, I cannot even vote in my own discussion. -- Prince Kassad 18:56, 1 April 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Oppose Better than closure was, imho, to make more people aware of this Wikipedia, and best to make internet access cheaper and more widespread among the Ndonga speakers.

Oppose I wonder why all those opposing comments were invisible in the edited text? I changed this.

General comments
Another case of potential users to pay for the consequences of others' impatience? No thanks. I do not picture many possible future Sango speakers having things easy in an environment as Incubator. Not to mention this. The Incubator is only good for very few and specific cases (basically when testing is required by an existing community or by a few users glad to do so) and for savvy editors (not quite a likely situation for many minority language speakers). Imho Incubator is not being used but abused and I do not see a real point in chucking Sango Ndonga Wikipedia away into it just because of somebody else's impatience. --88.27.194.72 13:29, 20 December 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Comments from the Ndonga Committee of Users
We highly disapprove of this purposal and are willing to do anything it takes to save it from deletion like right now we had someone make a full fledge article in Ndonga. AfroUnderscoreStud 01:25, 21 December 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Publicizing role of incubator
If closure means that Ndonga Wikipedia is in the "incubator" what does that mean, and is there any effort to spread the word or work with potential contributors (such as the above appears to be)? Or does "incubator" in fact merely serve as a way station to deletion? (Sorry if the last question sounds a bit pointed, but that impression is not uncommon.)--A12n 14:24, 12 February 2010 (UTC)Reply[reply]
