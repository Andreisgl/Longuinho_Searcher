However, there exist relatively few comprehensive analyses of structural frequencies, and little consideration has been given to the appropriateness of using any particular set of corpus frequencies in modeling human language. We provide a comprehensive set of structural frequencies for a variety of written and spoken corpora, focusing on structures that have played a critical role in debates on normal psycholinguistics, aphasia, and child language acquisition, and compare our results with those from several recent papers to illustrate the implications and limitations of using corpus data in psycholinguistic research.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJaeger, T. F. (2006) Redundancy and syntactic reduction. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University.T. Florian JaegerComprehenders are sensitive to probabilistic distributions of linguistic events (Garnsey et al., 1997; Kamide et al., 2003; Konieczny, 2000; Staub and Clifton, 2006, inter alia). Expected words and structures are processed faster than unexpected ones. This raises the question whether syntactic production, too, is sensitive to probabilities of upcoming material. This thesis investigates cases of syntactic reduction, as in “I think (that) the commercial break is over”, where the word that can be omitted. I present evidence from corpus studies of spontaneous speech that syntactic reduction is more likely if the reduced constituent is predictable. Modern statistical regression models are used to guard against common challenges to corpus-based studies (such as clusters and multicollinearity). Taken together with evidence from phonetic reduction (in duration, formant quality, etc.; see, e.g., Aylett and Turk, 2004; Bell et al., 2003; van Son and Pols, 2003), phoneme omission (e.g. t/d deletion; see Bell et al., 2003; Gahl and Garnsey, 2004), and argument drop (Resnik, 1996), the evidence from syntactic reduction supports the Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis (PRH): “Where grammar allows it, form reduction is more likely, the more redundant the information conveyed by the omitted form details is”. The PRH is compatible with production pressure (Ferreira and Dell, 2000, inter alia) and audience design accounts of reduction (Hawkins, 2004, inter alia). The results are also compatible with ‘uniform information density’ accounts (Aylett, 1999; Aylett and Turk, 2004; Genzel and Charniak, 2002): speakers may insert or omit that to avoid peaks or troughs in information density. Uniform information density accounts integrate both production and audience design accounts, as a uniform amount of information per time/unit optimizes successful information transfer while minimizing production effort. The same probabilities that I show to influence production are known to influence comprehension (Garnsey et al., 1997). Hence, the results may be taken to argue that language users’ representations of constituents contain probabilistic information. In short, knowledge of grammar may imply knowledge of probabilities (see Gahl and Garnsey, 2004). The final part of the thesis presents a new approach to studying what information speakers use to keep track of probabilistic distributions. In a first step, several predictability estimates of the same event are derived using different sets of cues or slightly different assumptions about what the relevant structure is that speakers keep track of. In a second step, these different predictability estimates are compared with regard to how much variation in syntactic reduction they account for. The results suggest that both structural and surface cues are used to keep track of the probability of structures and that speakers keep track of rather specific structures.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Memory and LanguageSense and structure: Meaning as a determinant of verb subcategorization preferences2003 • Ken McRae, Jeff ElmanDownload Free PDFView PDFProbabilistic models of word order and syntactic discontinuity2005 • Roger LevyDownload Free PDFView PDFJaeger, T. F. 2010. Redundancy and Reduction: Speakers Manage Syntactic Information Density. Cognitive Psychology, 61(1), 23-62.T. Florian JaegerA principle of efficient language production based on information theoretic considerations is proposed: Uniform Information Density predicts that language production is affected by a preference to distribute information uniformly across the linguistic signal. This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers’ preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers’ preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well.Download Free PDFView PDFA syntactic approach toward the interpretation of some distributional frequencies: comparing relative clauses in Italian corpora and in elicited productioncristiano chesiA robust set of experimental results from previous studies on both production and comprehension of subject relatives (SRs) and object relatives (ORs) in Italian have confirmed the well known different status of SRs and ORs holding cross-linguistically in both children and adults, with ORs harder than SRs, in various dimensions. One crucial finding of these results concerns Italian-speaking adults who, in elicited production tasks, tend not to produce ORs in a systematic way and resort to the production of alternative structures: the privileged alternative is represented by use of passive in the relative, leading to the production of up to 90% of passive object relatives (PORs) in the studies considered. The contribution of this article is primarily comparative in nature, bringing into the picture a new dimension: a corpus study of (headed) SRs and ORs in standard Italian to be compared with the results from elicited production. The animacy feature is also manipulated in a new elicitation experiment adapting previous designs. Results indicate that, on the one hand simple frequency based considerations cannot be at the source of the ample resort to PORs in the elicited productions, as PORs are rather infrequent in the corpora of spontaneous production investigated; on the other hand, ORs with an inanimate relative head are relatively frequent in the same corpora, yet manipulation of the animacy feature does not play a role in favoring the elicited production of ORs headed by an inanimate noun phrase. We propose that the grammatical dimension in terms of intervention locality may offer a crucial key in interpreting the complex shape of the results and highlight that simple distributional frequency factors remain unreliable as for the expectations they can generate.Download Free PDFView PDFCognitionWhy is that? Structural prediction and ambiguity resolution in a very large corpus of English sentences2006 • Douglas RolandPrevious psycholinguistic research has shown that a variety of contextual factors can influence the interpretation of syntactically ambiguous structures, but psycholinguistic experimentation inherently does not allow for the investigation of the role that these factors play in natural (uncontrolled) language use. We use regression modeling in conjunction with data from the British National Corpus to measure the amount and specificity of the information available for disambiguation in natural language use. We examine the Direct Object/Sentential Complement ambiguity and the closely related issue of complementizer use in sentential complements, and find that both ambiguity resolution and complementizer use can be predicted from contextual information.Download Free PDFView PDFComputational LinguisticsLarge-Scale Induction and Evaluation of Lexical Resources from the Penn-II and Penn-III Treebanks2005 • Andy  WayDownload Free PDFView PDFBehavior Research Methods, Instruments, & ComputersVerb subcategorization frequencies: American English corpus data, methodological studies, and cross-corpus comparisons2004 • Douglas RolandDownload Free PDFView PDFContext Effects In Language Production: Models of Syntactic Priming In Dialogue Corpora2008 • David ReitterDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings of TLTAnalyzing an Italian treebank with state-of-the-art statistical parsers2004 • Giorgio SattaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
