Epidemiology of Symptomatic Acute Dengue Infection in Children, 2006–2009Saravudh Suvannadabba2012, PLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesDengue infection is one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases. More data regarding the disease burden and the prevalence of each clinical spectrum among symptomatic infections and the clinical manifestations are needed. This study aims to describe the incidence and clinical manifestations of symptomatic dengue infection in Thai children during 2006 through 2008. This study is a school-based prospective open cohort study with a 9,448 person-year follow-up in children aged 3-14 years. Active surveillance for febrile illnesses was done in the studied subjects. Subjects who had febrile illness were asked to visit the study hospital for clinical and laboratory evaluation, treatment, and serological tests for dengue infection. The clinical data from medical records, diary cards, and data collection forms were collected and analyzed. Dengue infections were the causes of 12.1% of febrile illnesses attending the hospital, including undifferentiated fever (UF) (49.8%), dengue fever (DF) (39.3%) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (10.9%). Headache, anorexia, nausea/vomiting and myalgia were common symptoms occurring in more than half of the patients. The more severe dengue spectrum (i.e., DHF) had higher temperature, higher prevalence of nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, diarrhea, petechiae, hepatomegaly and lower platelet count. DHF cases also had significantly higher prevalence of anorexia, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain during day 3-6 and diarrhea during day 4-6 of illness. The absence of nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, petechiae, hepatomegaly and positive tourniquet test may predict non-DHF. Among symptomatic dengue infection, UF is most common followed by DF and DHF. Some clinical manifestations may be useful to predict the more severe disease (i.e., DHF). This study presents additional information in the clinical spectra of symptomatic dengue infection.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesDengue Infection in Children in Ratchaburi, Thailand: A Cohort Study.

During March 2008 to 2009, 781 patients with fever regardless of chief complaint were recruited for acute dengue virus infection testing. Of the 781 tested, 73 (9.3%) were positive for dengue infection. Serotypes DENV-2 (77%) and -3 (23%) were detected by PCR. One patient met the diagnostic criteria for dengue hemorrhagic fever. Only 3 out of 73 (4.1%) febrile subjects testing positive for dengue infection were diagnosed with dengue fever by the treating physician. This study confirms dengue virus as an important cause of acute febrile illness in Medellin, Colombia, but it is difficult to diagnose without dengue diagnostic testing.Download Free PDFView PDFSimple Clinical and Laboratory Predictors of Chikungunya versus Dengue Infections in Adults2012 • L. Roman CarrascoBackground Dengue and chikungunya are co-circulating vector-borne diseases with substantial overlap in clinical presentations. It is important to differentiate between them during first presentation as their management, especially for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), is different. This study compares their clinical presentation in Singapore adults to derive predictors to assist doctors in diagnostic decision-making.Download Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesEarly Clinical Features of Dengue Virus Infection in Nicaraguan Children: A Longitudinal Analysis2012 • Oscar OrtegaDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesThe Early Clinical Features of Dengue in Adults: Challenges for Early Clinical Diagnosis2011 • Shera ChaterjiDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS neglected tropical diseasesCorrelation of serotype-specific dengue virus infection with clinical manifestations2012 • nicolas aguayoDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS Neglected Tropical DiseasesEvaluation of the Traditional and Revised WHO Classifications of Dengue Disease Severity2011 • María PérezDownload Free PDFView PDFCLINICAL PRESENTATION OF DENGUE IN 150 ADMITTED CASES IN DHAKA MEDICAL COLLEGE2006 • hanif mohammadDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS Neglected Tropical DiseasesClinical and Virological Features of Dengue in Vietnamese Infants2010 • Tran ChauDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Dhaka Medical CollegeSera-epidemiology of Dengue Virus Infection in Clinically Suspected Patients Attended in Dhaka Medical College Hospital During January to December 2016nusrat fatemaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
