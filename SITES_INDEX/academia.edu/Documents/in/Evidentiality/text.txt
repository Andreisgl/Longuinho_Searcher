Nel dibattito sulla prova specialistica, in particolare scientifica, si evoca spesso una formula, “Iudex peritus peritorum”, per rendere l’idea dell’autonomia valutativa riservata al giudice anche in questa sfera. Tuttavia, non solo l’idea si particolarizza in varianti molteplici e difficili da discernere, ma neppure è chiaro quali di esse siano compatibili con l’epistemologia giudiziaria accolta nel nostro sistema penale. Il presente saggio tenta di affrontare entrambi i problemi. Dopo aver illustrato le grandi articolazioni del ragionamento probatorio specialistico, nonché i principali modi in cui il giudice può contribuire al suo svolgimento, esso sottopone a critica questi ultimi, considerati come altrettante immagini del iudex peritus peritorum.Abstract. In the debate on the specialized evidence, especially on the scientific one, the formula “Iudex peritus peritorum” is often evoked to express the idea of the evaluation autonomy reserved to the judge also in this sphere. However, not only does the idea differentiate itself into multiple and difficult to discern variants, but it is not even clear which of them are compatible with the judicial epistemology accepted in our criminal system. This essay attempts to address both problems. Having illustrated the great articulations of the specialized evidential reasoning and the main ways in which the judge can contribute to its development, it critically scrutinizes the latter, considered as many images of the iudex peritus peritorum.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gaetano Carlizzi•  14  Philosophy of Science, Proof Theory, Law of evidence, Evidence(2006) A preliminary outline of evidentiality in EnglishThis is from my 2006 book Evaluation in Media Discourse, where it is described in more detail and is located in the appendix.

We have been able to analyse the process of grammaticalization with absolute reliability thanks to the applied technology of the Corpus of Old Catalan (CICA and CIGCA), in which linguistic variation is quite representative. This study takes a cognitive perspective (Langacker 1987, 1991, 1999, 2006; Pelyvás 2000, 2006) that provides us with the tools to set up a semantic network and the paths of semantic change.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andreu Sentí•  7  Catalan Language, Modality, Modal Verbs, EvidentialityFrench future: Exploring the future ratification hypothesisSave to LibraryDownloadby Alda Mari•  6  Semantics, Tense and Aspect Systems, Evidentiality, Epistemic modalityThe epistemization of person markers in reported speechEgophoricity is a cross-linguistically rare grammatical phenomenon.

While numerous descriptive studies have substantially improved our synchronic understanding of the category in recent years, we are still largely ignorant of the diachronic origins of egophoricity systems. In this article, we address this gap and discuss a diachronic process that transforms person agreement markers into egophoricity markers. Based on evidence from three Tibeto-Burman languages, we reconstruct the diachronic transformation and argue that the process starts out in reported speech clauses once the direct construal of the predicate is generalized. This generalization allows for the functional reanalysis of first and third person markers as egophoric and allophoric markers, while second person markers become functionally obsolete. Once person markers have undergone an epistemization in reported speech clauses, the innovative epistemic system is extended to simple declarative and interrogative clauses, where it gradually replaces the conservative person agreement system.Save to LibraryDownloadby Manuel Widmer and +1Marius Zemp•  3  Historical Linguistics, Tibeto-Burman Linguistics, EvidentialityEvidentiality Revisited Cognitive grammar, functional and discourse-pragmatic perspectivesEvidentiality Revisited focuses on semantic-pragmatic based frameworks for the study of evidentials and evidential strategies in European languages (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish).... moreEvidentiality Revisited focuses on semantic-pragmatic based frameworks for the study of evidentials and evidential strategies in European languages (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish). The book also presents discourse-pragmatic studies, with special emphasis on the use of evidential and epistemic expressions as resources for stancetaking in discourse. The volume addresses issues such as the relationship between the conceptual domains of evidentiality and epistemic modality, the role of evidential and epistemic resources in modelling stancetaking, the expression of speaker commitment to the validity status of the information, and the discourse-pragmatic variation of evidentiality and epistemic modality in discourse domains and genres. The volume offers a collection of contributions in which cross-linguistic studies and corpus-based studies contribute to provide further insights into a usage-based account of linguistic reality.Save to LibraryDownloadby Juana I.

Drawing on contemporary linguistic, psychodynamic, and phenomenological approaches, I focus on the lexical and semantic resources typical of highland Maya dream talk, illustrating the way these resources can be used to pragmatically negotiate questions of volition and authorial responsibility in relation to dream experience. By locating experience at a distance from the speaker, this framing provides an expressive resource for managing—mitigating, diffusing, or even disclaiming—agentic responsibility for described events or experiences, particularly those with significant implications for social status or self-definition. I close with reflections on the interpretive potential of an integrative “cultural psychodynamic” approach, one that draws on discourse-analytic, ethnographic, and psychoanalytic methods and theories in the service of understanding complex cultural subjectivities. Keywords: Chiapas, highland Maya, dreaming, agency, ethnopsychology, evidentiality, narrative, cultural psychodynamics"Save to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Groark•  17  Psychoanalysis, Anthropology, Philosophy of Agency, Linguistic AnthropologyExpressing and Describing SurpriseAmong emotions, surprise has been extensively studied in psychology.

In linguistics, surprise, like other emotions, has mainly been studied through the syntactic patterns involving surprise lexemes. However, little has been done so far to correlate the reaction of surprise investigated in psychological approaches and the effects of surprise on language. This cross-disciplinary volume aims to bridge the gap between emotion, cognition and language by bringing together nine contributions on surprise from different backgrounds – psychology, human-agent interaction, linguistics. Using different methods at different levels of analysis, all contributors concur in defining surprise as a cognitive operation and as a component of emotion rather than as a pure emotion. Surprise results from expectations not being met and is therefore related to epistemicity. Linguistically, there does not exist an unequivocal marker of surprise. Surprise may be either described by surprise lexemes, which are often associated with figurative language, or it may be expressed by grammatical and syntactic constructions.

The main corpus used is the famous biography of Milarepa written around the fifteenth century. Evidentiality specifies how the speaker represents the epistemological source and the access to the information. There are five evidential categories which are assumptive, sensory, inference, gnomic and hearsay. Epistemic modality implies the speaker assesses the probability a clause is true or his commitment regarding its veracity. There are four epistemic modalities which are emphatic assertion, probability, high probability and improbability. I also show that epistemic modality is not evidentiality. But the former can interplay with the latter in Tibetan. I first present equative (copulas) and existential verbs which indicate evidentiality and epistemic modality. There are eight verbs which mainly mark evidentiality (one of them indicates an epistemic modality). I describe the copulas yin, lags, ‘dra, yod, mchis, ‘dug, gda’ and bdog. There are also compound verbs which indicate one of these two functions or both: yin.par.‘dug, yod.par.‘dug, yod.par.gda’, yod.pa.yin, yod.pa.lags, yin.pa.‘dra, yin.las.che, yod.pa.‘dra.par.‘dug.Among these verbs, there are four evidential categories: assumptive, sensory, inference and gnomic. In parallel evidentiality interplays with different registers of language (honorific, humilific versus non-honorific), and features (identification, categorization, characterization and location). As for epistemic modality, aside from verbs, there is also one particle mod which points it out. I noticed the following epistemic modalities: emphatic assertion, probability, high probability and improbability. Then, I describe auxiliary verb constructions which also show the same evidential categories. I also exhibit the interaction between evidentiality and tense-aspect, evidentiality and registers of language, evidentiality and deixis. At last, I present auxiliary verb constructions which convey epistemic modality notably emphatic assertion and high probability interplaying with some evidential categories.Save to LibraryDownloadby guillaume oisel•  11  Semantics, Tibetan Studies, Sino-Tibetan Linguistics, Tibetan LiteraturePotential vs Use: Revisiting an Evidential Participial Construction in LithuanianThe paper deals with the existing potential of the grammatical realizations of evidentiality (so-called " passive evidentials ") in Lithuanian, which has been described theoretically in literature; however there are no studies that would... moreThe paper deals with the existing potential of the grammatical realizations of evidentiality (so-called " passive evidentials ") in Lithuanian, which has been described theoretically in literature; however there are no studies that would attest to the frequency and patterns of actual use of this construction in authentic contemporary Lithuanian. The analysis has been carried out in the light of the theoretical approach (Boye and Harder 2009; Boye 2012) and the template of the database of evidential markers in European languages (Wiemer and Stathi 2010). The study employs corpus based quantitative and qualitative methodology in order to investigate the distributional patterns of the-ma/-ta construction in different types of discourse. Though-ma/-ta participles are very 2 frequent in contemporary Lithuanian, their use in the evidential construction is very rare.Save to LibraryDownloadby AURELIA USONIENE•  4  Modality, Corpus Linguistics, Contrastive Analysis, EvidentialitySobre el estatus (para)evidencial de algunos adverbios de punto de vistaSi partimos de una definición de la evidencialidad como marcación de las fuentes de la información sin delimitar la extensión e intensión del sustantivo "fuente", muchas unidades lingüísticas con un semantismo muy alejado del de los... moreSi partimos de una definición de la evidencialidad como marcación de las fuentes de la información sin delimitar la extensión e intensión del sustantivo "fuente", muchas unidades lingüísticas con un semantismo muy alejado del de los morfemas evidenciales considerados “prototípicos” pueden llegar a clasificarse como evidenciales. Un ejemplo de ello es el caso de algunos adverbios de punto de vista: los adverbios de perspectiva típicos y atípicos, sus variantes con valor relacional de ámbito y algunas construcciones inglesas en "-wise".Teniendo en cuenta estas consideraciones, en el presente artículo se aplica una nueva distinción conceptual entre "fuente", "base" y "modo de acceso a la información" con el fin de identificar con unos criterios más firmes aquellas unidades que, de acuerdo con su semántica, son unidades evidenciales, y de distinguirlas de otras piezas que tan solo lo son en apariencia, pues no codifican el parámetro "modo de acceso a la información", sino que únicamente transmiten información acerca de otros parámetros epistemológicos próximos a aquel (la" base" o la "fuente"). La aplicación de esta propuesta muestra que algunos adverbios de punto de vista cuyo semantismo, aparentemente, podría ajustarse al que se atribuye normalmente a los evidenciales no funcionan, en realidad, como unidades especializadas en la marcación de la evidencialidad.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dámaso Izquierdo Alegría•  4  Terminology, Evidentiality, Sentence adverbs, Viewpoint adverbsRedewiedergabe zwischen Konnektivität und Modalität: Zur Markierung von Redewiedergabe in Dolmetscheräußerungen in gedolmetschten Arzt-Patientengesprächen.This study analyzes the functionality of reported speech marking in interpreter’s utterances in authentic ad-hoc-interpretated German-Turkish and German-Portuguese doctor-patient communication (Special attention is paid to the Turkish... moreThis study analyzes the functionality of reported speech marking in interpreter’s utterances in authentic ad-hoc-interpretated German-Turkish and German-Portuguese doctor-patient communication (Special attention is paid to the Turkish reported speechmarkers diyor ‘says/ is saying’ and –mIş, to two Portuguese markers (the verbum dicendi contar que ’to tell that’ and the subjunctor que ‘that’) as well as to German meinen ‘mean, reckon’). Whereas guides to medical interpreting recommend to avoid the marking of reported speech, in our data it is used frequently (especially in the Turkish data) and appears in the German-Turkish and the German-Portuguese data basically in the same situations, particulary in risk communication, communication about clinical findings, and medical interviews. It is argued that it is used as a connectivity procedure on the one hand, and as a procedure to modalize the utterance on the other. The marking of reported speech does not focus on the proposition as other connective procedures do, but rather focuses on the speech situation, i.e. the participants. Therefore, this connectivity procedure is evenmore basic than others. By relinking fragments of the propositional content to their source the interpreter modalizes the utterance in a specific way. The challenge for interpreter trainings is that the use of reported speech marking may facilitate or hamper the communicative exchange between doctor and patient. It should therefore be used consciously by interpreters.Português:Este estudo – elaborado no âmbito do projeto “Interpretação no Hospital” do Centro de Pesquisa sobre Multilingualismo na Universidade de Hamburgo - objetiva analisar as funções dos marcadores de reprodução de fala em enunciados de intérpretes de comunicações autênticas entre médicos alemães e pacientes turcos ou portugueses traduzidos por intérpretes não-profissionais. Atenção especial é dada para a análise dos marcadores diyor ‘diz/ está dizendo’ e –mIş em turco, contar que e o subjunctor que em português, assim como meinen ‘achar’ em alemão. Enquanto guias para a interpretação em contextos medicais recomendam evitar marcar a fala reproduzida como tal, nos dados por nós analisados os intérpretes marcam-na com freqüencia (especialmente nos dados em turco). Os marcadores dereprodução de fala são usados nos dados teuto-turcos e teuto-portugueses basicamentenas mesmas situações, especialmente na comunicação sobre riscos, resultados de análise médica e de anamnésia. Avança-se a hipótese que a marcação da reprodução de fala serve como procedimento de conectividade dum lado e como procedimento de modalização doutrolado, só que – a diferença de outros procedimentos conectivos a marcação da reprodução de fala não enfoca a proposição, mas sim a situação de fala, i.e. os participantes – sendo assim mais básico para a coesão do que outros procedimentos. Ligando fragmentos do conteúdo proposicional à sua fonte, o intérprete modaliza o enunciado de maneira específica. O desafio que enfrenta a formação de intérpretes para esta tarefa é que a marcação de reprodução de fala pode facilitar ou dificultar a comunicação entre médicos e pacientes. Por isso é necessário usá-la de maneira consciente.Save to LibraryDownloadby Thomas Johnen•  20  Discourse Analysis, Portuguese, German Language, ModalityScalise Sugiyama 2021 Fiction that Fiction is Fiction ASEBLJournalvol15JanuarySave to LibraryDownloadby Michelle  Scalise Sugiyama•  4  Storytelling, Hunter-Gatherers (Anthropology), Evidentiality, Fiction'Devoir' épistémique à l’indicatif et au conditionnel : inférence ou prédiction ?

The functional development and the diffusion of these structures will be investigated in a corpus of Latin texts ranging from the times of Plautus to the tenth century. An overview of the characteristics of these constructions in medieval Italian, French, and Castilian will also be provided. Given the particular nature of the evolution of present participles in the transition between Latin and the Romance languages, in the sections of the paper devoted to the analysis of Italian, French, and Castilian, concurrent gerundival constructions will be taken into account as well. Within this framework, the relationship between the cultural, linguistic and stylistic reference models of the investigated texts proved to be of crucial importance for the analysis of the diffusion of present participle structures.L'obiettivo principale di questo contributo è quello di proporre una descrizione dell’evoluzione dell'uso delle strutture con participio presente dipendenti da verbi di percezione in latino, seguendo un arco diacronico che va da Plauto fino al medioevo centrale.

Evidentiality thus becomes one essential tool to enact the self. To explore the role of evidentials in different illness stories, 32 unsolicited narratives of eating disorders (ED), 28 accounts of borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 29 testimonies of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were selected from the Internet. The discursive analysis of the evidential strategies revealed that, in ED narratives, the enactment of the self was realized via visual perception, and the body was construed as self. In BPD narratives, inner emotional states were adopted as the source of evidence, and the mood was defined as self. In CFS narratives, the source of evidence to define the self was bodily perceptions, and sensations were understood as self. These results indicate that evidentials are genre-sensitive and develop particular discursive functions in different illness narratives.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carolina Figueras Bates•  5  Clinical Psychology, Narrative, Narrative Psychology, Narrative and IdentityHandgreifliche Beispiele in Michel Serres' "Philosophie der Gemenge und Gemische"Save to LibraryDownloadby Jessica Güsken•  7  Aesthetics, History of the Senses, Michel Serres, Phenomenology of TouchContribución al estudio de la evidencialidad en las noticias de los medios digitales peruanos actuales: el condicional como forma evidencialA pesar de que muchos especialistas en el estudio de la evidencialidad en el español consideran que esta lengua no tiene rasgos evidenciales gramaticales propiamente dichos, sino más bien léxicos, se ha podido advertir que en las... moreA pesar de que muchos especialistas en el estudio de la evidencialidad en el español consideran que esta lengua no tiene rasgos evidenciales gramaticales propiamente dichos, sino más bien léxicos, se ha podido advertir que en las últimas décadas hay una forma verbal que ha empezado a ganar importancia en los medios de comunicación y que tiene como fin manifestar una actitud epistémica del autor respecto de lo que comunica.

CERTAINTY, or EPISTEMIC MODALITY, is a linguistic expression of an estimation of the likelihood that a particular state of affairs is, has been, or will be true.The study describes how explicitly marked certainty can be predictably and dependably identified in texts, and answers the following research questions:1) How is explicit certainty expressed linguistically in English?2) What are the patterns and frequencies of occurrence of explicit certainty markers?3) How much inter-subjective agreement can be reached by readers when identifyingand categorizing explicit certainty in texts?A dataset of 2,343 sentences in 80 New York Times Service news reports and editorials was analyzed for occurrences of explicit certainty markers (e.g., definitely, somewhat)based on a four-dimensional categorization model. The dimensions included: level (absolute, high, moderate, low certainty, and uncertainty), perspective (the writer’s pointof view, reported direct participant’s account, and reported expert’s view), focus (opinions, emotions, or judgments and facts or events), and time (past, present, future, and irrelevant). The intercoder reliability results are modest but show improvements with longer coder training and stricter codebook instructions.The model’s five-level typology is subdivided into forty-three syntactico-semantic classes. Central modal auxiliary verbs, gradable adjectives in their superlative degree, and adverbial intensifiers frequently express explicit certainty, while adjectival downtoners and adverbial value disjuncts rarely do so. Explicitly-qualified statements occur at a significantly higher rate in editorials than in news reports (means of 0.94 and 0.7 certainty markers per sentence, respectively). Editorials have a high likelihood of starting and ending with an explicit certainty-qualified statement, while news reports tend to start with an implicitly certain statement, and have equal chances of ending with an implicitly or explicitly certainty-qualified statement.The model can serve as an analytical framework for automated certainty identification, a novel type of analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Such a framework allowstracking of certainty levels in texts over time and among text genres. This contribution potentially enhances automated search capabilities in NLP and other information accessapplications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Victoria L Rubin•  13  Rhetoric, Pragmatics, Stylistics, Content AnalysisSherpa-English English-Sherpa Dictionary with Literary Tibetan and Nepali Equivalents""The Sherpa-English and English-Sherpa Dictionary (SEESD) is the product of a very fruitful collaboration between two Sherpa scholars and two European linguists who are specialists in the Tibetic languages.

We will first discuss reference grammars, which are necessary for any cross-linguistic study of evidentials. This is followed by a discussion of (different types of) usage-based data, as well as natural language data and stimulus-based data collection used in linguistic fieldwork. We will end our discussion by examining data collected by means of questionnaires and acceptability judgements. It is shown that all the types of data discussed are relevant for a full understanding of evidentiality, but they differ in their contribution and complement each other. For example, usage-based data is necessary for studying frequencies in languages, while reference grammars reveal what is common across languages.Save to LibraryDownloadby Seppo Kittilä and +1Lotta  Jalava•  5  Linguistic Typology, Evidentiality, Data Collection, Field linguisticsDiscourse enclitics in Tena Kichwa: A corpus-based account of information structure and epistemic meaningThis thesis explores the meaning and functions of discourse enclitics in Tena Kichwa, a Quechuan language spoken in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

The enclitics in question are non-obligatory, word-final markers, attaching to hosts from all grammatical categories. Their meanings range from marking information structural categories to encoding the epistemic authority held by the speaker and the addressee. The thesis focuses on the semantics of the markers and their role in structuring TK discourse. In the first two chapters, I introduce the context of this study and provide a sketch of the grammar of Tena Kichwa. Subsequently, I describe the morphosyntactic properties of all Tena Kichwa enclitics and analyse their subset as a paradigm of ‘discourse’ enclitics. Consequently, I discuss the role of discourse enclitics in marking information structure, focusing on the markers which indicate change of topic and contrastive, interrogative and verum foci. Subsequently, I describe the epistemic semantics of the enclitics =mi and =cha, previously analysed as evidentials (e.g. Weber 1986; Floyd 1997; Faller 2002). I show that in Tena Kichwa, they are better analysed as markers related to epistemic authority. In the final chapters, I discuss the relationship between the information structural and epistemic meaning of the markers, showing that the enclitics form a notionally coherent morphosyntactic system, the core function of which is providing a structure for discourse by managing common ground. I also show that the non-obligatoriness of the markers can be at least partially accounted for if the notion of speaker and hearer expectation is taken into account. The analysis presented in the thesis is based on a corpus of thirteen hours of naturalistic discourse data, complemented by elicitation and stimuli-based tasks. This documentary corpus of Tena Kichwa has been deposited in the ELAR Archive, and will also be deposited in the Archive of Languages and Cultures of Ecuador.Save to LibraryDownloadby Karolina Grzech•  13  Pragmatics, Language Documentation, Endangered Languages, Discourse MarkersClause-typing and Evidentiality in Ecuadorian SionaSave to LibraryDownloadby Martine Bruil•  5  Historical Linguistics, Semantics, Grammaticalization, EvidentialityEvidentiality and epistemic modality: On the close relationship between two different categories (Bert Cornilie. 2009.

Given the complexity of the relations among modal and evidential expressions, their constant diachronic evolution, and the variation found in different English-speaking areas, and in different genres and discourse domains, the volume addresses the following issues: the conceptual nature of modality, the relationship between the domains of modality and evidentiality, the evolution and current status of the modal auxiliaries and other modal expressions, the relationship with neighbouring grammatical categories (tense, aspect, mood), and the variation in different discourse domains and genres, in modelling stance and discourse identities. http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/182779Save to LibraryDownloadby An Van linden and +1Juana I.

My personal interest is related to my longstanding practice of a translator from and to Albanian that preceded scientific activities. Anyone who translates this pair of languages – Bulgarian and Albanian – has encountered difficulties in conveying evidential forms. Over time, I have developed some intuition what can and what can not be said using evidentials, but the question remained: why it can or it can not be said. I found different answers in books and papers and so I decided to give my answer regarding those two languages, one of which is my mother tongue and the other I am supposed to know well enough.This comparative study aims to make a relatively complete and balanced representation of the category of evidentiality in Bulgarian and Albanian. The admirative is also included, since the two categories are related, and moreover, in Albanian admirative is the dominant category. In the first part, I outline the research trends on the issue, with emphasis on those related to Bulgarian and Albanian. In the second part, I deal with theoretical issues related to the terminology, the status of the category, the systematic organization of its members, its origin and degree of grammarization. In the third part, I examine the characteristics of the evidentials (renarrative, inferential, dubitative) according to certain criteria: their interaction with other verb categories – person, number and tense, their use in different types of sentences and in different text types and registers. The interaction with the aspect in Bulgarian is partially affected. The fourth part follows the same scheme, but refers to the admirative. The study is based on authentic language examples, as I believe that correct conclusions can only be made on the basis of rich language material.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ekaterina Tarpomanova•  4  Balkan Studies, Grammaticalization, Morphology (Languages And Linguistics), EvidentialityA descriptive grammar of Denjongke (Sikkimese Bhutia)This work is a descriptive grammar of Denjongke, or Sikkimese Bhutia (also known as Lhoke or Sikkimese) (ISO 639-3 sip), an endangered Tibeto-Burman, Tibetic language spoken in the Indian state of Sikkim.

The study is based on original fieldwork conducted over more than six years. The theoretical framework is functionalist-typological and may further be characterized as an application of Basic Linguistic Theory. The discussion is data-oriented and aims to describe Denjongke in its own terms.  The grammar begins with an introduction to the language and the people who speak it and continues with a description of phonology and an introduction to word classes, suffixes and clitics. The remainder of the grammar presents a mainly functionally-oriented description, starting with phrase-level syntax and proceeding through clausal syntax to discourse. The last chapter on vocabulary and the texts in the appendix provide a cultural window into Denjongke speakers' life.  Denjongke is an incipient tone language with 43 consonants and eight vowels. Nasalization and length are contrastive in vowels. The analysis establishes four major word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) and eleven minor word classes. Many nouns and verbs have ordinary and honorific equivalents. Controlled vs. non-controlled verbs occur in phonologically related pairs. Unlike many Tibetic languages, Denjongke does not make a clusivity distinction in first person plural pronouns. There are five case-marking enclitics some of which may be stacked.  In syntax, the marking of A argument shows signs of both syntactic and pragmatic control. The marking of P argument is sensitive to animacy, specificity and affectedness. Denjongke has a rich array of copula forms, which mark three evidential values: personal, sensorial and neutral. The semantically oriented category “personal” differs from the more syntactically-oriented Lhasa Tibetan category “egophoric”.  Denjongke is a clause-chaining language and has a wide variety of adverbial clauses, which are expressed through various constructions, including ten converbs. Relative clauses are a subclass of genitive-marked constituent-modifying clauses. The last chapter addresses some interesting features of Denjongke lexicon, including ideophones, i.e. vividly descriptive words which are semantically, phonologically and morphologically distinct from other words.Save to LibraryDownloadby Juha Yliniemi•  20  Synchronic Linguistics (Or Descriptive Linguistics), Tibetan Studies, Anthropology of Tibet and the Himalayas, Ideophones'Devoir' au conditionnel : valeur évidentio-modale et origine du conditionnelLe but de cet article est double: examiner l'origine du conditionnel dans la forme 'devrait' et comparer la valeur de 'devoir' au conditionnel avec celle du même verbe à l'indicatif.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patrick Dendale•  4  Evidentiality, Epistemic modality, Lexical evidential markers, EvidentialsA Grammar of Spoken Dzongkha.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Watters•  4  Tone systems, Tibeto-Burman Linguistics, Evidentiality, Case StudyПРЕИЗКАЗВАНЕТО В ОБУЧЕНИЕТО ПО БЪЛГАРСКИ ЕЗИКСтатията е посветена на преизказването – на неговата семантика, форми и употреби в обучението по български език в 7. клас.

Първо се разглежда частта от учебната програма по български език за 7. клас, засягаща преизказването, а после се съпоставят терминологията, дефинициите, формообразуването и употребите на преизказните форми в трите учебника, одобрени от МОН. Във всички части коментарите са свързани с въпроса доколко заложеното в учебната програма и в учебниците съответства на постиженията на съвременната българистика в областта на преизказването.This article is focused on the issue of the reported speech - its semantics, forms and usage in the 7th Grade Bulgarian Language Teaching. First, the paper considers the part of the curriculum in Bulgarian Language which is related to the reported speech. After that, it compares the terminology, the definitions, the inflection and the usage of the reported speech given in the three textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education. The comments, generated in each part, deal with the question whether the studied material both in the curriculum and the textbooks is updated to the latest achievements of the contemporary Bulgarian studies in the scope of the reported speech.Save to LibraryDownloadby Krasimira  Aleksova•  2  Evidentiality, Renarrative evidentialStill Mirative After All These YearsSave to LibraryDownloadby Scott DeLancey•  6  Pragmatics, Discourse Markers, Modality, EvidentialityВопрос или утверждение?
