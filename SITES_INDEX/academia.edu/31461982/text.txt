Weakening of the monsoon after ~5 ka BP (and droughts throughout the Asia) is a strong contender for the Harappan collapse, although controversy exists about the synchroneity of climate change and collapse of civilization. One reason for this controversy is lack of a continuous record of cultural levels and palaeomonsoon change in close proximity. We report a high resolution oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) record of animal teeth-bone phosphates from an archaeological trench itself at Bhirrana, NW India, preserving all cultural levels of this civilization. Bhirrana was part of a high concentration of settlements along the dried up mythical Vedic river valley 'Saraswati', an extension of Ghaggar river in the Thar desert. Isotope and archaeological data suggest that the pre-Harappans started inhabiting this area along the mighty Ghaggar-Hakra rivers fed by intensified monsoon from 9 to 7 ka BP. The monsoon monotonically declined after 7 ka yet the settlements continued to survive from early to mature Harappan time. Our study suggests that other cause like change in subsistence strategy by shifting crop patterns rather than climate change was responsible for Harappan collapse.Download Free PDFView PDFAGU Fall Meeting AbstractsHolocene Evolution of the Indus River Basin: the effect of climate and drainage reorganization on the Harappan2009 • Peter CliftThe Indus River basin has evolved significantly during the Holocene and may have affected the Harappan Civilization which is believed to have collapsed around 2000 BC. We aim to understand the links between drainage evolution, the intensity of the South Asian Monsoon and the development of this early human society. Sediment was sampled from modern rivers, pits and shallow boreholes in the alluvial plains of the Indus and the inactive Ghaggar-Hakra tributary.

The evidence of Sit Shamshi and Mohenjo-daro splendour of śikhara, 'tower' and puṣkariṇī 'temple tank' where prayers are offered validate the kole.l 'temple rebus: kole.l 'smithy, forge' evidenced in Indus Script corpora. The prayers are expressions of debt owed to ancestors whose heritage is followed in the metalworking traditions and knowledge systems of Sarasvati Civilization. An emphatic evidence is provided by the octagonal pillar in a fire-altar of Binjor. This octagonal pillar constitutes the Rudrabhāga of Śivalinga venerated all over India and in the Ancient Far East. In 1940, archaeologist M.S. Vats discovered three Shiva Lingas at Harappa, dating more than 5,000 years old. This rare archival photo shows that ancient Shiva Linga as it was being excavated from the Harappa site. Vietnam. Sandstone. Asian Civilisations Museum Ziggurat in Hindu idiom is a śikhara, 'tower' and a place to offer prayers, water ablutions to the Sun and the ancestors. The processes of offering water ablutions in front of a stepped tower are vividly presented in the bronze model Sit Shamshi (Elamite bronze model of a temple in the Louvre, Paris) as prayers to the Sun.

"A ziggurat (/ˈzɪɡəræt/ ZIG-ə-rat; Akkadian: ziqqurat, D-stem of zaqāru "to build on a raised area") is a type of massive stone structure built in ancient Mesopotamia. It has the form of a terraced compound of successively receding stories or levels. Notable ziggurats include the Great Ziggurat of Ur near Nasiriyah, the Ziggurat of Aqar Quf near Baghdad, the now destroyed Etemenanki in Babylon, Chogha Zanbil in Khūzestān and Sialk." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat This is rare video which enabled you to watch Mohenjodaro, the oldest civilization of mankind, as bird’s eye. This video was recorded on 9th February 2017 on the occasion of International Conference on Mohenjodaro & Indus Valley Civilization arranged by “National Fund for Mohenjodaro”, Ministry of Culture, Tourism & Antiquities – Government of Sindh. Directed by: Amar Fayaz Buriro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2ibUMQ5cgI&t=1s (8:57) The video clearly demonstrates that the dome on the 'stupa' mound is NOT a dome at all but a semicircular structure and has a platform in front to receive the offerings of adorants.

Andrew Lawler Science 06 Jun 2008: Vol. 320, Issue 5881, pp. 1280 DOI: 10.1126/science.320.5881.1280 Summary A Buddhist stupa in the center of the largest Indus city may actually be a monument from Indus times. If so, it will force Indus scholars to rethink the religious and political nature of the civilization, long thought to lack grand temples and palaces. https://andrewlawler.com/website/wp-content/uploads/Science-2008-Lawler-Buddhist_Stupa_or_Indus_Temple-1280.pdf Science-2008-Lawler-Buddhist_Stupa_or_Indus_Temple-1280.pdf The domed structure at Mohenjo Daro may date to Indus times, not later -- Andrew Lawler. The most imposing structure of the 250 hectare site of Mohenjo-daro is the highest mond with a ruined dome. This structure is in a courtyard originally surrounded by buildings. John Marshall and the early archaeologists at th site considered this dome to be a Bauddham Stupa surrounded by cells for monks. The entire structure is built using burnt bricks. Andrew Lawleer cites the views of Giovanni Verardi, University of Naples archaeologist that this structure may be a monument from Indus times. Verardi further argues that the coins found dated to Kushana period might have been buried later and therefore of little value in dating the structure. Michael Jansen does NOT find any Kushan shards at the mound site. Verardi suggests that the original structure may have been a series of platforms,perhaps similar to the Ur ziggurat in Mesopotamia build around 2100 BCE. This date is significant because this is the Mature Period of Sarasvati Civilization. Ziggurat-like structures were seen in many sites from Mesopotamia to Turkmenistan during 3rd millennium BCE. I suggest that the series of platforms provide for a comparison with the 'tower' shown on Sit Shamshi bronze model (Louvre Museum).Download Free PDFView PDFNeoglacial Climate Anomalies and the Harappan MetamorphosisDorian Fuller, Peter CliftAbstract. Climate exerted constraints on the growth and decline of past human societies but our knowledge of temporal and spatial climatic patterns is often too restricted to address causal connections. At a global scale, the inter-hemispheric thermal balance provides an emergent framework for understanding regional Holocene climate variability. As the thermal balance adjusted to gradual changes in the seasonality of insolation, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone migrated southward accompanied by a weakening of the Indian summer monsoon. Superimposed on this trend, anomalies such as the Little Ice Age point to asymmetric changes in the extratropics of either hemisphere. Here we present a reconstruction of the Indian winter monsoon in the Arabian Sea for the last 6000 years based on paleobiological records in sediments from the continental margin of Pakistan at two levels of ecological complexity: sedimentary paleo-DNA reflecting water column environmental states and planktonic foraminifers sensitive to winter conditions. We show that strong winter monsoons between ca. 4,500 and 3,000 years ago occurred during an interval of weak interhemispheric temperature contrast, which we identify as the Early Neoglacial Anomaly (ENA), and were accompanied by changes in wind and precipitation patterns across the eastern Northern Hemisphere and Tropics. This coordinated climate reorganization may have helped trigger the metamorphosis of the urban Harappan civilization into a rural society through a push-pull migration from summer flood-deficient river valleys to the Himalayan piedmont plains with augmented winter rains. Finally, we speculate that time-transgressive landcover changes due to aridification of the Tropics may have led to a generalized instability of the global climate during ENA at the transition from the warmer Holocene Optimum to the cooler Neoglacial.

Thoughts about Environmental and Cultural Diversity in the Indus Civilization IN2018 • Danika Parikh, Jennifer BatesThere is clear evidence for degrees of uniformity in specific types of material culture that were used across the large area occupied by the populations that comprised the Indus Civilization. There is also evidence that there was considerable cultural diversity across its environmentally varied extent. J. Mark Kenoyer and others have described the cultural material that is widely attested across this area as a veneer that overlays a considerable degree of variation in material use and practices (e.g. Meadow and Kenoyer 1997). The tension between uniformity and diversity has significant ramifications for our understanding of a range of social, economic, and even political factors relating to Indus populations in the periods before, during and after South Asia’s first period of urbanism. This contribution considers the range of variability inherent during these periods by assessing the diversity evident in four different categories of data, and the relationships between those datasets.Download Free PDFView PDFPerspectives from the Indus: Contexts of Interaction in the Late Harappan/Post-Urban PeriodRita  WrightDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Field Archaeology Petrie_&_Lynam_2019_Revisiting Settlement Contemporaneity and Exploring Stability and Instability: Case Studies from the Indus Civilization_JFA2019 • Cameron Petrie, Frank  LynamDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
