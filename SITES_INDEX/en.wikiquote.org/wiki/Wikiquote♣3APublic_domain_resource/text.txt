There are many resources available on the net that are in the public domain, and therefore freely usable without restrictions for Wikiquote content. 
There are also many copyrighted resources whose licensing terms are liberal enough that they can generally be used as well. For these, see Wikipedia:Free or semi-free non-Public-Domain information resources and Wikipedia:GNU Free Documentation License resources.
This page is intended as a list of only true public domain text resources. For images, see Wikipedia:Public domain image resources.
See also Wikipedia:Public domain resource for other resources specific to Wikipedia. This article is to list resources in addition to those already listed for Wikipedia that would be specifically usful for Wikiquote.
Sources for finding public domain resources[edit]
Here are some web searches which may help discover U.S. Federal Government and other public domain documents.  Please note that you must still manually verify that documents are in the public domain. Please note that not all sites in the .gov domain are U.S. federal government sites: some may be U.S. state or other local government sites.
