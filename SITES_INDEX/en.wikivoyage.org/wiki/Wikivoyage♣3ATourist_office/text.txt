Welcome to the tourist office
The Wikivoyage tourist office is a place where you can ask travel-related questions about any place in the world. Wikivoyage volunteers will do their best to find the relevant information (or just reply off the top of their expert heads) and reply to you.
Before you ask your question here, be sure to search our travel guide for the destination or topic you're considering. Many questions are already answered within our guides! In addition, some of our destinations have docents who have volunteered to answer questions about specific places. If neither of those avenues bear fruit, then please ask away!
This page is for travel-related questions only. Information on how to contribute to Wikivoyage is at Help:Contents, while questions about Wikivoyage itself may be posed at the Pub. Queries regarding general information on non-travel topics may be made at Wikipedia's Reference desk; some topics tangentially related to travel include:
the Humanities desk, which deals with geopolitics, culture, and human geography
the Science desk, which deals with natural processes, physical geography, and engineering (vehicles, transportation design, etc.)
Please note that we can not guarantee a response and can not be held liable for incorrect or outdated information.
Answered questions will be moved to the Archives after two weeks of inactivity.
Want a faster answer?
How can I get my question answered?
Explain clearly what you want to know.
Provide a short heading that gives the general topic of the question.
Tell us what part of the world your question applies to.
Don't post personal contact information – it will be removed. We'll answer here within a few days.
Don't post questions that common sense or a search engine can answer in a couple of seconds. 
Disclaimer
This is a travel guide that anyone can edit and that relies entirely on volunteer contributions. We do our best, but nothing on this page or elsewhere on the site can be guaranteed to be up-to-date or entirely accurate.
In particular, check with other sources for questions that can have serious consequences:
With your doctor for health issues
With your own government, or another, for travel advisories that may help you avoid dangerous areas
With the government of the destination country for visas and travel restrictions
With a lawyer for other legal issues
Nothing on this site should be taken as medical or legal advice.

The tourist office has a website, as does the city council and mayor.
Also see our article on Saint-Étienne. AlasdairW (talk) 20:24, 10 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Shops around the royal national park[edit]
Where are some good places to shop around the Royal National Park?

It depends where you are in the park, but Westfield Miranda is nearby (it's a 12-minute train ride from Sutherland via the T4 Cronulla branch line or a 9-minute drive via President Ave). Although Helensburgh and Stanwell Park are nearby, they lack good places to shop. Hope that helps, --SHB2000 (talk | contribs | meta) 01:21, 24 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
