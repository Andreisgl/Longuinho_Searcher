Materials and Methods: We collected dental metric and nonmetric trait data for 481 human skeletons from six archaeological sites along the Gulf of Taranto, dating to pre-colonial (900-700 BC) and post-colonial periods (700-200 BC). We are evaluating scenarios through an individual-level biodistance analysis using a three-pronged approach: (a) by analyzing levels of mobility in pre-and post-colonial periods under a model of isolation-by-distance; (b) by quantifying differences in group means and variances in pre-and post-colonial periods utilizing permutational multivariate analysis of variance and Betadisper analyses; and (c) by identifying ancestries of post-colonial individuals using naïve Bayes classification. Results: Southern Italy during pre-colonial times was characterized by low levels of mobility and marked differences in group means and variances. During post-colonial times, mobility increased and there were no differences in group means and variances. About 18% of the people in post-colonial times were of Greek ancestry and lived equally distributed across Greek colonies and indigenous villages. Nevertheless, the overall biological composition and variability of southern Italy remained relatively unchanged across pre-and post-colonial periods. Discussion: Our results support a scenario in which only few Greek colonists migrated to southern Italy and lived in smaller numbers alongside indigenous people in Greek colonies as well as in indigenous villages. Our results contradict a scenario in which large numbers of Greek invaders founded biologically isolated and substantially homogeneous colonial enclaves within conquered territories.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hannes Rathmann and +1Giulia Saltini Semerari•  6  Bioarchaeology, Archaeology of Southern Italy, Greek Colonisation, Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily)Review of Irad Malkin, A Small Greek World.

Além de mostrar o potencial de estudo histórico e arqueológico da região croata acerca da Grécia antiga e do Mediterrâneo antigo, nossa intenção é apresentar um panorama geral sobre a dinâmica da fundação de assentamentos gregos (apoi-kias e/ou empória) e do contato cultural entre gregos de diversas origens e entre gregos e as populações locais não-gregas nessa área entre o Ocidente e o Ori-ente do Mar Mediterrâneo. Palavras-chave: Colonização grega; Mar Adriático; Dalmácia Central; Arque-ologia na Croácia. Abstract: This article provides a brief introduction to the history and archaeology of Greek colonization in the Adriatic Sea area from the Archaic era, highlighting the area of Central Dalmatia, Croatia's coastal region. In addition to showing the potential for historical and archaeological study of the Croatian region about ancient Greece and the ancient Mediterranean, our intention is to provide an overview of the dynamics of the foundation of Greek settlements (apoikiai and/or emporia) and of cultural contact between Greeks from diverse origins in the Greek world and between Greeks and local populations in this area between the West and the East of the Mediterranean Sea.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lilian de Angelo Laky•  4  Greek Colonisation, Dalmatian history, Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily), Dalmatian hinterlandPreparazione e consumo degli alimenti in età arcaica.

Tale trasformazione agraria ha prodotto di conseguenza una serie di mutamenti strutturali dal punto di vista economico, ma anche paesaggistico e culturale. Tali modificazioni territoriali hanno comportato degli effetti positivi e negativi che hanno coinvolto un ampio spettro delle attività antropiche, tra gli altri basti pensare alla perdita di biodiversità, alle modificazioni radicali del paesaggio, alla concorrenza tra i vari usi del suolo legata alla rendita fondiaria, alla coesistenza con gli ambienti dunali, come anche l’annosa questione del mercato del lavoro, con le possibili ricadute dal punto di vista della polarizzazione delle comunità di migranti e le problematiche consequenziali. L’autore intende formalizzare e individuare, tramite appositi strumenti cartografici, l’evoluzione e l’ampiezza attuale della fascia trasformata, intendendo così mettere in evidenza le possibili sovrapposizioni e competizione con altre colture tradizionali, o in pieno campo, o ancora di qualità (DOP e IGP).Save to LibraryDownloadby Gianni Petino•  5  Geography, Economic Geography, Agriculture, GreenhousesArpi.

Early Rome: Myth and Society steps in to provide much-needed modern and accessible translations and commentaries on Italian legends.This work examines the tales of Roman pre- and legendary history, discusses relevant cultural and contextual information, and presents author biographies. This book offers updated translations of key texts, including authors who are often absent from classical mythology textbooks, such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Servius. Jaclyn Neel debunks the idea that Romans were unimaginative copyists by spotlighting the vitality and flexibility of Italian myth — particularly those parts that are less closely connected to Greek tales, such as the story of Caeculus of Praeneste. Finally, by calling attention to the Italian rather than Roman nature of the collection, this book suggests that Roman culture was broader than the city itself. This important work offers:    * Up-to-date and accessible translations of Roman and Italic legends from authors throughout antiquity    * Examination of compelling tales that involve the Roman equivalent of Greek “heroes”    * Unique view of the strength and plasticity of Roman and Italic myth, particularly the parts less closely connected to familiar Greek tales    * Intelligent discussion of relevant cultural and contextual information    * Argument that Roman culture reached far beyond the city of RomeFresh and readable, Early Rome: Myth and Society offers essential reading for students of ancient Rome as well as those interested in Roman and Greek mythology.http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119083796.htmlhttp://earlyrome.omeka.net/Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaclyn Neel•  11  Mythology, Roman History, Roman Republic, Early RomeUnpublished Notes on Plato's LifeThis reconstruction of Plato’s biography was researched and written when I was at the London School of Economics Department of Government in 2004-05.

Anthropophagy is the consumption of human flesh and the most extreme form of destruction of the human body, a physical violence which is the quintessential taboo of the self-described “civilized” societies. It provokes disgust, surprise and sometimes fascination, creating a deep connection between the text and the reader, and between the message and the audience. With regard to Sicily, anthropophagy is a cultural theme useful to discern between the account of real events and their representation. The construction of the image of Sicily, and even more of its inhabitants, the Sicilians, is based on an accumulation of clichés, often of ancient origins, transmitted and interpreted over the ages. One of them is surely the “bestiality” of its first inhabitants, intended as the ancient Cyclops or the Giants sons of Saturn, both of them “tyrants” described as man-eaters. During the Early Middle Ages the idea that the Sicilians eat human flesh was transferred to the new conquerors of the island: the Muslims, an infidel enemy to be fighted and considered beyond the boundaries of humanity and nature, meant as a divine law and therefore “civilization”. In both cases the accusations came from the outside, i.e. from groups as the ancient Greeks or the Christians (both Byzantine and Latin-Norman) who had an interest in representing the old and modern inhabitants of the island as anthropophagists to be feared, conquered, subjugated and converted to religion and/or civilization.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giuseppe Mandalà•  66  Intellectual History, Cultural History, Anthropology, Historical AnthropologyArcheologia degli Iblei (ASS 2015)Archeologia degli Iblei.

The silicon carbide (SiC) as one of the reinforcement used with 3%weight fraction and Alumina (Al2O3) as the major reinforcement in 3%,6%,9% &12% weight fraction. Al-7075 has been considered as the matrix material .The low cost stir casting process has been used for thedevelopment of the composite system. The matrix material was melted in electric furnace and the heattreated reinforcement in the desired weight fraction have been added followed by constant stirring the melt.The temperature of the melt held at 750°C. The pouring temperature was recorded which has relation toquality of the casting. The cast specimens have been obtained in the form of cylindrical rod of 20mmdiameter and 200mm length for carrying out tribological tests. Microstructure analysis reveals the uniformdistribution of reinforcements in the aluminum matrix. The density of the composite increases with theincrease in weight fraction. The composite density found to lie in between the density range of matrix andthe reinforcement. The pin on disc wear test has been carried on all the samples at various speeds of300,600,900 and 1200 rpm, varying load of 1kg, 2kg, 3kg & 4kg and varying sliding distances of 1km, 2km,3km & 4km. These test reveals that the wear resistance increases with the increase in the reinforcementweight fraction. The increase in the speed reduces the wear rate and wear rate increases in with increasein sliding distance. The wear rate and coefficient of the composite reduces for higher volume fraction. Theaddition of SiC apart from improving the wear rate reduces the noise and vibration at higher speed andload condition. The overall tribological property increases due to addition of the two reinforcement.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Recent Advances in Mechanical Engineering (IJMECH)•  5  Wearable Computing, Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily), Hybrid Composites, Al2O3Duane W.

The coin's obverse shows parallel line segments projecting from an approximately rectangular solid shape. Several different obverse orientations are considered. The reverse appears to show a stick figure facing frontally, standing on a ground line or low platform, and holding a staff upright at the left side. Likely prototypes are sought by considering coins of relevant metal, fabric, diameter, shape, weight, and thickness, and with an emphasis on their designs. These factors combined with overall frequencies of occurrence seem to point primarily to Eastern coins as likely prototypes. However, indirect consideration of provenance based on source and context information alters the result. A Western prototype of the area from Sicily to North Africa, more specifically a so-called Lopadusan coin type, is deemed more likely though still uncertain.Save to LibraryDownloadby Robert M Cutler•  67  Numismatics, Ancient numismatics (Archaeology), Sicily (History), Carthage (Archaeology)Historia de Europa (ss.

Yet, there is a severe lack of scholarship on the subject. In the absence of multidisciplinary studies, some scholars deny that ergotism even existed historically in these regions. The scarcity of original sources and the abundance of indirect evidence and clues call for an abductive, multidisciplinary method of investigation. This book is divided into three sections. The first part provides a medical-pharmacological explanation of the causes and effects of the disease; the second analyzes the agriculture and diet in southern Italy, highlighting the extremely favourable conditions for the pathology as well as describing local traditions. The second part analyzes the cultural implications of ergotism in Prehistory and in Magna Graecia. During the ancient Greek colonization, ergotism played a central role in the spread of Dionysian rites first, and subsequently, of the Eleusinian Mysteries. In Magna Graecia, ergotism epidemics can be linked to class struggles between landowners and shipowners-traders. The last section explores the magical-religious implications of the cult of Saint Anthony Abbot, thaumaturge of plants, animals, and men, divinity par excellence of ergotism, whose votive offerings outnumbered those of all other saints in southern Italy for centuries.With the demise of the Order of Saint Anthony, other autochthonous saints began fulfilling the same functions, demonstrating that ergotism continued to be a seriousproblem into the eighteenth century.This study is the first analysis of the cultural implications of ergotism in Southern Italy. The author uses the historical method updated on the last researches about what ergotism is. He claims the relevance of this illness in Magna Graecia, and from medieval times to the 19th century.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alessandro Tarsia•  18  Folklore, History of Medicine, Magna Graecia, Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily)Astronomy, topography and landscape at Akragas' Valley of the TemplesThe issue of the orientation of Greek Temples has been the subject of much debate since the end of the 19th century.

In fact, although a general tendency to orientation within the arc of the rising sun is undeniable, specific patterns and the true meaning remain obscure. With the aim of shedding light on this problem we present here a new, complete, high-precision survey of the temples of Akragas, the so-called Valley of the Temples UNESCO site. Our results include all temples – one of which was essentially still unpublished – and show that very different reasons influenced the choices of orientation – some symbolic, but others much more practical – beyond the general rule of orienting 'to the rising sun'. In particular, the temples of the central terrace – including the world famous temple of Jupiter – were oriented in accordance with the town's grid, while a rigorous orientation to the cardinal points is evidenced for the Aesculapius sanctuary. Finally, for two temples having 'anomalous' orientations, a stellar and a lunar proposal respectively are made.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrea Orlando•  8  Archaeoastronomy, Greek Archaeology, Cultural Astronomy, Greek SicilyField Survey in Southern Italy: Metaponto and CrotoneSummary of field research performed in the territories of Metaponto (MT) and Crotone (KR) in 2005.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alberto Prieto•  12  Classical Archaeology, Archaeological field survey, Metapontum, MetapontionEssay on Greeks and their expansion in our regionThe Ionian culture - the undisputed pinnacle of Ancient Greek civilization as a whole2, is nothing less than the sum of the range of all those elements that determine the (inter)intellect and everyday living of the people of our region... moreThe Ionian culture - the undisputed pinnacle ofAncient Greek civilization as a whole2, isnothing less than the sum of the range of allthose elements that determine the (inter)intellectand everyday living of the people of our region(and of at that time known world), through theGreek way of thinking as it has been identifiedand developed at its time.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christos Moissidis•  11  Greek Colonisation, Freemasonry, Ancient Greek History, Greek PotteryL'Architecture grecque à Poseidonia-PaestumLa cité grecque de Poseidonia, comme d’autres cités coloniales grecques, constitue un lieu extraordinaire pour étudier les formes de l’architecture grecque de l’époque archaïque jusqu’à la conquête romaine.Save to LibraryDownloadby Airton Pollini•  8  Greek colonies in Magna Graecia, Greek Colonisation, Greek Archaeology, Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily)Recenti scavi ad Akrai (Palazzolo Acreide, Sr)Chowaniec R., Fitula M., Recenti scavi ad Akrai (Palazzolo Acreide, Sr), ARCHAEOLOGIAE Research by Foreign Missions in Italy XIII.1-2, 2015 (2017), p. 47-68Save to LibraryDownloadby Roksana Chowaniec and +1Marta Fitula•  20  Archaeology, Classical Archaeology, Roman History, Landscape ArchaeologyInvitation as Visiting Professor, École normale supérieure - Paris, Sponsor Prof. Dr. Stéphane Verger and Dr. Thierry Lejars (2016-2017)Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrea Babbi•  28  Near Eastern Archaeology, Cypriot Archaeology, Mediterranean Studies, Funerary ArchaeologyLes Tombes peintes de PaestumLes tombes peintes de Poseidonia-Paestum constituent des signes éloquents de l’imaginaire de l’élite de la cité.

Archaeological finds from San Sosti were known only from the Casalini area, where a famous bronze axe with a Greek Archaic inscription (currently displayed in the British Museum) was discovered in the 19th century. In general, archaeological research at San Sosti and its surroundings was initiated in 2004 by the means of excavations carried out by the Soprintendenza Archeologica della Calabria in the Chiesa del Carmine and in the so-called Castello della Rocca. Research at the Chiesa del Carmine, located in the centre of the modern village, proves a continuous occupation from the Bronze Age onwards, while the rocky spur of the Castello della Rocca has been settled in Protohistoric, Greek and Medieval periods. This contribution aims at presenting the new excavation data concerning Protohistoric and Greek contexts found at the two archaeological sites. On the basis of the observations made by analysing the recently systematically collected data, finds from unsystematic investigations will further be discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Domenico A M Marino and +1Carmelo  Colelli•  11  Greek Archaeology, Magna Graecia, Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily), CalabriaLAKY, L.A.

Our intention is to provide an account of the importance of the sanctuary of Olympia played in the origin and diffusion of the Zeus Olympios’ cult, as well as the characterassumed by this cult in other parts of the Greek world. In particular, we intend to deepen the comprehension of the connections of the political power established with this cult during the Archaic and Classical epochs, especially regarding its political manipulation. In order to reach a sharper appraisal of the cult and meet the other purposes set forth herewith, the research will develop a detailed survey of those cities with temples consecrated to this divinity and, associating textual sources with contextualized archaeological data, suggest some themes to discussion as: 1. The use of both the epithet Olympios and the name Olympieion; 2. The spatial configuration of the Zeus Olympios’ sanctuaries and the relationship between society and the sacred place; 3.

Posto in aerea extra moenia a ridosso del circuito murario della città antica, questo santuario è contrassegnato da un’architettura molto semplice, il cui nucleo principale nel corso dei secoli rimase grosso modo immutato pur essendo stato interessato da diversi rifacimenti e restauri.Tra i numerosi ex voto rinvenuti all’interno dell’edificio sacro spiccano per importanza diverse centinaia di manufatti in ferro deposti nella nuda terra o in appositi contenitori. Gran parte di questi oggetti metallici è costituito da strumenti utilizzati per l’imprigionamento di schiavi. Le offerte di catene e ceppi lasciano credere che a Vigna Nuova si compissero anche riti in qualche modo legati alla manumissione sotto l’egida tutelare di Hera - la dea più importante del pantheon krotoniate - significativamente conosciuta presso il vicino Lacinio con l’appellativo di “Liberatrice”. Tanto i resti murari del santuario, quanto buona parte dei reperti metallici recuperati nel corso degli scavi richiedono urgenti interventi conservativi.Save to LibraryDownloadby Salvatore Medaglia•  14  Archaeology, Cultural Heritage Conservation, Heritage Conservation, Ancient Greek ReligionVelia-Studien II (2003) Save to LibraryDownloadby Verena Gassner•  3  Greek Colonization (Magna Graecia and Sicily), Elea - Velia, Archeologia della Magna GreciaThe Locrian Pinakes: Revealing Secrets of Cult Practice?In: Revealing and Concealing in Antiquity: Textual and Archaeological Approaches to Secrecy, edited by E.

In ancient sources the city is spelt in various ways, including Tios, Tieion, Teion and Tion. In the second half of the seventh century BC the city was founded as a Milesian colony by the priest named Tios. It was dependent to various kingdoms throughout the Hellenistic period and the city fell under Roman control in AD 70. In the Roman Imperial period, it is understood from inscriptions and coins that Roman emperors and proconsuls encouraged the development of the city. In the Byzantine period the city was a bishopric and we find the names of bishops of Tios on lead seals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bülent  Öztürk•  56  History, Archaeology, Historical Archaeology, Black Sea regionM.
