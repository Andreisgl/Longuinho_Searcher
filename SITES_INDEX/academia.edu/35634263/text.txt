Cloots wrote at several occasions about his education there, notably naming Sulzer as a philosophical influence ten years later. Examining the pupils’ life at the Académie, Sulzer’s teaching, and the detailed study schedule, this paper wonders what elements may have influenced Cloots. It is likely that Sulzer taught the philosophy of Wolff, but it is difficult to ascertain his influence on Cloots. There are similarities between Wolff’s civitas maxima and Cloots’s ‘universal republic’ that justify further studies.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Borderlands StudiesBorderland Lives in Northern South Asia: Non-State Perspectives2016 • Debidatta Aurobinda MahapatraDownload Free PDFView PDFProduction Planning & ControlWith a little help from my fans: The transformative role of the consumer in music co-production2018 • Jordan R GambleThis paper examines how the transformative role of the consumer in co-production is affecting key stakeholders within the music industry. The study explores the changing consumer role in co-production, how it is affecting content quality, the implications for music artists and record labels, and how they are approaching (and should approach) co-production. The research methodology consists of a three-stage interview design of 52 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior members of music organisations (including artist managers and major labels). An inductive, data-driven four-phase constant comparison analysis technique is used to analyse the data. The findings contribute to the co-production research domain by offering new insights from a music industry context and presenting new theoretical models for how co-production is affecting industry stakeholders. Implications for industry, policy and future research are also provided.Download Free PDFView PDFAphasiologyLaPointe, L. L. (2012).

Quality Function Deployment (QFD) represents one of the most powerful design methods to achieve such a goal. This study investigates the QFD-based methods proposed in the last two decades, whose use in different ambits of Design for X (DfX) is reported to be effective. We selected most common QFD-based methods, analyzing how designers can implement and coordinate them in design activities effectively throughout their application to an identical case study.Download Free PDFView PDFComputer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical EngineeringDesign of an implant for first metatarsophalangeal hemi-arthroplasty2013 • Atul  KumarDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
