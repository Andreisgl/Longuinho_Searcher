European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
About the Charter
Languages covered
What languages does the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages apply to?
 
The Charter applies to regional and minority languages, non-territorial languages and less widely used official languages. Within its scope are only the languages traditionally used within a state’s territory, not those connected with recent migratory movements or dialects of the official language.
“Regional or minority languages”, as defined by the Charter, are languages traditionally used within a given territory of a state by nationals of that state who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the state’s population; they are different from the official language(s) of that state, and they include neither dialects of the official language(s) of the state nor the languages of migrants.
The expression “non-territorial languages” means languages used by nationals of the state which differ from the language(s) used by the rest of the state’s population but which, although traditionally used within the state’s territory, cannot be identified with a particular area thereof.
