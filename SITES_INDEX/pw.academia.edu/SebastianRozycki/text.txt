English archeologists from the Staffordshire University have noted significant achievements. They conducted a research between 2007 and 2015 in the area of the Labor Camp Treblinka I and in the Extermination Camp Treblinka II. The research was conducted within a bigger project that also included camps on the Alderney Island and on the territories of the former Yugoslavia. However there is still lack of the comprehensive scientific research on the camps&#39; topography that would also include the nearest surroundings and would consider the fullest possible analysis of both testimonies and the spatial data (current and historical). It&#39;s been 70 years since the camps were liberated.

Housing 20,000 prisoners, Treblinka I was established in 1941 as a part of a network of objects such as forced labour camps, resettlement camps and prison camps that were established in the territory of occupied Poland from September 1939. This paper describes archaeological research conducted in particular on the execution site and burial site—the area where the “death pits” have been found—in the so-called Las Maliszewski (Maliszewa Forest). In this area (poorly documented) exhumation work was conducted only until 1947, so the location of these graves is only approximately known.

An example is the GS Soil project initiated by the Ministry of Environment of Lower Saxony in which 34 institutions participated, from different European countries, including Warsaw University of Technology. Within the framework of this project, spatial data on soils was described and catalogued in most European countries (also in Poland). Within separate tasks, the scope and standards for information technology concerning metadata of soils were defined. The paper presents overall characteristics of the tasks within the project GS Soil, including the resulting Geoportal GS Soil, emphasizing in particular the subject of metadata, but also issues relating to the organization and harmonization of data, as well as technical and semantic interoperability.

The leading aim of this article is to describe the comprehensive research strategy, with a particular stress on non-invasive geophysical surveys. The integrated archaeological research presented in this paper includes an analysis of archive materials (aerial photos, witness accounts, maps, plans, and sketches), contemporary data resources (orthophotomaps, airborne laser scanning-ALS data), field work (verification of potential objects, ground penetrating radar-GPR surveys, excavations), and the integration, analysis and interpretation of all these datasets using a GIS platform. The results of the presented study included the identification of the burial zone within the Maliszewa Forest area, including six previously unknown graves, creation of a new database, and expansion of the Historical-GIS-Treblinka. Obtained results indicate that the integration and analyses within the GIS environment of various types of remote-sensing data and geophysical measurements significantly contribute to archaeological research and increase the chances to discover previously unknown "graves" from the time when the labour camp Treblinka I functioned.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The use of non-invasive techniques in locating graves of Holocaust victims: the Rejowiec case studyTELEDETEKCJA ŚRODOWISKA dawniej FOTOINTERPRETACJA W GEOGRAFII,  2016The Holocaust – the almost total extermination of European Jews by the Germans during World War I... more The Holocaust – the almost total extermination of European Jews by the Germans during World War II (1939-45) is primarily associated with such German extermination camps as Auschwitz, Bełżec, Majdanek, Sobibór or Treblinka. In addition to these places, Central and Eastern Europe, including territory, within the present Polish borders, is literally dotted with forgotten individual and mass Jewish war graves. These are the graves of Jews who were not sent to the German death camps during the liquidation of the ghettos during Reinhardt’s operation (March 1942 - November 1943), but were murdered during and after the mass extermination. These Jews were buried in nameless graves located in forests, roadside ditches, arable fields, etc. In most cases, their number and exact location are unknown, both for scientists and descendants of victims, although they often exist in the memories of the last living witnesses of the Holocaust and local communities . One of the statutory tasks of the Rabbinical Commission for Jewish cemeteries in Poland is to search for the forgotten graves of Holocaust victims and restore the identity of the murderers who were taken away from them. The Commission, as a religious entity, headed by the Chief Rabbi of Poland, operates in support of the Jewish law - Halacha, whose regulations define the method and methodology of research. Halacha prohibits opening graves and moving the remains of the dead. All investigations specifying the location and size of the graves they must be carried out in a non-invasive manner, without interfering withthe soil structure.In this study, the authors present the first results of work on the location of places of execution and mass graves of Jews from World War II, which were carried out using methods respecting the provisions of Jewish law. To locate these places, the following methods are used: the Holocaust witness account, documents from the Institute of National Remembrance, data from laser scanning, GPR measurements, historical and current aerial photographs. The authors will present the methods of their work and the problems they faced during the research.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Topografia zbrodni.The following monograph was prepared in the course of a research process by the Faculty of Geodes... more The following monograph was prepared in the course of a research process by the Faculty of Geodesy and Cartography of the Warsaw University of Technology and is part of a project entitled 'Seeing what has been forgotten – a multidisciplinary exploratory study of areas to memorialise in the Treblinka camps area' financed by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. Since 2016, a team from the Geodesy and Cartography Department has continually conducted research activities in the area of the former camps. Our monograph entitled 'Treblinka II Extermination Camp – topography of the extermination' focused on certain aspects of recreating both the camp facilities and the train station, as the latter was a key element of the 'factory of death'. Most of the existing pieces of subject literature aim to describe the extermination processes of the Jewish people that took place in the camp. This monograph strives to explain the functioning of certain elements of the camp itself. One could see the Treblinka railway station, the siding, and the camp itself as a system of inter-connected topographic objects. Any and all problems with one of the aforementioned elements influenced the functioning of the entire system. Based on currently known and complete source data and taking into consideration the scope and topic of the work, the authors tried to describe all the topography elements that accompanied the genocide of the Jewish people in the Treblinka II Extermination Camp.The first step was the analysis of the train station itself as it was vital for the camp’s proper functioning. The cattle cars were rolled into the Camp from that train station. The analysis of the camp fence was the second research task. To that end, the authors used data found in historical archives that, so far, has not yet been used in other scientific work. This stage ended with the delineation of the internal and external borders of the camp. Having knowledge of the exact placement of the camp’s borders, the authors were able to calculate the external (15.85 hectares) and internal (11.77 hectares) areas of the camp. Analysis of the terrain within the already established borders of the camp was the last task. Upon initiation of the work the authors were aware of the fact that it would be impossible to estimate the exact location of each and every camp facility and that creating a map of the camp itself would be challenging.However, the authors were able to identify the main camp roads that could have divided it into the upper and lower parts. Additionally, the study uncovered the exact location of the rail siding and calculated its length. It confirmed that the recreated siding was not visible from the side of the road because it was obscured by an earth embankment and that it had a capacity of 20 cars. Additionally, the identification of the, so-called, reception area was a very important outcome of the work. Due to it being now known, any future research will have to analyse a much smaller area when looking for the undressing rooms that were the first step on the 'road' leading the victims to the gas chambers. Locating and identifying camp roads and possible locations of particular camp buildings, including the Lazaret – the fake infirmary – was a yet another result of interpretation of archival aerial photography and its confrontation with the camp’s plans. The created map of the Treblinka II Extermination Camp allowed for a delineation of the hypothetical route to the gas chambers, called 'der Schlauch' by the Germans and either 'Himmelfahrtstraße' (road to ascension) or 'Himmelweg' (road to heaven) by the inmates. Carrying out of experiments using a plethora of employed research methods is essential to conduct of new objectives of the museum called 'Treblinka Museum – a German Nazi Extermination and Labour Camp (1941-1944)' that was established in 2018. Additionally, it has to be noted that scholars from two different faculties began analysis of the camp’s his¬tory only from 2012. At the moment there are two academic units conducting work on-site – the Staffordshire University from Great Britain and the Warsaw University of Technology. In order to intensify activities of remembrance of Polish national heritage and to broaden the scope of the museal exhibition, as well as to initiate new promotional campaigns, it seems necessary not only to continue, but to expand upon the research work already conducted in the area supervised by the Museum. In the years to come it will be crucial to employ the newest research techniques and establish broad multidisciplinary research teams in order to provide a possibility of further execution of the facility’s goals. Moreover, opening up of new approaches of research in the Treblinka camps area will allow employees of the Museum and the Warsaw Technical University to gather work experience. The authors would like to thank the Professor Stanisław Białousz for their valuable comments and suggestions during the preparation of this monograph.The monograph’s authors would like to thank prosecutor Krzysztof Bukowski for allowing access to case documents of the Koszalin Delegation, Szczecin Branch of the Commission of investigation of crimes against the Polish Nation. Niniejsza monografia powstała w celu zaprezentowania wyników badań naukowych realizowanych w 2018 roku przez Wydział Geodezji i Kartografii Politechniki Warszawskiej w ramach projektu „Zobaczyć zapomniane – multidyscyplinarne badania poszukiwawcze miejsc do upamiętnienia na obszarze Obozów w Treblince”, finansowanego przez Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego. Prace badawcze na terenie obozów w Treblince prowadzone są w sposób ciągły od 2016 roku przez zespół badawczy stworzony przy Wydziale Geodezji i Kartografii. Monografia pt. „Obóz Zagłady Treblinka II. Topografia zbrodni” skupiła się na odtworzeniu obiektów obozowych jak i stacji kolejowej, która była ważnym elementem „fabryki śmierci”. Znane w literaturze przedmiotu opracowania w większości przypadków opisują proces uśmiercania ludności żydowskiej w Obozie Zagłady. Celem niniejszej rozprawy jest próba wyjaśnienia funkcjonowania niektórych składowych obozu. Można sobie wyobrazić, że stacja kolejowa Treblinka, bocznica oraz sam obóz to system powiązanych ze sobą obiektów topografii. Jakiekolwiek problemy z jednym z nich wpływały na funkcjonowanie całego systemu. W ramach przyjętego tematu pracy, na podstawie aktualnie znanych i najpełniejszych danych źródłowych, opisano możliwie wszystkie elementy topografii towarzyszące uśmiercaniu ludności żydowskiej w Obozie Zagłady Treblinka II. Prace rozpoczęto od analizy stacji kolejowej Treblinka, która była bardzo ważnym miejscem dla funkcjonowania obozu. To właśnie ze stacji wtaczane były wagony do Obozu Zagłady. Drugim zadaniem badawczym była analiza ogrodzenia obozowego. W tym celu wykorzystano materiały archiwalne, które nie zostały do tej pory uwzględnione w innych opracowaniach naukowych. Etap ten zakończył się wyznaczeniem granic wewnętrznych i zewnętrznych. Znajomość ich przebiegu pozwolił na obliczenie powierzchni Obozu Zagłady Treblinka II wytyczonej przez granicę zewnętrzną (15,85 ha) i wewnętrzną (11,77 ha).Ostatnim zadaniem była analiza terenu wewnątrz wyznaczonych gra¬nic obozowych. Przystępując do eksperymentów, autorzy zdawali sobie sprawę, że nie uda się wyznaczyć wszystkich obiektów i sporządzić pełnego planu obozu.Udało się wyznaczyć główne drogi obozowe, które mogły dzielić obóz na górny i dolny. Ustalono przebieg bocznicy kolejowej i obliczono jej długość, która wyniosła 220 m. Analiza potwierdziła, że odtworzona bocznica była zasłonięta wałem od strony drogi i pozwalała pomieścić 20 wagonów towarowych. Ważnym wynikiem analiz było określenie tzw. strefy przyjęć. Wyznaczony obszar pozwoli w przyszłych badaniach zawęzić teren, gdzie poszukiwane będą rozbieralnie, z których ofiary prowadzone były drogą do komór gazowych. Kolejnym rezultatem interpretacji zdjęć lotniczych i ich porównania z planami było wyznaczenie dróg obozowych i obszarów, gdzie zachodzi podejrzenie występowania budynków obozowych i lazaretu. Opracowana mapa Obozu Zagłady Treblinka II pozwoliła na usta¬lenie prawdopodobnego przebiegu drogi do komór gazowych, określanej przez Niemców „der Schlauch”, a przez więźniów „Himmelfahrtsstraße” (droga wniebowstąpienia) lub „Himmelweg” (droga do nieba). Autorzy niniejszej monografii składają szczególne podziękowania profesorowi Stanisławowi Białouszowi, który od kilku lat służy im swoją wiedzą i pomocą. Wyrażają też wdzięczność prokuratorowi Krzysztofowi Bukowskiemu za udostępnienie dokumentów śledztwa prowadzonego przez Komisję Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu, Oddział w Szczecinie, Dlegatura w Koszalinie.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Obóz pracy Treblinka I.

English archeologists from the Staffordshire University have noted significant achievements. They conducted a research between 2007 and 2015 in the area of the Labor Camp Treblinka I and in the Extermination Camp Treblinka II. The research was conducted within a bigger project that also included camps on the Alderney Island and on the territories of the former Yugoslavia. However there is still lack of the comprehensive scientific research on the camps’ topography that would also include the nearest surroundings and would consider the fullest possible analysis of both testimonies and the spatial data (current and historical). It’s been 70 years since the camps were liberated. New measuring techniques and a wider access to the archival data opened a new chapter in the research on the history of Treblinka camps. The Uprising in Extermination Camp Treblinka II that began on August 2, 1943 only partially influenced its liquidation. The Camp’s liquidation stared at the end of August, and demolition works lasted till November. Germans were very meticulous in removing all the traces of the perfectly operating “death machine”. Buildings and gas chambers were demolished and a farm was established at the former camp area. The Labour Camp operated till July 23, 1944 and was also later demolished. Its liquidation did not go according to the same scenario as in the case of a Extermination Camp. Till this day some buildings’ foundations remain. However, there are no plans for both camps and we can learn how they operated only from the testimonies. Within the project: “Methodology for integrating and harmonizing multi-source data for the research on functioning of the Treblinka I Labour Camp and Treblinka II Extermination Camp”, the authors of this monograph made first attempts to fully review available data and information on Treblinka camps. The research was conducted with an innovative method using the technology of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that allows the connection of the witnesses’ testimonies with the available and newly obtained geographic data. This method resulted in additional information that deepened the knowledge about the events that took place around Treblinka, not only during the period when the camps operated. The research continued in 2017 due to the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage funds available within the project “Supporting the Care Over Places of Remembrance and Permanent Commemoration in the Country”. This study includes research that has not been published yet and that was conducted between 2015 and 2017 at the area of the Labor Camp Treblinka and its surroundings. Solutions suggested in this study may become guidelines for conducting similar studies at the areas of other labour, transit, POW and concentration camps. One of the goals of the research was to systematize and describe the source materials and documentation describing the examined objects from the point of view of the camps’ topography and which are available in the archives and museums. Documents available in the Archives of the New Files (unknown financial documents regarding Labour Camp were discovered) and The Institute of National Remembers were analyzed. The second goal of the research was to prepare complete archival queries of aerial photographs, cartographic materials and text documents that are not yet known to the subject literature. Within this research, an access to the aerial photographs from the period 1940-1958 and topographical maps was obtained. The aerial photographs and maps that were discovered were not, to the full extent, known and used in the research on Treblinka camps neither in publications. An innovative solution was the development of a descriptive data linking methodology (from the testimonies) with spatial data in the aspect of historical research. The method and use of IT tools in the Geographic Information Systems allowed establishing next stages of the field research. Not only archival data (such as aerial maps or topographical maps) were used in the research. In order to conduct the research and generate derivative products (eg. shaded maps) a data from the laser scanning were used at every stage of the research. For the first time a satellite picture from the WorldView2 System was used for the research on Labour and Extermination Camps in Treblinka. The picture was used to interpret and visualize data. Current and archival data and witnesses’ testimonies were given a spatial dimension; results of the spatial analysis were used to select 8 research areas. Selected areas were subject to the on-site, detailed inspection. Archeological research was performed at the selected areas with potential mass graves. Those places were selected on the basis of the spatial analysis of the data gathered in the Spatial Database System for Treblinka camps. Three execution holes were localized during invasive research. The discovered graves were marked with crosses. The internal road and garbage dump localized at the area of the former Labour Camp were also researched using invasive methods. In case of the road it was expected for the human remains from the pyres of the Extermination Camp to be found. The excavation yielded negative results. Few metal artifacts were discovered at the garbage dump area, such as metal fragments of shoes and clothing, buttons, buckles, shell casings, coins, and glass containers, as well as unidentified metal objects. Those artifacts will add to the collection of the Museum of Struggle and Martyrdom in Treblinka. Human bones were also found at the described area. The last significant achievement of the research was a discovery of a railroad track fragment from the siding located at the gravel plant. This discovery was possible due to the composition of the results of analysis of archival aerial photographs and satellite photographs from the WorldView2 System. The railroad track is over 7 meters long and will be displayed in the viewpoint on a gravel plant. The research added to the knowledge of the history of both camps and indicated new research paths aiming to clarify the issues, which have not yet been addressed. Gaining access to digital archives and technically advanced “products” obtained on the basis of the engeenerial data analysis gives reason to assume that new technology will help deepen the historical knowledge not only related to Treblinka.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The interpretative potential of the Pléiades satellite imagery for Cultural Heritage resources studies on the example of Bobolice test siteby Katarzyna Osińska-Skotak and Sebastian RozyckiThe aim of the paper is to analyse the scope of digital image processing applied to images from t... more The aim of the paper is to analyse the scope of digital image processing applied to images from the Pléiades satellite in order to highlight their information potential from the perspective of research into cultural heritage resources. The Pléiades satellite system is the first European very high resolution optical imaging system and images from it have been accessible since 2012. Due to the high resolution and operability of the system it is an interesting source of information for the study of archaeological heritage remains. A number of digital processes such as contrast enhancement, creation of colour composites, principal components analysis, image decorrelation, vegetation and soil indices used to highlight selected features – resulting from the residue of archaeological heritage remains – in an image, were analysed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
