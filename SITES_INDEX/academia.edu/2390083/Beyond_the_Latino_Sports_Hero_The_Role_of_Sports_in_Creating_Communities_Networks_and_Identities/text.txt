Dubois These words, written in 1900 as Dubois prepared for the first Pan African Congress in London, predated a similarly prophetic statement in the forward of his classic book, The Souls of Black Folk (1903). For six decades Dubois used sociological theory and methods to study race and racial relations in the United States, producing numerous books and hundreds of insightful essays. However, it wasn&#39;t until 1944 when Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal wrote An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy that the topic of race attracted concerted attention from sociologists and other scholars in the United States. When the sociology of sport emerged as a sub-discipline in the fields of sociology...Download Free PDFView PDFNew World Colors: Ethnicity, Belonging, and Difference in the AmericasUnited on the Playing Field? Ethnic and Race Relations in U.S. American Youth Team Sports Films2014 • Astrid HaasDrawing upon the importance of sports in U.S. American culture, films about youth sports crucially inform the public understanding of sports in its relation to society in the United States. This essay analyzes three U.S. American films about college, school, and youth club sports as exemplars of this genre and its narrative and thematic approaches to the issues of interethnic/-racial conflicts and solidarity from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s: the children’s soccer comedy The Big Green (1995), the historical high-school football drama Remember the Titans (2000), and the docudrama about a turning point in the history of college basketball, Glory Road (2006). All three films were made by Walt Disney Pictures and are geared toward young and family audiences. | Due to copyright laws, I cannot make a public copy available here or link to a repository holding my article.

The essay analyzes the ways in which the current tendency of fusing forms and/or contents of these three types of cultural practice provides possibilities for new, Latina/o-empowering representations of latinidad in Mainstream U.S. culture, examining the case study of the MTV-produced TV movie All You’ve Got (2006) and its mingling of rap music and teenage sports drama. | Due to copyright laws, I cannot make a public copy available here or link to a repository holding my article.

The 1950s was a pivotal decade in Puerto Rican history due to the creation of the Commonwealth in 1952 and the innovative economic project known as Operation Bootstrap. The term "Operation Sport" portrays the development of sport and recreation in this decade as collaboration between the government and the working classes to develop recreational/cultural activities to assuage the impact of dramatic industrialization. However, regardless of the perception of progress, critics targeted the program for its centralization and expropriations, comparing it to "Communist" governments. For the newly established Commonwealth, at stake in the popular acceptance of these recreational programs was evaluation of a new political status arising from promises of social justice.Download Free PDFView PDFDiplomatic HistorySpreading Peace, Democracy, and Coca-Cola: Sport and American Cultural Expansion in the 1930s2004 • Barbara KeysDownload Free PDFView PDFA HISTORICAL CASE STUDY OF TITLE IX IN NEVADA: AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT IN OUR YOUTH2017 • JASON CLARKDownload Free PDFView PDFSports Education in the USA (English language paper)Antonio GraceffoDownload Free PDFView PDF" A Sport at which Jews Excel " : Jewish Basketball in American SocietyAri SclarDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
