[MediaWiki-announce] Security and maintenance release: 1.31.4 /1.32.4 / 1.33.1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.33.1, 1.32.4 and 1.31.4!
In a change to normal proceedings, the security patches are already merged
to
the various branches. This was due to the low severity of the patches. This
is
therefore the reason no pre-release announcement was sent.
It is noted that these patches are fairly large in comparison to normal,
this is
due to the splitting of some schema change patches from a single file to
multiple files to attempt to mitigate some migration issues identified in
T227662.
This release also serves as a maintenance release for these branches.
== Security fixes ==
* (T230402, CVE-2019-16738) SECURITY: Add permission check for suppressed
  account to Special:Redirect.
