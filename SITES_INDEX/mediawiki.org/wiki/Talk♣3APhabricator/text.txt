Can my Phabricator account Samwalton9 be renamed to Samwalton9-WMF? I'd like to create a new one from my volunteer account to continue drawing a clearer line between WMF and personal activities!

Hi there, 
I am able to see the "Other Assignee" field on https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/339269/, but @CCiufo-WMF is not. Can you help us understand what criteria must be met to see this field in a given task? 
Here are my permissions: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/?member=PHID-USER-orv5mcf5st35inouzwu3&status=active
Thanks so much!

@LDelench (WMF) Right, this is quite confusing. https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/transactions/editengine/maniphest.task/edit/3/ (the form used for this task) has a "Visible To" Custom Policy which includes for example "members of #WMF-NDA" (thus LDelench)  and doesn't include any project group that CCiufo is currently in.
https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/CCiufo-WMF/ is linked to the SUL account https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?page=User:CCiufo-WMF created by WMF ITS, so I've added as a member and hope that this fixes the problem.

Hi,
My Phabricator profile page (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/RajashreeTalukdar/) shows MediaWiki User as Unknown. Can these 2 be linked? I'm using the same username (RajashreeTalukdar) everywhere.
Thanks,
Rajashree

Hi, my MediaWiki username recently changed to Ifrahkhanyaree WMDE (from Ifrahkhanyaree) and it would be wonderful if someone could reflect this change on my Phab account as well. Much much appreciated!

Hi,
I recently changed my username to Isochrone and I would be grateful if a Phab admin could rename me onsite as well.
Many thanks.
