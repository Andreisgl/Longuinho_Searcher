It then considers the relationship between Greek painterly practice and philosophical accounts of colour(s), arguing that the philosophers show a substantial lack of interest in the painters’ practices. Dyeing technology also seems to be of little interest to colour theorists, who seem more focused on the visual effect of colours than on the behaviour of pigments and dyes. However, as I ultimatelysuggest with an anthropological turn of the discourse, referring to dyeing practices may be helpful to understand the intriguing predominance of the white/black/red triad both in the scientific explanations and in the Greek chromatic vocabulary.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Why have we lost such pre-theoretical notion, and what have we lost by losing it? I argue that most ancient Greek philosophers exploited this pre-theoretical assumptionone that was obvious to themin terms and ways that are still worthy of attention in the context of contemporary philosophy of colour. I offer an in-depth analysis of the theories of a number of early Greek philosophers, as well as of Plato in the Timaeus, showing that they tend to share the idea that colour is an essential property of external bodies and therefore plays a causal role in perception. Then I focus on a comparison between Democritus' stance and Aristotle's in order to highlight a significant contrast between the two. Democritus' theory is an exception in ancient thought because it traces the colour phenomenon back to a refraction of atmospheric light through atomic aggregates. Aristotle, instead, posits the presence of colour and light in the bodies themselves. Finally, I interpret Aristotle's account as the most complex attempt in ancient thought to weld together what we call the 'manifest image' of colour and its 'scientific image'.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

My point in Section 1 is that in tackling this issue Plato aims to provide a firm physiological basis to the notion of perception that starts to emerge in the Theaetetus and the Philebus and is crucial to the late development of his theory of cognition. In the ensuing section I try to put the account of perception in the Timaeus into a historical perspective, aiming to highlight two points: a) Plato's description of the way in which sensible impressions "travel" inside the body and interact with its parts and other constituents is largely indebted to previous theories, such as those we find, for example, in Empedocles and a few Hippocratic writers; b) The leading role in this story (where internal air plays a significant supporting role) is played by blood flowing through the vascular system and thus performing a crucial cognitive function. Moreover, emphasizing the role of blood as well as analyzing the elaborate way in which perceptions are transmitted through the body to the soul proves vital to appreciate (in Section 3) the cognitive status of the lower parts of the soul (which are more involved in perception) and their relation to reason. Overall, the paper adds further elements to our understanding of Plato's embodied approach to cognition. 1Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The focus then shifts to the long incubation period of physiognomic knowledge that took place from Homer’s time throughout Greek culture due to an interest in the moral significance of physical features that helped to separate physiognomy from other divinatory practices. This explains the attention drawn to the art of physiognomy by Aristotle, who famously reflected on the method- ological problems it raised and on the need to enrich the field with sys- tematic observations, particularly of animals. Thus, as shown through- out the paper, Aristotle laid the foundation for the first treaty on the discipline, which not by coincidence was written within the Peripatos.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A focus on personal character (and a reflection on the relation between physical and psychical facts) seems to be a Greek innovation. Aristotle attempted to give an inductive basis to assertions of the interdependence of body and soul (in An. pr. 2.27); the Historia animalium provided empirical evidence that corroborated early ideas about moral types among animals. The first extant treatise on the subject, the Physiognomonica (a Peripatetic work of c. 300 BCE long attributed to Aristotle), established a few criteria of comparison with animal, racial, and gender types, as well as with the expressions of emotions. This treatise is the forerunner of a tradition embracing Polemon of Laodicea in the 2nd century CE, an anonymous Latin treatise (Anonymus Latinus) in the 4th, as well as medieval, Renaissance, and modern writers. As a sign-based form of knowledge, physiognomy has been used in (and has drawn on) medicine, ethnography, and astrology. Physiognomic judgements were prized by orators because of their persuasive force. Artists too were well versed in physiognomy. Key to the popularity of the discipline is its claim of providing a comprehensive interpretation of the human world.

Specifically, it focuses on Plato’s exploitation of the analogy between the medical notion of health as a balanced condition of the body, on one hand, and political justice on the other. First, I examine Plato's thought on the status of the technai and particularly of medicine, prompted by the “Socratic” connection of moral virtue and knowledge, through an analysis of the relevant passages in a number of dialogues from the Apology of Socrates to the Gorgias and the Phaedrus. In the second section I endeavour to clarify the specific function of the references to medical techne in diverse contexts of the Republic and the Laws, aiming to claim its positive role as a model in the Platonic “psycho-political” project against Levin’s recent attempt at undermining it.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Parmenides, Fragment 8, 39-41 DK; Empedocles, Fragment 23 DK; Gorgias, Fragment 11, 17-18 DK). This judgment about the ‘ambivalence’ of colours is clearly shared by Plato, as shown by his criticism of painting, and particularly of the technique of σκιαγραφία, in the broader frame- work of his discussion on mimesis. However, Plato is far from being immune to the charm of colours in nature as well as in painting. As a matter of fact, as I argue in this paper, it can be shown that Plato conceived the luminosity of certain colours (esp. ‘white’ and the colours of precious metals) as the sensible medium through which intelligible Beauty makes itself visible to the human eye.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Democritus traces phro- nein to symmetria of the soul, that is conceived, in turn, as a state of thermic equilibrium, depending on his consideration of psyche as an aggregate of spherical and thin atoms flowing throughout the body and giving it life, move- ment, and perception. As a consequence, according to him, psychic states go hand in hand with changes in the body. In the following section of this paper, I offer additional evidence in favor of the controversial manuscript reading μετὰ τὴν κίνησιν. As a result, a consistent theory by Democritus can be reconstructed, according to which the balanced state of mobility and temperature of the psychic atoms concentrated in the head that generates a correct thinking neces- sarily follows the movement of sensible eidola throughout the body. In fact, a number of passages from Hippocratic writings attest that Democritus shared the key features of this explanation with the physiological and medical approach of the time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

L'art subtil d'Euripide de critiquer les dieux sur la scène.Philosophie antique, 18,  2018Summary.

I set out to explore Euripides’ religious views by considering him as a thinker and an artist at the same time, or rather as an author who raises as an artist essential questions about the meaning of human existence in relation to that of the gods, not so much by putting into the mouth of his characters certain doxai, but rather by making them speak and act in a certain way within a specific setting. I detach myself both from the scholars who have seen in Euripides a defender of the religious tradition and from those who tend to deconstruct his figures of the gods in a set of projections of various human feelings. Instead, I argue that Euripides questions from the beginning the coherence of traditional beliefs, with growing anxiety which leads, if not to a negation of the existence of the gods, to an exasperated attitude of doubt as to their role in human existence: which is sufficient for him to be counted among the authors whom Plato accuses of impiety in Laws 10.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As regards Euripides, the characters of Phae-dra and Medea are particularly revealing for their capacity to understand and express the reasons underlying the tremendous emotional stress under which they are. The paper deals with the problem of Medea's conduct along the drama, facing once more the challenge that Euripides launched on the scene of the Great Dionysia in 431 a.C. A challenge whose meaning can be thus summarized: while Medea perpetrates a horrible crime (the most horrible one can think of, actually), her gesture did not impress the ancient audience (neither does it impress us) for its being " evil " , but for its tragic grandeur. Indeed, in analyzing the famous monologue in which Medea reflects on how to best achieve her vengeance on Jason, we see that she does not evaluate her strategy in terms of what would be morally good or bad to do, either for herself or for her children, while clearly acknowledging that she is driven by her passion (thumòs). Besides stressing the extraordinary lucidity Medea displays in the monologue, we aim to disentangle the diverse and contradictory emotions that constitute her emotional syndrome, that is, love and hate, shame and anger, pleasure in revenge and despair.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I set out to explore Euripides’ religious views by considering him as a thinker and an artist at the same time, or rather as an author who raises as an artist essential questions about the meaning of human existence in relation to that of the gods, not so much by putting into the mouth of his characters certain doxai, but rather by making them speak and act in a certain way within a specific setting. I detach myself both from the scholars who have seen in Euripides a defender of the religious tradition and from those who tend to deconstruct his figures of the gods in a set of projections of various human feelings. Instead, I argue that Euripides questions from the beginning the coherence of traditional beliefs, with growing anxiety which leads, if not to a negation of the existence of the gods, to an exasperated attitude of doubt as to their role in human existence: which is sufficient for him to be counted among the authors whom Plato accuses of impiety in Laws 10.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Medea syndromeIn the last thirty years, Greek tragedy has been increasingly recognized as a ground of moral ref... more In the last thirty years, Greek tragedy has been increasingly recognized as a ground of moral reflection that is at least as worthy of philosophical attention as are the writings of Plato, Aristotle, or the Stoics, owing to the simple fact that dramatic characters move on the scene like in a living world of relationships that requires them to find their way through complex emotional situations. As regards Euripides, the characters of Phae-dra and Medea are particularly revealing for their capacity to understand and express the reasons underlying the tremendous emotional stress under which they are. The paper deals with the problem of Medea's conduct along the drama, facing once more the challenge that Euripides launched on the scene of the Great Dionysia in 431 a.C. A challenge whose meaning can be thus summarized: while Medea perpetrates a horrible crime (the most horrible one can think of, actually), her gesture did not impress the ancient audience (neither does it impress us) for its being " evil " , but for its tragic grandeur. Indeed, in analyzing the famous monologue in which Medea reflects on how to best achieve her vengeance on Jason, we see that she does not evaluate her strategy in terms of what would be morally good or bad to do, either for herself or for her children, while clearly acknowledging that she is driven by her passion (thumòs). Besides stressing the extraordinary lucidity Medea displays in the monologue, we aim to disentangle the diverse and contradictory emotions that constitute her emotional syndrome, that is, love and hate, shame and anger, pleasure in revenge and despair.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

"Presi per incantamento. Teoria della persuasione socratica", prefazione di Maria Michela Sassi, ETS, Pisa 2017by Gabriele Flamigni and Maria Michela SassiIn the “Charmides” Plato ascribes to Socrates the recourse to a curious metaphor. To young Charmi... more In the “Charmides” Plato ascribes to Socrates the recourse to a curious metaphor. To young Charmides, who is in need of a headache therapy, he explains that this ought to be preceded by a cure for his soul. “The treatment of the soul –Socrates puts it – is by means of certain charms, and these charms are kaloi logoi”. The study of this image of the charm allows the author of this book to discuss a key concept in Plato’s oeuvre: persuasion, as the subtitle reads. The main outcome of this enquiry is the sketching of an original reworking of the relationship between philosophy and rhetoric, which is often flattened to a mere opposition. Socrates is not a rhetorician, nor is Gorgias a philosopher, but both of them claim to be aiming at persuading the others. And philosophical persuasion, though in a certain sense is something completely different from the rhetorical one, in another shows itself as the offspring of a compulsory compromise of the philosopher with the rhetorician’s activity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Beginnings of Philosophy in Greeceby Maria Michela Sassi and Michele AsuniThe Beginnings of Philosophy in Greece ,  2018How can we face today the problem of the beginnings of philosophy, avoiding the rationalistic opp... more How can we face today the problem of the beginnings of philosophy, avoiding the rationalistic opposition between mythos and logos and exploring instead the multiple styles of thought (hence the plural: beginnings) which emerged on the confine between mythology and the dawning reason? Maria Michela Sassi reconstructs the texture of archaic knowledge through its vanishing points, its accelerations in time, its cognitive techniques (starting from writing), the habit of intellectual competition. All these things made possible what we were used to call «the Greek miracle». Such definition, however, is misleading  in its very conveying a charm that alters the features of what really happened in that far past between the Asian shores of Ionia and Magna Graecia. The beginning of the long process leading to the birth of philosophy was characterized by geographic polycentrism and disciplinary polygenesis: from Miletus to Elea, from Ephesus to Agrigento, some people started to reflect on the cosmic order, elaborated doctrines on the soul, wrote in the solemn Homeric metre or, later on, abandoned prosody in favour of an assertive prose, articulated like the laws of the polis. In order to define the category of the «Pre-Socratics», the prefix – however fortunate it has been – is not enough. The Milesian natural thinkers, the rhapsodist Xenophanes, the mathematician and “shaman” Pythagoras, the oracle-like Heraclitus, the inspired Parmenides, the “demonologist” Empedocles: all these thinkers share the same tension towards a reason which, by questioning traditionally recognized viewpoints, revolutionized the panorama of Greek knowledge.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

How can we avoid the sterility of the contrast between mythos and logos, and explore the multiple styles of thought which emerged on the confine between mythology and the dawning reason? Maria Michela Sassi goes back to the canonical questions – when thought was born, its specific nature and its distinctive forms – in order to reconstruct the texture of archaic knowledge through its vanishing points, its accelerations in time, its cognitive techniques (starting from writing), the habit of intellectual competition. All these things made possible what we were used to call «the Greek miracle». Such definition, however, is misleading: the idea of origin conveys itself a charm that gives a sense of wonder and alters the features of what really happened in that far past between the Asian shores of Ionia and Magna Graecia. The beginning of the long process leading to the birth of philosophy was characterized by geographic polycentrism and disciplinary polygenesis: from Miletus to Elea, from Ephesus to Agrigento, some people started to reflect on the cosmic order, elaborated doctrines on the soul, wrote in the solemn Homeric metre or, later on, abandoned prosody in favour of an assertive prose, articulated like the laws of the polis. In order to define the category of the «pre-Socratics», the prefix – however fortunate it has been – is not enough. The three Ionic “scientists”, the rhapsodist Xenophanes, the mathematician and “shaman” Pythagoras, the oracle-like Heraclitus, the inspired Parmenides, the “demonologist” Empedocles: all these thinkers share the same tension towards a reason which, by questioning traditionally recognized viewpoints, revolutionized the panorama of Greek knowledge. Such philosophical disposition was fixed, once for all, in Alcmeon’s 1st fragment: «The gods have certainties both on invisible and on mortal things; men can only conjecture».Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
