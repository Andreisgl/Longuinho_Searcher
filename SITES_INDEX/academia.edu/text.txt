The craze and euphoria surrounding it, not only in India but also in foreign lands, is something worth witnessing. One of the major attractions of Bollywood, which in fact distinguishes it from Hollywood, is its elaborate song-dance sequences which never fail to strike a chord with the audience. Its creation of sublime, emotional or foot-tapping escapism is simply unmatched anywhere in the world. A fact often overlooked is that, these songs and dances are intricately woven in our social fabric. It is interesting to take note of this and undertake an analysis of the same. In this article, I shall discuss about Bollywood, how the dances and songs are placed within movies, analyse the dance types, its forms in the context of social forces operating within it-'globalization' and 'glocalization' and provide a sociological understanding of it and its changing form. Since it is not possible to discuss the entire array of dance in Bollywood, I have analysed the dances post the globalization era and after the onslaught of MTV in 1980s. I have focused mainly on those dance sequences which have won the Filmfare Awards 1 , between year 1994 to 2013.Download Free PDFView PDFBeyond the Silver Screen: Bollywood and Filmi Dance in the UKAnn R DavidThis article examines the influence of filmi or Bollywood dance on dance practices in the UK. It locates film dance within the Bollywood genre, noting its recent acceptance as a new form of popular culture and its attractions for the younger generation of British Asians. The place of dance in the Hindi film is analysed and discussed briefly to contextualize the British position. Using evidence from fieldwork gathered in Leicester and London amongst dance teachers and students of South Asian dance, the paper questions notions of identity, authenticity, tradition and the changing nature of dance transmission as the Bollywood forms grow in popularity.Download Free PDFView PDFChutney Music In CarnivalDR. KUMAR  MAHABIRChutney has become the defining idiom through which people of East Indian/South Asian descent have made their musical mark in the Caribbean. Never before have chutney artistes, chutney concerts and chutney competitions pushed for airplay and space on the public stage as in Carnival 2013 in multi-ethnic Trinidad and Tobago. As a symbol of Indian identity, chutney challenged and competed with the dominant Afro Creole forms of calypso and soca in party circuits. Though chutney is performed all year round, it is at Carnival time that it increases in creativity and popularity as a form of cultural resistance and substitution. This paper seeks to explore how this genre of music has penetrated the national festival to the extent that Carnival has now to be re-examined and re-defined in the post-colonial society.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Indian Diaspora in the West Indies/Caribbean: A Cultural History of Triumphs and TribulationsDR.

One of the constituents of this differential was 1930s modern screen dance, performed by stars from the ‘cultured’ society. The most notable of them was Sadhona Bose – granddaughter of the social reformer Keshub Chandra Sen – who went on to become one of the first known dancing stars of Bengal. Bose’s Bengali Modern Dance – which claimed distinction from previous dances performed on the stage, dance-forms of silent cinema (both of which were considered undignified) and the neo-classical dances of the national-revivalist project – was central to her stardom. Through a study of Bose’s personal history and dance choreographies on screen, this article underscores the differential ‘Bengali-ness’ of Bose’s dancer persona. The article argues that the modern eclecticism of film dance created a space for Bose to negotiate her regional/Bengali subjectivity even while fulfilling the historicist demands of a hegemonic nationalism. It goes beyond the scope of the respectability discourse that often mires a female star and instead focuses on the nuances of dance forms and choreographies to locate her within the larger framework of dance culture and a regional modernism.Download Free PDFView PDFMedia, identity and diaspora: Indians abroadTej  BhatiaDownload Free PDFView PDFSensory Screens, Digitized Desires: Dancing Rasa from Bombay Cinema to Reality TVPallabi ChakravortyBombay cinema incorporated songs, dances, choreography, staging, and costumes from a variety of traditional forms to mark a modern national identity. The pioneering figure for using dance in films was Uday Shankar in his experimental film Kalpana. Bombay’s spectacular song-and-dance cinema then moves through films such as Chandralekha to contemporary Bollywood and its byproducts such as dance reality shows. The search for aesthetic modernity in India is embodied in the concept of “desire” as it evolved from traditional aesthetics to contemporary culture and new media technology; to uncover its evolution from Bombay cinema to reality show, I first analyze the historically transforming cinematography and content through a few select musicals. Secondly, I trace the emergence of the “Item” numbers in Bollywood and their relationship to music videos; and third, I explore the current expressions of screendance on reality shows in India as expressions of class mobility and democratization of cultureDownload Free PDFView PDFTRADITIONS AND TECHNIQUE OF INDIAN AND BALINESE DANCESAparajita SarmaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
