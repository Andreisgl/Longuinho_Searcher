Массовое удаление наблюдателей от одной партии из помещений, в которых осуществлялся подсчет голосов, напоминает знакомые картинки с выборов в России. Широкое внедрение норм, очевидно облегчающих фальсификации под предлогом «облегчения» явки дополнительных очень малых групп избирателей, ставит под удар определенность исхода выбора всех остальных избирателей. Массовое почтовое голосование с уникально низким процентом отвергнутых бюллетеней, голосование без удостоверений личности, сбор бюллетеней неофициальными сборщиками-эти и иные новинки предлагается теперь установить как общефедеральную норму. В федеральный закон о выборах предполагается вставить обязательное федеральное финансирование кампаний, а также нормы, плохо совместимые с правом Первой поправки. Масштабное и радикальное вмешательство федеральных властей в законодательство о выборах не имеет прецедентов в истории США и порывает с уважаемой традицией высокой степени автономии штатов. Все эти меры сопровождаются действиями, вызывающими разочарование друзей США, и открыто ставят целью порвать с наследием отцовоснователей Великой Республики. The article provides an overview of the issues of the 2020 US presidential election, which were an encouraging signal to dictators of the world. The mass removal of observers from one party from the premises where the votes were counted resembles a familiar sight from the elections in Russia. The widespread introduction of regulations that obviously facilitate electoral fraud on a pretext of "facilitating" the turnout of very small extra groups of voters jeopardizes the certainty of the outcome of the choice made by all other voters. Mass postal voting with an unprecedented low percentage of rejected ballots, voting without identification cards, ballots collected by unofficial collectorsthese and other novelties are now proposed to be established as a federal standard. Federal election law is expected to include mandatory federal campaign funding, as well as provisions that are poorly compatible with First Amendment law. Largescale radical federal intervention in electoral law is unprecedented in the US history and breaks with a respected tradition of high state autonomy. All of these measures are accompanied by actions that disappoint the friends of the United States, and openly aim to break from the legacy left by the founding fathers of the Great Republic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Rapid radiation of the Inner Indo-European languages: an advanced approach to Indo- European lexicostatistics [Linguistics, 2021, open access]by Alexei S .

We apply reasonably formal techniques of linguistic data collection and post-processing (onomasiological reconstruction, derivational drift elimination, homoplastic optimization) that have been recently proposed or specially developed for the present study. We use sequential phylogenetic workflow and obtain a consensus tree based on several algorithms (Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, neighbor joining; without topological constraints applied). The resulting tree topology and datings are entirely compatible with established expert views. Our main finding is the multifurcation of the Inner IE clade into four branches ca. 3357-2162 BC: (1) Greek-Armenian, (2) Albanian, (3) Italic-Germanic-Celtic, (4) Balto-Slavic-Indo-Iranian. The proposed radiation scenario may be reconciled with diverse opinions on Inner IE branchings previously expressed by Indo-Europeanists.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Permutation test applied to lexical reconstructions partially supports the Altaic linguistic macrofamily [Evolutionary Human Sciences 2021]by Alexei S . Kassian and Ilya EgorovEvolutionary Human Sciences 3 (e32) [Open access],  2021In this paper, we present the results of our analysis of the 110-item basic wordlists for four re... more In this paper, we present the results of our analysis of the 110-item basic wordlists for four reconstructed and one ancient languages, the linguistic ancestors of five language families which are hypothesized to constitute the Altaic (a.k.a. Transeurasian) macrofamily: Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolic, Proto-Tungusic, Middle Korean and Proto-Japonic wordlists. Protolanguage wordlists were reconstructed according to strict criteria of semantic reconstruction, based on accurate semantic glossing of forms in daughter languages. Each involved form was encoded into a bi-consonantal CC-shaped sequence using the consonant class method, after which a recently developed weighted permutation test was applied. In a typical situation, our algorithm makes a small number of type 1 errors (false positive), but the number of type 2 errors (false negative) can be substantial. Our main finding is that pairs between the Nuclear Altaic taxa – Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic – as well as the Turkic-Japonic and Tungusic-Japonic pairs demonstrate significant p-values. In some cases, this can be attributed to either ancient contacts or genealogical relationships, but at least for the Turkic–Japonic pair, a contact scenario is unlikely owing to geographical remoteness.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The general trend is negative: the number of such journals was higher in July 2018 than in 2015 when the RSCI was launched. We propose that this situation is due to the non-transparent and partly defective process of journal selection involved; primarily it can be attributed to problems with the RSCI expert pool.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Proto-Indo-European-Uralic Comparison from the Probabilistic Point of Viewby George Starostin, Alexei S . Kassian, and Mikhail ZhivlovIn this paper we discuss the results of an automated comparison between two 50-item groups of the... more In this paper we discuss the results of an automated comparison between two 50-item groups of the most generally stable elements on the so-called Swadesh wordlist as reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic. Two forms are counted as potentially related if their first two consonantal units, transcribed in simplified consonantal class notation (a rough variant of the Levenshtein distance method), match up with each other. Next to all previous attempts at such a task (Ringe 1998; Oswalt 1998; Kessler & Lehtonen 2006; Kessler 2007), our automated algorithm comes much closer to emulating the traditional procedure of cognate search as employed in historical linguistics. " Swadesh slots " for protolan-guages are filled in strict accordance with such principles of reconstruction as topology (taking into consideration the structure of the genealogical tree), morphological transparency , typology of semantic shifts, and areal distribution of particular items. Altogether we have counted 7 pairs where Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic share the same bi-consonantal skeleton (the exact same pairs are regarded as cognates in traditional hypotheses of Indo-Uralic relationship). To verify the probability of arriving at such a result by chance we have applied the permutation test, which yielded a positive result: the probability of 7 matched pairs is equal to 1.9% or 0.5%, depending on the constituency of the consonantal classes, which is lower than the standard 5% threshold of statistical significance or even lower than the strong 1% level. Standard methodology suggests that we reject the nullhypothesis (accidental resemblance) and offer a more plausibleexplanation for the observed similarities. Since theknown typology of language contacts does not speak in favorof explaining the observed Indo-Uralic matches as old lexicalborrowings, the optimal explanation is seen in the hypothesisof an Indo-Uralic genetic relationship, with the 7 matchingpairs in question representing archaic retentions, left overfrom the original Indo-Uralic protolanguage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Old Russian pošibati ‘futuere’: further evidence for bestiality in Old Rus’ / Др.-рус. пошибати ‘futuere’: еще одно указание на зоофилические практики в Древней Руси [Russian Linguistics 2019]Russian Linguistics,  2019The Old Russian verb pošibati is known from several contexts, for which the direct translation ‘t... more The Old Russian verb pošibati is known from several contexts, for which the direct translation ‘to beat, hit’ is not appropriate. In juridical texts the meaning ‘to rape (a woman)’ is traditionally accepted, whereas in the context of birchbark writing the translation ‘to bewitch, cast evil spells on (livestock, etc.)’ has recently been proposed. This paper demonstrates that an analysis of pošibati as (Lat.) ‘futuere’, i.e. the neutral designation of sexual intercourse, is, in fact, the best translation for the passages mentioned and is supported by the typology of semantic shifts. В древнерусском корпусе известно несколько контекстов с глаголом пошибати, в которых прямой перевод ‘бить’ для данной лексемы затруднителен или невозможен. Для пошибати в юридических текстах традиционно принимается перевод ‘изнасиловать’, а для древненовгородской грамоты был недавно предложен перевод ‘наводить порчу’. В статье показано, что толкование пошибати как (лат.) ‘futuere’, нейтральное обозначение половой связи, наилучшим образом удовлетворяет всем известным проблемным контекстам, а кроме того поддержано типологией семантических переходов.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Linguistic homoplasy and phylogeny reconstruction. The cases of Lezgian and Tsezic languages (North Caucasus) [Folia Linguistica Historica 2017]The paper deals with the problem of linguistic homoplasy (parallel or backward development), how ... more The paper deals with the problem of linguistic homoplasy (parallel or backward development), how it can be detected, what kinds of linguistic homoplasy can be distinguished and which varieties of the phenomenon are the most deleterious for the reconstruction of language phylogeny. It is proposed that language phylogeny reconstruction should consist of two main stages. Firstly, a strict consensus tree should be built on the basis of high-quality input data elaborated with the help of the main phylogenetic methods (such as Neighbor-joining, Bayesian MCMC, and Maximum parsimony), and ancestral character states, allowing us to reveal a certain number of homoplastic characters. Secondly, after the detected instances of homoplasy are eliminated from the input matrix, the consensus tree is to be compiled again. It is expected that after homoplastic optimization it will be possible to better resolve individual "problem clades", and generally the homoplasy-optimized phylogeny should be more robust than the tree constructed initially. The proposed procedure is tested on the 110-item Swadesh wordlists of the Lezgian and Tsezic groups. The Lezgian and Tsezic results generally support theoretical expectations. The MLN (minimal lateral network) method, currently implemented in the LingPy software, is a helpful tool for the detection of linguistic homoplasy. The paper is outlined as follows: (1) Introduction. (2) Main kinds of homoplasy. (3) Material and methods: (3.1) Data, (3.2) Phylogenetic methods, (3.3) Analysis. (4) Results: (4.1) The Lezgian case, (4.2) The Tsezic case. (5) Conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Pitfalls of shared innovations: Genealogical classification of the Tsezic languages and the controversial position of Hinukh (North Caucasus) [Lingua 2017]This paper deals with the genealogical structure of the Tsezic language group with a special focu... more This paper deals with the genealogical structure of the Tsezic language group with a special focus on the position of the Hinukh language within the group, which has remained controversial in previous research. Most specialists have treated Hinukh as the closest relative of the Tsez (Dido) language, and some previously proposed formal classifications based on lexical data appear to confirm this. However, the new and advanced lexicostatistical classification used in this paper suggests that Hinukh and Tsez do not in fact form a distinct clade. We examine Hinukh and Tsez historical phonology as well as morphological and syntactic features, upon which the traditional expert classifications have rested, and find that all exclusive traits seemingly shared by Hinukh and Tsez are either illusory or due to contact-driven parallel development or may simply represent Proto-Tsezic retentions. In other words, there is no phonological and grammatical evidence for a hypothetical Tsez-Hinukh protolanguage. On the contrary, there are some exclusive grammatical features of the Tsez and Khwarshi languages that may be regarded as innovations of a Tsez-Khwarshi protolanguage, conforming with a distinct Tsez-Khwarshi node in the new lexicostatistical classification of Tsezic. Therefore the traditional criterion of shared innovations supports the validity of the modern version of the lexicostatistical method employed in this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The “Nostratic” roots of Indo-European: from Illich-Svitych to Dolgopolsky to future horizons (2016)by Alexei S . Kassian, George Starostin, and Mikhail ZhivlovThe paper presents a brief assessment of “Nostratic” – the controversial, but promising hypothesi... more The paper presents a brief assessment of “Nostratic” – the controversial, but promising hypothesis on deeper linguistic connections of the Indo-European family, as envisaged by Vladislav Illich-Svitych and his contemporaries (particularly Aharon Dolgopolsky). We discuss some of the most important developments of the theory since the 1960s, and explain how emphasis on “quantity over quality” of data in the new huge corpora of “Nostratic” comparanda is less useful for advancing the hypothesis than a narrowly targeted emphasis on identifying the “core” evidence for the macrofamily. Identifying this “core” evidence, consisting of a small, but generally stable layer of the basic lexicon, is necessary to lend a more historically realistic flavor to the hypothesis, and its statistical evaluation will also help better understand the place of Indo-European among the other potential constituents of “Nostratic”. We argue that, in weighing the evidence, typological plausibility of semantic shifts and absence of topological conflicts in the tree are no less important than regularity of sound changes. We also show how the credibility level of various theories on the external connections of Indo-European can be arranged along a gradient – from “Indo-Uralic” to a general “Nostratic”, and indicate implications that such an arrangement may hold for future studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Un-making sense of alleged Abkhaz-Adyghean inscriptions on Ancient Greek pottery [ACSS 2016]A large number of Ancient Greek vases dated to the 1st millennium BC contain short inscriptions. ... more A large number of Ancient Greek vases dated to the 1st millennium BC contain short inscriptions. Normally, these represent names of craftsmen or names and descriptions of the depicted characters and objects. The majority of inscriptions are understandable in Ancient Greek, but there is a substantial number of abracadabra words whose meaning and morphological structure remain vague. Recently an interdisciplinary team (Mayor et alii 2014) came up with the idea that some of the nonsense inscriptions associated with Amazons and Scythians are actually written in ancient Abkhaz-Adyghe languages. The idea is promising since in the first half of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks initiated the process of active expansion in the Black Sea region, so it is natural to suppose that contacts with autochthonous peoples might be reflected in Greek art. Unfortunately, detailed examination suggests that the proposed Abkhaz-Adyghe decipherment is semantically and morphologically ad hoc, containing a number of inaccuracies and errors of various kinds. The methodological and factual flaws are so substantial that it makes Mayor et alii 's results improbable.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Pitfalls of the geographic population structure (GPS) approach applied to human genetic history: A case study of Ashkenazi Jews [Genome Biology and Evolution 2016]by Alexei S .

Localizing Ashkenazic Jews to Primeval Villages in the Ancient Iranian Lands of Ashkenaz. Genome Biology and Evolution). Das and co-authors applied the geographic population structure (GPS) method to autosomal genotyping data and inferred geographic coordinates of populations supposedly ancestral to Ashkenazi Jews, placing them in Eastern Turkey. They argued that this unexpected genetic result goes against the widely accepted notion of Ashkenazi origin in the Levant, and speculated that Yiddish was originally a Slavic language strongly influenced by Iranian and Turkic languages, and later remodeled completely under Germanic influence. In our view, there are major conceptual problems with both the genetic and linguistic parts of the work. We argue that GPS is a provenancing tool suited to inferring the geographic region where a modern and recently unadmixed genome is most likely to arise, but is hardly suitable for admixed populations and for tracing ancestry up to 1000 years before present, as its authors have previously claimed. Moreover, all methods of historical linguistics concur that Yiddish is a Germanic language, with no reliable evidence for Slavic, Iranian, or Turkic substrata.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
East Eurasian ancestry in the middle of Europe: genetic footprints of Steppe nomads in the genomes of Belarusian Lipka Tatars [Scientific Reports, 2016]Medieval era encounters of nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe and largely sedentary East Europ... more Medieval era encounters of nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe and largely sedentary East Europeans had a variety of demographic and cultural consequences. Amongst these outcomes was the emergence of the Lipka Tatars—a Slavic-speaking Sunni-Muslim minority residing in modern Belarus, Lithuania and Poland, whose ancestors arrived in these territories via several migration waves, mainly from the Golden Horde. Our results show that Belarusian Lipka Tatars share a substantial part of their gene pool with Europeans as indicated by their Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial and autosomal DNA variation. Nevertheless, Belarusian Lipkas still retain a strong genetic signal of their nomadic ancestry, witnessed by the presence of common Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA variants as well as autosomal segments identical by descent between Lipkas and East Eurasians from temperate and northern regions. Hence, we document Lipka Tatars as a unique example of former Medieval migrants into Central Europe, who became sedentary, changed language to Slavic, yet preserved their faith and retained, both uni- and bi-parentally, a clear genetic echo of a complex population interplay throughout the Eurasian Steppe Belt, extending from Central Europe to northern China.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We apply reasonably formal techniques of linguistic data collection and post-processing (onomasiological reconstruction, derivational drift elimination, homoplastic optimization) that have been recently proposed or specially developed for the present study. We use sequential phylogenetic workflow and obtain a consensus tree based on several algorithms (Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, neighbor joining; without topological constraints applied). The resulting tree topology and datings are entirely compatible with established expert views. Our main finding is the multifurcation of the Inner IE clade into four branches ca. 3357-2162 BC: (1) Greek-Armenian, (2) Albanian, (3) Italic-Germanic-Celtic, (4) Balto-Slavic-Indo-Iranian. The proposed radiation scenario may be reconciled with diverse opinions on Inner IE branchings previously expressed by Indo-Europeanists.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Permutation test applied to lexical reconstructions partially supports the Altaic linguistic macrofamily [Evolutionary Human Sciences 2021]by Alexei S . Kassian and Ilya EgorovEvolutionary Human Sciences 3 (e32) [Open access],  2021In this paper, we present the results of our analysis of the 110-item basic wordlists for four re... more In this paper, we present the results of our analysis of the 110-item basic wordlists for four reconstructed and one ancient languages, the linguistic ancestors of five language families which are hypothesized to constitute the Altaic (a.k.a. Transeurasian) macrofamily: Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolic, Proto-Tungusic, Middle Korean and Proto-Japonic wordlists. Protolanguage wordlists were reconstructed according to strict criteria of semantic reconstruction, based on accurate semantic glossing of forms in daughter languages. Each involved form was encoded into a bi-consonantal CC-shaped sequence using the consonant class method, after which a recently developed weighted permutation test was applied. In a typical situation, our algorithm makes a small number of type 1 errors (false positive), but the number of type 2 errors (false negative) can be substantial. Our main finding is that pairs between the Nuclear Altaic taxa – Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic – as well as the Turkic-Japonic and Tungusic-Japonic pairs demonstrate significant p-values. In some cases, this can be attributed to either ancient contacts or genealogical relationships, but at least for the Turkic–Japonic pair, a contact scenario is unlikely owing to geographical remoteness.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The general trend is negative: the number of such journals was higher in July 2018 than in 2015 when the RSCI was launched. We propose that this situation is due to the non-transparent and partly defective process of journal selection involved; primarily it can be attributed to problems with the RSCI expert pool.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Proto-Indo-European-Uralic Comparison from the Probabilistic Point of Viewby George Starostin, Alexei S .

Two forms are counted as potentially related if their first two consonantal units, transcribed in simplified consonantal class notation (a rough variant of the Levenshtein distance method), match up with each other. Next to all previous attempts at such a task (Ringe 1998; Oswalt 1998; Kessler & Lehtonen 2006; Kessler 2007), our automated algorithm comes much closer to emulating the traditional procedure of cognate search as employed in historical linguistics. " Swadesh slots " for protolan-guages are filled in strict accordance with such principles of reconstruction as topology (taking into consideration the structure of the genealogical tree), morphological transparency , typology of semantic shifts, and areal distribution of particular items. Altogether we have counted 7 pairs where Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic share the same bi-consonantal skeleton (the exact same pairs are regarded as cognates in traditional hypotheses of Indo-Uralic relationship). To verify the probability of arriving at such a result by chance we have applied the permutation test, which yielded a positive result: the probability of 7 matched pairs is equal to 1.9% or 0.5%, depending on the constituency of the consonantal classes, which is lower than the standard 5% threshold of statistical significance or even lower than the strong 1% level. Standard methodology suggests that we reject the nullhypothesis (accidental resemblance) and offer a more plausibleexplanation for the observed similarities. Since theknown typology of language contacts does not speak in favorof explaining the observed Indo-Uralic matches as old lexicalborrowings, the optimal explanation is seen in the hypothesisof an Indo-Uralic genetic relationship, with the 7 matchingpairs in question representing archaic retentions, left overfrom the original Indo-Uralic protolanguage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Old Russian pošibati ‘futuere’: further evidence for bestiality in Old Rus’ / Др.-рус. пошибати ‘futuere’: еще одно указание на зоофилические практики в Древней Руси [Russian Linguistics 2019]Russian Linguistics,  2019The Old Russian verb pošibati is known from several contexts, for which the direct translation ‘t... more The Old Russian verb pošibati is known from several contexts, for which the direct translation ‘to beat, hit’ is not appropriate. In juridical texts the meaning ‘to rape (a woman)’ is traditionally accepted, whereas in the context of birchbark writing the translation ‘to bewitch, cast evil spells on (livestock, etc.)’ has recently been proposed. This paper demonstrates that an analysis of pošibati as (Lat.) ‘futuere’, i.e. the neutral designation of sexual intercourse, is, in fact, the best translation for the passages mentioned and is supported by the typology of semantic shifts. В древнерусском корпусе известно несколько контекстов с глаголом пошибати, в которых прямой перевод ‘бить’ для данной лексемы затруднителен или невозможен. Для пошибати в юридических текстах традиционно принимается перевод ‘изнасиловать’, а для древненовгородской грамоты был недавно предложен перевод ‘наводить порчу’. В статье показано, что толкование пошибати как (лат.) ‘futuere’, нейтральное обозначение половой связи, наилучшим образом удовлетворяет всем известным проблемным контекстам, а кроме того поддержано типологией семантических переходов.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Linguistic homoplasy and phylogeny reconstruction.

It is proposed that language phylogeny reconstruction should consist of two main stages. Firstly, a strict consensus tree should be built on the basis of high-quality input data elaborated with the help of the main phylogenetic methods (such as Neighbor-joining, Bayesian MCMC, and Maximum parsimony), and ancestral character states, allowing us to reveal a certain number of homoplastic characters. Secondly, after the detected instances of homoplasy are eliminated from the input matrix, the consensus tree is to be compiled again. It is expected that after homoplastic optimization it will be possible to better resolve individual "problem clades", and generally the homoplasy-optimized phylogeny should be more robust than the tree constructed initially. The proposed procedure is tested on the 110-item Swadesh wordlists of the Lezgian and Tsezic groups. The Lezgian and Tsezic results generally support theoretical expectations. The MLN (minimal lateral network) method, currently implemented in the LingPy software, is a helpful tool for the detection of linguistic homoplasy. The paper is outlined as follows: (1) Introduction. (2) Main kinds of homoplasy. (3) Material and methods: (3.1) Data, (3.2) Phylogenetic methods, (3.3) Analysis. (4) Results: (4.1) The Lezgian case, (4.2) The Tsezic case. (5) Conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Pitfalls of shared innovations: Genealogical classification of the Tsezic languages and the controversial position of Hinukh (North Caucasus) [Lingua 2017]This paper deals with the genealogical structure of the Tsezic language group with a special focu... more This paper deals with the genealogical structure of the Tsezic language group with a special focus on the position of the Hinukh language within the group, which has remained controversial in previous research. Most specialists have treated Hinukh as the closest relative of the Tsez (Dido) language, and some previously proposed formal classifications based on lexical data appear to confirm this. However, the new and advanced lexicostatistical classification used in this paper suggests that Hinukh and Tsez do not in fact form a distinct clade. We examine Hinukh and Tsez historical phonology as well as morphological and syntactic features, upon which the traditional expert classifications have rested, and find that all exclusive traits seemingly shared by Hinukh and Tsez are either illusory or due to contact-driven parallel development or may simply represent Proto-Tsezic retentions. In other words, there is no phonological and grammatical evidence for a hypothetical Tsez-Hinukh protolanguage. On the contrary, there are some exclusive grammatical features of the Tsez and Khwarshi languages that may be regarded as innovations of a Tsez-Khwarshi protolanguage, conforming with a distinct Tsez-Khwarshi node in the new lexicostatistical classification of Tsezic. Therefore the traditional criterion of shared innovations supports the validity of the modern version of the lexicostatistical method employed in this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The “Nostratic” roots of Indo-European: from Illich-Svitych to Dolgopolsky to future horizons (2016)by Alexei S . Kassian, George Starostin, and Mikhail ZhivlovThe paper presents a brief assessment of “Nostratic” – the controversial, but promising hypothesi... more The paper presents a brief assessment of “Nostratic” – the controversial, but promising hypothesis on deeper linguistic connections of the Indo-European family, as envisaged by Vladislav Illich-Svitych and his contemporaries (particularly Aharon Dolgopolsky). We discuss some of the most important developments of the theory since the 1960s, and explain how emphasis on “quantity over quality” of data in the new huge corpora of “Nostratic” comparanda is less useful for advancing the hypothesis than a narrowly targeted emphasis on identifying the “core” evidence for the macrofamily. Identifying this “core” evidence, consisting of a small, but generally stable layer of the basic lexicon, is necessary to lend a more historically realistic flavor to the hypothesis, and its statistical evaluation will also help better understand the place of Indo-European among the other potential constituents of “Nostratic”. We argue that, in weighing the evidence, typological plausibility of semantic shifts and absence of topological conflicts in the tree are no less important than regularity of sound changes. We also show how the credibility level of various theories on the external connections of Indo-European can be arranged along a gradient – from “Indo-Uralic” to a general “Nostratic”, and indicate implications that such an arrangement may hold for future studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Un-making sense of alleged Abkhaz-Adyghean inscriptions on Ancient Greek pottery [ACSS 2016]A large number of Ancient Greek vases dated to the 1st millennium BC contain short inscriptions. ... more A large number of Ancient Greek vases dated to the 1st millennium BC contain short inscriptions. Normally, these represent names of craftsmen or names and descriptions of the depicted characters and objects. The majority of inscriptions are understandable in Ancient Greek, but there is a substantial number of abracadabra words whose meaning and morphological structure remain vague. Recently an interdisciplinary team (Mayor et alii 2014) came up with the idea that some of the nonsense inscriptions associated with Amazons and Scythians are actually written in ancient Abkhaz-Adyghe languages. The idea is promising since in the first half of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks initiated the process of active expansion in the Black Sea region, so it is natural to suppose that contacts with autochthonous peoples might be reflected in Greek art. Unfortunately, detailed examination suggests that the proposed Abkhaz-Adyghe decipherment is semantically and morphologically ad hoc, containing a number of inaccuracies and errors of various kinds. The methodological and factual flaws are so substantial that it makes Mayor et alii 's results improbable.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Pitfalls of the geographic population structure (GPS) approach applied to human genetic history: A case study of Ashkenazi Jews [Genome Biology and Evolution 2016]by Alexei S .

Localizing Ashkenazic Jews to Primeval Villages in the Ancient Iranian Lands of Ashkenaz. Genome Biology and Evolution). Das and co-authors applied the geographic population structure (GPS) method to autosomal genotyping data and inferred geographic coordinates of populations supposedly ancestral to Ashkenazi Jews, placing them in Eastern Turkey. They argued that this unexpected genetic result goes against the widely accepted notion of Ashkenazi origin in the Levant, and speculated that Yiddish was originally a Slavic language strongly influenced by Iranian and Turkic languages, and later remodeled completely under Germanic influence. In our view, there are major conceptual problems with both the genetic and linguistic parts of the work. We argue that GPS is a provenancing tool suited to inferring the geographic region where a modern and recently unadmixed genome is most likely to arise, but is hardly suitable for admixed populations and for tracing ancestry up to 1000 years before present, as its authors have previously claimed. Moreover, all methods of historical linguistics concur that Yiddish is a Germanic language, with no reliable evidence for Slavic, Iranian, or Turkic substrata.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
East Eurasian ancestry in the middle of Europe: genetic footprints of Steppe nomads in the genomes of Belarusian Lipka Tatars [Scientific Reports, 2016]Medieval era encounters of nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe and largely sedentary East Europ... more Medieval era encounters of nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe and largely sedentary East Europeans had a variety of demographic and cultural consequences. Amongst these outcomes was the emergence of the Lipka Tatars—a Slavic-speaking Sunni-Muslim minority residing in modern Belarus, Lithuania and Poland, whose ancestors arrived in these territories via several migration waves, mainly from the Golden Horde. Our results show that Belarusian Lipka Tatars share a substantial part of their gene pool with Europeans as indicated by their Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial and autosomal DNA variation. Nevertheless, Belarusian Lipkas still retain a strong genetic signal of their nomadic ancestry, witnessed by the presence of common Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA variants as well as autosomal segments identical by descent between Lipkas and East Eurasians from temperate and northern regions. Hence, we document Lipka Tatars as a unique example of former Medieval migrants into Central Europe, who became sedentary, changed language to Slavic, yet preserved their faith and retained, both uni- and bi-parentally, a clear genetic echo of a complex population interplay throughout the Eurasian Steppe Belt, extending from Central Europe to northern China.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This expansion–mainly to East Europe and the northern Balkans–resulted in the incorporation of genetic components from numerous autochthonous populations into the Slavic gene pools. Here, we characterize genetic variation in all extant ethnic groups speaking Balto-Slavic languages by analyzing mitochondrial DNA (n = 6,876), Y-chromosomes (n = 6,079) and genome-wide SNP profiles (n = 296), within the context of other European populations. We also reassess the phylogeny of Slavic languages within the Balto-Slavic branch of Indo-European. We find that genetic distances among Balto-Slavic populations, based on autosomal and Y-chromosomal loci, show a high correlation (0.9) both with each other and with geography, but a slightly lower correlation (0.7) with mitochondrial DNA and linguistic affiliation. The data suggest that genetic diversity of the present-day Slavs was predominantly shaped in situ, and we detect two different substrata: ‘central-east European’ for West and East Slavs, and ‘south-east European’ for South Slavs. A pattern of distribution of segments identical by descent between groups of East-West and South Slavs suggests shared ancestry or a modest gene flow between those two groups, which might derive from the historic spread of Slavic people.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

DRAFTThe final, slightly revised version of the paper is published in Cuneiform Digital Library Journa... more The final, slightly revised version of the paper is published in Cuneiform Digital Library Journal 2014:004. I host the present draft because it contains an excursus on the Haspelmath-Tadmor’ “Leipzig-Jakarta wordlist” on p.9-10 (due to its self-dependent nature, the excursus has been excluded from the published paper). I suggest that despite the sound theoretical approach, the actual results of the WOLD project unfortunately do not appear very reliable and the traditional Swadesh wordlist cannot be replaced by the current version of the “Leipzig-Jakarta wordlist”. The paper deals with lexical isoglosses between two ancient Near Eastern languages: Sumerian and Hurrian (Hurro-Urartian); namely several basic terms (like ‘hand’, ‘rain’ and so on) phonetically similar in both languages are discussed. Four possible scenarios are evaluated from the typological, etymological and statistical points of view: (1) chance coincidences; (2) lexical borrowings from Sumerian into Hurro-Urartian or vice versa; (3) genetic relationship between Sumerian and Hurro-Urartian; (4) prehistoric language shift: adoption by a Hurro-Urartian (or closely related) group of the Sumerian language or vice versa. Out of these four, two scenarios — lexical borrowings and genetic relationship — are typologically unlikely. The statistical probability of chance coincidences is low, although formally this explanation cannot be excluded. The fourth scenario — language shift — fits linguistic evidence and does not contradict archaeological data.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
