"he of the head") is "eunuch" or "courtier," various explanations for the origin of the term have been proposed. After reviewing the seven explanations encountered in the secondary literature, and assessing their respective strengths and weaknesses, this article makes a new proposal for the origin of the term, namely that it refers to the "head" of the king's bed. It is observed that this hypothesis is consistent: (i) with Akkadian terminology relating to parts of beds, which uses rēšu(m) to designate either a bed's top end generally or its "headboard" specifically; (ii) with the perception, visible in Babylonian ritual texts, of the bed as a place of potential danger to its occupant; and (iii) with the Akkadian literary expression mukīl rēši ("lit. keeper of the head") which, by analogy with well-attested expressions like mukīl bābi ("keeper of the gate") and mukīl appāti (lit. "keeper of the bridle"), is more likely to refer to an inanimate "head" than part of the human body. The possibility that the term ša rēš (šarri) is equivalent to the Greek term εὐνοῦχος, as argued for example by (Briant, P. 1996. Histoire de l'empire Perse. De Cyrus à Alexandre. Paris: Fayard. = Briant, Pierre. 2000. From Cyrus to Alexander. A History of the Persian Empire. Translated from the French by Peter T. Daniels. Winona Lake IN: Eisenbrauns), has been questioned by (Lenfant, D. 2012. "Ctesias and his Eunuchs a Challenge for Modern Historians." Histos 6: 257-97), but if the newly proposed origin of ša rēši is correct, it indirectly supports the case for an equivalency of the two terms: like εὐνοῦχος (lit. "bed-keeper"), ša rēši would literally refer to guardianship of the king's bed. The new proposal nevertheless has no bearing on the debate over whether ša rēši primarily designates "eunuch" or "courtier."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Frazer & Adalı 2021 "The just judgements that Ḫammu-rāpi, a former king, rendered": A New Royal Inscription in the Istanbul Archaeological Museums, Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie 111, 231-262by Mary Frazer and Selim AdalıThis article publishes a royal inscription preserved on a clay tablet housed in the Istanbul Arch... more This article publishes a royal inscription preserved on a clay tablet housed in the Istanbul Archaeological Museums. The inscription, which was intended for display on a stele, commemorates a royal grant of tax exemptions to nine Babylonian cities and presents the royal protagonist as a second Ḫammu-rāpi. The name and titulary of the king in question are not preserved, and the attribution of the inscription is accordingly uncertain. Following Jean-Vincent Scheil's attribution of the text already in 1902, the study that accompanies an edition of the text argues that it should be attributed to Nabonidus, king of Babylon 556-539 BC, and explores its historical significance in this context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on the text of the letter itself and on information contained in the tablet's scribal notes, it focuses on three moments in the letter’s “life”: the senders’ original intentions in writing the letter; the context in which the surviving manuscript, the tablet BM 45642, was produced; and the inscription of the letter onto a stone monument at some point prior to the production of BM 45642. It is argued that the object onto which the letter was inscribed was a stele rather than a stone tablet, and that it could have been displayed in the main courtyard of the E-zida temple in Borsippa on the occasion of Antiochus III’s visit to Borsippa in 187 BC.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The documents were written in: Uruk (Nos. 1-4 and probably 5), Bēl-iqbi (No. 6), Bīt-Rē’î (no. 7) and either Babylon or Kish (No. 8) and they range in date from the reign of Nabopolassar (Nos. 1 and 6) to the reign of Darius I (No. 7) and probably later (No. 8). As well as documenting, for example, the repair of a bridge in Uruk (No. 4) and a shift in crop emphasis on a temple estate (no. 6), the documents contribute to the prosopography of Babylonia c. 600-325 BCE. Men mentioned include a šangû of Sippar (no. 6) and two scribes who rose to the rank of šatammu of the Eanna temple (Nos. 2 and 3).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These include the principal Assyrian cities Nineveh (Kuyunjik), Assur (Qalat Sherqat) and Kalhu (Nimrud; biblical Calah), as well as smaller provincial centers such as Burmarina (Tell Shiukh Fawqani), Dur-Katlimmu (Tell Sheikh Hamad), Guzana (Tell Halaf), Huzirina (Sultantepe), Imgur-Enlil (Balawat), Ma'allanate (unidentified), Marqasu (Kahramanmaraş), Sam'al (Zinçirli), Šibaniba (Tell Billa), Til-Barsip (Tell Ahmar), and Tušhan (Ziyaret Tepe). The aim of the Archival Texts of the Assyrian Empire (ATAE) Project is to expand the Nineveh-focused State Archives of Assyria online (SAAo) corpus by creating a complete, open-access corpus of Neo-Assyrian archival texts. Unlike SAAo, the linguistical-annotated texts in the ATAE corpus are arranged by their provenance and the archive in which they were unearthed. The archive designations used by ATAE follow Olof Pedersén, Archives and Libraries in the Ancient Near East 1500-300 B.C., Bethesda 1987, a PDF of which can be downloaded here. Neo-Assyrian archival texts provide important insights into the economic and legal history of the Assyrian Empire, while also presenting modern scholars with vital impressions of societal structures and private lives of the period. The aim of the project is to make this text corpus easily accessible to scholars, students, and the general public.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
