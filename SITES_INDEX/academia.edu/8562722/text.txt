Some scholars even assert that the ancient Greeks did not possess the concepts of self or person. This dissertation sets out to examine those passages throughout Plato's dialogues that most clearly require some notion of the self or the person, and by doing so to clarify the logical lineaments of these concepts as they existed in fourth century Athens. Because Plato wrote dialogues, I restrict myself to analyzing the concepts of self and person as they appear in the mouths of various Platonic characters and refrain from speculating whether Plato himself endorses what his characters say. In spite of this restriction, I find a number of striking ideas that set the stage for further philosophical development. After an introductory chapter, in Chapters 2 and 3 I argue that the identification of the person with the soul and the identification of the human being with the composite of soul and body make possible a conceptual split between person and human being. In Chapter 4, I argue that the tripartite account of the soul suggests an ideal identification of the person with the rational aspect of the soul rather than the lower aspects of one's psychology. Finally, in Chapter 5 I argue that the analogical link between rationality in us and the rational order of the cosmos leads to the conclusion that the true self is, in some sense, divine.Download Free PDFView PDFDissertation: Turning the Whole Soul: Platonic Myths of the Afterlife and Their Psychagogic FunctionJoseph M .

The major strata in the hierarchy of divine beings were referred to in the Neo-Platonist tradition as “hypostases”. My question is this: between intellect, the World-soul, the Demiurge, and even the Forms how many hypostases did Plato posit, what were their nature, and what overall functions did they play in his philosophical system? I analyze Plato’s various accounts of those divine things that are immanent in the world of change (e.g. the World-soul) and those that are said to be transcendent intelligibles (e.g. the Forms and the Demiurge) in order to determine what Plato’s gods are and what roles they play in his system. While I examine the entire Platonic corpus, I focus on Plato’s late dialogues, in which theology and cosmology receive considerably more extensive and significant treatment than they do in his earlier works. My central texts are the Philebus, Timaeus, and book X of the Laws, supplemented secondarily by the Phaedo, Phaedrus, Republic, Sophist, Statesman, and Epistle VII. I also make cautious use of the testimony from Aristotle regarding Plato’s so-called “unwritten doctrines”. The invention of the World-soul is revealed to be Plato’s way of instantiating intellect in the cosmos in order to suit the demands of his natural and moral philosophy, while his esoteric account of the Demiurge resolves any tensions between his immanent theology and his metaphysics, and suggests, semi-literally, the role that timeless, intelligible goodness plays in organizing the sensible world of change.

In Plato and the Moving Image, Shai Biderman and Michael Weinman, eds. (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill | Rodopi, 2019)Phaedo - a Ghost Story, Penultimate draft2019 • David N McNeillIn this essay, I argue for a reading of Plato's Phaedo as both a ghost story, and a story about ghost stories, in something like the sense of ghosts introduced into contemporary film theory through Jacques Derrida's appearance in Ken McMullen's 1983 film Ghost Dance and his reflections on 'spectrality' and the ghostly in his 1993 Specters of Marx. As a ghost story, the dialogue makes dramatically manifest certain paradoxes concerning visibility and invisibility, materiality and immateriality, presence and non-presence. Moreover, as was the case with Derrida's interest in ghosts, what is ultimately at stake in Phaedo's ghost stories are questions of tradition, memory, and the possibility of a genuine inheritance. Principally, I show how the opposition between two distinct aspects of Derrida's account of the role of ghosts in our psychic economy, the first emphasized in Ghost Dance, the second emphasized in Specters of Marx, is a crucial part of the Phaedo's exploration of the fate of Socratic philosophy after Socrates' death.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
