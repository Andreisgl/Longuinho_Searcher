We have a new crew mate! Today hip-hop aficionado Albert M. Carter joins iamCrü as a contributor and we’re delighted to have him onboard. As a label owner, manager and distributor, Albert – aka Berto Brown – has key industry insight. The driving force behind Hip-Hop University, Albert is co-founder of Emirates Music Summit. He also recently launched AudioSwim, a music distribution and label service using future technology to help independent artists amplify their brand and get paid in full. Albert kicks off writing for iamCrü with his Top 5 Female Rappers of All-Time. Here we go…
No.5: Lil’ Kim
Kimberly Jones, most notably known by her stage name Lil’ Kim, is one of the most well-known and successful female rappers on the planet. Born in Brooklyn, New York, she was discovered by The Notorious B.I.G – one of hip-hop’s most iconic figures.
Lil’ Kim’s debut album Hard Core surfaced in 1996. Back when physical copies were a thing, Hard Core sold more than two million copies in the US and over six million copies worldwide. Rapper, songwriter, actress, model and reality television personality, Kim has released five studio albums. To date, she’s notched up over 15 million album sales and 30 million single sales.However, the original Queen Bee (sorry Beyoncé) doesn’t land on my list of Top 5 Female Rappers of All-Time through impressive music sales alone. Lil’ Kim has impacted hip-hop culture. Through her stylish fashion sense, ability to embrace her femininity and her crossover appeal, Lil’ Kim has in one way or another influenced most female rappers who’ve followed.
No.4: Cardi B
We’ve all heard of Cardi B by now. With her distinct voice and catchy signature phrases, the potty-mouthed, fun-loving, loud, no-holds-barred rapper is a household name – and one of the most polarizing figures in hip-hop.
Born Belcalis Almanzar, Cardi B burst onto the scene via VH1’s Love and Hip Hop reality TV show. Released in 2017, breakout single Bodak Yellow shot to No.1 – making Cardi the first solo female rapper to reach the top spot since 1998 in the process. Since then, she’s broken numerous records.
With 13 songs placing in Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart at the same time, Cardi holds the record for most simultaneous Billboard Hot 100 entries by a woman. She ranks second for the most simultaneous Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Hot 10 entries with five songs. What’s more, she surpassed Taylor Swift’s record for most first-week plays for a female artist on Apple Music. As the numbers keep racking up, Cardi B is showing no sign of slowing down.
No.3: Queen Latifah
Most known for her box office hits these days, people forget that Queen Latifah is one of the most influential and groundbreaking female rappers of all time. Signing her first record deal with Tommy Boy records at just 18, Queen Latifah redefined a male dominated industry with her feminist-themed music. Her albums transcended hip-hop and moved into soul, dance and reggae.
In 1991 Queen Latifah, aka Dana Owens, appeared in her first movie – Spike Lee’s ‘Jungle Fever’. With acting roles coming thick and fast since, she’s enjoyed small and large screen success. Across her music and acting career, from the Grammys to the Academy Awards, this Queen has scooped 30 gongs.
No.2: Missy Elliot
Exploding on the rap scene with her 1997 debut album Supa Dupa Fly, Missy Elliot ushered in a new hip-hop sound. Her writing, rapping, singing and production skills give the multi-Grammy award-winning artist an edge on the list.Showcasing her diverse talent on a massive scale, Missy changed the game for women in music. The Work It rapper’s fun-filled music exudes strength and confidence and embodies woman empowerment. The only female MC with six platinum solo albums, Missy releases all her music on her own record label, Goldmine Records.
A close contender for the top spot in this Top 5 Female Rappers list, Missy paved the way for women artists to not only compete with men but even surpass them. An incredible talent, she’s inspired some of today’s favourite artists from Lil’ Wayne to Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj.
No.1: Nicki Minaj
Arguably one of the most famous people on the planet, Onika Tanya Minaj, aka Nicki Minaj, claims pole position. With her rapid-fire delivery and melodic voice, the rapper, singer and actress holds her own with some of the most popular artists in the world like Drake, Lil’ Wayne, Rick Ross and Jay-Z.
The Trinidadian-born, New York-raised artist is the most awarded female rapper in history, surpassing Missy Elliot for the top spot. With over 100 singles in the Hot 100 to her name, she’s also the most followed rapper on Instagram with 142 million followers. Nicki reigns supreme as the best female rapper of all-time.
