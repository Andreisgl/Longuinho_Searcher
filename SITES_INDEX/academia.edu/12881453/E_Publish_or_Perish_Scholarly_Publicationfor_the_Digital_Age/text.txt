DivakarGenesis of e-books and the connected social implications have a long bearing on the dissemination of knowledge. The strides in information technology have ushered in new content formats and reading devices. An e-book is superior to a c-book in terms of storage, delivery and accessibility.

Around the world, there have been initiatives towards the ultimate goal of enhancing public access to all recorded knowledge. Internet apart from facilitating self publication of e-books, democratising access to knowledge and doing social good especially for developing countries by improving literacy, and education.Download Free PDFView PDFInnovation and the Future of E-BooksJohn W WarrenThe technological development and cultural acceptance of e-books today parallels the state of the printed book in the 15th century. E-books are increasingly available from a variety of distributors and retailers, and work on a myriad of devices, but the majority remain simply digitized versions of print books. Some devices or platforms include such tools as word definitions, highlighting, and note taking, but many of these tools simply mimic what students and researchers have traditionally done with printed texts. This paper examines three examples of innovative e-books in order to illustrate the potential and pitfalls of electronic publications. The first is a history e-text that includes 1,700 primary-source documents — such as Presidential memos, reports, and even audio and video clips — linked from footnotes, providing a treasure trove of research material to readers. The second is a novella in hypertext form. The third example examines digital textbooks that include multimedia, assessment, and other digital tools. Each of these cases demonstrates creative approaches, business models, and methods of review that point to the enhanced, interactive, interlinked future of the e-book.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of College Reading and LearningPicture a World without Pens, Pencils, and Paper: The Unanticipated Future of Reading and Writing2010 • Nathalie BaptisteDownload Free PDFView PDFArs edendi lecture series (1) – Volume 1De laude scriptorum manualium and De laude editorum: From Script to Print, From Print to Bytes2011 • Jan ZiolkowskiThe Ars edendi Lectures are organized by the research programme of the same name based at Stockholm University and funded by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. Both the programme and the lectures focus on editorial method and theory as applied to dynamic textual traditions of medieval Latin and Greek works. For the Lecture Series, leading scholars are invited to share their expertise regarding textual criticism and the art of editing. In this volume, the first in a planned series of four, Nigel Wilson guides future editors to new challenges and indicates how their work will be markedly different on account of advances in related technologies. In Jan Ziokowski's lecture, new technology is also strongly present as he reflects on the future of the printed book and the work of critical editing in the digital age. Technology of a more specific kind is treated by Timothy Janz, who accounts for a method under development to identify scribes with more certainty by their script alone. In the last two lectures here, the focus shifts from hard technology to a greater sensitivity in the editing of texts as regards both linguistic forms and aesthetics in the Middle Ages. Peter Stotz examines the first volume of the Corpus rhythmorum musicum, giving examples of where such a sensitivity can create more credible editions. Pascale Bourgain emphasizes the importance of a stylistic awareness on behalf of the editor and how the lack of it can distort the author's original sense.Download Free PDFView PDFDictionary of library and information scienceirfan ullahDownload Free PDFView PDFRe-Writing Publishing: Fanfiction and Self-Publication in Urban FantasyJessica BayFanfiction is the practice of fans writing stories using the world and/or characters of an established work of fiction in order to rework this material. This thesis examines the relationship between fanfiction and digital self-publication within the popular fiction genre of urban fantasy. Emerging technologies in digital publishing have created a new world for authors and readers alike. Online publishing companies make it possible for any author to self-publish an ebook and distribute it through a global platform without an agent. The practice of writing fanfiction connected with urban fantasy has combined with the relative ease of digital self-publication to create an environment within which many new authors can explore non-traditional forms of publication. While all genres have access to this possibility, I suggest that urban fantasy is one of the few that is poised to revolutionise the publication industry due to its historical connection with digital fanfiction.

Given the ideological views of content producers is generally that their allegiance is to service the public first, and the organisations they represent second, content producers are often not financially driven with many having little regard for when, where or how the revenue will be earned by the publisher that in turn funds their pursuits. Given the changing economics of the publisher’s fundamental business models due to disruption, the ability for content producers to continue to operate in the same manner is not sustainable in the digital era. To survive in the digital era, content producers must understand that while publishers still provide some value, many of the traditional functions such as market- ing, payments or design, may be better executed themselves using tools and services available on the Internet. To thrive in the digital era, content producers must become more entrepreneurial and work to better understand their target markets as well the different content packages consumers demand whilst employing strategies and tac- tics such as affiliate marketing, the sale of consumer data, a ’freemium’ model or a crowdfunded subscription model. Furthermore, this report details the concept of a content publishing platform akin to an ’app store’ as well as the introduction of a ’media tax’, akin to a TV licence that will ensure content producers are financially rewarded for the continued pursuit of serving the public.Download Free PDFView PDFLibrary Hi TechThe emergence of electronic books publishing in Spain2010 • Julio Alonso Arévalo, Helena  Martín-Rodero, José Antonio CordónPurpose – In Spain, recent experiences by publishing houses are related to the new market of electronic books and they will change the current publishing scene in no time. The paper aims to discuss some of them and to give an outlook of future developments in the sector and in the libraries. Design/methodology/approach – In order to develop the current situation of electronic publishing and the research on the initiatives of production and sales of electronic books, the authors used statistical and business sources, as well as bibliographic and reference databases. They assessed the experiences that have been developed in the libraries regarding the lending and use of electronic books, by means of a survey that considers these points. Findings – There are several working experiences with electronic books, mainly through the subscription of collections in university and research libraries. However, the latest innovation is represented by the appearance of initiatives for the production and creation of publishing contents in Spain. The publication of electronic books in Spain has gone from being a mid-term possibility, calmly accepted by the publishing sector, to being an unstoppable reality that has forced the main actors in this field to take their positions and to adopt immediate initiatives. Originality/value – This is the first time that an analysis of the sector of electronic books in Spain and their implications for library and publishing sector is doneDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
