I am a paid curation officer at the National Herbarium of Victoria. Certain members of our organisation, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, are helping to share our botanical resources through the WP:GLAM project. See the RBGV GLAM Project Page for more information.
From October to November 2022, I worked full-time as a Digital Curation Officer (Wikimedian), at the National Herbarium of Victoria. I am working to improve the discoverability of information about women collectors represented in the National Herbarium of Victoria's holdings. 
Conflict of Interest[edit]
When I am editing the Wikimedia Foundation projects Wikipedia, Wikidata, or contributing to Wikimedia Commons as part of my official professional duties, I always try to abide by the accepted norms and practices regarding conflicts of interest, neutrality, and subject notability. This includes acting transparently and only adding information that is verifiable, typically drawing on data held within the State Botanical Collection, or other publications.
