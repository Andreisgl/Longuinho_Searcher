Welcome!
This wiki started life as a Wikipedia. The encyclopedia in the constructed language of Klingon was felt to be unsuited to the goals of the Wikimedia Foundation. It was closed during Wikimania 2005 and finally moved to this new home at Fandom in December 2006, and now has 237 articles.
The Klingon language (tlhIngan Hol in Klingon) is the constructed language spoken by Klingons in the fictional Star Trek universe.
You may write anything in this wiki, as long as you do so in Klingon. The aim is to build something similar to Wikipedia, which means an encyclopedia about any topics you can think of, but all written in Klingon.
For non-Klingon-speakers and beginners: If you have any comments or questions, you can leave a message in the Forum. See also A guide to the Klingon Encyclopedia and all Help files.
