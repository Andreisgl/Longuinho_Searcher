            Zachy Hennessey
        
Zachy Hennessey is The Jerusalem Post’s Business and Tech Innovation reporter.
Before joining the Post, Zachy served in the IDF International Spokesperson’s Unit and reported for BlockTV, a crypto and blockchain news site.
Zachy is an avid user of a certain Israeli Sparkling Water Maker, but has vowed not to let his love of bubbly H2O interfere with his journalistic integrity.
