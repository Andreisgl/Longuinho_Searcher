True birthplace of Wales's literary hero
Hollywood immortalised Richard Llewellyn's vision of Wales
  
A documentary film on the life of one of Wales's most famous literary sons has revealed that his claim to be Welsh-born was false.
Evidence has been unearthed that contradicts a claim by Richard Llewellyn - author of the novel How Green Was My Valley  - that he was born in St David's, Pembrokeshire.
The Hollywood film starred Maureen O'Hara and Roddy McDowell
The new information has emerged as the result of research by BBC television producer Arwel Ellis into how to mark the 60th anniversary of the book.
How Green Was My Valley was published in 1939 and was made into an Oscar-winning film starring Maureen O'Hara and Roddy McDowell. The book has been translated into more than 30 languages.
According to a birth certificate found in an archive of Llewellyn's papers, at the University of Texas, the author was really born in London.
Vivian Lloyd - his real name - was born in the north London suburb of Hendon and was the son of a Welsh publican.
Until his death in 1983 the author of a series of acclaimed novels set among Welsh mining communities, claimed to be the son of a Welsh miner who worked down the pits in Gilfach Goch in the south Wales Valleys.
In fact, the writer first had a job washing dishes at Claridges hotel
in London, and his knowledge of mining came from stories he heard
from a family who ran a bookshop in the city's Charing Cross
Road.
