Berenice VerhelstUniversity of Amsterdam,  Acasa,  Faculty MemberClassics+11Berenice Verhelst (°1987) studied Classics (Languages and Literature, Latin and Greek) and Dutch (Languages and Literature, Dutch) at the University of Ghent. From 10/2010 to 9/2014 she held a Predoctoral Fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO). She completed her dissertation (title: "Ποικιλομύθῳ φωνῇ. A literary and rhetorical analysis of direct speech in Nonnus' Dionysiaca") under the supervision of Prof. dr. Kristoffel Demoen (Ghent) and was rewarded her doctorate in September 2014.  In 2014-2015, she worked as a Teaching Assistant for Greek Literature and Linguistics at the University of Ghent.

Its long soliloquies and scarcity of dialogues have often been pointed out as striking characteristics of Nonnus’ epic style, but nonetheless this fascinating subject received relatively little attention.Berenice Verhelst aims to reveal the poem’s constant interplay between the epic tradition and the late antique literary context with its clear rhetorical stamp. She focusses on the changed functions of direct speech and their implications for the presentation of the mythological story.

Although similar problems and questions arise in research on both poetical traditions, a real dialogue between these two scholarly fields is still conspicuously missing. It is our conviction that a stronger dialogue is needed between the two fields to come to a better understanding, not only of the shared developments, but also of the subtle differences between the two traditions, which are now often overlooked or simplified because of the lack of comparative studies. The bilingual focus of our project and the book which will be its result is chosen explicitly to stimulate the dialogue between the two fields and explore the possibilities this creates to come to a better understanding of Late Antique poetry. It aims to shed new light on literary developments that can or have been regarded as typical for Late Antiquity and on the poetic and aesthetic ideals that affect individual poems from this period. Only by analyzing this poetry from a bilingual perspective is it possible to correct common misunderstandings about the extent to which certain literary phenomena are typically “Late Antique”, “Latin” or “Greek”. Because opening a dialogue can only be done in collaboration, this project can only be successful as teamwork. The broad outline of the current collaborative book project was decided upon during the closing round table discussion of the 2015 Edinburgh conference “Poetry and Aesthetics of Late Antiquity” (organized by Calum Maciver, Aaron Pelttari and Catherine Ware). New voices have entered the discussion since, and the workshop scheduled for 8-9 September 2016 in Ghent will bring all contributors (Latinist and Hellenists, established and junior scholars) together in order to discuss the many questions we are all struggling to answer. Discussion will be stimulated by the format of the workshop with pre-circulated draft chapters and appointed respondents.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
PapersTowards a linked open data resource for direct speech acts in Greek and Latin epicby Simone Finkmann, Berenice Verhelst, and Chris ForstallDigital Scholarship in the Humanities,  2022Open Access: https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqac006/6549220

The ... more Open Access: https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqac006/6549220  The DICES research group reports here on preliminary work to integrate research on Greek and Latin epic speeches into the larger ecosystem of linked open data (LOD) for classical scholarship. The ability to collate speech data from different researchers and to leverage external repositories of texts and characters opens up new possibilities for interrogation of the epic corpus. We briefly survey the current state of scholarship on epic speeches and of the digital infrastructure on which we propose to build. We outline a model for harmonizing speech data across studies and aligning it with existing LOD standards. Finally, we discuss some early proof-of-concept results and the larger implications of this approach for the field. The long-term aim of the DICES project is to build a database of metadata on direct speech in Greek and Latin epic, not only covering canonical texts such as Homer and Virgil, but also including the less-studied texts of the late antique period, which will benefit greatly both from the increased accessibility and also from the diachronic perspective afforded by a corpus-based approach. The envisioned database also has the potential to include diachronic data from additional genres and languages at a later stage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Today, they are part of our cultural heritage, without any religious connotations. But how did Christians in Late Antiquity deal with the heritage of their still omnipresent past? A closer look at the literature from this period of change (4th-6th century AD) can offer a –partial – answer, but only when Christian and ‘pagan’ (or better ‘secular’) literature are studied together and in relation to one another. Nonnus of Panopolis (5th AD) is an interesting case. He wrote a 48-book epic poem on the God Dionysus and a hexametrical Paraphrase of the gospel of John. Can Dionysus represent Christ? Or is Nonnus’ interest in mythology (like ours) purely antiquarian? What is the effect of the Gospel’s transformation into an epic poem? This contribution combines a central focus on Nonnus with a few explorations of the broader LateAntique (Greco-Roman) context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Many later Greek and Latin authors refer to this myth in their works, but no one as often as Nonnus of Panopolis, the Novus Homerus of late antiquity and author of the long epic Dionysiaca. We can find references to the story in twelve separate passages. Two of them are fully developed and highly original adaptations of the story, combining humour and explicit intertextuality. They can be read as parodic sequels of the story. Both also seem to refer to the points of discussion in the Homeric scholia regarding the song of Demodocus. This article presents a full discussion of the story of Aphrodite’s adultery in the Dionysiaca, with special attention to Nonnus’ attitude towards Homer.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

What if they defile his name, by calling Typhon now the “Bringer-of-rain”, the “Ruler-on-high” or even worse, the “all-highest” instead of Zeus? One can but smile about his apparent concern which adjectives are used by men to describe him. Our smile grows wider, when we realize that these are, of course, not merely adjectives, but epithets associated with Zeus in the literary tradition. “τις Ἀχαιῶν” in line 385 already reminded us of the Greeks of Homer, but a more important clue for interpreting this passage as a metalepsis (breaking the boundaries between narrative levels) is the reference to Hellas as “μυθοτόκος” (bringing forth mythological stories) in the same line. As a self-conscious literary character Zeus, indeed, seems not only to care about his reputation within the literary world he is confined to, but also to fear the way his story will be told. As a mise-en-abyme, this passage is an important clue for interpreting the characterization strategies for both Zeus and Typhon in the first books of the Dionysiaca. Taking the case of Zeus and Typhon as a starting point, I will try to shed new light on the constant dialogue with the literary tradition in the Dionysiaca. Regardless of whether he does so by giving his characters a say in how they want to be remembered, by anachronistically comparing them with characters from the Iliad that “actually” still have to be born or by juxtaposing two versions of one myth, Nonnus continuously prevents his audience from believing his story. Instead, he seems to focus their attention on his demonstration of literary skills and education.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In de Dionysiaca van Nonnus van Panopolis (5de eeuw n. C.) wordt Hypnus overtuigd om Zeus te laten inslapen na een lange monoloog van Iris, vermomd als Hypnus’ moeder Nyx. Haar speech bevat een reeks vergezochte “mythologische” argumenten die Hypnus moeten overtuigen kant te kiezen in de Indische oorlog tegen Zeus en Dionysus. Aphrodite, die zich net achter Dionysus schaart, haalt op haar beurt al haar retorisch talent uit de kast om haar zoon, Eros, voor Dionysus’ kar te spannen. Beide speeches worden aangekondigd door de verteller als “bedrieglijk”, maar bevatten geen onwaarheden of leugens. De aandacht van de lezer wordt gevestigd op het manipulatieve karakter van de argumentatie, de constructie van een passend sprekers-ethos en de technieken die beide spreeksters gebruiken om op de emoties van hun gesprekspartners in te spelen (pathos). Het sterk retorische karakter van Nonnus’ epos wordt in deze voordracht ook in verband gebracht met de contemporaine retorische praktijk, waarbij vaak werd geput uit de mythologische traditie, zowel voor schoolopdrachten (zie bv. (Ps.-)Libanius’ Progymnasmata) als voor heuse showredevoeringen (zie bv. Dio Chrysostomus’ Trojaanse redevoering).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With his 35.5% speech ratio, Nonnus seems closer to the Homeric balance of speech and narrator text (Iliad 45%, Odyssey 67.5%) than Quintus (23.6%) or Apollonius (29.4%), but this high percentage is due to the great length of his elaborated speeches, which makes Nonnus, perhaps more justified, the lest Homeric of all Greek epicists.  A more fundamental difference, regarding the function of speech, is the limited presence of conversation. In this paper the absence of conversation will be connected to the presence of a strong influence of contemporary rhetoric. A rhetorical analysis of a select number of individual speeches will lead to a discussion of what their function is in the narrative of the Dionysiaca .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A distinction is drawn between actual τις-speech and τις-speech that is pronounced by a character imagining the reaction of others (tertiary focalisation). In Homer we count 23 actual τις-speeches, and 10 potential τις-speeches.  John Wilson (1979) makes note of the dramatic use of potential τις-speeches in Greek tragedy, but also draws attention to its almost complete absence in Greek literature later than the 5th century BC.  The by contrast extensive use of potential τις-speech by Nonnus of Panopolis (15 in the Dionysiaca (and another 6 in indirect speech) and 2 in the Paraphrase of the Gospel of John) was not taken into account. Introduced by “ὄφρα τις εἴπῃ” or “ὅταν […] τις ἐνίψῃ”, a great number of these examples are discussed in contributions to Nonnus research for their epigrammatic style, ending a rhetorically elaborated speech with a short embedded speech as a punch line. Notwithstanding the great formal similarity with Homer, Nonnus research has not regarded them as examples of τις-speech before. By comparing Nonnus’ use of potential τις-speech with Homer and the tragedians, I shall point out the differences and similarities. The two examples in the Paraphrase, where Nonnus makes a small addition to the text of the Gospel, indicate most clearly that potential τις-speech in Nonnus has become a stylistic feature and part of his poetic language. I will show that the revival of potential τις-speech in Nonnus does not only mean an extensive use of it as one of his more common rhetorical devices used in character speech, but also a creative search for new alternatives and derivate forms.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
From Troy to India and from Medea to Morrheus. Nonnus’ rhetorical transformation of Homer, Apollonius and Quintus in Dionysiaca 31-35.In books 31-35 of his Dionysiaca, Nonnus (5th century AD) pays homage to his epic predecessors. H... more In books 31-35 of his Dionysiaca, Nonnus (5th century AD) pays homage to his epic predecessors. He rewrites Homer’s Dios Apatê-episode (Ilias 14-15), and inserts within the frame of this Homeric adaptation a love story with many parallels to the story of Jason and Medea in Apollonius’ Argonautica 3. The love story also contains a necrophilia scene, reminiscent of Quintus of Smyrna’s report of the love of Achilles for the amazon Penthesilea after her death (Posthomerica 1), which makes the list of his three main epic predecessors complete.The great number of intertextual references in this episode catches the eye because of the remarkable combination of sources (Homer, Apollonius and Quintus), but is not exceptional in itself. The Dionysiaca can be read as a constant dialogue with the literary past. At various instances, the author explicitly presents himself as the challenger of his literary examples, of which Homer is the most important. Apollonius’ exemplary function is less articulated, but as Vian proves in his survey of ‘Echoes and Imitations of Apollonius Rhodius in Late Greek Epic’ (2008), Apollonius can also be counted among Nonnus’ favourite models. Whereas Nonnus’ epic predecessors are the dominant structural models for the episode analysed in this paper, he also uses topoi that are familiar from the Greek novels. As a fundamental element of Nonnus’ new epic style, which also bears the mark of the contemporary rhetoric (school) practices, this influence of other, un-epic traditions creates a contrast in tone with his epic predecessors.This contrast, rather than the intertextual play in itself, is the central point of interest in this paper. Both recent editions of the Dionysiaca (Budé 2003, 2005, 2006 and BUR 2004) already give a detailed overview of the intertextual correspondences in this episode. Nonnus’ rewriting of the Argonautica 3 in books 33-34 is also discussed in an article by Nicola Montenz (2004). Therefore, taking the intertextual relation between the corresponding passages as a starting point, this paper presents a comparison of Nonnus’ epic style and tone with Homer, Apollonius and to a lesser degree Quintus.The focus hereby will lie on the use of direct speech, which, as will be demonstrated, is one of the most striking differences between Nonnus and his epic predecessors. The statistic prevalence in the Dionysiaca of monologues (often without an audience) over dialogues (with a maximum of three speech moments per dialogue) characterizes it as an epic in which the action is not driven forward by the conversations between the characters, but, by contrast, is delayed every time a long monologue is pronounced. Most of the speeches are carefully composed rhetorical showpieces, full of paradoxes and myth-based witty arguments. By comparing the speeches in this episode with the corresponding speeches in Nonnus’ epic models, the artificiality of the speech situations in Nonnus is revealed. The long speeches of Nonnus’ characters often anticipate on possible reactions and objections. In that way a monologue assumes the function of a dialogue and as a result the illusion of reading a real conversation is broken. As will be demonstrated in this paper, school rhetoric plays a significant role in Nonnus’ transformation of his models.  By arguing for and against the same proposition – a typical school exercise – in two speeches concerning Aphrodite’s loyalty (31.229-282 and 33.149-179), Nonnus, moreover, does not only create a rhetorical opposition between these two speeches, he also confronts his two models: Homer and Apollonius.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
