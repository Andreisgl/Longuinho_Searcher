However, large collections of these publications appear to be rare and are often incomplete. In order to assess the unique properties of the collections, we compare observatories present in our own collection from the university at Copenhagen, Denmark with two collections from the USA: one at the Woodman Library at Wisconsin-Madison and another at the Dudley Observatory in Loudonville, New York.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We argue that the current academic management paradigm NPM has created a twin monster: A Para-Academic Industry and a Mayhem of Metrics. The hypothesis behind New Public Management is, that the public sector institutions can become effective if run like a private sector company. Efficiency must be measured which is why performance indicators must be established. For this reason, a new industry has emerged. Its commodity is different types of services to academia including data for various researcher performance metrics. This industry has struck gold: Modest costs of production and distribution combined with a loyal and tax-payer funded clientele, who is highly dependent on their commodity: Access to publications and data on publication activities. The data provided by the Para-Academic Industry has on the surface solved one problem since it has enabled u...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Libraries cannot afford to lag behind. It is crucial to keep up with the developments and strengthen our foothold in the research communities. But how do we achieve this? How do we cope with cultural changes? How do we adapt and organise our institutions so that we can face this new and dynamic environment? If these questions sound familiar to you, and you would like to know how others in the field have successfully tackled these issues, this session is relevant for you. Through three presentations, the theme of adapting our libraries, library collections and organisational strategies to the future will be addressed.

Hirsch (2005) created it to measure both the productivity and the citation impact of a researcher&#39;s scholarly publications. The index quickly became one of the most popular indicators among researchers and policymakers since it is a relatively simple measure of research performance. However, a simple measure cannot incorporate the entire complexity of scholarly communication, or of the profile of an academic career. &lt;br&gt;This study differs previous studies examining and discussing the h-index, criticizing its merits, and/or suggesting alternative measures. We accept the existence, and use of the h-index, but are critical towards it being used as an impact indicator on its own. The study focuses on how individual researchers can in principle strategically optimize their own h-index, and on the strategies used by such &quot;high h-index researchers&quot;. The study uses publication data about 75 ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
