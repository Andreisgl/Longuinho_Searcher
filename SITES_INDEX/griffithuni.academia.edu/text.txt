Seymour demonstrates how the independent company utilizes performativity to articulate political and social views and diverse representations of gendered bodies. Through a short case study centring on the provocative performances of founding member Mark Winmill, Seymour discusses ideas of gender performativity, body theory and the notion of &quot;other.&quot; Drawing on concepts from Judith Butler, Peta Tait, and Deleuze and Guattari, this paper aims to provide a small insight into the diverse work that makes up the thriving Australian contemporary circus sector. [i] The Briefs Factory collective uses the term queer to describe their work as openly embracing themes of homosexuality and sexual ambiguity.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
