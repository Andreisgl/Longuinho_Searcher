    The price of knowledge
Shame education and knowledge costs money.  I understand there’s tons of work and upkeep and maintenance expenses yet, those free knowledge bases supply the usual information at a cost of being edited by omission, one sided views etc etc. as a big fan of those old thick hardcover shelf books, of which as a child i would peruse daily through, online isn’t that great of a desire. As curiosity of statue’s and other art gets erased from a young minds view, the books no longer collected , unavailable and dismissed due to online ventures such as social media, games and chatting with strangers, encyclopedias give way to a choice, an hurried, short learning curve, dumbed down populace. The sharing and influence imbued among actual People, other then the criminal minds has long ago become a cloudy opaque afterthought. Best regards Britannica , thank you for the adventures around the world many decades ago. Im still traveling in my imagination. For free.

    Just one note…
I love having access to the Encyclopedia Brittanica on my phone, and the price is very reasonable; but there is one feature that I feel is sorely missing: bookmarking. There are some articles that are so long that I don’t want to read through them in one sitting, and having to go and find the page that I left off on every time I close the app is tedious. I know I can add whole articles to my favorites and that is useful, but it would be nice to be able bookmark individual pages as well. Other than that, I think it’s great that I have such easy access to so much knowledge!

    It is really nice
I have used the encyclopedia Britannica books and before I read the books i used Wikipedia, until my teacher told me that Wikipedia can be edited by people and you don’t even need an account, so after that are used the complete set of Britannica that I bought the books from eBay there from 2004 and I did attempt to read all the books ALL 32 books and I use them for studying for school, but when I’m on the go I actually use this the encyclopedia Britannica app I really love it it’s actually better than Wikipedia, i would use it like Google but I won’t delete Google for this app but I give it a five star rating.
