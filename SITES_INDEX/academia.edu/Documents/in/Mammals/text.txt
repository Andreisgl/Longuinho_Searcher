Species have specific habitat preference that influences their distributions. A study was conducted to determine habitat use and potential habitat of the Himalayan Tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) and Musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) in the Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ). The habitat survey and species presence-absence data was used to establish patterns of species distribution through Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The recognized distribution patterns were used to visualize potential habitat over entire park and buffer zone in a spatially-explicit way by using Geographic Information System (GIS) application. We underline that the outcomes of this study can be useful for habitat management and species conservation.Save to LibraryDownloadby sudeep thakuri•MammalsBehavioral Responses to Mammalian Blood Odor and a Blood Odor Component in Four Species of LargeOnly little is known about whether single volatile compounds are as efficient in eliciting behavioral responses in animals as the whole complex mixture of a behaviorally relevant odor.

Recent studies analysing the composition of volatiles in mammalian blood, an important prey-associated odor stimulus for predators, found the odorant trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal to evoke a typical ‘‘metallic, blood-like’ ’ odor quality in humans. We therefore assessed the behavior of captive Asian wild dogs (Cuon alpinus), African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), South American bush dogs (Speothos venaticus), and Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) when presented with wooden logs that were impregnated either with mammalian blood or with the blood odor component trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, and compared it to their behavior towards a fruity odor (iso-pentyl acetate) and a near-odorless solvent (diethyl phthalate) as control.

Each subunit contains three N-terminal domains, the β-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyl transferase and dehydrase separated by a structural core from four C-terminal domains, the enoyl reductase, β-ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein and thiosterase. The kinetics and specificities of the substrate loading reaction catalyzed by the malonyl/acetyl transferase, the condensation reaction catalyzed by β-ketoacyl synthase and chain-terminating reaction catalyzed by the thioesterase ensure that intermediates do not leak off the enzyme, saturated chains exclusively are elongated and palmitate is released as the major product. Only in the fatty acid synthase dimer do the subunits adopt conformations that facilitate productive coupling of the individual reactions for fatty acid synthesis at the two acyl carrier protein centers. Introduction of a double tagging and dual affinity chromatographic procedure has permitted the engineering and isolation of heterodimeric fatty acid synthases carrying different mutations on each subunit. Characterization of these heterodimers, by activity assays and chemical cross-linking, has been exploited to map the functional topology of the protein. The results reveal that the two acyl carrier protein domains engage in substrate loading and condensation reactions catalyzed by the malonyl/acetyl transferase and β-ketoacyl synthase domains of either subunit. In contrast, the reactions involved in processing of the β-carbon atom, following each chain elongation step, together with the release of palmitate, are catalyzed by the cooperation of the acyl carrier protein with catalytic domains of the same subunit. These findings suggest a revised model for the fatty acid synthase in which the two polypeptides are oriented such that head-to-tail contacts are formed both between and within subunits.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrzej Witkowski•  12  Kinetics, Mammals, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Protein Structure and FunctionDosage compensation in mammals: fine-tuning the expression of the X chromosomeSave to LibraryDownloadby Edith Heard•  15  Genomic Imprinting, Mammals, Biological Sciences, SpermatogenesisUltraviolet Vision and Avoidance of Power Lines in Birds and MammalsSave to LibraryDownloadby Chris  Hogg•  9  Conservation Biology, Visual perception, Mammals, Biological SciencesOn the scaling of mammalian long bonesSave to LibraryDownloadby Jafferson Da Silva•  9  Mammals, Biological Sciences, Animals, Muscle ForceFirst confirmed record of the Striped Hog-nosed Skunk Conepatus semistriatus from peri-urban Bogotá, ColombiaThe Striped Hog-nosed Skunk Conepatus semistriatus is widespread Neotropical carnivore species, with a disjunct distribution from Mexico to Brazil.

Poorly known across its range, in Colombia the species is mostly known only from scarce and sporadic records, but with no information for most aspects of its ecology or conservation status. Here we present the first record of the species for a peri-urban area of Bogotá, capital city of Colombia. Our record is the first for a large city across its range, located outside previous range estimates and confirming its presence for the tutelar mountains of the city. Although this record does not expand significantly the range of the species, it represents an important addition to the fauna of Bogotá, highlighting the importance of improving conservation measures for this important forest patch, and thus ecological integrity, in one of the largest cities in the Neotropics.Save to LibraryDownloadby José F.

A comparison between the lamprey and mammalian basal ganglia establishes a detailed similarity regarding its input from cortex/pallium and thalamus, as well as its intrinsic organisation and projections of the output nuclei. This means that the basal ganglia circuits now present in rodents and primates most likely had evolved already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution. This includes the &#39;direct pathway&#39; with striatal projection neurons (SPNs) expressing dopamine D1 receptors, which act to inhibit the tonically active GABAergic output neurons in globus pallidus interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata that at rest keep the brainstem motor centres under tonic inhibition.

At the molecular level, in both the SCN and peripheral oscillators, the circadian clock mechanism is built from interconnected feedback loops in gene expression that operate in a cell-autonomous and self-sustained fashion. The SCN clock is mainly entrained by light/dark cycles. By contrast, peripheral oscillators can be strongly affected by daily feeding cycles, which have little effect on the phase of the SCN. However, when feeding schedules are coupled with a caloric restriction, behavioural and physiological circadian rhythms and gene expression in the SCN are shifted and/or entrained to meal-time. Moreover, the reward and motivational value of food can also be a potent synchroniser for the SCN clock. This suggests that energy metabolism and motivational properties of food can influence the clock mechanism of the SCN. Food-related cues may entrain clock genes of the SCN with a direct effect, or be mediated indirectly by another neural or peripheral site. In addition, there may be one or more oscillator sites that would play an integral role as a food-entrained oscillator (FEO), responsible for anticipation of meal-time. The site housing, or the network underlying, this putative FEO is still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarise our current knowledge of the central and peripheral circadian clocks and how they can be entrained by feeding at the physiological and molecular levels.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jorge Mendoza•  19  Neuroendocrinology, Mammals, Motivation, RewardEvolutionary divergence of the reptilian and the mammalian brains: considerations on connectivity and developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Miguel Concha•  12  Cognitive Science, Mammals, Brain, HumansModels of amino acid substitution and applications to mitochondrial protein evolutionSave to LibraryDownloadby Ziheng Yang•  23  Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Molecular Evolution, MitochondriaGut microbiota and kin recognitionSave to LibraryDownloadby Anne Lizé•  10  Animal communication, Mammals, Hymenoptera, Biological SciencesStable carbon isotopes in exhaled breath as tracers for dietary information in birds and mammalsSave to LibraryDownloadby Leonie Baier•  15  Carbon, Diet, Chiroptera, Energy MetabolismA quantitative review of the horse genus Equus from South AmericaSave to LibraryDownloadby José Luis  Prado•  6  Systematics (Taxonomy), Paleontology, Vertebrate Paleontology, MammalsComet assay to determine genetic damage by the use of ivermectin in zebu cows (Bos taurus indicusObjective.

The objective of the work was evaluate the damage genetic caused by the use of ivermectin (IVM) in cows zebu to concentrations of 1% and 3.15% through the test comet. Material and methods. 15 cows, were taken with age between 3 and 4 years old, average weight of 350 kg, body condition between 3 and 3.5. Three experimental groups with five animals per group, which were exposed to the concentration of IVM to 1% to 3.15% more group control (without application of IVM) were used. Animal blood sample was performed by venipuncture jugular or medial flow with vacutainer ® needle, extracting 8 ml of blood. The blood samples it was collected at 9, 18 and 27 days post-treatment. Results. The display of the comets is made by using fluorescence microscope, the cells were evaluated by means of visual log and the Comet image software. Evidenced the presence of nuclei with DNA migration in all analyzed plates. The values of classification of comets indicate cells with high levels of damage (grade 3: cells with high damage). The rate of DNA damage of the treatment to 1% to 3.15% was significant, to relate to the control group. Conclusions. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the likely genotoxic potential of the use of IVM in cattle.Save to LibraryDownloadby Revista MVZ Córdoba•  4  Mammals, Drug, ADN, Genetic DamageGuia de mamíferos não voadores do Jardim Botânico de Brasília, DFhttp://jbb.ibict.br//handle/1/1324 O Jardim Botânico de Brasília (JBB) é uma unidade de conservação de Brasília, DF, localizada na área central do Brasil, criada para preservar parte do bioma Cerrado.

É constituída por um mosaico de fisionomias vegetais e variações de ambientes, incluindo três categorias de formações fitofisionômicas: florestas, savanas e campos. Apresentamos informações sobre a mastofauna, a partir de levantamentos promovidos por servidores e pesquisadores colaboradores do Este Guia apresenta informações sobre a mastofauna, a partir de levantamentos promovidos por servidores e pesquisadores colaboradores do Jardim Botânico de Brasília (JBB) desde 2009, incluindo dados inéditos na literatura. Os registros foram realizados por intermédio da utilização de método direto (captura e visualização do animal), câmeras fotográficas com sensores automáticos e rastreamento de pegadas e fezes. A fauna de mamíferos terrestres para a área do JBB e entorno, é constituída por, pelo menos, 56 espécies, divididas entre: 22 roedores, oito marsupiais, cinco tatus, dois tamanduás, dois primatas, quatro felinos, três canídeos e outras quatro espécies de carnívoros, três veados, o coelho-do-mato e a anta. Essa lista é baseada em registros confiáveis, como espécimes-testemunho para os pequenos mamíferos (roedores e marsupiais) e fotos e registros diretos para as espécies de maior porte (veados, macacos, carnívoros, anta, tatus e tamanduás). Apenas duas das espécies de roedores listadas ainda não têm registro dentro do JBB, mas em regiões limítrofes, sendo provável sua presença e, por isso, são aqui, também, apresentadas. Para cada espécie são fornecidos o nome comum em português, nome científico seguido pelo autor que descreveu a espécie, nome comum em inglês, etimologia do nome científico, status de conservação, distribuição geográfica com mapa, descrição morfológica, comentários sobre a biologia (incluindo, quando possível, dados de dieta, hábitos e reprodução) e bibliografia utilizada. As medidas foram incluídas por ajudarem na identificação do animal. Nem sempre foi possível manter a homogeneidade das informações, uma vez que muitas espécies não são bem conhecidas, e com os constantes avanços taxonômicos, espécies foram revalidadas e não foram ainda avaliadas. O JBB protege em sua área 14 espécies de mamíferos terrestres categorizadas em algum critério de ameaça pelo ICMBio, sendo 10 consideradas “Vulneráveis”, duas “Em Perigo”, e duas “Quase Ameaçadas”, mostrando a importância dessa unidade de conservação na proteção a essas espécies. No JBB os carnívoros possuem o maior número de espécies (5) com algum grau de ameaçada, seguido dos roedores (3), e dos marsupiais, primatas, perissodáctilos, artiodátilos, tatus e tamanduás, cada um com uma espécie ameaçada na área. Esse quadro reforça a importância das unidades de conservação, de todas as categorias, para a manutenção da diversidade.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexandra Bezerra and +1Cibele Bonvicino•  4  Taxonomy, Mammals, Cerrado, Brazilian cerradoGABAergic Neurons in Mammalian Thalamus: A Marker of Thalamic Complexity?Save to LibraryDownloadby Carolina Frassoni•  19  Cognitive Science, Electron Microscopy, Biology, MedicineDiverse plant and animal genetic records from Holocene and Pleistocene sedimentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alan Cooper•  37  Ancient History, Genetics, Soil, ScienceHigh sequence identity between the SRY HMG box from humans and insectivoresSave to LibraryDownloadby Monica Bullejos•  17  Genetics, Transcription Factors, Mammals, HumansEntanglements of marine mammals and seabirds in central California and the north-west coast of the United States 2001–2005Save to LibraryDownloadby Derek Lee•  14  Fisheries, MARINE POLLUTION, Multidisciplinary, MammalsCongruence of Morphological and Molecular PhylogeniesSave to LibraryDownloadby Davide Pisani•  11  Molecular Evolution, Mammals, Biological Sciences, Decision TreesContamination of local wildlife following a fire at a polychlorinated biphenyls warehouse in St Basile le Grand, Quebec, CanadaSave to LibraryDownloadby Jean Rodrigue and +1Jean-Luc Desgranges•  16  Invertebrates, Archives, Polymers, MultidisciplinaryAssays for Ribosomal RNA Processing and Ribosome AssemblySave to LibraryDownloadby Lester F Lau•  11  M Rna Processing, Mammals, Humans, AnimalsTorque patterns of the limbs of small therian mammals during locomotion on flat ground.

In this study, we offer a description of the karyotype of a female specimen of C. brevicauda, collected at 1,647 m in the locality of Chachagüi, in the Colombian Andes. The karyotype was obtained from bone marrow and conventional staining with Giemsa. We describe the chromosomal number, fundamental number and the karyotypic pattern. We compared the karyotype with others proposed for the species and several closely related species. This study increased the number of karyotypes reported for Colombian populations of C. brevicauda. The karyotype of C. brevicauda described in this paper agrees with karyotypes of other populations with 2n = 20 and FN = 36. The karyotypic pattern includes one sexual pair, two subtelocentrics pairs, two submetacentrics pairs and five metacentrics pairs. The pattern recorded herein is different to other reported for the species and the genus. The descriptions of variations in chromosomal morphology in C. brevicauda are incomplete, but it is possible that the different karyotypic patterns are indicators of polymorphism within the genus. Other studies are necessary to describe the yet undescribed karyotypes of C. manu and C. monohernandezi and to obtain additional evidence for the phylogenetic reconstructions of Carollia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elkin A.

This review focuses on the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) and reports on its presence in the female reproductive tract of species with different reproductive strategies, that is, viviparity, oviparity, and ovuliparity. Unlike oviparity and viviparity, ovuliparity does not involve any contact between paternal-derived fetal antigens and maternal tissues, because eggs are released unfertilized in the external environment. Therefore, we consider ovuliparity a natural negative control for mechanisms of materno-fetal immunotolerance. The goal of this review is to discuss the role of the IL-1 system in the acquisition of the ability to retain the embryo in the female genital tract during the transition from ovuliparity to viviparity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Silke Jantra•  12  Evolutionary Biology, Zoology, Reproduction, Language evolution and developmentThe Role of the MAGUK Protein CASK in Neural Development and Synaptic FunctionCASK, which belongs to the family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins, is recognized as a multidomain scaffolding protein highly expressed in the mammalian nervous system.

MAGUK proteins generally target to neuronal synapses and regulate trafficking, targeting, and signaling of ion channels. However, CASK is a unique MAGUK protein in several respects. It not only plays a role in synaptic protein targeting but also contributes to neural development and regulation of gene expression. Several CASK-interacting proteins have been identified from yeast two-hybrid screening and biochemical isolation. These proteins, whose interactions with CASK are reviewed here, include the Parkinson’s disease molecule parkin, the adhesion molecule neurexin, syndecans, calcium channel proteins, the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Mint1, Veli/mLIN-7/MALS, SAP97, caskin and CIP98, transcription factor Tbr-1, and nucleosome assembly protein CINAP. More important, CASK may form different complexes with different binding partners and perform different functions. Among these interactions, CASK, Tbr-1, and CINAP can form a transcriptional complex regulating gene expression. Reelin and NMDAR subunit 2b (NR2b) genes have been identified as Tbr-1 target genes. Reelin is critical for neural development. NR2b is an important subunit of NMDAR, which plays important roles in neural function and neurological diseases. Regulation of reelin and NR2b expression suggests the potential roles of the Tbr-1-CASK-CINAP complex in neural activity, development, and disease. The functions of these CASK protein complexes are also discussed in detail in this review.Save to LibraryDownloadby Current Medicinal  Chemistry•  16  Molecular Biology, Protein, Neural Networks, Neural NetworkWasbeer Procyon lotorThe raccoon (Procyon lotor) is native to North and Central America.

The first raccoons in the Netherlands escaped from fur farms. From the 1960s onwards, there have also been reports of raccoons crossing into the Netherlands from Germany. Most sightings during the most recent period covered by this atlas are from the part of the Netherlands north of the large rivers Rhine, Meuse and Waal. In a typical year, no more than a couple of animals are observed. These may be either raccoons escaped from fur farms or vagrants entering from Germany. The steady increase of the latter suggests chat a permanent population will be established in the Netherlands in the coming decades.Save to LibraryDownloadby Reinier W Akkermans•  3  Zoology, Mammals, RaccoonsPhotography-based taxonomy is inadequate, unnecessary, and potentially harmful for biological sciencesThe question whether taxonomic descriptions naming new animal species without type specimen(s) deposited in collections should be accepted for publication by scientific journals and allowed by the Code has already been discussed in... moreThe question whether taxonomic descriptions naming new animal species without type specimen(s) deposited in collections should be accepted for publication by scientific journals and allowed by the Code has already been discussed in Zootaxa (Dubois & Nemésio 2007; Donegan 2008, 2009; Nemésio 2009a–b; Dubois 2009; Gentile & Snell 2009; Minelli 2009; Cianferoni & Bartolozzi 2016; Amorim et al. 2016).
