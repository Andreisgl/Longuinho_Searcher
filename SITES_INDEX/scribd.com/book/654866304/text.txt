If you do nothing, nothing will happen. If you do something, something may happen. Here's how to do "something" so you won't keep on getting what you're getting!Raymon Grace, mountain man, dowser, healer, and font of folk wisdom, has written a book filled with down-home stories of what happens when real people use their personal power to heal themselves and take charge of their lives. Included here are stories of spontaneous healings, space clearing, the amazing powers of the pendulum, dowsing, energy raising, exorcism, and tapping into the power of spirit guides. Grace inspires readers to imagine the seemingly impossible, to harness the power of the mind, and to open themselves to a world of endless possibilities.You don't need academic degrees, expensive equipment, or spiritual credentials. All you need is a willingness to learn the simple principles and put the techniques to use. This book shows you how to change your life.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextPersonal GrowthBody, Mind, & SpiritLanguageEnglishPublisherOpen Road Integrated MediaRelease dateFeb 1, 2014ISBN9781612833231Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to The Future Is YoursRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextLeave the Body Behind— Sojourns of the SoulEbookLeave the Body Behind— Sojourns of the SoulbyDavid KnightRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Leave the Body Behind— Sojourns of the Soul for laterHealing through love: Heal yourself and others with Anahata HealingEbookHealing through love: Heal yourself and others with Anahata HealingbyUlrich RathgeberRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Healing through love: Heal yourself and others with Anahata Healing for laterThe Reluctant Intuitive: A Soulful Confession and Practical GuideEbookThe Reluctant Intuitive: A Soulful Confession and Practical GuidebyDr. Tatiana H.

It may not be eloquent, and the Queen's English may be butchered severely. No apologies are made. It is written with the encouragement of my many friends whose names would fill the book, some in this life and some who have crossed over. The purpose of this book is to get you, the reader, to think, to imagine what you could do if you had more mental abilities. Next is to convince you that you do have these abilities, you just have to cultivate and learn how to use them. With these abilities comes the responsibility to use what you have in a respectful manner to improve your life, your family, and your community. These abilities can also be used to heal the Earth and our environment, of which we are a product. If the Earth is sick, and we are part of the Earth, then can we be totally well? It is the accumulation of stories, information, and experiences gathered on the path of life, a path that has led to many places and has been shared with interesting people. Among these people are some who are well known and some who are equally important, but not so well known. We are all the sum total of our heritage and environment. We may be stuck with our heritage, but we can change our environment. We can do this by bringing into our environment the people with characteristics and knowledge that we would like for ourselves. Among those who have enriched my environment and deserve appreciation are Bill and Winnie Askin, Harold McCoy, Rolling Thunder, Chief Two Trees, Jose Silva, Evelyn Rattray, Walt Woods, Tom Brown, Jr., and a number of others. It is the knowledge of these people and of the spirit world that, if properly used, can help us change the energy around us and thereby our future. Special thanks go to Jack Kestner, who first wrote about the work we do and was the motivation to transform me from a backwoods mountain man into a backwoods international speaker. Thanks also to Suzanne Cole, who edited the first edition of this book and was responsible for my advanced dowsing manual, Techniques That Work for Me. This edition is 50 percent larger than the original book. My brother, David; his wife, Leslie; and my wife, Nancy, have been most helpful with their suggestions in putting this book together. I doubt that it could have been finished without them. Several people have written stories and letters telling how they have been helped by the information you will find within these pages. Their stories are recorded as they wrote them. I hope this will give you, the reader, the encouragement to realize: The future really is yours—and you can do something about it! 1 Learning the Basics Sally was telling me about her new job as office manager and the problems that came with it. One employee in particular, Alice, had gone out of her way to be disagreeable and turn other employees against Sally. Morale and cooperation were low and conditions defied management. Sally and I hadn't gotten together in a while, but we had been friends for a long time and this was an opportunity to do her a favor. Sally, I said, I've learned a few things since we visited the last time, and if you like, we'll see what we can do about your office. She agreed, and I began using a method to get the information needed to correct the problem. It only took a few minutes and as I relayed the information to her, she nodded her head in agreement. The place was a disaster—low motivation, something draining everyone's energy, ill will—the list went on and on. It took a while longer to make the corrections. Then I asked Sally how long it would be before she had a chance to get the office staff together. This Thursday we have a staff meeting, and that is only two days away! she exclaimed. Will you let me know how it goes? Sure, she agreed. On Friday she sent an e-mail saying that the level of cooperation and overall energy in the office and staff had changed remarkably. Even Alice had come to her and offered to be more cooperative. A week later, conditions were still improved, making her job easier and more enjoyable. Now, Sally had taken part in some unusual experiences with me before and this was not a great surprise to her. But you folks reading this probably want to know how it happened. After all, affecting office conditions several hundred miles distant is not what most people do for an evening's entertainment. Well, that is one of the things this book is about. I just have to throw in some stories to get your attention. If you can survive the first few pages of technical information, the rest is easy. Once you learn the basics, everything else is just another technique. You Can Perform Miracles Now, folks, this book is about many things, but foremost is self-empowerment. Many examples are given here to encourage you, and to illustrate what can be done. Most of these examples are written in the words of those who actually accomplished these feats. They, for the most part, are people like you. They didn't have all the answers any more than you and I do. They just believed in themselves enough to do something. The bottom line is this: If you can relax your body and mind enough to focus your thoughts, and use vivid visualization, you can perform miracles. Now, don't complicate it. So many people miss the whole picture because it is so simple. I'll say it again: If you can relax your body and mind enough to focus your thoughts, and use vivid visualization, you can perform miracles. We live in a world that wants to complicate everything. Lecturers and writers use big words and complicated terms to make themselves appear superior. I know for a fact that some speakers dangle a tidbit of information in front of the audience and then withhold the rest of the information. This appears to give the speaker a sense of superiority. My goal is to present this information in a manner that can be understood by anyone of average intelligence. You will not need a dictionary to read this book, because I never use a long word if a short one will do the job. The basic idea is this: The future is composed of thoughts not yet materialized. We have the choice to create our future or let it be created by our indecision. We have created our present by our thoughts, decisions, and actions, or by their absence. By the same method, or lack of it, we create our future. We have a choice of which future we create. There are probably infinite possible futures for us, all dependent upon our thoughts and actions. If there is one single message for people who attend my classes, it is this. You are not just victims of the elements and politicians. You have a choice, but having a choice is of little benefit unless you exercise it! At each speaking opportunity, I make a statement that is in most part quoted from my friend Chief Two Trees. It goes like this: People have given their health to their doctor, their money to their banker, their soul to their preacher or priest, their children to the school system, and in so doing, have lost the power to control their lives. After the applause dies down, it is followed by this: People buy things they don't need, at prices they can't afford, with money they don't have, to impress someone who doesn't give a damn. The Power of Thought OK, now that we know we have a choice in creating our future, how do we go about it? Well, first we have to learn how to think and to add power to our thoughts. Thoughts are the first step of creativity. Probably most people's thoughts are so scattered and at the wrong brain frequency that they don't really amount to much outside their own mind and body. Under stress, the brain frequency speeds up and this causes the thoughts to lose power. It also causes the immune system to weaken, thereby making one more vulnerable to disease and germs. It is common knowledge that stress isn't all that good for us, and that the opposite of stress is relaxation. Stress also hinders us from focusing our mind, and there is much more power in a focused mind than a scattered mind. My friend Harold McCoy and I speak at most major dowsing societies across the country. Harold, the founder of the Ozark Research Institute, makes a most impressive talk on The Power of a Focused Mind. He has used this power of mind to get the ticks and fleas out of his yard. He has also used it to stop an oil leak in his car, and in thousands of successful healings on people. Let's explain it like this. Everything has a frequency, vibration, beat, or cycle. Pick whichever word you like best. The Earth goes around the sun every 365 days, 6 hours, and a few minutes. The moon goes around the Earth every 28 days. The leaves that fall to the Earth will decay and go back to the Earth, and the tree, if left undisturbed, will go back to the Earth. All things come from the Earth and will return to the Earth. This is a cycle of nature. Our heart has a cycle also; it beats about 70 times a minute. Now this is all understood by everyone. What is not so much understood is that the brain also has a frequency, beat, or cycle. In our normal state during the day, our brain is emitting about 20 beats per second, which is what is called the beta frequency. The brain frequency is separated into four parts. Depending on whose research you choose to believe, the frequencies are something like this. From 0.5 to 3 is called delta, from 4 to 7 is called theta, from 8 to 14 is called alpha, and from 15 up is called beta. According to my information, there is a band of energy around the earth that vibrates at 10 beats per second, and this is the energy in the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid. Some believe the pyramid was built the way it is to create the alpha frequency to allow healing for the pharaoh and his family—exposure to the alpha frequency seems to allow the body to correct a multitude of problems. It also seems possible to be able to create an alpha frequency with our hands. I have heard of a group of Native Americans who would shake their hands over the body of a sick or injured person to create a healing condition. Apparently this method has been around for a while, but not well known. We know from experience that by moving our hands rapidly around the head of a person with a headache, the headache will, in most cases, vanish. This method has been used for many years with great success and in many cases the headaches never return, even after several years. The same method can be applied to other parts of the body. There are two sides of the brain—the right and left hemispheres—and it is believed that only about 10 percent of the population uses both sides of the brain at the same time. This is greatly simplifying it, but the left side is the logical side and the right is the creative side. All children use both sides, which is why children have such vivid imaginations. Think for a moment. Do you still have the imagination that you had as a child? Probably not. Why? Because most people lose their ability to equally use both sides of their brain as the body physically matures. Can you get it back? Yes. How? Stay with me and keep reading. One of the first things we need to do is to learn to reach a more powerful state of mind. If we were able to consciously lower our brain waves, we could improve our immune system and give more power to our thoughts. It would also help us to use both sides of our brain. Imagination So you might ask, what benefit is it to use both sides of our brain? It improves our imagination. And what is the benefit of that? Well, any time we improve our imagination, we improve everything else our mind can do. And how does that work? Everything that exists in the physical world must first exist in the nonphysical world, the spirit world, or thought form. (Pick whichever term you like.) These boots I wear once covered a cow. Someone had to skin the cow and scrape off the hair, tan the hide, cut out the patterns, and sew them into a pair of boots. However, before the cowhide ever became a pair of boots, the thought of the boots had to exist in the bootmaker's mind. Same thing with a pair of jeans. They once were a cotton plant. Someone had to pick the cotton, clean it, process it, spin it into thread, weave it into cloth, cut out the pattern, and sew it into a pair of jeans. First, the thought of jeans had to exist. As was stated earlier, thoughts are the first step of creativity. The more imagination we have, the more possibilities we can think of, and the more solutions we can find to correct problems. Whenever we are able to lower our brain frequency, our awareness improves, as does our hearing. Once I was invited to a house to work with a person who had a headache. The TV was on and I asked for the volume to be lowered. The person put the TV on mute and no sound was heard. However, when I reached a relaxed mental state to begin the healing work, I could hear every word on the TV even though it was still on mute. Try this experiment for yourself. Sit quietly, with your eyes closed and think about something pleasant for a few moments. Then just become aware of the sounds you hear that you hadn't noticed before. The information isn't new; it has been around for a long time. One of my teachers, Tom Brown, who was trained by an old Apache medicine man by the name of Stalking Wolf, was given similar information around 1962. Stalking Wolf didn't call them frequencies, he called them lands. Alpha was the land of the Spirit, theta and delta were lands of the shaman and beta was the land of the living dead. In the shaman training with Tom Brown, I learned how to walk in such a manner as to stay in alpha for indefinite periods of time. It is a level of mind that allows us to be aware of things around us and also those at a distance, and also to be able to receive information not available at the beta level. I do not hear rap music. Why? Because I do not tune my radio to the frequency where it exists; therefore, I do not hear it. Information from the spirit world does not seem to exist in the beta frequencies. We need to reach a lower frequency to tune into this type of information. Achieving Alpha Now this is enough technical stuff. Let's get into how to do it. There are a lot of methods to achieve the same purpose. Most are presented in a far more complicated way than is necessary. Alpha is not some mysterious realm off in another faraway land. It is simply a frequency reached by lowering the brain waves. We do this by relaxing the body and mind. How do we relax the body? By doing something we have been doing all our lives. It's called breathing. What do you do when you are stressed out and something else happens to add to the stress? You probably take a long breath and let out a sigh. Most of us do. It is a natural way of reducing stress. We don't even have to think about it, we just do it. If you were here with me, I would ask you to close your eyes while I take my drum, and with a rapid beat would ask you to take a deep breath and build it up and up and hold it, and then let it go. This is a very deep breath and is released with force. Then you would take a deep and gentle breath and imagine yourself at the beach. Feel the cool water on your feet, the sun on your skin, hear the sound of the waves, smell the water, and feel the difference in the temperature of the water and the rays of the sun. Then you would take a deep breath, and while inhaling, pretend to write in the sand. You could write your name three times, or you could write whatever you like. Then, as you exhale, pretend to have a wave come in and wash out what you have written. Take another deep breath and pretend to write the same thing again two times. Again exhale and pretend to have the wave wash out what you have written. Take another deep breath and pretend to write the same thing again one time. Again exhale and pretend to have a wave wash it out. By taking a deep breath and bringing back the memories of being at the beach and writing and erasing, you are forced to use the right side of your brain. Also, by thinking of something pleasant, you are relaxing your mind. You don't have to use this method. Any method of deep breathing and thinking of something pleasant and using the five senses will work for you. Later on we will discuss how to reach the same level of relaxation by walking a path with flowers and trees. Now isn't that simple? Many people have asked how you know when you are at the alpha level. Good question. No bells will ring, no horns will blow, and there will be no formal announcements made. Just assume that you are there. If you are like a little kid going on a trip who keeps asking, Are we there yet?—you aren't. After a few sessions, you will feel the relaxation and become familiar with the feeling. If this helps any, how many times have you driven some distance not remembering the last few blocks or miles? You were daydreaming, and that takes place at the alpha level. As stated earlier, alpha is not some mysterious realm off in another land, just a state of relaxed body and mind. Don't complicate it! Programming Once you are there, what do you do about it? Program yourself. What does program mean? To program yourself means to plant a suggestion in your mind that will cause you to react in a desired manner in the future. Let's take some real-life examples. I have programmed myself to be aware of any and all danger to myself, family, and friends, and to take the appropriate action to avoid the danger. One morning I was awakened by a dream that seemed significant. After getting up, I used my pendulum to get answers to a few questions like: Does this apply to me? Does it apply to any of my friends? Which one? I was able to determine that an ambush was being set up for one of my friends. By changing the energy of the situation, we were able to avoid the planned ambush. Now you may ask, How do you know it would have happened? All I'm comfortable with putting into print is that in the following twenty-four hours there was sufficient evidence to indicate such a plan had been in place.
