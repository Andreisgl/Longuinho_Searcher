Thomas DreherLudwig-Maximilians-Universität München,  Deutsche Philologie,  Department MemberIntermedia Art+37I studied history of art at LMU and wrote a thesis on "Conceptual Art in America and England between 1963 and 1976" (1988, published in German in 1992). "Performance Art after 1945. Action Theater and Intermedia Art" was sustained by DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and published in German in 2001. My research on the history of art since 1945 is archived on the website "Intermedia Art" (URL: http://dreher.netzliteratur.net/). "IASLonline Lessons in NetArt" presents my research on net art and net conditions (URL: http://iasl.uni-muenchen.de/links/lektion0e.htm). I expanded the subject of this site to Mobile Telephony, Locative Media and Computer Art.less963 Followers761 FollowingTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall46 Papers4 Books6 Talks1 Interviews3 Book ReviewsPapersHistory of Computer ArtIASLonline Lessons in NetArt,  2015The development of the use of computers and software in art from the Fifties to the present is ex... more The development of the use of computers and software in art from the Fifties to the present is explained. As general aspects of the history of computer art an interface model and three dominant modes to use computational processes (generative, modular, hypertextual) are presented. The "History of Computer Art" features examples of early developments in media like cybernetic sculptures, computer graphics and animation (including music videos and demos), video and computer games, reactive installations, virtual reality, evolutionary art and net art. The functions of relevant art works are explained more detailed than usual in such histories.  The German version was completed in December 2012. The last chapter of the English translation was published in June 2014.

New cheap portable video devices (Sony Porta Pak, available in America since 1968) changed that role and allowed the practice of new participatory forms in video art and video activism. The evolution of cheap devices for video production and the expansion of the American cable TV offered new means for the realization of alternative TV programs which integrated viewers as participants. Since the nineties the internet offers video activists new chances for collaborative practices. Activists reacted to the criticism of net conditions and created tools against f. e. data mining and censorship. Different strategies were invented to use video and net tools in actions in the real and digital spaces (January 2004/English translation: June 2004).Published in "IASLonline Lessons in Net Art".

Nearly all contributions to the theme borrow the terms "immersion" and "magic circle" from theories on computer games. These transfers caused contradicting arguments concerning the relations between the gamer´s actions and the playground. A model of interfaces is proposed as an alternative to these contradictions. The 'world-interface' constitutes the bodily and cognitive access of the player to the world. The 'game-interface' is constituted by the access of the participant to the elements creating the game´s conditions: the rules of the game and its technical equipment. The 'game-oriented world-interface' replaces the opposition between reality as playground and the game´s system by the participant´s coordinations between the 'world-interface' and the 'game-interface' in strategies (concepts) and actions (realizations).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Among this group "Lexia to Perplexia" (2000) is an outstanding work. Memmott combines parts of codes as f.e. punctuation marks and neologisms to a hyperfiction programed with DHTML and Javascript. Readers can explore the presentation modes of the ten source codes resp. chapters. The combinations of texts and images reflect relations between users (as "remote bodies"), their screens and networks.

The 13th of the "IASLonline Lessons in NetArt“ (2003) features the projects realised by the Croatian artist since 1997. The main focus points to “Distribution Justice“. Since 2001 the project was developed further from one exhibition to the next. The poll offers alternatives to John Rawls' “Theory of Justice“ and tries to find out the preferences of citizens getting access to it either in museum exhibitions or via the web site. “Distributive Justice“ was extended by a game confronting Americans and Non-Americans in different ways with questions concerning justice.In: URL: http://iasl.uni-muenchen.de/links/lektion13e.htmlSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its contributors try to define the (im-)possibility of authentic experiences of remote and mediated events. They discuss the difference between direct and media-mediated experiences controversially. Goldberg hopes to be able to develop "telematic scenarios“ offering no occasions for doubts about the authenticity of events transmissioned in real time.

"Atlas" is an open project, to which Richter constantly adds new working materials. In 1989, his newspaper clippings (as image templates for works of the sixties) and sketches for installations of his works in exhibition spaces were of great importance, while today they occupy only a small part next to the studies for the late abstract paintings. The perception of the walls with newspaper templates and working sketches is different from that of the many walls with color studies: In the latter case, the gaze glides along the wall presentations, while the newspaper cuttings attract attention to varying degrees and provoke an alternation between close-up and distant views, individual images and spatial impressions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The booklet "Blurting in A & L" is itself part of the art world, whose premises the members of Art & Language criticize in the "Blurts". The relation of sections of the text - the "Blurts" – to each other by means of hypertext enables readers to confront their reading of the relations between the sections with the stated reading of members of the group: The different possibilities offered here by the printed and the web version published in 2002 are presented as refractions of "abductive reading".Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For the ... more Early uses of computers as artistic means and ends date back to the fifties and sixties. For the pioneers of computer art cybernetics, as the were founded in the forties by Norbert Wiener and Clude Elwood Shannon, were a source of inspiration. Simultaneously to the evolution of kinetic art integrating moving parts into the art object a 'cybernetic art'  arose. Its protagonists developed works reacting to input data and interacting with the environment. "Material models" (N. Wiener) of cybernetics were the forerunners of cybernetic sulptures (Nicolas Schöffer) and responsive environments (Gordon Pask). The cybernetic term information and information aesthetics (Max Bense, Abraham Moles) inspired artists to program computer graphics (Georg Nees, Frieder Nake, Herbert Werner Franke).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Intermedia Art´s relations between notation and realisation are expanded by new mutations in relations between readable code and computer processing: Examples of program codes appear as the next step after formalizations of verbal concepts in Dada, Fluxus and Conceptual Art. And on the other hand: These formalized notations can be presented as precursors of Software Art.

Birgit Rinagl and Franz Thalmair selected seven artists for an exhibition with net projects thematising digital monochromy.

The dialog supplements and augments the introduction of the curators for the exhibition White, Yellow, Blue, and Black, one Coincidence, and one Object (September 2010).Published in: Hochrieser, Sabine/Kargl, Michael/Rinagl, Birgit/Thalmair, Franz (ed.): Content Form Im-Material.

Weibel combines this plea with a critique of the “time aristocracy” (“Zeitaristokratie”) keeping alive media created manually although the aristocracy’s  members established digital media and constituted the causes why the handcrafted media became superfluous. In the eighties this argument was an attack on the New Image Painting and the <<Nouveaux Fauves>>/die ”Neuen Wilden”.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
