The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is considered a valid measure of burnout. However, the student version of the MBI (MBI-SS) has received limited empirical support. The aim of this paper is to analyze the factorial validity, invariance, and latent profiles of the Italian version of the MBI-SS in a sample university students. A total of 7757 Italian university students participated in an online cross-sectional survey. Results from explorative and confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable fits for the Italian version of the MBI-SS. In addition, multigroup analyses supported full-metric invariance of MBI-SS within gender and academic level (bachelor vs. master). Finally, results from latent profile analysis showed that a three latent profile model was the better solution for the data: (a) burned-out (high levels of exhaustion, cynicism (CY), and low professional efficacy (PE); n = 2665, 34.2%); (b) overextended (high levels of exhaustion, moderate other, n = 3953, 51.0%); and (c) engaged (moderate exhaustion, low CY, and high PE, n = 1149, 14.8%). The resulting three-profile solution in the present study partially agrees with a prior study as it replicated three of the five-profile solution identified. In sum, we suggest that the MBI-SS is valid and reliable and represents a robust instrument for the measurement of burnout among Italian speaking university students.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Vocational BehaviorAchievement strategies during university studies predict early career burnout and engagement2009 • Asko TolvanenDownload Free PDFView PDFBook of Procedings of the 10th Conference European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology.Well-being at the workplace: the need for a psychological counselling service – an exploratory case study2012 • Serviço de Psicologia  Universidade da Madeira, Carla Vale Lucas, Filipa OliveiraDownload Free PDFView PDF127-publishedtantan balatbatDownload Free PDFView PDFAdvances in Physical EducationAn Explorative Study of Possible Demographic Variables, Sports-Related Sit-uational Variables, and Social Variables as Predictors of Athlete Burnout and Its Core Dimensions among German Non-Elite Endurance Athletes2015 • Heiko  ZiemainzDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE FIVE VALUES OF PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT: INTRODUCING THE VALUE CREATION MODEL FOR ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FRAMEWORK2011 • Claretha HughesAmerican Institute of Higher Education–The 6 th International Conference Charleston, SC–April 6–8, 2011 180 THE FIVE VALUES OF PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT: INTRODUCING THE VALUE CREATION MODEL FOR ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FRAMEWORK Claretha Hughes Human Resource Development University of Arkansas Fayetteville, AR 72701 chbanks@ uark.Download Free PDFView PDFBurnout in competitive and elite athleteskristine YnciertoDownload Free PDFView PDFStudents' sense of coherence, study engagement and self-efficacy in relation to their study and employability satisfaction2012 • Rudolf OosthuizenDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
