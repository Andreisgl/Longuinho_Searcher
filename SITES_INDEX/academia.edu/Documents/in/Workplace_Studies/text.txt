With particular focus on selected teachers in Ogun State, this ex-post facto research examined classroom design and its influence on teachers’ performance in teaching job. A total of 128 participants were randomly selected from 16 secondary schools in Ijebu Ode and 128 questionnaires titled ‘Scale on Classroom Design and Teachers Performance’ (SCDTP) with reliability co-efficient of 0.82 obtained through cronbach alpha method was developed and administered on the target participants. 96 instruments, constituting 75% of the total administered, were however returned and analysed. Simple percentage and Chi-square inferential statistics utilising 0.05 level of significance was adopted in testing the hypotheses.

In an attempt to justify arbitrary positions of power, organizations often portray them as "leadership" positions, deploying corporate doublespeak like "team leaders" or "officers" in their hierarchical arrangement. The problem with this is that leadership, in any true sense, is an absolute contradiction from power; and especially from arbitrary power. The acquisition of money and idleness that becomes synonymous with climbing the ladder makes leadership roles impossible for those who fill these positions to obtain.Save to LibraryDownloadby Colin Jenkins•  12  Organizational Behavior, Organizational Theory, Organizational Culture, AnarchismSmart cities and digital workplace culture in the global European context: Amsterdam, London and ParisUntil recently, knowledge-intensive work activities have predominantly taken place in office buildings as a specialized form of economic infrastructure.

New digital technologies together with an economic and organizational transition from closed firms to open platforms has changed the pattern of work within the modern metropolis. The office building is no longer the sole workplace typology and work activity has intensified in other urban locations. The questions then are: "How might smart cities reinterpret workplace culture at the urban scale outside the framework of office buildings typology?" and "Which tools and methodologies can be used to make digital workplace culture visible at the urban scale?" In order to answer these questions, workplaces are observed not as private architectural spaces but as compositions of "subjective urban experiences". A Twitter data analysis provides evidence of workplace spatial culture within the innovative global cities of Amsterdam, London and Paris, interpreted as behavior settings. This analysis shows that office pattern locations are generally distributed independently to knowledge intensive business services and workplace demand, as expressed through social media analyses. In addition to office buildings, transit hubs, urban amenities and new digital services play a key role in reframing workplace location. Moving beyond generic visions for digital work in outer spaces, big data therefore provides specific insights and incentives for considering workplace design at the urban scale.Save to LibraryDownloadby michelangelo vallicelli•  23  Urban Geography, European Studies, Workplace Studies, Urban StudiesWhy do we need to share information?: Analysis of collaborative task management meetingsIn order to study collaborative information behaviour (e.g. information search, creation, and sharing) in the work environment, it is important that we take into consideration its embedded nature in collaborative work, however not many... moreIn order to study collaborative information behaviour (e.g. information search, creation, and sharing) in the work environment, it is important that we take into consideration its embedded nature in collaborative work, however not many studies have actually taken this into consideration. In conducting fieldwork, we studied group task management in the work of IT product hardware designers. The study shows how understanding the details of information activities embedded in task management allowed us to generate some ideas for transforming task management into a more collaborative activity, and for reembedding task management more thoroughly into their work practices together with the practitioners. The paper discusses how taking an ethnomethodological approach can be fruitful for researchers who want to gain a close understanding of actual collaborative information activities and their embedded nature in work, and how understandings of this kind can be important for developing ideas ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Nozomi Ikeya•  4  Ethnography, Information Behavior, Workplace Studies, EthnomethodologyDes rôles, des paroles, une identité.

This so-called de-ethnicisation of work is formulated in the Malaysian Government’s 10th Malaysia Plan (2011–2015) as an indicator of Malaysian society’s entry into modernity, the overall yardstick being Malaysia’s progression to a high-income nation by 2020. Empirical research was conducted among employees of 10 ‘Western’ luxury five-star hotels in the greater Kuala Lumpur. The degree of association of occupation with ethnicity was tested through a quantitative survey of 786 respondents from a representative sample of the parent population in 2010. Contrary to the Government’s de-ethnicisation agenda, findings show a continuing strong correlation between ethnicity and occupation, reinforced by qualitative research conducted between 2010 and 2011, which reveals specific ethno-marketing practices and an ‘ethnic groupism’ phenomenon as plausible explanations, among other causal factors.Save to LibraryDownloadby Wendy A Smith•  7  Sociology of Work, Hospitality Management, Workplace Studies, EthnicityThe Archive of Workplace Writing Experiences: Using the Voices of Real-world Writers as a Bridge Between the Classroom and the Conference RoomSave to LibraryDownloadby Jessica  McCaughey•  4  Professional Writing, Workplace Studies, Technical Writing, WorkplaceProgress Hindered: The Retention and Advancement of Females in Science, Engineering and Technology Careers (with Lisa J.

However, to date little research exists on how women, especially those in management positions, are performing within these fields. Using data obtained from over 2,493 survey respondents and 28 focus groups, we seek to understand the barriers that hinder the retention and advancement of women in managerial positions in these career fields. Paying particular attention to for-profit science, engineering and technology firms, we argue that there are significant barriers to female retention and advancement within these fields related to the norms of professionalisation, and that from a human resources perspective firms could do a much better job of leveraging the existing female talent pipeline in these occupations. In addition, we highlight the implications of our findings and provide our policy recommendations to address them.Save to LibraryDownloadby M.

As in other fields such as filmmaking, dance creation is based on a cognItive dualism that considers the choreographer as the creative decision-maker, while the dancer is objectified. The dancer’s body is an instrument for exploration of the choreographer’s imagery. We claim that the products of creativity are minute but crucial modifications of transitory stages of a dance rehearsal. On the one hand, attention is given to a dance company as a distributed cognitive system. The choreographer communicates in diverse modalities, which carry specific information, physical as well as symbolic. Through the analysis of an audiovisual and cognitive ethnography with ELAN software we find differences in decision-making patterns across multimodal instructions. On the other hand, we apply Social Network Analysis and UCINET software as a methodological innovation in order to formalize data from observed rehearsal settings. In all, the choice of modalities in the chorographical instruction shapes movement production, which is based on dyads, triads and other forms of creative interaction.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dafne Muntanyola-Saura•  17  Communication, Social Networks, Dance Studies, CreativityGender training manual for company actorsThis manual was developed in the framework of WP3: “Training Seminars for Company Actors/Monitoring and Evaluation of company initiatives on work life balance for women and men” of the “SHARE – Promoting work-life balance in companies and... moreThis manual was developed in the framework of WP3: “Training Seminars for Company Actors/Monitoring and Evaluation of company initiatives on work life balance for women and men” of the “SHARE – Promoting work-life balance in companies and a better sharing of care between men and women” Project. It includes an indicative training programme for company actors in order to promote gender equality initiatives, emphasizing on initiatives that facilitate the reconciliation of work and family / private life. This manual incorporates an approach based on the principles of gender training, as well as on the main principles of adult education. Although this manual is part of the SHARE Project activities, it was designed in such a way, so that can become a useful tool for the design of other similar training programmes, that however may differ in terms of their specific characteristics (e.g. target groups, duration, etc.) to the SHARE Project training programme. After the completion of this training programme, the trainees are expected to have improved their knowledge on gender issues and to have developed skills that will enable them to take initiatives for gender equality in their workplace.The "SHARE" PROJECT is implemented by the General Secretariat for Family Policy and Gender Equality (Coordinator), the Research Centre for Gender Equality (KETHI) and the organization Women On Top.

ISBN: 978-962-367-652-6. As a consequence of frequent changes in employers and workplaces, professionals are often faced with the challenge of having to learn "how to do things" in their new workplaces and "how to become fully integrated members". Learning how to communicate appropriately is an important aspect of this socialisation process (Wenger, 1998). We look at one of the particularly interesting discursive strategies in this context, namely humor. Drawing on more than nine hours of authentic discourse collected in three workplaces in Hong Kong supplemented by over 15 interviews with newcomers, this chapter contributes to research on the role of humor in the socialisation process. In particular, we employ the community of practice framework to illustrate how newcomers in different workplaces actually learn (and at times resist) to use humor appropriately in ways that characterise the discursive repertoire negotiated among members in their new work environment. Findings illustrate that for newcomers, humor is a double-edged sword, which may be an advantage as well as a handicap: it enables them to participate without being fully responsible for the consequences, but it may also exclude them from participation marking them as outsiders. For researchers, however, investigating humor is an excellent way of gaining insights into workplace socialisation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bernie Mak•  4  Humor, Workplace Studies, Socialization, Hong KongInterpersonal interactions, workplace violence, and occupational health outcomes among social workersSummary Primary emphasis within the literature on mechanisms to address the prevalence of negative occupational well-being outcomes among human service workers has tended to focus on individual self-care efforts or organizational level... moreSummaryPrimary emphasis within the literature on mechanisms to address the prevalence of negative occupational well-being outcomes among human service workers has tended to focus on individual self-care efforts or organizational level policies aimed at improving work–life balance. While these are important areas of research, the workplace setting itself can also create negative outcomes, suggesting the need to adapt characteristics of this setting. One aspect of this workplace setting includes the dynamics of interpersonal interaction within the workplace. This study reports a multivariate analysis of the relationship between negative workplace interpersonal interactions (generally defined to provide a more holistic assessment of ways in which violence is manifested in the workplace) between workers and service users and between workers themselves and human service worker occupational outcomes.FindingsIn 2012, data were collected from a sample (n = 674) of human service workers in Alberta, Canada. This study finds a high prevalence of negative workplace interactions between workers, and that these experiences have consequences for worker experience’s with burnout and life satisfaction, and contributes to intentions to leave the workplace. Compounding negative interpersonal interactions between workers are particularly significant across all measured occupational outcomes.ApplicationsThese findings suggest the need for a workplace ‘settings-based’ approach to improve occupational well-being among workers. Utilizing a workplace ‘settings-based’ approach would place more emphasis on the processes and structure of day-to-day work within organizations to help alleviate negative occupational outcomes among workers.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Graham•  8  Social Work, Workplace Studies, Health, Organizational structureTHE ROLE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT AS MEDIATOR BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL AND EMPLOYEE WELL-BEINGPsychological capital (PsyCap) is personal power and autonomy in every person, which is one of the factors that affect an employee's well-being.

PsyCap as the development of positive psychology could strengthen individuals in understanding their competency and enhancing their capabilities, as well as the concept of psychological empowerment. Furthermore, psychological empowerment is also a factor in the employee's well-being; therefore, this study purpose to find out whether the relationship of PsyCap and employee well-being has a role of psychological empowerment as a mediator. The total of respondents is 307 employees in the services company. The analysis technique applied the mediation regression analysis model no. 4 by Hayes. The results showed that the relationship between PsyCap and employee well-being, contained the role of psychological empowerment as a partial mediator. Wherein, PsyCap will have a more significant effect if through psychological empowerment first. This study like dew in the desert where this study seeks to cover the gap in previous research and, especially for psychology literature regarding these three variables.Save to LibraryDownloadby laila wardani and +1Aam Amalia•  12  Social Psychology, Subjective Well-Being, Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Workplace StudiesReligion and religious discrimination in the French workplace: Increasing tensions, heated debates, perceptions of labour unionists and pragmatic best practicesThe visibility of religious identities in workplaces has become a recurrent topic of certain public debates and tensions in France.

It is generally the visibility of Muslim identities and practices of Islam that are at the centre of these tensions. This article shows in the context of French republican laïcité that religious issues are considered as private issues that should not play out openly in the workplace, which is considered to have a more public character. With a focus on the French labour law framework and religious discrimination issues, interviews with elected politicians, religious leaders, unionists, representatives of civil society organisations and legal experts show that religious discrimination in the French workplace is a more complex phenomenon than it seems. Discrimination of religious employees, in a direct or indirect manner, happens more often than is officially reported in France. Many respondents suggested that a great deal of religious discrimination is, at best, reframed as ethnicity-based or gender-based discrimination. The article also discusses some recent examples of businesses that treat the issue of religious diversity in the French workplace in a more pragmatic manner, opening up more possibilities for reasonable accommodation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Franck FREGOSI and +1Deniz KOSULU•  20  Sociology, Political Sociology, Sociology of Religion, MulticulturalismMusic and Sound at WorkThis is an edited, expanded and reshuffled version of my framing remarks for the two panels of the stream “Music and Sound at Work”, which I convened at the London Conference in Critical Thought, University College London, in June 2015.... moreThis is an edited, expanded and reshuffled version of my framing remarks for the two panels of the stream “Music and Sound at Work”, which I convened at the London Conference in Critical Thought, University College London, in June 2015.

An attempt was made to identify factors of the built space that most significantly influence how work activities are undertaken, based on theevaluation of the space of a government management audit and accounting department. The evaluation was made over two steps: before and after alterations made to the space, which allowed a comparison to be made between the adaptability of the spaces and the activities. The methodological procedureapplied in this study allowed an analysis that set out to identify the interactions between the variables of the built environment and how the activities were undertaken.

The workplace is considered to be a strategic tool in influencing the performance of employees and realizing business goals, that is why organizations are beginning to use the workplace to realize their corporate goals. The role of Facility managers in workplace management is beginning to grow into adding value to the organization hence placing FM in a more strategic position in organization. Workplace strategies are used by organizations to make sure that the work processes are aligned with the workplace to enable peak performance. This Master thesis deals with how workplace strategies can be used as a tool to positively influence the performance of employees. It explains how workplace management strategies and innovation can generate added value to an organization, hence increasing employee performance. This research adopts a qualitative approach in gathering data which resulted in conducting 11 semi-structured interviews with Inhouse Facility/Workplace managers and Consultants from around the world. The outcome of this paper gives insights on how facility managers can add value to their organizations through workplace management, to outline a detailed process of how to develop a workplace strategy, stating out the elements and benefits of a workplace management, and finally the positive impact of workplace strategies on employee performance. These findings are adequate only for knowledge intensive organizations because the interviews were conducted with participants from knowledge-based industries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adegoke Oyewo•  4  Real Estate, Workplace Studies, Workplace Management, Space Layout PlanningGender differences in impression management in organizations: A qualitative reviewSave to LibraryDownloadby Rosanna Guadagno and +1Robert Cialdini•  5  Organizational Behavior, Workplace Studies, Gender Roles, Impression ManagementDefining a Culture: The Paradigm Shift Toward a Collective EconomySave to LibraryDownloadby Christine Kenline•  12  Collective Behavior, Creativity, Innovation statistics, Group CreativityContract feudalism: A critique of employer power over employeesSave to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Carson•  6  Industrial And Labor Relations, Class, Workplace Studies, Work and LabourThe Problem With “Problems”: The Case of Openings in Optometry ConsultationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Will Gibson•  7  Sociology, Optometry, Conversation Analysis, Organization StudiesErgonomics in the garment industrySave to LibraryDownloadby Gordana Čolović•  6  Organizational Behavior, Ergonomics, Workplace Studies, Work and LabourEl terreno de la guerra de clasesPara quienes no lo conocen, Kim Moody es un activista e intelectual norteamericano de izquierda que nos tiene acos-tumbradas a reflexiones "no convencionales" sobre la clase obrera y sus posibles estrategias políticas.

Así fue, cuando en la segunda mitad de la década del '90, irrumpió con la pro-puesta de un "sindicalismo de movimiento social" que, si bien tiene muchos puntos problemáticos que he tratado de plantear en otro artículo 1 , tuvo la virtud de ser una crítica furibunda al sindicalismo corporativo y su lógica de acepta-ción de las fragmentaciones obreras que la burguesía con-quistó post década del '80. Veinte años después, Kim Moody vuelve a irrumpir en el cielo (ni sereno ni agitado) de los debates sobre las estrategias de la clase obrera, para darnos un libro que considero de lectura obligatoria para militan-tes de izquierda y también para la academia. On New Terrain tiene un subtítulo que anticipa sobre qué va la cosa: How Capital is Reshaping the Battleground of Class War (cómo el capital está remodelando el campo de batalla de la gue-rra de clases). Sencillo y al pie, el libro analiza las transfor-maciones en las reglas del juego de una guerra: la de clases. Al hacerlo, no se conforma con un análisis sociológico (que es indispensable y está, por cierto, muy fundamentado), si-no que entra también al debate de estrategias y, para ello, se toma el trabajo de argumentar, pacientemente, porqué cualquier estrategia (¿la del Democratic Socialists of Amé-rica-DSA-?) de querer "izquierdizar" al Partido Demócrata (PD), conduce inevitablemente a la derrota. Pero algo más: este recorrido está hecho a partir de un posicionamiento ex-preso en el marxismo como referencia ineludible en la que Moody se sitúa. En este artículo rescataré lo que conside-ro los principales argumentos, tanto del análisis sociológi-co como del estratégico, con el objetivo de entusiasmar a les lectores con este libro que pone el foco, ni más ni me-nos, que en la principal potencia mundial: Estados Unidos. ¿Precariedad? Sí (pero no a costa de licuar la clase obrera) Uno de los principales temas entre los que analizan la clase obrera (académicos pero también militantes), es el de la pre-carización laboral como marca propia del neoliberalismo. El terreno de la guerra de clases Por Paula Varela (Politóloga, UBA) Por donde se mire, la precarización se ha profundizado en los últimos 25 años, aunque con tiempos desiguales entre los países dependientes y los imperialistas. Esta evidencia empírica, y su condición de "normalidad" para los sectores jóvenes, ha abierto un debate acerca de si tal modificación de la composición y dinámica de la clase obrera implica la constitución de una nueva clase (o no). Uno de los libros más conocidos que sostienen la tesis del surgimiento de una "nueva clase social" es The Precariat de Guy Standing. Co-mo puede imaginarse, la discusión no se reduce a una cues-tión clasificatoria sino que implica todo un debate acerca de dos problemas centrales para cualquiera que se reivindique anticapitalista (y Moody se cuenta entre ellos): el problema de cuál es el sujeto del cambio social (o el sujeto revolucio-nario para decirlo en términos del marxismo) e, indisociable de lo anterior, cuál es la estrategia. En Argentina, hay un di-rigente político que, podríamos decir, es "standiniano". Juan Grabois toma el título de su libro "La clase peligrosa" de es-ta conceptualización de Standing y también toma, aunque peronizándola bastante, la estrategia política de la "renta universal", ya no como modo de terminar con el precaria-do, sino de que éste no se vuelva explosivo. No voy a criti-car aquí el libro de Juan Grabois, porque ya lo he hecho en un artículo anterior de Ideas de Izquierda 2. Pero sí quiero destacar que, cuando Kim Moody critica ciertas lecturas de moda sobre la precarización, está también definiendo cuál es sujeto al que hay que apostar. En la primera parte del libro (The Remaking of the US Working Class), Moody realiza una descripción detallada (basada en buena medida en datos estadísticos de EE. UU.) sobre las mutaciones sufridas por la clase obrera norteame-ricana desde los '70 hasta la actualidad. Lejos de negar la precarización laboral como parte de estos cambios, el argu-mento consiste en destacar y poner en primer plano que la principal modificación de la clase obrera norteamericana ha sido la brutal caída de su salario real y, con él, de su nivel de vida. Como contraparte de este proceso, Moody destaca el aumento de las ganancias empresarias y la concentración capitalista en cada vez menos manos. En la página 33, pue-de encontrarse una tabla que muestra la relación entre sala-rios y ganancias desde 1975 hasta 2011, haciéndose visible A propósito del libro de Kim Moody On new terrain.Save to LibraryDownloadby paula varela•  13  Marxism, Workplace Studies, Capitalism, Marxist theoryLines Of Work: Stories of Jobs and Resistance (Review)Review of 'Lines of Work: Stories of Jobs and Resistance', by Scott Nikolas Nappalos, ed.

This preliminary exploration adopted a qualitative approach. Two individual face-to-face and semi-structured interviews were conducted, and thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The interviewees showed very little knowledge about workplace counseling, but had concerned about confidentiality and workplace counselors’ independency and neutrality.  Furthermore, they preferred workplace counselors to be well familiar with internal operations, business management and organizational culture. This study suggests that workplace counseling at a strategic level may play a pioneer role for developing caring organizational culture. Further, it spells out the interaction of workplace counseling and healthy workplace. The discussion may enrich publicawareness about how counseling at work can help both staff and organizational development to cope with workplace challenges and life difficulties. The study also discussed on workplace counseling and work-life-balance that may contribute to not only healthy workplace but also a healthy society.Save to LibraryDownloadby 鄭鳳姬 Fung Kei, Oasis Cheng•  8  Psychotherapy and Counseling, Workplace Spirituality, Workplace Studies, Qualitative ResearchClassroom Design and Teachers’ Performance in Selected Secondary Schools in Ogun State, NigeriaSave to LibraryDownloadby Oludeyi Olukunle Saheed•  6  Education, Ergonomics, Workplace Studies, Work and LabourA cultural approach to small talk: A double-edged sword of sociocultural reality during socialization into the workplaceMak, B.

A cultural approach to small talk: A double-edged sword of socio-cultural reality during socialization into the workplace. Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 8(2), 118-133. ISSN: 1744-7143. (Indexed in ESCI, Clarivate Analytics) People transitioning into a workplace usually face the challenge of socializing into their working communities. While small talk is one domain in the process, small talk itself is influenced by ethnicity of participants and norms of the workplace. We present a case study of how a newcomer transitioning toward integral status interacts with small talk in her new workplace. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the discourse of small talk collected from a new expatriate from Philippines, Anna, and her new colleagues in a Hong Kong firm. The analysis illustrates how their small talk is implicitly associated with Filipino core values, Hong Kong social customs, and the local organizational culture. Owing to discrepancies and similarities, small talk can be both a hurdle and an instrument during Anna's socialization. The findings suggest small talk can be an indicator of in/appropriate behavior and un/successful socialization. It can be used for newcomers' development of rapport; it can be used by integral members to mold newcomers into the workplace. Nonetheless, since small talk is not a universal behavior, any attempts can be counterproductive due to various cultural matters. We argue that small talk can be seen as a double-edged sword of socio-cultural reality in workplace socialization.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bernie Mak•  6  Intercultural Communication, Workplace Studies, Socialization, Hong KongWorkplace Dignity Scale ItemsScale items for article:Thomas, B., & Lucas, K.

Songs, for a long time, helped people synchronise their movements and made the day go quicker. In the 1930s, recorded music was often used in factories to improve productivity and reduce boredom and fatigue. Today, technology has made it easier to listen to your own music at work. Many employees have access to music through mp3 players, smartphones and via the internet, and can make choices about what to listen tothat previously would not have been possible.Based on Dr Anneli Haake's PhD research at the University of Sheffield, totaljobs created ‘The Sound of Productivity’, a tool meant to encourage people to discover if music could boost their productivity at work. After assessing their personality, taste and work environment through the tool, users learn whether listening to music could help or hinder their productivity and what factors have an impact on their focus. The findings demonstrate that the majority of people (79%) would benefit from listening to music at work, and that some workspaces tend to hinder people’s productivity.However, not all professions and sectors allow for music listening.

A common means of managing this diversity is to introduce language policies that often privilege English or the locally dominant language(s). In contrast, managing their everyday working lives may require employees to draw on a range of multilingual and non-verbal resources. Such tensions between policy and practice in multilingual workplaces may impact structures and processes of inequality and power in the workplace. By looking at two sites within logistics and construction, this article offers a critical look at multilingual policies and practices and their consequences for speakers within the workplace. The article investigates how language is conceptualised in language policies and enacted in language practice. From this point of departure we discuss how the tensions between policies and practices impact on the daily working life and professional opportunities of the workers. Our findings suggest that even though multilingual practices are crucial for the flow of everyday work interactions on the floor, the language requirements within the workplace mirror the repertoires and practices of high-status employees, and therefore their competence is valued more highly than the more multilingual repertoires of their subordinates. A consequence of this unequal valorisation of the different linguistic repertoires is the maintenance of existing hierarchies in the workplace and the creation of new ones.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dorte  Lønsmann and +1Kamilla Kraft•  6  Multilingualism, Workplace Studies, Work and Labour, Language PolicyEmpowering and disempowering meeting styles: understanding the cultural logics of meetings and assembliesThis paper identifies six elementary interactional constraints in face-to-face meetings: frames, sequential relevance, face, status, physical boundaries, and temporal boundaries.

It argues that these constraints are not absolute but subject to cultural interpretation and modification in practice, thus giving rise to numerous meeting styles. Each of these meeting styles can be analytically understood as a set of regimes which determine to what degree and in what way the elementary constraints will be effective in the actual meeting as it takes place. These meeting styles are then examined with regard to the question of empowerment: How can we understand that some meetings are experienced as energizing and empowering while others seem to be fruitless and disempowering? Based on the inherent logic of the different meeting regimes, the paper identifies three contrasting styles: disempowerment, inclusive empowerment, and exclusive empowerment and exposes the mechanisms that account for these effects.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christoph Haug•  7  Social Movements, Workplace Studies, Meetings, Community EmpowermentWorkplace as a Service (WPaaS) Solves BYOD Challenges – Use Case Version 0.1 WiGiT Open Specifications for Wireless GridsSave to LibraryDownloadby Lee McKnight•  22  Enterprise Architecture, Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, Wireless Communications, Virtual CommunitiesCreating a Modern and Covetable Workplace: Issues in Gap Inc.'s KM Strategies for Banana RepublicSave to LibraryDownloadby Suzanne Lee•  7  Business, Communication, Knowledge Management, Workplace StudiesDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN EMPLOYEE ATTENDANCE TRACKING.docxABSTRACT Employees are the backbone of any company therefore their management plays a major role in deciding the success of an organization.

Each employee in the database is associated with a position can be added and edited when need arises. Over the years the process of manual attendance has been carried out which is not only time consuming but also provides erroneous result. Automated time and attendance monitoring system provides many benefits to organizations. This reduces the need of pen and paper based manual attendance tracking system. Following this thought, this paper discussed how employers indirectly gather information on their employees in the workplace. The means used in achieving this aim is through e-monitoring and surveillance. In this project, a finger print module is implemented with the Employee tracking system to register employee data and allow access to the system, with this employers can monitor the attendance system of employees more effectively and from data collected can form a result for each employee.Save to LibraryDownloadby Babatunde Olanrewaju-George•  6  Workplace Studies, Biometrics And Identity, Database Management Systems, Surveillance, personal data, social sorting, privacy, camera surveillance, identification systems, internet surveillance, biometricsMigrant workers in the Italian healthcare sector.

ISBN: 978-902-725-687-4. This chapter demonstrates how the affordances of computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies can frame and reframe swearing in the workplace. In particular, we provide evidence that communicating via digital technologies leads to novel communicative situations – situations that might be held accountable for the spread of swearing at work. This is because colleagues exchanging written digital messages can use the channel to perform swearing in a light-hearted, playful way, and thus avoid face-to-face confrontation and being accused of verbal aggression in professional contexts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Erika Darics and +1Bernie Mak•  5  Discourse Analysis, Computer-Mediated Communication, Workplace Studies, Hong KongEmail Duration, Batching and Self-interruption: Patterns of Email Use on Productivity and StressWhile email provides numerous benefits in the workplace, it is unclear how patterns of email use might affect key workplace indicators of productivity and stress.

We investigate how three email use patterns: duration, interruption habit, and batching, relate to perceived workplace productivity and stress. We tracked email usage with computer logging, biosensors and daily surveys for 40 information workers in their in situ workplace environments for 12 workdays. We found that the longer daily time spent on email, the lower was perceived productivity and the higher the measured stress. People who primarily check email through self-interruptions report higher productivity with longer email duration compared to those who rely on notifications. Batching email is associated with higher rated productivity with longer email duration, but despite widespread claims, we found no evidence that batching email leads to lower stress. We discuss the implications of our results for improving organizational email practices.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gloria Mark and +1Shamsi Iqbal•  3  Sensors and Sensing, Workplace Studies, Email GenresCorporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007: Legislative success or practically inadequateAfter 10 years in force, has the CMCHA 2007 been a success or inadequate on a practical level?

This research paper investigates whether the Corporate Manslaughter Legislation adequately holds organisations to account for serious failings resulting in death and how the advice legal practitioners provide has changed in its wake (if at all). The Author has found that there has been some "improvement" on the previous regime since the 2007 Act's enactment, however, there would certainly seem to be multiple deficiencies remaining.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ryan Halmkan•  20  Criminal Law, Statistics, Corporate Social Responsibility, DeathKnowmad SocietyKnowmad Society explores the future of learning, work, and how we relate with each other in a world driven by accelerating change, value networks, and the rise of knowmads.

This phenomenon is, in many countries, most acutely manifested in the prison sector. This study focuses on the Turkish and Slovenian prison sectors and compares results with identical studies undertaken in both countries. This paper utilises the Job Effective Wellbeing Survey (JAWS) to explore job satisfaction (JS) of staff in Turkish and Slovenian prisons. The intent of this study is to investigate whether there are statistically significant differences between the JS levels of prison officers in these two countries, and to explore the role of national culture within these results. This study has a number of unique features. It is the first study that compares the JS of prison staff in Turkish and Slovenian contexts. It is also one of the few known studies that has focused on JS utilising the JAWS survey instrument for prison staff specifically. Finally, this study provides a research base for further international research focusing on prisons as workplaces, and provides opportunities for cross-cultural comparisons.

In the theoretical portion we dealt with defining emotional intelligence and presenting it from the leaders' aspect. Finally, each generation is introduced. In our paper we set up 2 hypotheses, which are cross-tabulated and / or analyzed with the help of related statistical methods. In the end, both our hypotheses proved to be true.

Despite the fact, they are considered a minority and constantly struggle to succeed in society. Factors include negative stigma towards people with disabilities, lack of accommodation, discrimination, and insufficient education system. The Independent Living Center is the primary advocacy organization for people with disabilities in America, achieving many institutional changes to help persons with disabilities gain the same opportunities in life with those without disabilities. However, a history of their oppression is difficult to reverse and there is still a significant lack of awareness towards ablebodyism in the United States.Save to LibraryDownloadby Risa Yamanaka•  10  Humanities, Disability Studies, Human Rights, DiversityUnfolding the Untold, Sexual Harassment in the Moroccan Workplace: Fez as a Case StudySexual harassment is among the oldest immoral practices penetrating societies around the globe, from the ancient times to the present.

Studies have shown that sexual harassment is widespread in all cultures and especially in transitional societies where there is a lack of law enforcement. The phenomenon of sexual harassment in the workplace is a chronic problem around the world and Morocco is no exception, as it is still considered to be a sensitive issue. Continuous development of policies in different nations is observed regarding the issue of sexual harassment, yet it is unfortunate that public records of sexual harassment within the workplace are nearly non-existent in Morocco.Save to LibraryDownloadby Amina Attar•  5  Women's Studies, Workplace Studies, Gender Equality, Violence Against WomenThe Social Construction and Reframing of Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity DisorderIn this article, I integrate research in social construct theory, the medicalization of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and strengths-based theory to propose a change in the way American society negatively labels and... moreIn this article, I integrate research in social construct theory, the medicalization of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and strengths-based theory to propose a change in the way American society negatively labels and interacts with people diagnosed with ADHD. This article presents examples of global perspectives on ADHD, the nature of stigma that occurs to those who receive a medical diagnosis of ADHD, and the need to reframe ADHD from a disease to that of a positive difference. The reader is asked to consider the implications for millions who suffer from the stigma of ADHD. Starting with children diagnosed with ADHD, I suggest that members of society begin to reframe ADHD as a social construct recognizing the strengths and positive traits because there are many. This is a call to all members of society, especially those professionals of the medical, psychological, social, and educational systems, to adopt a strengths-based model of support for those diagnosed with ADHD.Save to LibraryDownloadby Barbara  Mather•  28  Education, Diversity, ADHD, Workplace StudiesRana Plaza and the Triangle Shirtwaist Company: Shifting Blame and Cutting CornersThe factory disasters at Rana Plaza and the Triangle Shirtwaist Company were 100 years apart, but strikingly similar events.
