In this paper, there is a synergetic approach used to delineate the tectonic-structural framework with analyzing the hydrocarbon reservoir in the Lower Indus Platform basin of Pakistan. The reflected seismic profiles and potential field map constitute the data base of this study. Our study in the line of the previous research is resulted from important oil and gas discoveries contained in the Early Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic formations of the Lower Indus Platform basin area. The result shows trapping mechanism in the Lower Indus Platform basin involves of the fault blocks and stratigraphic traps are present in the area. The more refined images are interpreted to provide greater insight into detailed integrated geophysical study of area.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The line orients itself NNE-SSW direction. The sections have the shot points from VP-199 to VP-1044. Eleven Reflectors R1, R2, R3, Base Miocene, Pinchout P1, P2, P3, P4, P5P6 (Pinchout) are marked and a basement has been marked and interpreted. All the reflectors above the basement show a downward bending at the center. The depth of each reflector was calculated by iso velocity contour map method. The depth section obtained by this method shows strati-graphic features like Pinchouts. The reflectors are then correlated with the subsurface structures and stratigraphy of the area.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is a process which describes different reservoir parameters using well field data. Porosity is one of the parameters that determines the amount of oil present in a rock formation and research in this area is mainly carried out by engineers and geoscientists in the petroleum industry. Accurate prediction of porosity is a difficult problem. This is mostly due to the failure in the understanding of spatial porosity parameter distribution. Artificial neural networks have proved to be a powerful tool for mapping complicated and non-linear relationships in petroleum studies. In this study, we analyze and compare generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and feed-forward back propagation neural network (FFBP) in modeling porosity in Zhenjing oilfield data. This study is calibrated on four wells of Zhenjing oilfield data. One well was used to find an empirical relationship between the well logs and porosity, while the other three wells were used to test the model's predictive ability in the field, respectively. The findings proved that the GRN network can make more accurate and credible porosity parameter estimation than the commonly used FFBP network. Artificial intelligence can be exploited as a powerful instrument for predicting reservoir properties in geophysical formation evaluation and reservoir engineering in petroleum industry.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Capability of self-organizing map neural network in geophysical log data classification: Case study from the CCSD-MHby Yao  Yevenyo Ziggah (PhD) and Nasir  KhanWell log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling... more Well log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling research. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline metamorphic rocks, more complex nonlinear functional behaviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Hence, establishing a prediction technology that can accurately interpret/classify well log data in terms of lithology is of major significance. This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithol-ogy clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Analysis of geochemical well logs in crystalline rocks using statistical approach Abstract#3419: Case study of Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole35th International Geological Congress .

Applications of downhole logs are well developed in the petroleum industry. As a result, log respo nses in sedimentary rocks are well known; even though, this is not the case for crystalline rocks [1]. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline rocks, more complex nonlinear functi onal be haviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Moreover, up to now, there is no systematic formulated interpretation/classification methods available for crystalline rocks [2] in geophysics; thus posing challenges in accurate identification of log curve for this purpose. Motived by the success of statistical methods to solve different problems in geophysics, thi s study wi ll explore the applicability of using Cross Plot and Factor Analysis to recognize metamorphi c rocks type s using geochemical log data. These methods are calibrated on Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) data. The CCSD-MH project was one of the largest and most expensive scientific research projects in geosciences ever undertaken in China [3]. The CCSD-MH is located in the southe rn part of Donghai County, in the Sulu Ultrahigh pressure metamorphic belt of Eastern China (Figure 1). After 3 years of drilling through UHPM, a final depth of 5158 m was reached in 2005. It is the deepest well drilled into the extremely hard crystalline rocks [3]. The logging engineering employed more than 20 types of well logging tools and use d advanced ECLIPS5700 image logging system to obtain a variety of geophysical and geochemical logging data. Therefore the CCSD project database offers a unique opportunity to study log responses in relation to rock composition for metamorphic rocks. Also of interest in this research will be the comparison of geochemical logs analysis results through statistical methods to those obtained by geophysical logs in order to determine if the geochemical logs evaluati on has any advantages over geophysical logs evaluation in crystalline rocks interpretation. These statistical methods can be a very advantageous tool in facilitating the task of geophysicists in the framework of research drillings in continental crust.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
