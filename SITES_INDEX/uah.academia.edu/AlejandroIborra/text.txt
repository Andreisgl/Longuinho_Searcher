This experience was conducted in the subject of “Social Skills” for students of the degree of Psychopedagogy in the University of Alcalá (Madrid, Spain) during the second semester of academic year 2010/2011.The subject took place along thirty one sessions and was attended by around fifty students between twenty-three and fifty-three. At the beginning of the course, and as an optional activity, the students were asked to register what they were feeling throughout the sessions in order to facilitate their personal reflection. On the one hand they had to track, by means of scale weekly reports, the occurrence and intensity of thirteen different emotional states. On the other hand, they were invited to record, through weekly reports, the most significant events experienced during the sessions. By the end of the course we had gathered a total of ninety-five records from eleven students, nine women and two men. Although in a first moment we selected four cases to be analysed, as they were not homogeneous in the number or timing of registers we considered as more interesting to focus on one of the cases and make a preliminary analysis, as an approach to future and more systematized research projects. Our proposal to analyse the data collected in the kind of experience we are presenting would consist of a categorical content analysis of the narratives made with the program Atlas.ti (Iborra, 2007 b) and on analysis of variability, continuities, discontinuities and changes in trajectories (Kunnen et al., 2011). This work tries to contribute with some ideas to the reflection about the teaching and learning processes, emphasizing on the importance of students´ individual trajectories and suggesting some ways to measure and analyse them. We consider that this is particularly relevant in the case of people who will work as professionals in the field of education.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The 'Career Identity and Self-Management' (IdeCaA) Scale: a Self-Regulatory and Functional Contribution to the Study of IdentityFor a long time the conception of “career” has been the most widespread metaphor when referring t... more For a long time the conception of “career” has been the most widespread metaphor when referring to the trajectories experienced throughout our professional live (Skorikov &amp;amp; Vondracek, 2011) . However, the higher complexity in the domain of work is leading to the decrease of predictable and stable career paths (Law, Meijers &amp;amp; Wijers, 2002). The concept of occupational identity is becoming more relevant in order to refer to the agentic mechanism responsible for coping both with the changing and unpredictable environmental conditions and with the own personal demands (Côté &amp;amp; Levine, 2016). Although there are interesting examples of applying the dimensional identity status paradigm with working young adults, we defend that a functional model of identity probably describes better the self-regulatory activity needed to manage the demands arising from the current professional context (Serafini &amp;amp; Adams, 2002). In this regard, we present a model of “Career Identity and Self Management” based on the elaboration and validation of a questionnaire (IdeCaA) which measures how individuals self-manage their professional careers through relevant meaning-making processes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Como docentes universitarios, una de nuestras propuestas de evaluación es un cuestionario online de carácter opcional y anónimo. Para cada pregunta se ofrecen varias respuestas, seguidas por un feedback donde se presenta una argumentación compleja sobre el grado de precisión de las mismas. El objetivo de este cuestionario formativo es que el estudiante revise activamente los conceptos trabajados en la asignatura. El cuestionario fue presentado a un grupo de 95 estudiantes del Máster Universitario en Formación del Profesorado y un grupo de 34 alumnos de 1º Curso del Grado de Magisterio en Educación Primaria. Dichos cuestionarios fueron valorados por los alumnos y posteriormente se realizó un análisis de contenido (Schreier, 2014). Se identificaron tres temas: 1) promover que los estudiantes reflexionen sin la presión de una calificación, 2) facilitar que el estudiante aprecie diferentes niveles de complejidad en el tipo de respuestas posibles, y 3) facilitar procesos de autonomía y responsabilidad con respecto al propio proceso de aprendizaje.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Through a thematic holistic analysis, we identified (1) five phases in the student’s learning process, which illustrated her evolving meaning-making of the challenging demands and related changes in her emotional experience and (2) two learning outcomes, including the student’s insights into the meaning of learning and her increasing self-awareness.

In this chapter, they share their experience of using self-assessment in a Teacher Training Degree course as a way to both enhance self-direction and assess its development. A thematic analysis of the self-assessments of a sample of 30 students is carried out, and four themes are identified: 1) the degree of authorship, 2) the degree of elaboration, 3) “taking notice of” subtle levels of analysis, and 4) the identification of temporal milestones throughout the course. These themes enable a different pattern of mental complexity to be identified, a complexity which is understood as evidence of students&#39; different degrees of self-direction. The findings are discussed in the light of developmental constructivist theories.

As the emphasis of our project is on the phenomenon of learning processes, we collected data from four different methodological experiential challenging learning experiences aimed to promote the autonomy of adolescents and emerging adults university students. More specifically our aims are to detect different patterns in the emotional and learning trajectories, to analyze the qualitative narratives expressed by the participants and to determine the intra-individual variability in developmental trajectories. We consider this project as a methodological challenge in two levels. At one level, and as researchers with a psychological background, we wish to implement a kind of inquiry loyal to the new approaches in psychology (Smith and Sparkes 2005, Valsiner 2009, Kunnen et al.2011) which pay attention to the complexity and multiplicity of the individual and avoid the ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To that end, we tracked individuals' emotional trajectories during a challenging training course, seeking qualitative changes–turning points—and we tested their relationship with the perceived complexity of the training. The research context was a 5-day higher education course based on process-oriented experiential learning, and the sample consisted of 17 students. The students used a five-point Likert scale to rate the intensity of 16 emotions and the complexity of the training on 8 measurement points. Monte Carlo permutation tests enabled to identify 30 turning points in the 272 emotional trajectories analyzed (17 students * 16 emotions each). 83% of the turning points indicated a change of pattern in the emotional trajectories that consisted of: (a) increasingly intense positive emotions or (b) decreasingly intense negative emotions. These turning points also coincided with particularly complex periods in the training as perceived by the participants (p = 0.003, and p = 0.001 respectively). The relationship between positively-trended turning points in the students' emotional trajectories and the complexity of the training may be interpreted as evidence of a successful management of the cognitive conflict arising from the clash between the students' prior ways of meaning-making and the challenging demands of the training. One of the strengths of this study is that it provides a relatively simple procedure for identifying turning points in developmental trajectories, which can be applied to various longitudinal experiences that are very common in educational and developmental contexts. Additionally, the findings contribute to sustaining that the assumption that complex contextual demands lead unfailingly to individuals' learning is incomplete. Instead, it is how individuals manage complexity which may or may not lead to learning. Finally, this study can also be considered a first step in research on the developmental potential of process-oriented experiential learning training.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
