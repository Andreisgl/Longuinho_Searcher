Novel prodrugs for the treatment of colonic diseases based on 5-aminosalicylic acid, 4'-geranyloxyferulic acid, and auraptene: biological activities and analytical assaysA pro-drug is a substance administered in a pharmacologically inactive structure that, once admin... more A pro-drug is a substance administered in a pharmacologically inactive structure that, once administered, is metabolised in vivo into the corresponding active principle. The rationale for the design of prodrugs is the optimisation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Moreover these compounds are frequently synthesized to improve bioavailability. 5-Amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) represents one of the most efficient agents for ColoRectal Cancer (CRC) treatment. Its inclusion in natural or semi-synthetic cyclodextrins (CDs) has been extensively studied to enhance drug properties as solubility, stability, and bioavailability. On the other hand, very recently naturally occurring 4&#39;- geranyloxyferulic acid and auraptene were found as novel promising agents for the treatment of colon diseases, like adenomas and adenocarcinomas.

In recent years different liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) techniques coupled with a variety of analytical equipment have been developed for the determination of both organic and inorganic analytes. OBJECTIVE Over the past few years, the number of research papers in this field has shown a markedly growing tendency. Therefore, the purpose of this review paper is to summarise and critically evaluate research articles focused on the application of LPME techniques for the analysis of plant and herbal samples. RESULTS Due to the complex nature of the samples, the direct application of LPME techniques to the analysis of plants has not often been done. LPME techniques as well as their modalities have been commonly applied in combination with other pretreatment techniques, including a solid-liquid extraction technique supported by mechanical agitation or auxiliary energies for plant analysis. Applications and the most important parameters are summarised in the tables. CONCLUSION This review summarises the application of the LPME procedure and shows the major benefits of LPME, such as the low volume of solvents used, high enrichment factor, simplicity of operation and wide selection of applicable detection techniques. We can expect further development of microextraction analytical methods that focus on direct sample analysis with the application of green extraction solvents while fully automating procedures for the analysis of plant materials.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In addition, to avoid high doses of a single drug that could cause serious side effects, multi-drug therapies are often used to treat numerous diseases. For these reasons, the demand for methods that allow the rapid analysis of mixed compounds has increased in recent years. In order to respond to these needs, new methods and instruments have been developed. However, often the complexity of a matrix can require a long time for the preparation and processing of the samples. Different problems in terms of components, types of matrices, compounds and physical-chemical complexity are encountered when considering drugs associa...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An NP-loaded MSMP is a multistage vector (MSV) that forms a Matryoshka-like structure that protects the therapeutic cargo from degradation and prevents its dilution in the circulation during delivery to tumor cells. We developed an MSV constituted by 1 µm discoidal MSMPs embedded with PEGylated liposomes containing oxaliplatin (oxa) which is a therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer (CRC). To obtain extra-small liposomes able to fit the 60 nm pores of MSMP, we tested several liposomal formulations, and identified two optimal compositions, with a prevalence of the rigid lipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000]. To improve the MSV assembly, we optimized the liposome-loading inside the MSMP and achieved a five-fold increase of the payload using an innovative lyophilization appro...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Enzyme-assisted extractions of polyphenols – a comprehensive reviewTrends in Food Science & TechnologyAbstract Background Phenolic compounds present multiple health benefits due to their various biol... more Abstract Background Phenolic compounds present multiple health benefits due to their various biological activities such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, while also serving as functional food ingredients as they can substitute preservatives through their antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Unfortunately, many of such compounds are not only within cytosolic spaces but are also bound within plant cellular walls. Many extraction methods to this day are not able to access such compounds and thus obtain maximum yield levels. Enzyme-assisted extraction methods are currently one of the few types of methods capable of achieving this outcome, while also implying mild reaction conditions, substrate specificity, industrial applicability and other numerous advantages. Scope and approach The following study aims to provide thorough insights regarding these extraction methods in the hope of further familiarizing readers with these innovative extraction methods as they are currently yet to earn wide usage. Thus, a review of current available data selected from studies observing enzyme-assisted extractions of polyphenols as well as studies concerning enzyme-assisted extractions combined with other innovative chemical substances and/or instrumentations (such as ionic liquids, ultrasounds, microwaves, etc.). Key findings and conclusions Given the presented information, enzyme-assisted extraction methods enabled increased polyphenolic compound accessibility, allowing nearly whole plant matrix exploitation, through easily manipulable process parameters. Despite these highly appreciated advantages and high feasibility, enzyme-assisted extraction methods were found to be scarcely industrially implemented as a result of their novelty. Scientific papers such as this review attempt to encourage their understanding and popularization.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Novel MIPs-Parabens based SPE Stationary Phases Characterization and ApplicationMoleculesIn this work, the synthesis, characterization, and application of novel parabens imprinted polyme... more In this work, the synthesis, characterization, and application of novel parabens imprinted polymers as highly selective solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbents have been reported. The imprinted polymers were created using sol–gel molecular imprinting process. All the seven parabens were considered herein in order to check the phase selectivity. By means of a validated HPLC-photodiode array detector (PDA) method all seven parabens were resolved in a single chromatographic run of 25 min. These SPE sorbents, in-house packed in SPE empty cartridges, were first characterized in terms of extraction capability, breakthrough volume, retention volume, hold-up volume, number of theoretical plates, and retention factor. Finally, the device was applied to a real urine sample to check the method feasibility on a very complex matrix. The new paraben imprinted SPE sorbents, not yet present in the literature, potentially encourage the development of novel molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enha...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Liquid Phase and Microwave-Assisted Extractions for Multicomponent Phenolic Pattern Determination of Five Romanian Galium Species Coupled with BioassaysMoleculesBackground: Galium is a plant rich in iridoid glycosides, flavonoids, anthraquinones, and small a... more Background: Galium is a plant rich in iridoid glycosides, flavonoids, anthraquinones, and small amounts of essential oils and vitamin C. Recent works showed the antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, and antioxidant activity of this plant genus. Methods: For the determination of the multicomponent phenolic pattern, liquid phase microextraction procedures were applied, combined with HPLC-PDA instrument configuration in five Galium species aerial parts (G. verum, G. album, G. rivale, G. pseudoaristatum, and G. purpureum). Dispersive Liquid–Liquid MicroExtraction (DLLME) with NaCl and NAtural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NADES) medium and Ultrasound-Assisted (UA)-DLLME with β-cyclodextrin medium were optimized. Results: The optimal DLLME conditions were found to be: 10 mg of the sample, 10% NaCl, 15% NADES or 1% β-cyclodextrin as extraction solvent—400 μL of ethyl acetate as dispersive solvent—300 μL of ethanol, vortex time—30 s, extraction time—1 min, centrifugation at 12000× g for 5 min...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Enzyme-assisted extractions of polyphenols – a comprehensive reviewTrends in Food Science & TechnologyAbstract Background Phenolic compounds present multiple health benefits due to their various biol... more Abstract Background Phenolic compounds present multiple health benefits due to their various biological activities such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, while also serving as functional food ingredients as they can substitute preservatives through their antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Unfortunately, many of such compounds are not only within cytosolic spaces but are also bound within plant cellular walls. Many extraction methods to this day are not able to access such compounds and thus obtain maximum yield levels. Enzyme-assisted extraction methods are currently one of the few types of methods capable of achieving this outcome, while also implying mild reaction conditions, substrate specificity, industrial applicability and other numerous advantages. Scope and approach The following study aims to provide thorough insights regarding these extraction methods in the hope of further familiarizing readers with these innovative extraction methods as they are currently yet to earn wide usage. Thus, a review of current available data selected from studies observing enzyme-assisted extractions of polyphenols as well as studies concerning enzyme-assisted extractions combined with other innovative chemical substances and/or instrumentations (such as ionic liquids, ultrasounds, microwaves, etc.). Key findings and conclusions Given the presented information, enzyme-assisted extraction methods enabled increased polyphenolic compound accessibility, allowing nearly whole plant matrix exploitation, through easily manipulable process parameters. Despite these highly appreciated advantages and high feasibility, enzyme-assisted extraction methods were found to be scarcely industrially implemented as a result of their novelty. Scientific papers such as this review attempt to encourage their understanding and popularization.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ellagitannins, such as punicalagin and ellagic acid, play a role as anti-atherogenic and neuroprotective molecules in the complex fighting against the degenerative diseases. The aim of this work was to evaluate the composition in punicalagins and ellagic acid of differently obtained extracts from whole fruit, peels and juices, prepared by squeezing or by centrifugation, of pomegranate belonging to different cultivars. Moreover, a wider phenolic fingerprint was also determined. The bioactivity of the extracts was tested on the redox activity of PDIA3 disulfide isomerase, an enzyme involved in the regulation of several cellular functions and associated with different diseases such as cancer, prion disorders, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The results demonstrate that the differen...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
