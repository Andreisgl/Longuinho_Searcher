This chapter focuses on the process of creating an enriched digital edition of Pausanias&#39;s Periegesis Hellados or Description of Greece. The purpose of this research is twofold: to identify ‚Äòheritage data‚Äô in Pausanias and to describe the technical and epistemological parameters of their aggregation and organisation. In answering the essentially digital humanities research question ‚Äúhow Pausanias&#39;s literary heritage information can be best organised and connected to the archaeological record on the ground‚Äù, the Digital Periegesis project is charting and analysing the relevant digital tools and methods by which extensive semantic annotation and Linked Open Data (LOD) can facilitate the organisation of heritage information in Pausanias&#39;s text and its connection to actual archaeological finds.

Trajan's tears : Reading virtue through emotionsSvenska Institutet i Rom,  2020This chapter investigates the significance of tears in the political culture of the Roman Empire.... more This chapter investigates the significance of tears in the political culture of the Roman Empire. Its starting point is the tears Pliny the Younger praises the emperor Trajan for shedding in response to senatorial acclamations. I will situate Trajan‚Äôs tears in Roman culture and read them against a range of similar and contrasting tears shed in different contexts (the law court, mourning, and political settings in a more narrow sense). Weeping in Roman political culture was extrovert and passionate. The intensity was a sign of the expressed emotion‚Äôs sincerity, which is why weeping conveyed sincerity in the communication between significant groups in the political system. Tears expressed virtues such as fides, pietas, clementia, civilitas, and consensus. Weeping also articulated power-relations, and it was a sign of respect or deference to weep in front of another. Tears are nonverbal and are given meaning depending on the situation and how roles with their scripts for behaviour were expected to be performed. If contexts, roles, and scripts are unstable, unreliable, and contested, the same holds true for tears. The duplicities of the Principate gave rise to dissimulatio, which led to ambiguous communication in which emotional expressions became separated from emotional content. During the reign of a ‚Äúbad emperor‚Äù (that is an emperor with a poor reputation in historical tradition, often because of alleged repression of the Senate), Romans might need to feign or withhold tears before the emperor, whose tears could also not be trusted. During the reign of a ‚Äúgood emperor‚Äù, like Pliny‚Äôs Trajan, tears could be trusted. False and true tears can be read either as a literary representation or as a description of historical circumstances in a pathological or sound political culture, respectively. Trajan‚Äôs tears in Pliny‚Äôs Panegyricus stand out as a strong expression of sincerity and virtue in an ideologically idealized text that highlights the importance that the tears of those in power could be read.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is carried through by reading representations of weeping in Greek and Latin literary works in different genres, written by different authors. The study demonstrates that while tears and weeping were a common occurrence in Roman politics, the appropriateness and meaning of tears varied by literary context and variables in the historical context (like status, gender, and communicative context). The study also discusses the question of change over and time and argues that the advent of the Emperor impacted weeping and that both an increased appreciation of tears as well as self-control were available as responses for the elite.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
