However, international interest in restricted carbohydrate diets is growing. General practitioners and practice nurses need to know how to advise people with Type 1 diabetes regarding low-carbohydrate diets. This study aimed to explore the carbohydrate counting experiences of people with Type 1 diabetes in a trial with and without a diet restricted to 75 g of carbohydrate per day. Eight participants were interviewed by focus group or interview 12 weeks after a carbohydrate counting course with individual dietary choice or the same course with information on restricted carbohydrate eating and a daily maximum intake of 75 g of carbohydrate. Data were analysed using a qualitative thematic analysis approach. Themes included the need for insulin management skills, impact of the dietary experience, and need for dietary knowledge.

The aim of the present study was to identify dominant workplace stressors for New Zealand nurses, their most used coping strategies, and variables that best predict their mental and physical health. Postal surveys were sent to 190 randomly selected New Zealand nurses employed in clinical areas. Workload was the most common stressor, while &#39;planful&#39; problem solving, seeking social support, and self controlling were the most frequently used ways of coping. The link between stressors such as workload and reduced mental health is concerning, especially as effective coping strategies such as problem solving are already predominantly used by nurses.

More recently, it has been accepted that people with dementia have insight into their condition and, therefore, the ability to contribute to research. A qualitative research project was undertaken with nine participants to explore the experiences and coping strategies of people with dementia. Interviews were undertaken and the data analysed using thematic analysis. Three major themes emerged: coming to terms with memory loss, maintaining control and independence, and the impact of illness on relationships. Understanding the reality for people is essential given that representations of the catastrophic impact of dementia generate high levels of anxiety and depression. Implications for nurses&#39; practice include the need for skilled, well-paced, sensitive and ongoing information about the condition, along with...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper reports the findings of a study exploring the impact of symptomatic endometriosis on women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s social and working life. The study used a feminist approach. Eighteen women were interviewed and a thematic approach used to analyse the data. The analysis is structured around three themes focusing on issues around disclosure of symptoms in the work place; the impact of symptoms on work, education and social participation; and the strategies used by women in the study to manage endometriosis. A range of health and employment implications are discussed in this paper. In particular, nurses can provide useful support to women by careful assessment and prompt referral for diagnostic procedures and by providing timely and comprehensive information, including information about the lifestyle and nutritional factors recommended by women with endometriosis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The majority of respondents were satisfied with work access to online information (84.5%, n = 501) and searched for online information at least several times a week (57.5%, n = 343). The major barrier to online information seeking was insufficient time, but 68 respondents had no work online information access. The level of nursing qualification was significantly correlated with computer confidence and information quality checking. A range of information evaluation approaches was used. Most nurses in study accessed and evaluated Internet information in contrast to the findings of earlier studies, but there were barriers preventing universal integration into practice.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The conc... more This study traces shifts in health professional representations of people with dementia. The concepts of subaltern, personhood and citizenship are used to draw attention to issues around visibility, voice and inclusion. Professional discourses and practices draw upon, and are shaped by historical and contemporary representations. Until recently, people with dementia were subaltern in nursing and medical discourses; marginalised and silenced. The incorporation of contemporary representations foregrounding personhood and citizenship into health professional accounts provide space for transformative styles of care. Privileging personhood centralises the person with dementia in social networks, focusing on their experiences and relationships. Respecting citizenship involves challenging discrimination and stigma: nursing from a rights-based approach necessitates listening and being responsive to the needs of the person with dementia. Incorporating contemporary representations in health professional practice requires the discarding of the historically dominant elite and authoritarian accounts of dementia still apparent in some nursing texts along with, perhaps, the historically burdened term of dementia itself.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Symptomatic endometriosis significantly affects women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s quality of life. Characteristically the condition causes severe pain and has a negative impact on the ability to work, on family relationships and self-esteem. There has been little discussion about women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s experience of endometriosis in nursing literature. A qualitative research design informed by feminist research principles was chosen for this project. Eighteen women agreed to take part in the research. The individual, audio taped interviews were semi-structured and interactive. The interviews were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The dominant feature of data from the interviews was the experience of severe and chronic pain impacting on all aspects of life. Analysis related to pain resulted in four themes: manifestations of pain, the pain trajectory, intractable pain and controlling pain. The diagnostic process typically took 5-10 years indicating that primary health care practitioners need higher levels of &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;suspicion&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; for this condition. Case studies and problem-based scenarios focusing on endometriosis in health professional education programmes would enhance diagnostic skills and knowledge development. No formal pain management follow up after diagnosis and treatment meant women actively sought information from other sources as they made major lifestyle changes in the areas of activity and nutrition. Pain management services specifically for women with endometriosis would provide much needed support with this neglected aspect of the disease. This is a fertile area for the development of the Nurse Practitioner role which, also drawing on the considerable collective expertise of women with endometriosis, could provide significant information and support for women as they manage this highly complex condition.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Is anybody listening?

Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of Australian, New Zealand and UK nurses. Of the 7604 participants in the electronic cohort, 1909 provided qualitative comments of which 162 related to nursing practice; thematic analysis resulted in four high order themes.

Issues raised by participants have been discussed in the nursing literature for several years yet nurses still experience these negative aspects of nursing. It appears there is a significant gap between what is known about the practice environment, recommendations for change and change occurring: the management equivalent of the theory-practice gap, resulting in nurses intending to leave the profession. Research demonstrates that a well-qualified, stable nursing workforce improves quality of health care and health outcomes. Changing the work environment and fostering a positive workplace culture seems fundamental to supporting the retention of nurses, that this is not occurring in some areas in the current climate is a concern for the profession and those responsible for the provision of care.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The quality of the work environment is an important issue for recruitment, retention and workforce planning. Knowledge about the people in and the place that is the residential aged-care facility may assist with the problems surrounding the recruitment and retention of nurses in the workforce. Qualitative electronic cohort sub-study. This paper presents the qualitative research findings from an electronic cohort sub-study of 58 registered and enrolled nurses working in the residential aged-care sector in 2007. Data were collected through an open ended question and a qualitative content analysis was used to generate the core categories. The concept of caring was grounded in and constrained by, the everyday reality of the nurses in the study. Organisational imperatives for the completion of documentation necessary for accreditation and funding combined with under-staffing restricted the time available for caring practices. Some nurses represented residential care faculties as devoid of care, others as a place where the resident was central to their work and care. The staff perceived of themselves as an ageing workforce in need of rejuvenation and resourcing. The concept of caring is manifest in nurses&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; language as they describe their workplace, the residents, themselves and the structures that impact on what they do. Good caring manifests itself when the residents are central to the business of the aged care facility. However, nurses in this study describe a range of restrictive factors impeding caring practices and diminishing workforce morale and motivation to create environments that can truly be called a &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;home-away-from-home&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; and one that all people would find acceptable.

The m... more The aim of this research was to explore the experiences of people with intersex conditions. The main objective was to contribute to knowledge of the condition by giving voice to a group of people who are invisible in society. Medical management of intersex conditions has historically focused on erasing visual bodily difference through gender assignation and medical/surgical intervention to ensure congruent body appearance. People with intersex conditions require support to live free from shame in a normalising society and need particularly sensitive care when engaged with the health system. A small-scale qualitative study was undertaken. Recruitment of participants was difficult because of barriers created by invisibility and marginalisation. After extensive and careful negotiation with one contact, three people in New Zealand agreed to participate in the research. In-depth interviews were undertaken and thematic analysis used to develop themes that were common across participants&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; experiences. Three themes emerged from the data: managing silence, coping with difference and development of acceptance. These themes highlight: the negative impact of societal ignorance, lack of acceptance of body difference and the journey from silence to disclosure and acceptance of individuality and choice in gender identification. These findings highlight the need for nurses to be knowledgeable and skilled communicators to ensure age-appropriate information and support is provided to enable individual choice in gender identification and normalisation for people with intersex conditions. Many nurses will be unaware of the condition of being intersex and have little knowledge of the challenges faced by this group yet are likely to be involved in their care. People with intersex conditions require particularly sensitive care and nurses can provide appropriate, supportive and &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;safe&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; care if they are aware of the condition and its challenges.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Interviews were undertaken and the data analysed using thematic analysis. Three major themes emerged: coming to terms with memory loss, maintaining control and independence, and the impact of illness on relationships. Understanding the reality for people is essential given that representations of the catastrophic impact of dementia generate high levels of anxiety and depression. Implications for nurses&#39; practice include the need for skilled, well-paced, sensitive and ongoing information about the condition, along with...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper reports the findings of a study exploring the impact of symptomatic endometriosis on women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s social and working life. The study used a feminist approach. Eighteen women were interviewed and a thematic approach used to analyse the data. The analysis is structured around three themes focusing on issues around disclosure of symptoms in the work place; the impact of symptoms on work, education and social participation; and the strategies used by women in the study to manage endometriosis. A range of health and employment implications are discussed in this paper. In particular, nurses can provide useful support to women by careful assessment and prompt referral for diagnostic procedures and by providing timely and comprehensive information, including information about the lifestyle and nutritional factors recommended by women with endometriosis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study aimed to establish New Zealand nurses&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; access and evaluation of online health information in the primary care context using a postal questionnaire survey; there were 630 respondents from a random sample of 931 nurses. The majority of respondents were satisfied with work access to online information (84.5%, n = 501) and searched for online information at least several times a week (57.5%, n = 343). The major barrier to online information seeking was insufficient time, but 68 respondents had no work online information access. The level of nursing qualification was significantly correlated with computer confidence and information quality checking. A range of information evaluation approaches was used. Most nurses in study accessed and evaluated Internet information in contrast to the findings of earlier studies, but there were barriers preventing universal integration into practice.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Representations of people with dementia - subaltern, person, citizenNursing Inquiry,  2010This study traces shifts in health professional representations of people with dementia. The conc... more This study traces shifts in health professional representations of people with dementia. The concepts of subaltern, personhood and citizenship are used to draw attention to issues around visibility, voice and inclusion. Professional discourses and practices draw upon, and are shaped by historical and contemporary representations. Until recently, people with dementia were subaltern in nursing and medical discourses; marginalised and silenced. The incorporation of contemporary representations foregrounding personhood and citizenship into health professional accounts provide space for transformative styles of care. Privileging personhood centralises the person with dementia in social networks, focusing on their experiences and relationships. Respecting citizenship involves challenging discrimination and stigma: nursing from a rights-based approach necessitates listening and being responsive to the needs of the person with dementia. Incorporating contemporary representations in health professional practice requires the discarding of the historically dominant elite and authoritarian accounts of dementia still apparent in some nursing texts along with, perhaps, the historically burdened term of dementia itself.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A life shaped by pain: women and endometriosisby Jean Gilmour and Annette HuntingtonJournal of Clinical Nursing,  2005The research aim was to explore women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s perceptions of living wit... more The research aim was to explore women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s perceptions of living with endometriosis, its effects on their lives and the strategies used to manage their disease. Symptomatic endometriosis significantly affects women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s quality of life. Characteristically the condition causes severe pain and has a negative impact on the ability to work, on family relationships and self-esteem. There has been little discussion about women&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s experience of endometriosis in nursing literature. A qualitative research design informed by feminist research principles was chosen for this project. Eighteen women agreed to take part in the research. The individual, audio taped interviews were semi-structured and interactive. The interviews were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The dominant feature of data from the interviews was the experience of severe and chronic pain impacting on all aspects of life. Analysis related to pain resulted in four themes: manifestations of pain, the pain trajectory, intractable pain and controlling pain. The diagnostic process typically took 5-10 years indicating that primary health care practitioners need higher levels of &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;suspicion&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; for this condition. Case studies and problem-based scenarios focusing on endometriosis in health professional education programmes would enhance diagnostic skills and knowledge development. No formal pain management follow up after diagnosis and treatment meant women actively sought information from other sources as they made major lifestyle changes in the areas of activity and nutrition. Pain management services specifically for women with endometriosis would provide much needed support with this neglected aspect of the disease. This is a fertile area for the development of the Nurse Practitioner role which, also drawing on the considerable collective expertise of women with endometriosis, could provide significant information and support for women as they manage this highly complex condition.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Is anybody listening?

Recruitment and retention of the nursing workforce is of international concern as demands increase due to demographic changes, political pressure and community expectations, in a climate of economic constraint. Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of Australian, New Zealand and UK nurses. Of the 7604 participants in the electronic cohort, 1909 provided qualitative comments of which 162 related to nursing practice; thematic analysis resulted in four high order themes.

Issues raised by participants have been discussed in the nursing literature for several years yet nurses still experience these negative aspects of nursing. It appears there is a significant gap between what is known about the practice environment, recommendations for change and change occurring: the management equivalent of the theory-practice gap, resulting in nurses intending to leave the profession. Research demonstrates that a well-qualified, stable nursing workforce improves quality of health care and health outcomes. Changing the work environment and fostering a positive workplace culture seems fundamental to supporting the retention of nurses, that this is not occurring in some areas in the current climate is a concern for the profession and those responsible for the provision of care.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The quality of the work environment is an important issue for recruitment, retention and workforce planning. Knowledge about the people in and the place that is the residential aged-care facility may assist with the problems surrounding the recruitment and retention of nurses in the workforce. Qualitative electronic cohort sub-study. This paper presents the qualitative research findings from an electronic cohort sub-study of 58 registered and enrolled nurses working in the residential aged-care sector in 2007. Data were collected through an open ended question and a qualitative content analysis was used to generate the core categories. The concept of caring was grounded in and constrained by, the everyday reality of the nurses in the study. Organisational imperatives for the completion of documentation necessary for accreditation and funding combined with under-staffing restricted the time available for caring practices. Some nurses represented residential care faculties as devoid of care, others as a place where the resident was central to their work and care. The staff perceived of themselves as an ageing workforce in need of rejuvenation and resourcing. The concept of caring is manifest in nurses&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; language as they describe their workplace, the residents, themselves and the structures that impact on what they do. Good caring manifests itself when the residents are central to the business of the aged care facility. However, nurses in this study describe a range of restrictive factors impeding caring practices and diminishing workforce morale and motivation to create environments that can truly be called a &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;home-away-from-home&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; and one that all people would find acceptable. These findings have implications for aged-care sector recruitment, retention and workforce planning within residential aged-care facilities.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The experiences of people with an intersex condition: a journey from silence to voiceby Jean Gilmour and Annette HuntingtonJournal of Clinical Nursing,  2009The aim of this research was to explore the experiences of people with intersex conditions. The m... more The aim of this research was to explore the experiences of people with intersex conditions. The main objective was to contribute to knowledge of the condition by giving voice to a group of people who are invisible in society. Medical management of intersex conditions has historically focused on erasing visual bodily difference through gender assignation and medical/surgical intervention to ensure congruent body appearance. People with intersex conditions require support to live free from shame in a normalising society and need particularly sensitive care when engaged with the health system. A small-scale qualitative study was undertaken. Recruitment of participants was difficult because of barriers created by invisibility and marginalisation. After extensive and careful negotiation with one contact, three people in New Zealand agreed to participate in the research. In-depth interviews were undertaken and thematic analysis used to develop themes that were common across participants&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; experiences. Three themes emerged from the data: managing silence, coping with difference and development of acceptance. These themes highlight: the negative impact of societal ignorance, lack of acceptance of body difference and the journey from silence to disclosure and acceptance of individuality and choice in gender identification. These findings highlight the need for nurses to be knowledgeable and skilled communicators to ensure age-appropriate information and support is provided to enable individual choice in gender identification and normalisation for people with intersex conditions. Many nurses will be unaware of the condition of being intersex and have little knowledge of the challenges faced by this group yet are likely to be involved in their care. People with intersex conditions require particularly sensitive care and nurses can provide appropriate, supportive and &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;safe&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; care if they are aware of the condition and its challenges.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
