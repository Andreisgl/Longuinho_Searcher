In The Netherlands voluntariness and unbearable suffering are required for euthanasia. Many people are more concerned about the loss of autonomy and independence in years of severe dementia than about pain and suffering in their last months. To address this concern, people could write advance directives for physician-assisted death in dementia. Should such directives be implemented even though, at the time, the person is no longer competent and would not be either terminally ill or suffering unbearably? We argue that in many cases they should be.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bonnie Steinbock•  9  Law, Applied Ethics, Dementia, EuthanasiaDevelopment of a short form of the Severe Impairment BatterySave to LibraryDownloadby Kari Kastango and +1Bruce Pollock•  17  Psychometrics, Dementia, France, Cross-Cultural ComparisonAn Education Intervention to Enhance Staff Self-Efficacy to Provide Dementia Care in an Acute Care Hospital in Canada: A Nonrandomized Controlled StudyEducation is needed for enhanced capacity of acute hospitals to provide dementia care.

A nonrandomized controlled, repeated-measures design was used to evaluate a dementia education program delivered to an intervention group (IG, n ¼ 468), compared to a wait-listed group (n ¼ 277), representing separate sites of a multisite hospital. Participants completed self-efficacy for dementia and satisfaction measures and provided written descriptions of dementia care collected at baseline, postintervention (IG only), and at 8-week follow-up. Oral narratives were gathered from IG participants 8 weeks post-intervention. The IG demonstrated significant improvement in self-efficacy scores from baseline to immediately post-intervention (P < .001), sustained at 8 weeks. There were no changes from baseline to 8 weeks postintervention evident in the wait-listed group (P ¼ .21). Intervention group participants described positive impacts including implementation of person-centered care approaches. Implementation of dementia care education programs throughout hospital settings is promising for the enhancement of dementia care.Save to LibraryDownloadby Victoria  McLelland•  3  Dementia, BPSD, Clinical Nursing EducationMusic, Spirituality, and MemoryThis paper looks at using music as a spiritual practice for people living with dementia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan Lunney•  9  Practical theology, Dementia, Spirituality, PersonhoodDementia: A Legal OverviewThis essay provides a critical overview of contemporary legal approaches to capacity in the context of dementia.

Agitation reduces the probability of positive social interaction and increases the psychological and organizational burden. While medical interventions are common, there is need for complementary or alternative methods. Music intervention has been brought forward as a promising method to reduce agitation in dementia. While interventions, target groups and research designs differ, there has so far not been a systematic overview assessing the effect of music intervention for agitation in patients with dementia. A meta-analysis was conducted in order to investigate possible effects of music interventions. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Music intervention had a medium overall effect on agitation in dementia, suggesting robust clinical relevance. While the moderate number of studies does not allow for further differentiation between sub-types of music intervention, the subgroup comparisons indicated promising pathways for future systematic reviews. This meta-analysis is the first systematic and quantitative overview supporting clinically and statistically robust effects of music intervention on agitation in dementia. The analysis provides further arguments for this non-pharmacological approach and highlights needs for future systematic research reviews for the investigation of intervention types.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stefan  Sütterlin•  6  Music, Dementia, Music Therapy, Dementia CareAttachment in old age: Theoretical assumptions, empirical findings and implications for clinical practiceSave to LibraryDownloadby Philippe Persoons•  18  Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Dementia, BehaviorThe Poetry of Dementia: Art, Ethics and Alzheimer's Disease in Tony Harrison's Black Daisies for the BrideSave to LibraryDownloadby Lucy Burke•  6  Literature, Dementia, Medical Humanities, Cultural Disability StudiesCortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in Alzheimer and Lewy body dementia: an MRI surface-based morphometric study.CONTEXT: Depression is common in dementia, especially in the early stages, with important clinical implications, but the etiology is unknown and most likely heterogeneous.

Antidepressant use in the elderly without dementia has previously been shown to be associated with high risks of adverse events and with structural brain alterations.OBJECTIVE:To investigate cortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD).METHODS:74 subjects with mild AD and LBD from geriatric and psychiatry outpatient clinics in Western Norway were included. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. Automatic preprocessing using Freesurfer included steps for white and grey matter surface reconstruction. The resulting cortical thickness was analyzed using linear modeling.RESULTS:Clusters of depression-associated thinning were found in prefrontal and temporal areas. Treatment-associated thinning was observed in the parahippocampal region and was significant even after correction for age, sex, AD/LBD diagnosis, and MADRS scores.CONCLUSION:Depression in mild AD and LBD is associated with cortical thinning in prefrontal and temporal areas. The findings suggest that depressive symptoms in mild dementia could develop due to neurodegeneration in the same neural circuits that are critical for depression across different brain disorders. Antidepressant use in patients with mild AD and LBD is associated with parahippocampal thinning. Taken together with low efficacy of antidepressants in cognitively impaired patients and high risks of adverse events, our results suggest a need to re-evaluate the treatment approaches for depression and the role of antidepressants in patients with dementia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexander Lebedev•  7  Depression, Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, MorphometryPreliminary study of the relationship between thyroid status and cognitive and neuropsychiatric functioning in euthyroid patients with Alzheimer dementiaTo investigate whether variations within normal ranges of thyroid functioning are related to cognitive and neuropsychiatric functioning in Alzheimer disease (AD).

Mild alterations of thyroid hormone levels, even in the normal range, are associated with changes in mood and cognitive functioning in older, nondemented adults, and lower concentrations of thyroid hormones have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline. Less is known about the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction in AD. Twenty-eight euthyroid patients with AD on donepezil underwent evaluation of thyroid status, including measures of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), and cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessment with the Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Assessment Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Visual Analog Mood Scales.

Furthermore, there are no long-term interventions nor individual (one-on-one) interventions applied by professionals. Objetive. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a long-term individual cognitive stimulation intervention on people with mild NCD. PATIENTS AND METHODS A pre-post test design with a non-equivalent control group was conducted. A total of 82 participants with mild NCD were assigned to a cognitive stimulation intervention group or to a control group. The intervention consisted of 88 individual format sessions of approximately 45 minutes, twice per week. Independent evaluators assessed cognition, depressive symptomatology and autonomy level in activities of daily living at pre-intervention, intra-intervention (6 months) and post-intervention (12 months).

The initial feedback stage was conducted using small sample discussions. There was no standardized questionnaire used, but the general question of “how can we make radio more dementia friendly” was put to people, including some of the answers already provided to give people a starting point for discussions. This information was used to structure the fully-produced 60 minute broadcast on  BBC Radio Devon “Music, Memory and Making Radio”. The documentary structure was an unusual mix of music and speaking, with multiple repetitions of the presenters’ names. The topic of the programme was repeatedly explained, mini-features kept as short as possible, and during the recording of interviews, signs were put up asking people to speak clearly. Mini-features included: what makes music memorable, how music can be used to help people with dementias, and initial considerations regarding dementia-friendly radio broadcasts. Below is an overview of the making of the programme; as well as samples of feedback we have been receiving from broadcasters, people living with dementia and their carers.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexis Kirke•  4  Antennas & Radio Wave Propagation, Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, BroadcastingA protocol for Italian validation of DEMQoL-Proxy Scale: assessing the Quality of Life of people with moderate or mild dementiaIn this paper, we propose an adaptation of a tool’s validation protocol.

We adopted this phases-theory to validate in Italian language an instrument to assess Quality of Life for people with moderate or mild dementia. We will explain the example of our Italian validation of DEMQoL-Proxy considering each De Vellis’s phase. We will explain our application of De Vellis’s model to Italian example described. For the first three phases, we reproduced the original validating study in which authors (Smith et al., 2005) defined what to measure, how to generate a set of items and the structure of the scale. Indeed, for the last five phases we explained the adaptation of De Vellis’s model to Italian validation. We hope that this model could be effective for validating goals, for researchers and for all professionals who deal with caregivers and patients with moderate and mild dementia.

Systematic searches of 10 relevant bibliographic databases and a rigorous examination of the literature from nonacademic sources were undertaken. Searches identified 304 articles assessed for relevance and level of evidence, of which 74% were academic literature. The review identified the need for (1) more timely and accurate diagnosis and increased support immediately following diagnosis; (2) more individually tailored services addressing life cycle issues; (3) examination of the service needs of those living alone; (4) more systematic evaluation of services and programs; (5) further examination of service utilization, costs of illness, and cost effectiveness; and (6) current Australian clinical surveys to estimate prevalence, incidence, and survival rates.

Starting with a psychological continuity theory of personal identity, the argument concludes that the very conditions that bring an advance directive into play may destroy the conditions necessary for personal identity, and so undercut the authority of the directive. In this article, I concede that if the purpose of a theory of personal identity is to provide an answer to the question What is it for a person to persist over time?, then reflection on personal identity poses a potentially serious threat to the moral authority of advance directives. However, as Marya Schechtman observes, questions about how a single person persists through change are not what most of us are interested in when we think about who a person is.

We recently completed a cross-sectional study to test the hypothesis that a combination of a brief cognitive screening instrument (Mini-Cog) with a functional scale (Functional Activities Questionnaire; FAQ) would accurately identify individuals with MCI and undiagnosed dementia. The Mini-Cog consists of a clock drawing task and 3-item recall, and takes less than 5 minutes to administer. The FAQ is a 30-item questionnaire completed by an informant. In addition to the Mini-Cog and FAQ, a traditional cognitive test battery was administered, and two neurologists and a neuropsychologist determined a consensus diagnosis of Normal, MCI, or Dementia. A classification tree algorithm was used to pick optimal cutpoints, and, using these cutpoints, the combined Mini-Cog and FAQ (MC-FAQ) predicted the consensus diagnosis with an accuracy of 83% and a weighted kappa of 0.81.

Five groups (saline-saline control, streptozotocin-saline, and streptozotocin with different doses of flavonoids, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) of rats were examined. Rats received different doses of Mespilus germanica flavonoids or saline over three weeks starting one day before surgery. Next, they were assessed using a learning and memory test. After subjected to the behavioral test, the animals were perfused and their brains were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4 % and the tissue was further processed. Finally, the density of intact neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area in all groups was investigated. The results revealed that injection of streptozotocin significantly reduced cognitive function, memory retention as well as CA1 intact neurons compared to the control group. Flavonoids extracted by Mespilus germanica considerably eradicated the negative effects of streptozotocin. Accordingly, Mespilus germanica leaf flavonoids can improve cognitive deficits resulted from injection of streptozotocin.Save to LibraryDownloadby matin ramezani and +1Darbandi N•  3  Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, Cognitive NeuroscienceSooner or later?

The pain chart was developed from existing assessment scales and pain indicators, and is targeting needs of older people in residential care and geriatric hospital settings with high prevalence of cognitive impairments. The chart is based on self-report of pain but allows for observation of pain-related behaviours for those unable to report pain. The chart consists of one evaluative and one documentation dimension, and was evaluated by a group of clinicians in geriatric hospital care (n = 15) and residential aged care (n = 6). The chart was found to be content valid, informative and easy to use, facilitating clinical assessments and monitoring, and assisting visual readings of patients’ temporal pain trends.Save to LibraryDownloadby Benny Katz•  20  Documentation, Pain, Dementia, Pain ManagementDifferential Effects of Global and Cerebellar Normalization on Detection and Differentiation of Dementia In FDG-PET StudiesFDG-PET ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) is frequently used to improve the differential diagnosis of dementia.

However, a fundamental methodological issue of the reference area for the intensity normalization procedure is still unsolved. Here, we systematically compared the two most commonly used normalization methods to the cerebral and to the cerebellar metabolic rate for glucose with regard to detection and differentiation of dementia syndromes. FDG-PET imaging was performed on 19 subjects with early Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, 13 subjects with early frontotemporal lobar degeneration and 10 subjects complaining of memory impairment, which had not been confirmed by comprehensive clinical testing.

As a result, the NTB (neuropsychological test battery) was introduced as an alternative which measures cognitive de- cline in both mild and moderate patients equally well (Harrison et al, Arch Neurol 64:1323-9, 2007). Methods: The psychometric properties of NTB are examined in two randomized, double-blind trials; one 12-week placebo- and active-controlled (w 350 patients) and the other 24-week placebo-con- trolled (w 330). The test-retest reliability, ratio of within subject variability to between subject variability, and internal consistency of NTB in addition to correlation of NTB with other cognitive and functional measures are evaluated using data from the placebo patients. The sensitivities of NTB and ADAS-Cog are assessed as a function of baseline MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores using data from the active and the placebo arms. Results: It is confirmed that the NTB has good psychometric properties. Although the NTB and ADAS-Cog are equally sensitive in detecting change in the overall population, differences are observed when stratified by baseline MMSE scores. While the NTB is more sensitive than ADAS-Cog among the mild patients, the reverse is observed among the moderate patients. Conclusions: The NTB has good psychometric proper- ties. Based on two studies of relatively short duration, both the NTB and ADAS-Cog are shown to be good instruments for detecting drug effects on cognitive decline among AD patients. The sensitivity of these instruments needs to be evaluated in validation studies of longer duration.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Harrison•  4  Memory (Cognitive Psychology), Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, CognitionLow folate status is associated with impaired cognitive function and dementia in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on AgingSave to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Miller•  18  Engineering, Dementia, Aging, Folic acidThe use of formal and informal care in early onset dementia: results from the NeedYD studyEarly onset dementia (EOD) poses specific challenges and issues for both the patient and (in)formal care.
