"Government of India shall endeavour to adopt open source software in all e-Governance systems implemented by various Government organizations, as a preferred option in comparison to closed source software," said the policy statement, put on the website of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology. ET had reported in November that the government was looking to adopt open source development in a big way. At that time, the DeitY secretary had said open source would be preferred "wherever possible." However, the new policy clearly states that "All Government Organizations, while implementing e-Governance applications and systems must include a specific requirement in Request for Proposal (RFP) for all suppliers to consider open source software (OSS) along with closed source software while responding. Suppliers shall provide justification for exclusion of OSS in their response, as the case may be." "Government Organizations shall ensure compliance with this requirement and decide by comparing both OSS and CSS options with respect to capability, strategic control, scalability, security, life-time costs and support requirements," it adds. The only exceptions considered would be ones where OSS solutions meeting functional requirements, or if the skillset in the identified open source technology are not available. In either case, departments option for CSS technology would have to justify the choice. The move is likely to meet with approval from several open source activists across the country who have been rooting for the use of this technology that would significantly bring down costs. The source code, according to the newly announced policy, shall be available for the community/adopter/end-user to study and modify the software and to redistribute copies of either the original or modified software, and would be "free from royalty". The move is also in line with several governments across the world which prefer open source and open standards for development of their applications and services. The United States, United Kingdom and several countries in the European Union also prefer use of open source over proprietary software. Closer home, the State of Kerala has consistently been held up as a remarkable example of the use of open source and open standards. The Indian government has already upped its use of open source technology. Its crowdsourcing platform MyGov.in is a case in point, which has been developed entirely on open source technology.Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> @toi_techLike TOI Tech on Facebook >>> TOI_techFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAElectionsMadhya Pradesh ElectionsRajasthan Elections 2023Chhattisgarh ElectionsTelangana Election 2023Mizoram ElectionsAssembly Election 2023TOP TRENDSAditya L1Aditya L1 Launch TimeIndia vs Pakistan Live ScoreISRO Sun MissionIND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023Aditya L1 MissionTrending StoriesIn TechEntire WebsiteAditya L1 Launch Live Updates: ISRO all set for Sun mission with Aditya launch todayAditya-L1 begins 1.5 million-km trek to solar vantage point todayIndian Navy's stealth frigate Mahendragiri launchedAditya-L1: Countdown for launch of India's solar mission beginsAditya-L1 mission: Isro completes launch rehearsal of 1st solar missionHydroloc Xtreme: The future of interior waterproofingLive: Rahul targets Adani after fresh stock manipulation allegationsReady for elections in J&K any time: Centre to SCChandrayaan-3: Pragyan's cams weigh just 125gm each, can tolerate high radiation, low tempChandrayaan-3: Pragyan rover confirms presence of Sulphur on Moon, detects traces of other elements, search for Hydrogen onSatan II: Russia deploys 'deadliest nuclear missiles' to keep 'enemies at bay'IND vs PAK Live: Rain delays start of Pakistan's run chase in PallekeleWhat men can learn from women's group talkAditya-L1: PSLV places solar space observatory in orbitUS to send depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine: What it meansPragan Rover has traversed over 100 metres on MoonWhy is India an 'easy target' for foreign mediaYS Sharmila dodges question on YSRTP merger with CongIndia’s first solar mission lifts off successfully: Key detailsAmit Shah, Adhir Ranjan part of panel on simultaneous pollsAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimes NowTimes Now NavbharatTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebKushi ReviewJawan TrailerParenting TipsUnhealthy FoodMouni RoyBeauty TipsAmala PaulIndian CricketerMishri BenefitsMouni RoyTop TrendsAditya L1Aditya L1 Launch TimeIndia vs Pakistan Live ScoreISRO Sun MissionIND vs PAK Asia Cup 2023Aditya L1 MissionRajasthan Woman ParadedAditya L1 CountdownDelhi G20 SummitChandrayaan 3India GDPOne Nation One ElectionBangladesh vs Sri LankaChandrayaan 3 Pragyan RoverAdani newsChandrayaan 3 Discovery on MoonDelhi MetroAsia Cup 2023 ScheduleTrending TopicsKushi Movie ReviewKushi Box Office CollectionSalaar Release DateTiger 3Ushasi RayCovid SymptomsKing OF kotha CollectionDream Girl 2 ReviewJungkookSamantha PrabhuKanjeevaram SariKeerthy SureshAmala PaulMonthly HoroscopeZodiac SignsGadar 2 CollectionVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentViral NewsViral VideosFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.
