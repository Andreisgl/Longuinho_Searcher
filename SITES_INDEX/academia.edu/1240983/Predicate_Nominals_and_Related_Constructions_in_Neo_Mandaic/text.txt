Despite its long history of attestation and copious literature, it is moribund today. Even though the members of the Mandæan community, numbering perhaps 60,000 adherents, are familiar with Mandaic through their sacred literature and liturgy, only a few hundred Mandæans, located primarily in Iran, speak it as a first language. Of these, even fewer use it regularly in writing, primarily to compose the colophons that accompany manuscripts.Download Free PDFView PDFAttributive constructions in North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic2018 • Ariel GutmanThis study is the first wide-scope morpho-syntactic comparative study of North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects to date. Given the historical depth of Aramaic (almost 3 millennia) and the geographic span of the modern dialects, coming in contact with various Iranian, Turkic and Semitic languages, these dialects provide an almost pristine "laboratory" setting for examining language change from areal, typological and historical perspectives. While the study has a very wide coverage of dialects, including also contact languages (and especially Kurdish dialects), it focuses on a specific grammatical domain, namely attributive constructions, giving a theoretically motivated and empirically grounded account of their variation, distribution and development. The results will be enlightening not only to Semitists seeking to learn about this fascinating modern Semitic language group, but also for typologists and general linguists interested in the dynamics of noun phrase morphosyntax.Download Free PDFView PDFMandaeans vi.

According to the analysis suggested here, Syriac uses different negation morphemes for different types of predicates and for different types of syntactical structures. The morpheme la negates predicates whose person component is inside them, called inherent predicates. The morpheme la hwa negates predicates which need an external mark of person in order to constitute nexus (the connection between the subject and the predicate), called non-inherent predicates. The morphemes la (h)wa and law form negative cleft sentences in sentences with both predicates. The position of ’it and its negations in this system will also be discussed. The system of negation morphemes and syntagms will be shown to exhibit clearly the differences between the two types of predicates, much more than their affirmative counterparts.Download Free PDFView PDFAttributive Constructions in North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic: Areal, Typological and Historical Perspectives2016 • Ariel GutmanThe focus of this dissertation is the examination of noun phrase morpho-syntax, and in particular adnominal modification, within North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic (=NENA) dialects. The dissertation describes in detail the various constructions present in NENA dialects, based upon existing grammars, corpora, and the author's fieldwork, and relates their development both to anterior strata of Aramaic and to influences from contact languages, in particular Kurdish and Persian. Given the historical depth of Aramaic and the geographic span of the modern dialects, NENA provides a “laboratory” setting permitting us to examine the role of the various factors in the development of these constructions. The dissertation, moreover, presents the first wide-scope morpho-syntactic comparative study of NENA dialects to date.Download Free PDFView PDFunipartite clause in subordination BW last.pdfEran Cohen“Unipartite non-verbal clauses following the construct state in Semitic”.

Part I: Present-Based Paradigms2015 • Paul NoorlanderNeo-Aramaic, specifically North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA), presents us with one of the most multi-faceted cases of language contact and areal phenomena among the world’s languages. In the transition from Old Aramaic to Neo-Aramaic, several profound morphosyntactic changes occurred attesting to various fascinating evolutionary cycles (cf. Jastrow 2008). The gradual loss of morphological case-marking through phonetic erosion and the merging of the Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) system in North-West-Semitic had a major impact on the restructuring of her Iron Age descendants, which are characterized by the concomitant emergence of a definite article and new dependent-marking strategies to indicate argument structure (Gzella 2013). Many developments in Aramaic are paralleled by those in Arabic and Hebrew (Rendsburg 1991). This drift continued in Neo-Aramaic, but assumed greater proportions in NENA. The most drastic innovation is its verbal system (cf. Pennacchietti 1988; Hoberman 1989; Polotsky 1996; Kapeliuk 1996; Khan 2007a: 12–14). Analytical constructions already on the verge of grammaticalization in Middle Aramaic gave rise to entirely new inflectional paradigms. The loss of the essential ingredients of the West Semitic verbal system, the suffix- and prefix-conjugations, and their replacement by originally non-finite constructions are unparalleled within modern Semitic (Hopkins 2005). Tsereteli (1979: 57–9) lists 14 TAM categories (plus a full set of revamped passives) for Christian Urmi Neo-Aramaic. For a Semitic language, this is not just a few new paradigms, but a virtual explosion of paradigms! The truly intriguing point—and the main goal of this article—in regard to the innovated verbal system of NENA comes from outside Aramaic: this hugely expanded system of TAM paradigms in NENA is closely mirrored in certain non-Semitic languages of the area that also underwent their own significant transformations and restructurings to arrive at these parallel modern inventories of TAM paradigms.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
