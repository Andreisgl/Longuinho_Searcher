Benefits
                        Streaming data analytics with speed
Dataflow enables fast, simplified streaming data
                          pipeline development with lower data latency.
                        Simplify operations and management
Allow teams to focus on programming instead of
                          managing server clusters as Dataflow’s serverless
                          approach removes operational overhead from data
                          engineering workloads.
                        Reduce total cost of ownership
Resource autoscaling paired with cost-optimized batch
                          processing capabilities means Dataflow offers
                          virtually limitless capacity to manage your seasonal
                          and spiky workloads without overspending.
Key features
                      Key features
                        Ready-to-use real-time AI 
Enabled through out-of-the box ML features including
                          NVIDIA GPU
                          and ready-to-use patterns, Dataflow’s real-time AI
                          capabilities allow for real-time reactions with
                          near-human intelligence to large torrents of events.
                        
Customers can build intelligent solutions ranging
                          from predictive analytics and anomaly detection to
                          real-time personalization and other advanced analytics
                          use cases.
Train, deploy, and manage
                          complete machine learning (ML) pipelines,
                          including local and remote inference with batch and
                          streaming pipelines. 
                        Autoscaling of resources and dynamic work rebalancing
                      
Minimize pipeline latency, maximize resource
                          utilization, and reduce processing cost per data
                          record with data-aware resource autoscaling. Data
                          inputs are partitioned automatically and constantly
                          rebalanced to even out worker resource utilization and
                          reduce the effect of “hot keys” on pipeline
                          performance.
                        Monitoring and observability 
Observe the data at each step of a Dataflow pipeline.
                          Diagnose problems and troubleshoot effectively with
                          samples of actual data. Compare different runs of the
                          job to identify problems easily.

Stream
                    analytics
Google’s
                    stream analytics
                    makes data more organized, useful, and accessible from the
                    instant it’s generated. Built on Dataflow along with Pub/Sub
                    and BigQuery, our streaming solution provisions the
                    resources you need to ingest, process, and analyze
                    fluctuating volumes of real-time data for real-time business
                    insights. This abstracted provisioning reduces complexity
                    and makes stream analytics accessible to both data analysts
                    and data engineers.

                            Dataflow ML 
Deploy and manage
                            machine learning (ML) pipelines with ease. Use ML
                            models to do local and remote inference with batch
                            and streaming pipelines. Use data processing tools
                            to prepare your data for model training and to
                            process the results of the models.
                            Dataflow GPU 
Data processing system
                            optimized for performance and cost of your GPU
                            usage. Support for a wide range of NVIDIA
                            GPUs.
                            Vertical autoscaling 
Dynamically adjusts
                            the compute capacity allocated to each worker based
                            on utilization. Vertical autoscaling works hand in
                            hand with horizontal autoscaling to seamlessly scale
                            workers to best fit the needs of the
                            pipeline.
                            Horizontal autoscaling 
Horizontal autoscaling
                            lets the Dataflow service automatically choose the
                            appropriate number of worker instances required to
                            run your job. The Dataflow service may also
                            dynamically reallocate more workers or fewer workers
                            during runtime to account for the characteristics of
                            your job.
                            Right fitting 
Right fitting creates
                            stage-specific pools of resources that are optimized
                            for each stage to reduce resource wastage.
                            Smart diagnostics 
A suite of features
                            including 1) SLO-based data pipeline management, 2)
                            Job visualization capabilities that provide users a
                            visual way to inspect their job graph and identify
                            bottlenecks, 3) Automatic recommendations to
                            identify and tune performance and availability
                            problems. 
                            Streaming Engine 
Streaming Engine
                            separates compute from state storage and moves parts
                            of pipeline execution out of the worker VMs and into
                            the Dataflow service back end, significantly
                            improving autoscaling and data latency.
                            Dataflow Shuffle 
Service-based Dataflow
                            Shuffle moves the shuffle operation, used for
                            grouping and joining data, out of the worker VMs and
                            into the Dataflow service back end for batch
                            pipelines. Batch pipelines scale seamlessly, without
                            any tuning required, into hundreds of
                            terabytes.
                            Dataflow SQL

                            use your SQL skills to develop streaming Dataflow
                            pipelines right from the BigQuery web UI. You can
                            join streaming data from Pub/Sub with files in Cloud
                            Storage or tables in BigQuery, write results into
                            BigQuery, and build real-time dashboards using
                            Google Sheets or other BI tools.
                            Flexible Resource Scheduling (FlexRS) 
Dataflow FlexRS
                            reduces batch processing costs by using advanced
                            scheduling techniques, the Dataflow Shuffle service,
                            and a combination of preemptible virtual machine
                            (VM) instances and regular VMs.

                            help with troubleshooting batch and streaming
                            pipelines. You can access monitoring charts at both
                            the step and worker level visibility and set alerts
                            for conditions such as stale data and high system
                            latency.
                            Customer-managed encryption keys 
You can create a batch
                            or streaming pipeline that is protected with a
                            customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) or access
                            CMEK-protected data in sources and sinks.
