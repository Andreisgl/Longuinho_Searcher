In particular, the use of media technologies to re-present theatrical performances in other places and times contends rather explicitly with an ephemerality still largely considered fundamental to theatre's ontology. Using the 1964 Electronovision recording of Richard Burton’s Hamlet and contemporary cinema broadcasts of theatre like NT Live as examples, this essay argues for understanding the mediatization of theatre not as an ontological rupture, but as a transposition of theatre’s patterns and data into digital forms.Download Free PDFView PDFEmancipating the Spectator? Livecasting, Liveness, and the Feeling I2019 • Heidi  LiedkeRecently, the Metropolitan Opera, the National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company have produced livecasts of their shows that are shown in cinemas worldwide. What impact do livecasting technologies have on the experience of their spectators? Are they manifestations of the Rancierian epoch or do they bring about a new kind of emotional turn? And how do they influence the perceived liveness of the performances? This article investigates these questions by drawing on concepts from adaptation studies, performance philosophy and audience studies. I argue that, on the one hand, livecasting opens up new possibilities of audience participation and fosters a multimodal engagement with the “translated” sources. Livecasts allow their audiences (the feeling of) a key role in determining their shape, and theatres reach out to audiences to engage with their shows on social media. On the other hand, this new paradigm of spectatorship, with its emphasis on “first-person experiences,” may co...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Arden Research Handbook of Shakespeare and Contemporary Performance"Global mediation: Performing Shakespeare in the age of networked and digital cultures," The Arden Research Handbook of Shakespeare and Contemporary Performance, ed. Peter Kirwan and Kathryn Prince (London: Bloomsbury, 2021), pp. 132-1502021 • Alexa Alice  JoubinPerforming Shakespeare in modern times is an act of mediation between characters and actors, creating channels between geocultural spaces and time periods. The multiplicity of the plural term global Shakespeares helps us push back against deceivingly harmonious images of Shakespeare’s ubiquitous presence. Adaptations accrue nuanced meanings as they move through physical and digital spaces, gaining cultural significance by paying homage to or remediating previous interpretations. As a transhistorical and intermedial practice, global Shakespeares have been deployed to revitalize performance genres, resist colonial appendage, exemplify social reparation. This chapter investigates methodologies for transhistorical inquiry into culturally fluid, contemporary adaptations of early modern texts in relation to digital cultures. In juxtaposing the ways in which localities create site-specific meanings, and the ways in which cultural meanings are dispersed and reframed through ever-evolving forms of digital engagement, this chapter outlines the future challenges and opportunities for contemporary global performances.Download Free PDFView PDFShakespeare Survey“PPE for Shakespearians: Pandemic, Performance and Education,” Shakespeare Survey, Volume 74: Shakespeare and Education, ed. Emma Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021): 81–972021 • Kevin A QuarmbyShakespeare and performance pedagogy changed with COVID-19’s arrival. Live performances ceased, theatres closed, and pre-recorded Shakespeare dominated. Actors either accepted dangerous work or experimented unsuccessfully with technology. San Francisco Shakespeare Festival, however, developed ‘live’ Zoom performances, their safe employment practices offering alternative models for student engagement in the post-pandemic world.Download Free PDFView PDFOxford Handbooks OnlineIntermediated Bodies and Bodies of Media (accepted Word Doc)2016 • Sujata IyengarThis essay argues that, when screen media such as television, film, and digital video appropriate and remediate Othello, they do so through intermediality: the simultaneous and self-conscious communication of information and experiences through multiple material and sensory modes. Using Dmitri Buchowetski’s silent version, Orson Welles’s feature film, Geoffrey Sax’s British movie, and Zaib Shaikh’s television films, Ready Set Go Theatre’s web-series, and the National Theatre Live streamed performances as case-histories, the chapter investigates ‘race’ itself as a communicative medium. It concludes that screens ‘screen’ Othello in two senses: they magnify suffering, breathing, human bodies in front of us even as they shelter us from the lived truth of race in the world.Download Free PDFView PDFMethuen Drama and Arden Shakespeare New BooksMethuen Drama and Arden Shakespeare New Books2019 • Mark  DudgeonNew books publishing April-December 2019 from Methuen Drama and The Arden ShakespeareDownload Free PDFView PDFWhy have the special screenings of the Live Cinema events and Exhibition on Screen become popular in contemporary cinemas?Yunzi HanDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Spell of Live Performance: HD Opera and Liveness TodayMihaela IrinaDownload Free PDFView PDFHomo VirtualisTheatre and Performance Go Massively Online During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications and Side Effects2020 • Eleni TimplalexiDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, theatre groups and companies started massively providing online (filmed) versions of their productions. Theatre performances, live-streamed or recorded, have been shown online before, but mostly as a supplementary strategy, assisting the promotion of a live performance, not as a cultural trend per se, nor to the massive extend it has been happening during the pandemic. However, the consumption of this sort of online content, as this is literally what becomes anything posted on the web’s hypertextual multimedial selves, cannot occur without consideration of the potential implications and side effects. What exactly is it we are watching on our screens, why is it marketed as theatre and performance, and why do we consume it as such? In the paper, the Phelan/Auslander debate is revisited, as this eradication of the distinction between the live and the mediatized may indicate performance’s crucial shift away from independence towards technological, economical and linguistic dependence from mass reproduction. However, before lightheartedly welcoming this hybridity of massively experiencing online performances, which springs out from the collision between live performance (art) and web content (creativity), it is worth considering welcoming first digital performance hybrids emerging within and in between the medial restrictions imposed by the pandemic. These bold, experimental, participatory, ‘transparent’ intermedial forms of expression may prove out to be a source of strength in times of crisis.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
