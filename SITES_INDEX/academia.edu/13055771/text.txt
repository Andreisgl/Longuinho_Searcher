THEAETETUS 184-7Toomas LottThis paper offers an explanation of why Plato, in his later dialogues, begins to view the capacity of belief formation as necessarily involving the reasoning part of the soul. I will argue that the standard explanation, according to which for later Plato forming beliefs requires cognitive access to intelligibles (Forms), is unsatisfactory. My focus will be on the passage from Plato's Theaetetus (184B-187A), which is crucial for understanding Plato's notion of belief. I will argue that this passage does not support the standard explanation, and develop an alternative reading of the passage, according to which forming a belief is a goal-directed activity aiming at truth. In other words, it is the epistemic goal of forming beliefs that matters for Plato, not the cognitive preconditions.Download Free PDFView PDFFolia PhilosophicaPlato and the Classical Theory of Knowledge2019 • Artur  PacewiczIn the paper the notion of the classical theory of knowledge is analyzed with reference to its source – the philosophy of Plato. A point of departure for the analysis is the characteristic of the classical theory of knowledge by Jan Woleński in his book "Epistemologia", (but it can be also found in the works of other researchers devoted to epistemology). His statements about Plato are weighted in the context of Plato's thought. The dialogues "Apology", "Gorgias", "Meno", the fragment, of the "Republic", "Theaetetus", "Timaeus" and the testimonies about the so-called agrapha dogmata are especially taken into consideration.Download Free PDFView PDFC.

Dianoia conceives of the relations between the Forms, and these relations are reflected in our thought and its natural image, vocal speech. We support the idea that we cannot interpret the Platonic conception of the relationship between language and reality through the Aristotelian semiotic triangle, because according to it the relation between pragmata or onta and logos becomes real through the medium of thought (noēmata). On the contrary, logos in Plato has an unmediated relation with reality and is itself reckoned among beings. In parallel, we set out to show the difference between the Platonic conception of logos and the Gorgianic approach to it, as well as the approaches of other Sophists and An-tisthenes. Logos itself in Plato is a weaving which reflects the interweaving of Forms, while vocal speech is a natural image of thought. Logos in its dual meaning, dianoia and vocal speech, is illustrated in Dialectic, because as vocal speech is a mirror to dianoia, so Dialectic is a means which clearly reflects the thinking procedures of dianoia.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
