Fish and shellfish were used often since ancient times by wealthy classes as a kind of social marker, not only as a gastronomic delight, but also as a way to stay healthier. This paper reviews thoroughly how seafood has been present in the dietary practices of the Mediterranean people since ancient Egyptians up to the gastronomic discourse of some celebrated contemporary chefs. Preferences for particular tastes and flavors, local traditions, myths and religious rites (such Lent, Shabbat and Ramadan that prohibited eating some foods and allowed others) as well as cultural exchanges between countries and civilizations (with the incorporation of new ingredients and culinary techniques), have shaped the Mediterranean culinary customs along the history. Such traditions are reflected in many ancient writings, culinary literature and cookbooks. We will analyze some of these sources with special attention to those excerpts, anecdotes, cookbooks, recipes, cooks and even characters related to seafood. Knowledge and learning from our rich Mediterranean culinary heritage are important aspects to bear in mind. Whereas some contemporary celebrity chefs (and probably many diners) are not fully aware of such culinary legacy, others like Ferran Adrià have recently recognized the importance of studying the past as a driver for creation and gastronomic innovation.Download Free PDFView PDFCivilization, Gastronomy and Meat-eatingJeremy McInerneyThis chapter examines meat-eating and gastronomy in ancient times. It explains that the symbolic significance of meat-eating is particularly noticeable in the world of epic and that it was considered a marker of status in the Homeric poems. It discusses archaeological evidence that the close connection between sacrifice and feasting in epic poems reflects practices in the Iron Age or even earlier.This chapter also mentions meat-eating served as a focal point for anxieties about impious or anti-social behaviour. It also discusses the Roman elite’s reputation for fine dining, which was then considered as morally bankrupt and an abdication of civic responsibilities.Download Free PDFView PDFKOKOSZKO Maciej, JAGUSIAK Krzysztof, RZEŹNICKA Zofia, Rice as a foodstuff and a medication in ancient and Byzantine medical literatureZofia RzeźnickaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Maritime ArchaeologyCooking and Processing Fish in Antiquity: Questions of Taste and TextureJohn WilkinsDownload Free PDFView PDFStudia CeraneaRice as a Foodstuff in Ancient and Byzantine "Materia MedicaMaciej KokoszkoThe present study discusses dietetic qualities of rice and culinary recipes pertaining to its preparation as demonstrated in ancient and Byzantine medical treatises compiled between 1st and 7th cent. A.D. (Dioscurides, Galen, Oribasius, Anthimus, Alexander of Tralles, Aetius of Amida and Paul of Aegina). The evidence (in the part touching on gastronomic applications of rice) also includes De re coquinaria attributed to Apicius. The article consists of three parts. The first analyzes sources and modern literature to assess the impact of rice on the Greco-Roman and Byzantine agriculture. The results of the analysis confirm the scholarly opinion that rice was never popular in the Mediterranean in the ancient and early Byzantine periods. A slow and gradual change in its status appeared along with the Arab agricultural revolution. The second chapter of the study is devoted to dietetic characterizations of rice and presents features attributed to the cereal over the ages.

Through the discourse analysis of 60 semi-direct interviews, we observed that the idea of control is in both countries based on the relation between women and their food habits. This concept of control, built on self-responsibility is considered by these women as ‘normality’, even though it is completely related with food habits reflexibility and causes a rupture in the previous habits. Further than the problematic of aesthetic and health that motivates this idea of control, it represents a life style and a life hygiene, a life conquer, self control, that is built altogether with the idea of femininity.Download Free PDFView PDFNew Worlds, New Tastes: Food Fashions After the RenaissanceBrian CowanA set of paradoxes lay at the heart of early modern European culinary experiences. The food culture of the period can be understood as perpetually torn between pressures to maintain continuity in the face of revolutionary changes as well as being divided between common cosmopolitan tastes shared by European elites across the continent and a growing sense of urgency behind defining national differences in terms of rival national cuisines. On the one hand, the cosmopolitan intellectual culture of humanism struggled to maintain and revive the culinary and dietetic legacies of classical antiquity. On the other hand, the ‘modern’ pressures for change were irresistible, particularly as access to, and knowledge of, new foods and new cooking techniques increased. This chapter explores these paradoxes of early modern food culture by examining carefully the two most important influences on European understandings of food between the age of Columbus and the age of the French Revolution: humanism and mercantilism. This chapter also explains the rise of a new culinary aesthetic in early modern Europe (c. 1500- c. 1800). It describes the transition from medieval and renaissance culinary ideal of 'intensive‘ flavouring through sugars and spices of a few select dishes to a more expansive early modern and enlightenment culinary aesthetic of 'extensive‘ spicing of a wider variety of new foods. This transformation in taste was part of a wider European cultural revolution that occurred in the wake of humanist neo-classicism and the expansion of European trading networks in Asia and the Atlantic world. While this post-renaissance cultural revolution had its origins in the late fifteenth and sixteenth-centuries, its impact on European taste was not fully felt until the mid-seventeenth century.Download Free PDFView PDFOFFAL: AS A FOOD CULTURE IN ISTANBUL CUISINE MA in Cultural StudiesPelin DumanlıDownload Free PDFView PDFEveryone Eats - Understand Food and CultureSofía KalágaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
