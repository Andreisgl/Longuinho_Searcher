Katz and Conor Moynihan at the 2016 Queer Arts Festival by Pride in Art in Vancouver, BC, Drama Queer explores the role of emotion in contemporary queer art as a form of political practice. Emotion has been identified by scholars and activists as central to much queer contemporary work. This exhibition places the queer utility of emotion into a historical context. Drama Queer solicits a range of contemporary work that engages how feelings function in our political present and the different facets of art and emotion—political emotion, erotic emotion etc. This exhibition explores art that seeks to engender social change by making the viewer an accomplice, queering their perspective or seducing them into seeing the world from a dissident vantage point. Catalogue includes title essay by Jonathan D. Katz and Conor Moynihan, an introduction by SD Holman, and artist essays by Carl Pope, Joey Terrill, and Del LaGrace Volcano.Download Free PDFView PDFDoy(2005) - Picturing the Self.pdfIoana PetreDownload Free PDFView PDF The Photographic Portrait in The British Raj: A Study of the Representation of the Begums of BhopalSophie Balfour-LynnA study of the portraits of the Begums of Bhopal, Sikander Begum (r. 1860-1868) and Shah Jahan Begum (r. 1868-1901) taken by Lieutenant James Waterhouse and later by the photographic firm Bourne and Shepherd. This paper looks at the circulation of these portraits and the how their meaning was transformed through their placement and audience. The photographs are examined through the themes of race, gender and status in order to show how native rulers could exert influence and identity while also co-operating with British rule.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Human Use of the Human Face: The Photographic Self–Portrait in the Age of the Selfie2016 • Karen ann Donnachie[Karen ann Donnachie, PhD // Doctoral Thesis: Full-text] This multidisciplinary, practice explores the phenomenon of the selfie (understood as a networked, vernacular, photographic selfportrait) in order to propose a new critical understanding of its effect on wider photographic self-portrait practice, and photography in general. Significantly, “The Human Use of the Human Face” depicts the selfie as more than a mere vernacular object or action and is not satisfied with the dismissal of the selfie as a direct remediation of the traditional self-portrait. Instead this thesis maps the complex, and sometimes controversial genre of amateur self-portraiture as it sits somewhere between performance, narcissism, social tic, intrinsic desire for self-projection and a possibly irrational quest for authenticity in the photographic image. This practice-led research is articulated through the creation of original digital and electronic artworks including speculative camera design, social media web apps and immersive installation; through interviews with contemporary artists; and finally through the discussion of cultural, aesthetic and photographic theory. This research examines the privileged position the selfie holds inside a rapidly expanding and evolving social media ecology as it becomes both vehicle and tool, a symbol of personal, social, cultural and political identities. Along with the prevailing concerns surrounding the selfie and its reflection on contemporary society, this thesis inserts notions of human affect, connectedness, belonging and being human into the discussion concerning the motivations behind, and social consequences of, the selfie in three areas: first life, second life, and afterlife. This thesis was presented in 2016 for my PhD (Art), awarded from the School of Design & Art, Curtin University, Western Australia, 2017.Download Free PDFView PDFLife Writing. (on-line first)(2015) ‘Farewell to the self: between the letter and the self-portrait’Maria  TamboukouIn this paper I consider interfaces between visual and textual representations of the female self in art. I am looking in particular at Gwen John's self-portraits and the letters revolving around them. In this context, there are three thematic areas that I explore: a) questions around portraiture in general and the self-portrait in particular, b) connections between visual images and textual narratives in life-writing research and c) genealogical lines in John's self-representation through her paintings and letters. What I suggest is that John's self-portraits become events for playing with different modalities of self-representation and experimenting with other ways of painting the self, while her letters become texts destabilizing and interrogating conventions of reading the visual. What I finally argue is that the visual turn in narrative research needs to consider carefully discourses and debates in the field of art histories, while the latter have to become more informed in the nuances of life narrative research.Download Free PDFView PDFAcross Time: Seminole PortraitsAcross Time: Seminole Portraits2012 • Annette B FrommDownload Free PDFView PDFFigures of Empire: Slavery and Portraiture in Eighteenth-Century Atlantic BritainEsther  ChadwickDownload Free PDFView PDFVisionary Anatomies & the Great Divide: Art, Science & the Changing Conventions of Anatomical Representation, 1500-20032003 • Michael SappolDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
