Childhood in Africa, 4 (1), 70-82.Elizabeth NgutukuIn this paper, we reflect on the ethical issues encountered during our work with youth as Researchers in a sexual and reproductive health research project in Ethiopia and Uganda. This study was carried out as the research component of a comprehensive sexuality (CSE) education project implemented by Save the Children International and their local partners in both countries. The formative research had the aim of understanding the contextual realities and gendered social norms that structure sexual behavior and practice of very young adolescents and youth in the study contexts. We examine the dilemmas and “labor” of doing research with youth within a discursive and “expert” led adolescent sexuality and Reproductive health intervention regime and at the same time position the role of our “adult expert gaze.” We also reflect on the research methodology we adopted of working with youth as peer researchers and the tensions in enhancing as well as accessing youth voice. We argue that while research with young people requires that researchers observe specific ethical guidelines, the concept of “a youth researcher” positioned within specific expert discourses may be unsettling and presents further quandaries. We argue that these tensions have to be constantly negotiatedSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersDeconstructing Childhood VulnerabilityKristen CheneySpecial issue of Childhood in Africa December 2010 Issue 1, Volume 2Download Free PDFView PDFChildhood in AfricaDeconstructing Childhood Vulnerability: An Introduction2010 • Kristen CheneyDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE IMPACT OF PROTECTION INTERVENTIONS ON UNACCOMPANIED AND SEPARATED CHILDREN IN HUMANITARIAN CRISESLeigh-Anne GillespieDuring conflicts and crises, children often face multiple stressors that can have significant impacts on their physical, cognitive, social and emotional development. Because unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) have lost the care and protection of their primary caregivers, they face a heightened risk of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence. As a result, programming for UASC cases is often prioritized in the context of humanitarian interventions. But what is the impact of protection interventions on UASC in humanitarian crises in low and middle income countries? How effective are child protection activities specific to UASC at restoring a protective environment? How effective are interventions aimed at preventing and responding to abuse, exploitation, violence and neglect at ensuring the safety of UASC? How effective are mental health and psychosocial support interventions in promoting the mental health and psychosocial well-being of UASC? This systematic review synthesizes and evaluates the existing evidence base in order to find a response.Download Free PDFView PDFThe mental health of children facing collective adversity: Poverty, homelessness, war and displacementFrancesca MeloniDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN FACING COLLECTIVE ADVERSITY2012 • Rachel KronickDownload Free PDFView PDFDancing with the devil, or necessary dialogue?

This worrying trend threatens democracy, development, peace and stability. The devastating effects of the violence have various affected Kenyan children and youth. A section of Kenyan youths determined to prevent the country from receding to the violent conflict have (re)conceptualized and (re)formulated graffiti as an alternative weapon for social transformation. The physical space has become the rostrum of civic advocacy and citizen participation, as the youth (re)frame graffiti to engage the populace and political leadership into national consciousness and moral accountability. Through ethnographic research this study advances a typology of the unique contribution of graffiti to struggle for social change and contention, which is distinct from more traditional social activism and protests. In particular, the study explores the ways in which graffiti reflects a particular identity of youth agency, activism and advocacy that values daring, risk, rebelliousness, ingenuity, commitment, and sacrifice, while at the same time reflecting particular aesthetics that are adored by the public.Download Free PDFView PDFManaging Street Children - A holistic ApproachJeketule SokoDownload Free PDFView PDFRESEARCH PAPER BY LLB, LLM ADV, EMMANUEL KIMEYAN ASSESEMENT OF THE PROTECTION OF CHILD RIGHTS IN TANZANIA: LAW AND PRACTISE2021 • Prince ManuelDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Anthropology of  Learning in Childhood (pp. 443-463) Children’s learning in new settings. 2010 • David F LancyDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
