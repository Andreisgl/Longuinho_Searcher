The focus is on contact and common developments in the prehistoric period. Words showing the earmarks of loanwords datable to Roman times or the Middle Ages are excluded. Most of the remaining collection predates Grimm’s Law. This and further linguistic criteria are consistent with contexts before ~500 BC. The evidence and analysis here lead to the following explanatory hypothesis. Metal-poor Scandinavia’s sustained demand for resources led to a prolonged symbiosis with the Atlantic façade and Central Europe during the Bronze Age. Complementary advantages of the Pre-Germanic North included Baltic amber and societies favourably situated and organized to build seagoing vessels and recruit crews for long-distance maritime expeditions. An integral dimension of this long-term network was intense contact between the Indo-European dialects that became Celtic and those that became Germanic. The Celto-Germanic vocabulary—like the motifs shared by Iberian stelae and Scandinavian rock art—illuminates this interaction, opening a window onto the European Bronze Age. Much of the word stock can be analyzed as shared across still mutually intelligible dialects rather than borrowed between separate languages. In this respect, what is revealed resembles more the last gasp of Proto-Indo-European than a forerunner of the Celtic–Germanic confrontations of the post-Roman Migration Period and Viking Age. This 2020 edition puts into the public domain some first fruits of a cross-disciplinary research project that will continue until 2023. https://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Centre/2020/Celto-Germanic2020.pdfSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAdorantenRock art and Celto-Germanic vocabulary: Shared iconography and words as reflections of Bronze Age contact2019 • John KochRecent discoveries in the chemical and isotopic sourcing of metals and ancient DNA have transformed our understanding of the Nordic Bronze Age in two key ways. First, we find that Scandinavia and the Iberian Peninsula were in contact within a system of long-distance exchange of Baltic amber and Iberian copper. Second, by the Early Bronze Age, mass migrations emanating from the Pontic-Caspian steppe had reached both regions, probably bringing Indo-European languages with them. In the light of these discoveries, we launched a research project in 2019 — ‘Rock art, Atlantic Europe, Words & Warriors (RAW)’ — based at the University of Gothenburg and funded by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet). The RAW project undertakes an extensive programme of scanning and documentation to enable detailed comparison of the strikingly similar iconography of Scandinavian rock art and Iberian ‘warrior’ stelae. A linguistic aspect of this cross-disciplinary project is to re-examine the inherited word stock shared by Celtic and Germanic, but absent from the other Indo-European languages, exploring how these words might throw light onto the world of meaning of Bronze rock art and the people who made it. This paper presents this linguistic aspect of the RAW project and some preliminary findings.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Indo-European Studies Monograph Series, No. 58Indo-European "Smith" and his divine colleagues2010 • Václav BlažekDownload Free PDFView PDFINDO-EUROPEAN AND THE INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGES INDO-EUROPEAN HYPOTHESISLyla AqromyDownload Free PDFView PDFIEclass_JIES2007.pdfVáclav BlažekDownload Free PDFView PDFBeyond Indo EuropeanPre Indo European vocabulary, the mass comparison of Indo European, Afro Asiatic, Dene Caucasian and othersMariam KrajncThis part of our work has been released copyright free, provided that original credit is given.

These historic models were sometimes biased towards written history, which isn't always accurate. We have searched maps to find consistency between certain types of archaeological sites and the words used to name them. We have found some consistency between Afro Asiatic words and different archaeological site types in Britain. There are other associations between different types of Celtic word and other archaeological sites, but we can't tell if the language used was actually Celtic, or a predecessor to Celtic which was predecessor to Celtic. The first Neolithic culture in England was the Windmill Hill culture, which wasn't connected to the earlier spread of Neolithic technology from Dingle in South West Ireland. The province of Munster provides an important key to understanding the spread of Celtic identity. There was Mesolithic settlement in Munster, and then early Neolithic finds were discovered on the Dingle Peninsula. It is believed that from here, the Neolithic technology went to Connaught, then to the Irish Sea and to Wales and the Isle of Man. This is consistent with the spread of Gaelic, the most archaic Gaelic dialects are spoken in Munster, alongside the most Ogham stones. The Isle of Man also has a lot of Ogham stones, so we can assume an early Irish influence. There are also Ogham stones in Wales, and evidence that West Wales and Anglesey were historically Irish, implying that the Goidelic languages had a lot to do with the founding of Celtic elements in West Britain. The spread of Bronze Age technology also went from the copper mines in Munster, to the gold mines elsewhere in Ireland, and to the copper and gold mines in Wales and parts of England. There is a very clear west to east movement of trade and technology, which is not the same cultural matrix as the east to west spread of the Neolithic via England. The Windmill Hill culture was concentrated in Essex and Norfolk, but this also spread to South West England, an example is Wor Barrow in Dorset. *Wor or *war is a root that can be connected to the Finnish word for mountain, vuori, and the Afro Asiatic word *war-which means to grow or increase. This word has symbolic connotations and seems connected to the Neolithic beliefs about the dead and the way that they nourished the land.Download Free PDFView PDFBefore the Branches: towards a new understanding of (Late) Proto-Indo-European and Copper-to-Bronze Age EuropeJohn Kochslides for Bronze Age Seminar Group, Gothenburg, 2 December 2015, based on research developed in the AHRC-funded Atlantic Europe in the Metal Ages (AEMA) projectDownload Free PDFView PDFInsular EtymologiesMerlijn De SmitThis draft has been submitted to a journal, but I would welcome any comments on it. It deals with the etymologies of some terms for coastal and island geography in Finnic and Saami, focusing on (supposed) substrate vocabulary but also some other terms. I'm very happy with some of my suggestions, whereas with others I'm a bit on thin ice.
