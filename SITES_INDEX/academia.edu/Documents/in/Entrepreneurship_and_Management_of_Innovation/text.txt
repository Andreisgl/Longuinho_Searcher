First he views technologies as combinations of components or parts, put together for a particular purpose (such as jet engine technology being composed of a system of sub-parts designed to provide propulsion to aircraft). Second this broad assembly of parts is organized around a core principle (e.g. a jet engine burns fuel), which in turn is derived from a natural phenomena (e.g. fuel combustion). In this way, Arthur views technology as a long chain of artefacts starting at the phenomena, and ending in the designed purpose. Third, Arthur adds a further dimension to this hierarchy by introducing a complex interactive human system to describe the mechanisms through which this technological system evolves over time. Variation is introduced as designers and engineers make new combinations of parts to solve new and existing problems. If interpreted as successful these designs...Save to LibraryDownloadby Dermot Breslin•  2  Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationStrategic Management of Agribusiness: Determinants and TrendsIntense changes have arisen in global agriculture, yielding a new market reality that is more complex and competitive than before.

To confront these changes, a renewed perspective on the practice of agribusiness management is necessary. However, studies in this critical line of research are scant. This study updated the outlook on the strategic management of agribusiness in Taiwan by conducting in-depth interviews with 10 expert agrientrepreneurs. The results indicated that agribusiness strategies can be categorised as targeting one of three dimensions: the external environment, the internal environment, and sustainable development. This paper discusses each dimension in detail and suggests five broader trends of strategic management.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hsiu-Ping  Yueh•  6  Business, Agribusiness, Sustainable Development, Strategic ManagementFostering Connections in a Lattice OrganizationAdaptive Space can be thought of the relational and emotional freedom for people to freely explore, exchange, and debate ideas.

(Arena 2019) The values and design of W. L. Gore & Associates have created the conditions for personal freedom and fulfillment, as well as the free flow of ideas as evidenced by Gore’s repeated acknowledgement as a “Great Place to Work” and its record for prolific innovation.This glimpse into the Gore practices that create adaptive space include a practical description of the practices, examples of how each practice led to successful innovation, and implications for human resources and organizational professionals. The focus is on practices that create the space to foster four types of connections most potent for innovation: discovery, development, diffusion, and disruption.  Gore fosters each of these with approaches that amplify rather than inhibit the freedom for people to work together to transform their ideas into innovative, customer-valued products.Save to LibraryDownloadby Debra France•  4  Organizational Development, Entrepreneurship and Management of Innovation, Organizational Design and Structure, Innovation & Change ManagementInnovation topics under debate at the EC: the opinions of Italian entrepreneurs, academics and policy makersSave to LibraryDownloadby Stefania Testa•  3  Entrepreneurship, Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationThe innovation dilemma of the Ghanaian textile industryPage 1. 228 Int.

Moving from ‘behind the closed doors’ style of innovating to open innovation where collaboration with outsiders is encouraged, organizations are in the pursuit of more effective ways to accelerate their innovation outcomes. As a result, organizations are establishing creative and entrepreneurial ecosystems, which not only empower employees but also involve many others to co-create new solutions. In this paper, we present a methodology for organizing hackathons, i.e. competition-based events where small teams work over a short period of time to ideate, design, prototype and test their ideas following a user-centric approach to solve a specific challenge. This paper also provides insights into two different hackathons organized in the United Kingdom, and Mexico, as well as a series of 5 hackathons organized in Argentina, Mexico, Switzerland, United Kingdom and in Senegal.Save to LibraryDownloadby Matic Golob•  18  Entrepreneurship, Service Design, Management of Innovation, Experience DesignExploring intergenerational influence on entrepreneurial intention: the mediating role of perceived desirability and perceived feasibilitySave to LibraryDownloadby Shumaila Yousafzai•  2  Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationHistory, theory and evidence of entrepreneurial marketing - An overviewSave to LibraryDownloadby Reinhard Schulte and +1Claes Hultman•  11  Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Business Administration, Social SciencesDoes free/open source software enable new forms of entrepreneurship?

However, an effective response to this challenge much depends on how typical products are marketed through the internet to an international audience. This paper introduces a methodology for evaluating web interfaces of e-commerce systems of agrifood SMEs operating in an lagging rural region. The methodology has been applied to a regional survey where it is considered a sample of SMEs located in Calabria, a South Italy region. The collected data has been statistically analysed in order to get results on levels of B2C e-commerce adoption. A particular study is addressed to a classification of e-commerce interfaces depending on both SME’s stage in the industry and the way how SME’s ‘typical producer’ status is perceived by potential customersSave to LibraryDownloadby Salvatore Ammirato•  6  Rural Development, Business and Management, B2C E-commerce, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationTheory and evidence on mergers and acquisitions by small and medium enterprisesSave to LibraryDownloadby Utz Weitzel•  7  Business and Management, Merger and Acquisition, Small and Medium Enterprise, Small and Medium Size EnterpriseComparative Concepts of Technology for Strategic ManagementTechnology is a complex system, composed of more than one entity and a relationship that holds between each entity and at least one other entity in the system, to satisfy needs, achieve goals, and solve problems of adopters to take... moreTechnology is a complex system, composed ofmore than one entity and a relationship thatholds between each entity and at least oneother entity in the system, to satisfy needs,achieve goals, and solve problems of adopters totake advantage of important opportunities or tocope with consequential environmental threats forpurposes of adaptation and/or survival in highlydifferentiated and volatile environments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mario Coccia•  20  Technology, Economics of Innovation, Patents, Management of InnovationEntrepreneurial innovation problems associated with the dynamic growth of university spin-outs in China: a capabilities perspectiveSave to LibraryDownloadby Tim Minshall•  2  Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationLeading transformation in a family-owned business: insights from an Italian companySave to LibraryDownloadby Filomena  Canterino•  2  Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationBarış Kültürü ve Eğitimi ÇalıştayıSave to LibraryDownloadby Gamze Sart•  272  Economics, Teaching and Learning, Education, Educational TechnologyCreativity and entrepreneurial intention in young people Empirical insights from business school studentsThe authors examine the link between creativity and entrepreneurial intention in young people and the roles that family and education may play in encouraging this link.

The results from a survey of 180 undergraduate business school students show that the more creative young people consider themselves to be, the higher are their entrepreneurial intentions. Students&#39; creativity also fully mediates the effect of family support for creativity on their entrepreneurial intention. Support for creativity in the university is found to have no effect on their creativity or on their entrepreneurial intention. Entrepreneurship course attendance moderates the effect of individual creativity on entrepreneurial intention.Save to LibraryDownloadby Constantine Andriopoulos•  3  THE ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN INNOVATION, Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationKnowledge, theory and practice in knowledge management: between associative patterning and context-rich actionSave to LibraryDownloadby Alex Bennet•Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationImpact of organizational culture on employees’ job performanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Fakhar Shahzad•  20  Business, Management, Finance, EconomicsPlatform-based sustainable business models: reducing food waste in food servicesSave to LibraryDownloadby Malla Mattila•  2  Business and Management, Entrepreneurship and Management of InnovationThe Impact of Organizational Culture on Employees Performance: An overviewThe primaryobjective of this paper is to determine the impact of organizational culture on the employees’ performance in the telecommunication sector in Afghanistan.

Researchers try to apply and adopt previously used questionnaires for the purpose. Both independent variable organizational culture and dependent variable employee performance is divided to their sub-elements to measure them in the targeted organization. As this topic has not been discussed methodically in the context of Afghanistan, therefore, it is perceived vital to conduct such a research and encourage the selected sector for improvement through recommendation.The target population of this research is employees in the telecommunication sector which are about 2000 workforces. This study includes 211 employees of various telecommunication companies in Afghanistan which are selected randomly.

This study has included a quantitative survey research design. The study collected 386 sample responses from faculty members using the purposive sampling technique. The PLS-SEM analysis was used for data analysis through SmartPLS version 3.2.9. The results have shown that employee behaviour has a positive and significant effect on ER, IR, and WLB; workplace stress has a positive and significant effect on anxiety; workplace stress has a positive and significant effect on time stress, and workplace stress has a negative and significant effect on work-life balance. Furthermore, the study recommends using person-centered stress management techniques for possible work-life stress and employee well-being.
