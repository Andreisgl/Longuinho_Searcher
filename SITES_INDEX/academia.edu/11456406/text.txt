GilbertResearch and teaching concerning Digital Media & Learning (DML) should not be the sole responsibility of one university department or program. Developing effective programs must be a partnership between various stakeholders seeking to design coursework, spaces for interaction, and collaborative projects. Recognizing that the undertaking must acknowledge individual situations and contexts, we explore the viability of our collaborative, interdisciplinary venture to build a comprehensive DML program at a traditional university. Research, models of DML across the country, previous experience integrating digital media for learning, and consciously navigating the reality of culture, policies, and challenges in education informs our work. In this working example we detail the existing structures, institutional offerings, nurtured relationships, challenges and early successes from our endeavor. We invite critique and scholarly conversation towards considering similar models across institutions, disciplines, and settings.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWhat have we learned and how have we learned it?

The multi-disciplinary project featured five universities from across Europe: the University of Vic (Spain), Tampere University of Applied Sciences (Finland), Liepaja University (Latvia), the University of Lincoln (United Kingdom) and HKU Hilversum (Netherlands) – and was designed to develop new pedagogical frameworks that might encourage collaborative approaches to teaching and learning. This paper will focus primarily on the implementation of a number of digital tools during the pre-workshop phase, in addition to highlighting the key educational aspects of the project.Download Free PDFView PDFMERLOT Journal of Online  …Toward a Philosophy of Multimedia in the Online Classroom: Aligning Multimedia Use with Institutional Goals2009 • Jean Mandernach, Amber Dailey-HebertDownload Free PDFView PDFInstructional-Design Theories and Models, Volume IV: The Learner-Centered Paradigm of EducationCollaborative production of digital media: A New design for the classroom2016 • Breanne K Litts, TJ KalaitzidisIn 2006, a group of learning theorists predicted an upcoming “decade of synergy” during which scholars would synthesize diverse learning research to transform the design of education (Bransford et al., 2006). This synergy is well underway, especially in the field of literacy learning: the New Literacy Studies (Gee, 2011; Lankshear & Knobel, 2007), recent scholarship concerning informal, digital cultures (Ito et al., 2010; Jenkins, Purushotma, Clinton, Weigel, & Robison, 2006), and “situative” developments in learning theory (Harel & Papert, 1991; Wenger, 1998) all describe becoming literate as involving production, community, and authenticity. From these perspectives, literacy means doing, becoming, and being, not just knowing. In this chapter, we take up Bransford et al.’s call for synthesis to describe a convergent “New Literacies” perspective (Lankshear & Knobel, 2011) on instructional design. In the following sections, we operationalize this perspective to assemble a New Literacies pedagogical framework intended to engage learners in collaborative, creative, interest-driven, and production-oriented digital media projects that enable them to become active participants within and beyond the classroom.Download Free PDFView PDFE-Learning and Digital MediaDigital collaboration inside and outside educational systems2015 • Eli-Marie D DrangeThis article takes its outset in findings from an ongoing research project investigating the use of digital and multimodal resources in teacher education (TE) in Norway. The material studied is mandatory assignments in different courses in TE, asking how teacher students collaborate through digital media in their production of texts for learning, and how the design of these literacy practices can be influenced through the teachers’ design of the assignments. In focus group interviews the researchers found that the students preferred organizing collaborative processes through Facebook groups rather than through the university’s learning management system. This created a space between formal and informal learning, often mediated by “power users” performing a curatorial function on behalf of the group. Furthermore, the quality of the processes seemed to depend on how the assignments were designed for different modes and for individual or group work. The tasks that inspired genuine coll...Download Free PDFView PDF2018: A Framework for Digital Media Literacies for Teaching and Learning in Higher EducationDr Jorge ReynaAcross a broad range of subjects in higher education institutions, students are required to complete assessment tasks that involve the production of digital artefacts. Examples include podcasts, digital stories, animations, video, and blended media. To produce effective digital artefacts, one must be digitally literate. This requires a certain set of technical, audio-visual, behavioural, critical and social skills. In this article, the authors propose a framework that can be used to develop digital media literacies and train students in digital media creation. The framework considers three interdependent domains: conceptual, functional, and audio-visual. A series of examples will be provided to illustrate the importance and interdependent nature of these domains. Implications of the framework on student training is discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFEmbedding Media in the Higher Education Learner Experience: Is it Just a ‘Matter of Time’?Lisa O'NeillLearning in the technological age has been transformed both by knowledge-producing systems and by the systems of knowledge produced. To examine the alignment of formal learning environments to our everyday technology experiences, this qualitative case study was conducted to identify program level essential conditions for effectively embedding media in situated instruction to improve learner experiences. Two areas of particular interest were (a) how informal technologies influence the use and implementation of technologies in formal settings, and (b) how an individual judges what is useful in an information technology system. This case study responded to the research question What are the essential conditions to effectively embed media in the higher education learner experience? Data gathered and analyzed on learner-directed study habits and findings were utilized to redesign faculty-directed activities, to uncover the value and impact of embedded and augmented media in context. Learner participants contributed logs of media use and attended a focus group interview to map their augmented and embedded use of media. Semi-structured interviews provided data, which was mapped to values and beliefs about teaching with media in this context. This report of findings details and expands upon the conclusion that identifying applicable opportunities that are associated with faculty approaches and aligned with faculty beliefs, when supported appropriately by the institution, create best practices that may further influence the embedding of media in learner experiences. It is recommended that communication networks within a community of practice be put in place to support the effective embedding of media technology for teaching and learning in higher education. Learners are well versed in how to augment instruction with self-directed learning, and learners are eager to participate in this community of practice to contribute exemplars for discussion and inclusion in the curriculum.Download Free PDFView PDFDigital Scholarship in the HumanitiesDigital Learning in an Undergraduate Context: Promoting Long-Term Student–Faculty Place-Based Collaboration2015 • Katherine FaullDownload Free PDFView PDFCompletely Out of My Domain: An Institutional Narrative of Multimedia Collaboration2015 • Erik  EllisDownload Free PDFView PDF12th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation Conference ProceedingsAll hands on deck: A case study of the collaboration of an academic and team of digital experts on a technology-enhanced version of a second-year communications course2019 • Roger Dawkins, Lynnae VenaruzzoMany researchers are focused on addressing the "engagement problem": how to increase student engagement with online content in a flipped model of learning. This is a perpetual problem given learning environments are constantly changing due to technological innovation. Using technology to create technology-enhanced learning environments (TEL) to increase student engagement, satisfaction and achievement and promote self-regulated learning practices/behaviours in the student cohort, a subsequent research question arises: what outcomes emerge from team-based curriculum design (TBCD) involving academics and experts, such as user-experience designers and learning scientists? This presentation describes a project at Western Sydney University in Australia that aimed to: (1) implement and evaluate an innovative TEL environment in a flipped and blended undergraduate media course; and (2) critically review a model of TBCD engagement; and (3) explore opportunities for scalability to other units at the university. Key features of the case study will be discussed, which include choice of technology to support the design of the innovative TEL environment, analysis of observational data from the perspective of the TBCD team, and analysis of student analytics and feedback data from surveys. Preliminary findings are indicating increased student participation and engagement with learning materials within the TEL environment. In addition, the TBCD partnership has provided critical insights into the practice of members of the team, and the emerging model may have future applications within other disciplines. This study aims to contribute to existing research into the nature and implications of a paradigm shift for academics' training and digital literacy, issues/barriers to flipped models of learning, and more generally in terms of the (changing) role of the academic in contemporary higher education contexts.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
