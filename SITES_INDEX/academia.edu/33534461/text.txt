In order to explore the content of the texts, this study is concerned with the analysis of two texts with the use of three meanings in functional grammar, such as experiential, interpersonal and textual meanings. This research is conducted by using the descriptive qualitative method as it aims to describe the structural organization, textual, experiential and interpersonal meaning and also the analysis of clause complexes from different test series of the English national examination. The SFG analysis asserts that structurally, Text A and Text B have a similar framework with regards the text organization. Textually, the theme in both texts is dominated by the unmarked topical themes. Experientially, the dominant process in these texts is material processes. It indicates that both texts are generally concerned with actions and events and the participants involved in the texts. Interpersonally, the mood types of Texts A and B are dominated by the declarative mood, which can help provide information and present arguments for or against in the texts. Finally, in terms of clause complex analysis, Text A tends to use more clause complexes rather than Text B. All in all, the analysis of texts in the educational field by using functional grammar can help evaluate particular texts grammatically.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLanguage, Literature & Society 2016Listening Comprehension Problems of Thai University English Learners2016 • Andy N CubalitThis research investigated, identified, and analyzed listening comprehension problems of EIC students in RMUTL, Phitsanulok Campus. It also answered the following questions: 1) What are the listening comprehension problems encountered by EIC students related to the listening text, the speaker, and the listener? 2) What strategies do EIC students use to resolve their listening comprehension problems? While schools and universities are trying to put efforts in developing English education in Thailand, a number of studies have shown that the achievement of Thai learners was unsatisfactory. As English is being used as an international medium of communication, numerous factors hamper the success of English language learning. Emphasis is given more to reading, writing, and grammar than to listening and speaking. Students had very minimal opportunities to exercise spoken English resulting to having a poor listening and speaking skills. The findings indicated that most participants encountered English listening problems related to the listening text, the speaker, and the listener at a high level. Other factors contributing to listening difficulties of EIC learners were the lack of opportunity to practice and use their English skills. Cubalit, A, (2016).

Number 3 September 20192019 • Arab World English Journal  (AWEJ)In the present study, with the aim of analyzing the relationship among teacher feedback, feedforward, and grade, the corrections and comments made by four experienced assessors on 187 compositions were under scrutiny. These essays were written by 56 Swedish university students studying English as a second language at three different educational levels. The results reveal that while there were clear links between mid-essay corrections/comments and grades given, the links between mid-essay corrections/comments and end comments were not only comparatively few, but less clear. Moreover, although valued highly in the research literature because of their ability to promote writing skills in an enhanced manner, there were more summative end comments than formative ones. The conclusion was, therefore, drawn that it is quite taxing for assessors, even for experienced ones, to produce connections that involve an alignment among a) mid-essay corrections/comments, b) end comments and c) grade that will, at the same time, promote students’ writing skills in accordance with what is suggested by the research literature. The assessors were, however, irrespective of grade given, attuned to the educational level at hand, focusing more on analytic aspects at the two lower levels, while taking a more holistic approach at the highest educational level. This may indicate that offering corrections/comments does not only entail a developmental journey for students, but for teachers too.Download Free PDFView PDFEducating for a Just Society: The 41st Association of Literacy Educators and Researchers YearbookPerceptions of L1 and L2 Proficiency: Analyzing Adolescent English Learners’ Lived Experiences with Language2019 • Kelli BippertStudents identified as English language learners enter school with a range of language experiences not only in English, but in their home languages. The research questions in this qualitative study were 1) how are students positioned in their L1 and L2 use at home, school, and the larger community, and 2) what do students’ positions reveal about their perceived proficiency in L1 and L2? Focus group interviews and student reflective journals were analyzed, revealing five overarching themes: evidence of subtractive educational mindset, a socially constructivist approach to language acquisition, anxiety associated with language use, positionalities in English, and posi- tionalities in Spanish. Student perceived proficiency in L1 and L2 were dependent upon the environment and the language used (L1 or L2).Download Free PDFView PDFArab Word English Journal Volume 8 Number 3 2017 Full IssueArab World English Journal  (AWEJ)Abstract Non-native English-speaking students at, or about to enter British Universities and other Western universities where the language of instruction is English may experience challenges with academic writing, often one of the most important means of assessing students. Pre-sessional and in-sessional English academic writingcourses have been developed to aid students, and traditionally covered a range of topics. This paper discusses essential ‘pre-writing’ tasks. It then outlines some of the essential elements of academic writing; these often focus on paragraph structure, basic components of an essay, and different functional types of essays. Other features covered by this paper include aspects of language such as level of formality, cohesive devices, caution and hedging, supplying evidence, and avoiding plagiarism, amongst others. This paper also emphasizes the growing importance of collaborative learning, critical thinking and autonomous leaning which may be insufficiently familiar to students from non-Western learning environments where traditionally factual recall is given the greatest importance. Inductive and deductive approaches to paragraph organization, and also essay development have also been introduced. These approaches may also contrast with the rhetorical features familiar to non-native students from various cultures around the world and require special attention. Contemporary pre-sessional courses are also becoming more specialized, targeting English suitable for specific sets of disciplines at the undergraduate at postgraduate level. For example, courses focusing in STEM subjects (science technology, engineering and mathematics) are replacing more ‘generic’ academic English courses.Download Free PDFView PDFUsing Video Recorded Corpus to Analyze Classroom Interactions in Elementary School EFL ClassesZehra GabillonThis paper describes an interaction analysis study, which was carried out in a French Polynesian elementary school context. The corpus for the study was gathered via video recordings during an extensive educational project. This project aimed at collecting corpora on various school subjects from French Polynesian elementary schools between the years 2014-2017. The researchers used ATLAS.ti, a Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) to analyse the classroom interactions collected from six elementary school teachers' EFL classes. The study attempted: a) to discover common teaching strategies and techniques the teachers employed; b) to understand the effects the teachers' actions on the learners, and c) to determine whether the teachers' teaching methodologies were in concordance with today's foreign language teaching approaches. The study used both comprehensive and descriptive data analysis methods. The transcribed data were examined by focusing on both verbal and nonverbal classroom interventions. The codes were generated by studying both classroom exchanges and video recordings. The analysed data were presented using interpretations of individual instances, examples, paradigms, and frequencies.Download Free PDFView PDFAsian EFL JournalMOOC Camps for Teacher Professional Development: The Philippine Experience2018 • Romualdo MabuanMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are dramatically reconfiguring and redefining teacher training. With MOOCs’ ubiquity, openness and accessibility, they have become a new platform for teacher professional development across the globe. Utilizing an ethnographic approach, this study examined aspects of memories, perspectives and experiences of the 17 MOOC participants (4 university instructors and 13 high school teachers) in Manila, the Philippines who successfully completed three MOOCs sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and administered by Family Health International and World Learning via Canvas (www.canvas.net) as the MOOC platform. The completed MOOCs were: Teaching Grammar Communicatively (September 25 – October 29, 2017), Integrating Critical Thinking into the Exploration of Culture in an EFL Setting (February 5 – March 26, 2018), and Using Educational Technology in the English Language Classroom (April 16 – May 21, 2018). Data from individual reflections, journals and focus group discussions revealed that, in general, the participants viewed MOOCs as a practical and effective means for professional development because of their open, free and flexible features, while MOOC camps are seen as a community of practice that engages MOOC participants and sustains their motivation in completing the courses successfully. Furthermore, participants’ aims for completing the courses were drawn: to get certification, to have access to quality open educational resources, to participate in a new mode of learning, to acquire new knowledge and skills, inter alia. Andragogical and pedagogical implications are provided in the light of these findings.Download Free PDFView PDFArab World English Journal (AWEJ) Volume 9. Number 1. March 2018Arab World English Journal  (AWEJ)Despite the widespread consensus among researchers that readers whose first language is Arabic frequently experience major difficulties with word recognition when reading in English, there is little research into the strategic behaviour of first language (L1) Arabic readers when encountering unknown vocabulary in texts written in English. This paper reports a study designed to contribute to our understanding of the types of reading strategy employed by L1 Arabic speakers when reading in English and in particular the types of knowledge sources and contextual clues they rely on when encountering unfamiliar English words. The following research questions were addressed: 1. What are the principle lexical processing strategies employed by Arabic-speaking university students when encountering unfamiliar vocabulary in academic English texts? 2. To what extent does the employment of these lexical processing strategies result in successful identification of the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary? A pre-test was conducted to provide a measure of the participants’ overall reading proficiency and to ensure the unfamiliarity of the target words. Subsequently, individual reading tasks with concurrent think-aloud sessions were conducted to enable the identification of lexical processing strategies. Two main findings emerged: first, the participants in this study made use of three strategies when dealing with unfamiliar vocabulary; second, these strategies were frequently employed in a noticeably ineffective manner and, in consequence, many of the participants’ attempts at inferencing were conspicuously unsuccessful. The pedagogical implications of these findings are briefly discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFEDUCATING FOR CHANGE The European Conference on Education The European Conference on Language LearningRasha Osman Abdel HaliemDownload Free PDFView PDFShallow Semantic Parsing of Persian Sentences2009 • Azam EstajiDownload Free PDFView PDFYour eyes are beautiful; a study of compliment responses in Persian2010 • Azam EstajiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
