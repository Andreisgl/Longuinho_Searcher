Polyethylene bags with different number of perforations (3, 4 and 6) were used in this experiment. Headspace oxygen concentration, respiration, weight loss, surface color, firmness, pH, and soluble solid content were examined throughout storage. It was observed, that all the investigated packages were equally effective in maintaining the quality of carrot slices. There was no symptom of decay till the end of the experiment. In addition, pH, soluble solid content and firmness showed only minor change. Moreover, weight loss of carrot slices was below 2 % after 12 days of storage. Thus, perforation modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has been proved to be efficient in maintaining the quality of slice carrot.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Food EngineeringA model to predict shelf-life in air and darkness of cut, ready-to-use, fresh carrots under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions2007 • B.

However, as O2 and/or CO2 values that might cause injury are strictly related to the commodity, they should be optimized for each product. Here three study cases are reported about the application of modified atmospheres (MA), with different CO2 concentrations (0-40 kPa), to table grapes (cv. Italia) and sweet cherries (cv. Ferrovia) and, as short-term treatment (48 h at 0 °C), to fresh-cut artichokes (cv. Violet de Provence). In each trial, the effect of high CO2 treatment on quality parameters was observed during cold storage. Concerning table grape “Italia”, our results show that low CO2 (up to 10kPa) MA preserved the quality and sensory parameters of the fruit, whereas high CO2 (&gt; 20 kPa) caused a fermenta...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of FoodservicePhysico-chemical qualities of minimally processed carrot stored under vacuum2007 • Ada RochaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
