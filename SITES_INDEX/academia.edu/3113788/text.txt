The Danish town of Aalborg is to Flyvbjerg what Florence was to Machiavelli: a laboratory for understanding the real workings of power, and for grasping what they mean to our more general concerns of social and political organization. Politics, administration, and planning are examined in ways that allow a rare, in-depth understanding. The reader witnesses, firsthand, the classic and endless drama which defines what modernity and democracy are and can be.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIn Scott Campbell and Susan S. Fainstein, eds., Readings in Planning Theory, 3rd edition, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 318-329Rationality and Power2003 • Bent FlyvbjergThe Aalborg Project may be interpreted as a metaphor of modern politics, modern administration and planning, and of modernity itself. The basic idea of the project was comprehensive, coherent, and innovative, and it was based on rational and democratic argument. During implementation, however, when idea met reality, the play of Machiavellian princes, Nietzschean will to power, and Foucauldian rationality-as-rationalization resulted in the fragmentation of the project.Download Free PDFView PDFFlyvbjerg Bent Making Social Science MatterGlobal TransitDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Planning Education and Research, vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 353-366 Bringing Power to Planning Research: One Researcher's Praxis Story2002 • Bent FlyvbjergThis article provides an answer to what has been called the biggest problem in theorizing and understanding planning: the ambivalence about power found among planning researchers, theorists, and students. The author narrates how he came to work with issues of power and gives an example of how the methodology he developed for power studies—phronetic planning research—may be employed in practice. Phronetic planning research follows the tradition of power studies running from Machiavelli and Nietzsche to Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu. It focuses on four value-rational questions: (1) Where are we going with planning? (2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What should be done? These questions are exemplified for a specific instance of Scandinavian urban planning. The author finds that the questions, and their answers, make a difference to planning in practice. They make planning research matter.Download Free PDFView PDFIdeal Theory, Real Rationality: Habermas Versus Foucault and Nietzscheali farrokhiUnderstanding rationality and power are key to understanding actual political and administrative behavior. Political and administrative theory that ignores this fact stand in danger of being at best irrelevant or, at worst, part of the problem it wishes to solve. The paper presents Jürgen Habermas as an example of a political philosopher who fails to recognize that actual political and administrative rationality largely disrupts the relevance of his ideal prescriptions. Michel Foucault is proposed as an antidote to Habermas in a comparative study of the two. Machiavellian verita effettuale (effective truth) and Nietzschean wirkliche Historie (real history) are seen as more effective means to understand and limit rationalization and power than Habermasian Diskursetik (discourse ethics).Download Free PDFView PDFPOWER AND INTERPRETATIONSanford  Schram, b caterinoChapter 12 from Making Political Science MatterDownload Free PDFView PDFPlanning in Interplace?

We posit an alternative approach based on the power analytics of Michel Foucault which focuses on ‘what is actually done’, as opposed to Habermas’s focus on ‘what should be done’. We discuss how the Foucauldian stance problematises planning, asking difficult questions about the treatment of legitimacy, rationality, knowledge and spatiality. We conclude that Foucault offers a type of analytic planning theory which offers better prospects than does Habermas for those interested in understanding and bringing about democratic social change through planning.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
