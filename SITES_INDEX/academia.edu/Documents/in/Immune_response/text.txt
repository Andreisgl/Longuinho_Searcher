A similar safety and reactogenicity profile was demonstrated for both vaccine regimens, as well as a good immune response for all antigen components. By offering protection against six diseases in a series of single injections, the hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine was shown to be a safe, well tolerated and immunogenic alternative to primary immunization with licensed separately administered vaccines.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ulrich Heininger•  17  Immune response, Biological Sciences, Hepatitis B, HumansTransfected human dendritic cells to induce antitumor immunitySave to LibraryDownloadby hiwa rahimi•  9  Immune response, Gene Therapy, Cancer treatment, Genetic EngineeringImmunogenicity and protective efficacy of tuberculosis subunit vaccines expressing PPE44 (Rv2770c)Save to LibraryDownloadby Kris Huygen•  20  Immune response, Flow Cytometry, Cytokines, ApoptosisEffects of pregnancy-associated Listeria monocytogenes infection : Necrotizing hepatitis due to impaired maternal immune response and significantly increased abortion rateSave to LibraryDownloadby Maja Abram•  21  Pathology, Molecular Biology, Immune response, ImmunohistochemistryA monoclonal antibody that appears to recognize the receptor for human T-cell growth factor; partial characterization of the receptorT-cell growth factor (TCGF or interleukin-2) is an inducible glycoprotein hormone of molecular weight 15,000 (ref. 1) synthesized and secreted by T lymphocytes following activation with antigen or mitogen2,3.

TCGF is required for proliferation and expansion of T cells following antigen encounter4,5 and to maintain them in long-term culture in vitro6-9. Full expression of the human immune response requires both the induction of TCGF synthesis and the formation of specific TCGF membrane receptors10,11. Monoclonal antibodies binding TCGF have been prepared12,13. In contrast, antibodies specific for the TCGF membrane receptor have not been identified, nor has the receptor been characterized. We have prepared a monoclonal antibody, termed anti-Tac14,15, which appears to bind to the human membrane receptor for TCGF. In support of this, we now demonstrate that anti-Tac suppresses TCGF induced proliferation of T cells and blocks binding of radiolabelled TCGF to cells from a cloned human continuous T-cell line. Also we have partially purified and characterized the putative TCGF receptor. This receptor is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight (Mr) of 47,000-53,000.Save to LibraryDownloadby joel depper•  9  Immune response, Multidisciplinary, Nature, HumansComparative and phylogenetic analysis of α-l-fucosidase genesSave to LibraryDownloadby Maria-Elisa Perotti•  26  Genetics, Immune response, Comparative sequence analysis, Molecular EvolutionGemcitabine exerts a selective effect on the humoral immune response: implications for combination chemo-immunotherapyMost cytotoxic drugs have gross effects on the immune system, such as neutropenia and lymphopenia.

However, their effects on tumor-specific immune responses are unknown. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is frequently used to treat non-small cell lung cancer. It is also active in other malignancies, either alone or in combination with cisplatin. Here, we investigate its effects on antigen-specific antitumor immunity using a murine tumor cell line transfected to express influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). CD4(+), CD8(+), and B220(+) lymphocyte numbers all decreased during chemotherapy (120 microg/g, i.p., every third day for five doses), but B cells were selectively depleted. Gemcitabine induced a profound suppression of the IgG antibody response to HA, and this was unrelated to tumor size. In contrast, in vitro T-lymphocyte recall responses to the class I- and class II-restricted dominant peptide epitopes of HA were enhanced in tumor-bearing, gemcitabine-treated mice.

A... moreAbstract: Many different bacterial species produce lipases which hydrolyze esters of glycerol with preferably long-chain fatty acids. They act at the interface generated by a hydrophobic lipid substrate in a hydrophilic aqueous medium. A characteristic property of lipases is called interfacial activation, meaning a sharp increase in lipase activity observed when the substrate starts to form an emulsion, thereby presenting to the enzyme an interfacial area. As a consequence, the kinetics of a lipase reaction do not follow the classical Michaelis-Menten model. With only a few exceptions, bacterial lipases are able to completely hydrolyze a triacylglycerol substrate although a certain preference for primary ester bonds has been observed. Numerous lipase assay methods are available using coloured or fluorescent substrates which allow spectroscopic and fluorimetric detection of lipase activitiy. Another important assay is based on titration of fatty acids released from the substrate. Newly developed methods allow to exactly determine lipase activity via controlled surface pressure or by means of a computer-controlled oil drop tensiometer. The synthesis and secretion of lipases by bacteria is influenced by a variety of environmental factors like ions, carbon sources, or presence of non-metabolizable polysaccharides. The secretion pathway is known for Pseudomonas lipases with P. aeruginosa lipase using a two-step mechanism and P. fluorescens lipase using a one-step mechanism. Additionally, some Pseudomonas lipases need specific chaperone-like proteins assisting their correct folding in the periplasm. These lipase-specific foldases (Lif-proteins) which show a high degree of amino acid sequence homology among different Pseudomonas species are coded for by genes located immediately downstream the lipase structural genes. A comparison of different bacterial lipases on the basis of primary structure revealed only very limited sequence homology. However, determination of the three-dimensional structure of the P. glumae lipase indicated that at least some of the bacterial lipases will presumably reveal a conserved folding pattern called the α/β-hydrolase fold, which has been described for other microbial and human lipases. The catalytic site of lipases is buried inside the protein and contains a serine-protease-like catalytic triad consisting of the amino acids serine, histidine, and aspartate (or glutamate). The Ser-residue is located in a strictly conserved β-ε-Ser-α motif. The active site is covered by a lid-like a-helical structure which moves away upon contact of the lipase with its substrate, thereby exposing hydrophobic residues at the protein's surface mediating the contact between protein and substrate. This movable lid-like α-helix explains at a molecular level the lipase-specific phenomenon of interfacial activation. At least some of the pathogenic bacterial species produce a lipase which has been studied with respect to its role as a virulence factor. Lipases of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis may be involved in colonization and persistence of these bacteria on the human skin. Lipases of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are produced during the bacterial infection process and, at least in vitro, considerably impair the function of different cell types involved in the human immune response like macrophages or platelets. The present state of knowledge suggests to classify the lipases as important bacterial virulence factors which exert their harmful effects in combination with other bacterial enzymes, in particular the phospholipases C. Most of the steadily increasing interest in bacterial lipases is based on their biotechnological applications which are partly based on their potential to catalyze not only hydrolysis but also synthesis of a variety of industrially valuable products. Optically active compounds, various esters and lactones are among the substances synthesized using bacterial lipases. Recently, an important application emerged with the addition of bacterial lipases to household detergents in order to reduce or even replace synthetic detergent chemicals which pose considerable environmental problems. As a main conclusion, [ipases represent an extremely versatile group of bacterial extracellular enzymes that are capable of performing a variety of important reactions, thereby presenting a fascinating field tot future research.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hussien Adnan•  23  Microbiology, Immune response, Protein Folding, KineticsHeavy Metal Ions in Normal Physiology, Toxic Stress, and CytoprotectionAbstract: As a group, heavy metals include both those essential for normal biological functioning (e.g., Cu and Zn), and nonessential metals (e.g., Cd, Hg, and Pb).

Both essential and nonessential metals can be present at concentrations that disturb normal biological functions, and which evoke cellular stress responses. The cellular targets for metal toxicity include tissues of the kidney, liver, heart, and the immune response and nervous systems. Intriguingly, manipulations of specific metals, their reservoirs, and the cellular stress response can have therapeutic effects on certain diseases. In this minireview, we will consider both the biological responses to stressful levels of heavy metal cations, and experimental and clinical manipulations of these cations as a means to improve human health parameters.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lawrence Hightower•  20  Immune response, Vascular Surgery, Multidisciplinary, Heavy metalsSIMPLE DIPSTICK ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF SALMONELLA TYPHI-SPECIFIC IgM ANTIBODIES AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN PATIENTS WITH TYPHOID FEVERApplication of a dipstick assay for the detection of Salmonella typhi-specific IgM antibodies on samples collected from S. typhi or S. paratyphi culture-positive patients at the day of admission to the hospital revealed the presence of... moreApplication of a dipstick assay for the detection of Salmonella typhi-specific IgM antibodies on samples collected from S. typhi or S. paratyphi culture-positive patients at the day of admission to the hospital revealed the presence of specific IgM antibodies in 43.5%, 92.9%, and 100% for samples collected 4-6 days, 6-9 days, and &gt; 9 days after the onset of fever,Save to LibraryDownloadby Marga Goris•  17  Immune response, Indonesia, Adolescent, HumansImmune Responses to Lentiviral VectorsSave to LibraryDownloadby Laura Santambrogio•  13  Immune response, Hemoglobinopathies, Innate immunity, Biological SciencesImmune response induced by recombinant BCG expressing merozoite surface antigen 2 from Plasmodium falciparumSave to LibraryDownloadby Chunfu Zheng•  13  Immune response, Biological Sciences, Mice, AnimalsHuman Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Subtype C Molecular Phylogeny: Consensus Sequence for an AIDS Vaccine Design?Save to LibraryDownloadby S.

Multifactorial evidence suggests that a defect of innate immune response to microbial agents is involved in IBD. This editorial outlines the immunopathogenesis of IBD and their current and future therapy. We present IBD as a result of dysregulated mucosal response in the intestinal wall facilitated by defects in epithelial barrier function and the mucosal immune system with excessive production of cytokines growth factors, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen metabolites, resulting in tissue injury.

In a natural model of tuberculosis, we studied 10 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (non-protective immune response) and 38 healthy household contacts (protective immune response). We tested the lymphocyte proliferative response by T cell Western blotting to eight different antigen fractions and lo two purified mycobacterial antigens of 30 and 64 kD. Patients with active tuberculosis recognized fractions with molecular weights of 80–114, 60–80, 28–41 and 14–19kD. Household contacts recognized the same fractions except the 14–19 kD. The response lo the 64-kD antigen was not significantly different between groups. In contrast, 10% of the patients with active tuberculosis and 73% of the household contacts responded to the 30-kD antigen. The humoral response against the 30-kD antigen by ELISA showed a significantly higher production of antibodies in tuberculosis patients compared with household contacts. We conclude that patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis develop an immune response characterized by poor proliferative response to the 30-kD antigen with a strong humoral response, whereas the opposite occurs in healthy subjects infected by Mycobacterium tuberculoses.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eduardo Ramos•  7  Immunology, Immune response, Family, Innate immunityHIV-1 induced decrease of nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression during in vivo and in vitro infectionSave to LibraryDownloadby Ernesto Cairoli and +1Alfonso Cayota•  15  Immunology, Immune response, Flow Cytometry, HIVPhysiological and proteomic evidences that domestication process differentially modulates the immune status of juvenile Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) under chronic confinement stressSave to LibraryDownloadby Martine Raes and +1C.

A delay of 24–72 h in onset of feeding is quite common in the poultry industry due to variation in hatching time and hatchery treatments. As intestinal development occurs in concert with the development of the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), we investigated the effects of short term feed withholding on development of GALT in broiler hatchlings. GALT activity was determined by antibody production (systemic and locally in the gut), distribution of B and T lymphocytes in the gut, expression of lymphocyte specific genes, and distribution of B and T lymphocytes in the cloacal bursa. Our findings show that while development of GALT in the foregut (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) was only slightly and temporarily impeded by feed withholding, GALT activity in the hindgut and the gut-related cloacal bursa was significantly delayed during the first 2 weeks of life: Systemic and intestinal antibody responses following rectal immunization to antigen were lower, colonization of the hindgut (cecum and colon) by T and B lymphocytes was delayed, as well as the expression of chIL-2 mRNA in hindgut T lymphocytes. We also found that the increase of B and T population size in the cloacal bursa was delayed with time. Full recovery occurred from 2 weeks of age. The 2-week vulnerable period should be seriously considered in circumstances where hatchlings are in transit for extended periods from hatcheries to farms.Save to LibraryDownloadby Enav Bar-Shira•  20  Zoology, Immune response, RNA, Flow CytometryNatural history of HLA expression during tumour developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Susan Glew•  10  Immunology, Immune response, Natural History, ImmunohistochemistryTargeted Deletion of Metalloproteinase 9 Attenuates Experimental Colitis in Mice: Central Role of Epithelial-Derived MMPBackground & Aims: There is mounting evidence that matrix metalloproteinases are the predominant proteinases expressed in the gut mucosa during active inflammatory bowel disease.

We investigated the role of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), a secreted gelatinase that is consistently up-regulated in both animal models and human inflammatory bowel disease and is associated with disease severity, in the pathogenesis of colitis by using mice containing a targeted deletion of the MMP-9 gene. Methods: Dextran sodium sulfate–induced colitis and Salmonella typhimurium–induced enterocolitis were used as animal models to study colitis. Results: MMP-9 activity and protein expression were absent from normal colonic mucosa but were up-regulated during experimental colitis. MMP-9−/− mice exposed to dextran sodium sulfate or salmonella had a significantly reduced extent and severity of colitis. Immunohistochemical studies showed that MMP-9 was localized to epithelial cells and granulocytes during active colitis. The immune response to systemic administration of Salmonella typhimurium was not affected in MMP-9−/− mice. Neutrophil transmigration studies and bone marrow chimeras showed that neutrophil MMP-9 is neither required for its migration nor sufficient to induce tissue damage during colitis and that epithelial MMP-9 is important for tissue damage. MMP-9 inhibited cell attachment and wound healing in the model intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco2-BBE. Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that MMP-9 expressed by epithelial cells may play an important role in the development of colitis by modulating cell–matrix interaction and wound healing. Thus, strategies to inhibit MMP-9 may be of potential therapeutic benefit.Save to LibraryDownloadby mauricio rojas•  29  Immune response, Gastroenterology, Wound Healing, Extracellular MatrixLeeches: Immune Response, Angiogenesis and Biomedical ApplicationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Gianluca Tettamanti•  7  Immune response, Wound Healing, Humans, AnimalsCohort study of the association of antibody levels to AMA 1, MSP 119, MSP 3 and GLURP with protection from clinical malaria in Ghanaian childrenSave to LibraryDownloadby Samuel Bosomprah and +1Kwadwo A Kusi•  18  Immune response, Medical Microbiology, Malaria, GhanaThe immunobiology of CD154–CD40–TRAF interactions in atherosclerosisSave to LibraryDownloadby Linda Beckers•  9  Immunology, Immune response, Atherosclerosis, Signal TransductionNextLast »Related TopicsTabletsFollowFollowingClinical ChemistryFollowFollowingMagnetic Resonance SpectroscopyFollowFollowingVaccinationFollowFollowingCrystallizationFollowFollowingImmunologyFollowFollowingRoger PenroseFollowFollowingNeuroimmunologyFollowFollowingArthur SchopenhauerFollowFollowingInfection and immunityFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
