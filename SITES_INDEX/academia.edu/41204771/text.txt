Relics, reliquaries and liturgical vessels in Venice, ca. 1300-1475, Centro Studi Antoniani, Padova 2019Manlio Leo Mezzacasa2019This book is the first comprehensive study of goldsmiths' art in Venice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The study places the cult of relics in its historical context and scholarly discourse and provides an overview of the types of liturgical vessels crafted in the Middle Ages. It investigates the material and social dimension of the goldsmiths' art in medieval and early-Renaissance Venice, and the role of relics, reliquaries, and liturgical vessels in domestic devotion. This is exemplified through case studies, one of which focuses on an important late-thirteenth-century filigree cross in the Cloisters collection of New York City. The book brings to light several hitherto unstudied objects, and explores new approaches, studying several liturgical vessels in light of developments in contemporary sculpture. The study concludes with an investigation of the Reliquary of St. Martha, made for the female monastery of Santa Marta in Venice by the German goldsmith Zuane Lion in 1472. An introduction by Giovanna Valenzano and foreword by Giovanna Baldissin precede the text. Copious illustrations, many of objects which are not on public display, bring to life the forgotten art of the medieval goldsmith.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNew light on two late-medieval reliquaries from Venice and the Veneto, "Ricche Minere" 10 (2018), pp. 31-55Manlio Leo MezzacasaThis article presents the initial investigation of two overlooked pieces of late medieval sacred goldsmith art: a monstrance-reliquary, now in the Museo del Bargello in Florence (inv. Oreficerie Religiose 65) but originally belonging to the cathedral of Ravenna, passing through an unknown private collection and into the De Carlo collection before reaching its current location. Secondly, a Reliquary of the True Cross held at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. These artefacts – created between the very last years of the fourteenth century and beginning of the following century – can be shown to have unmistakeable and multiple relations to liturgical vessels preserved in Venice and the broader Veneto region. This article finds strong evidence that the Bargello n. 65 artefact was originally a Eucharistic monstrance, and later was adapted into a reliquary for St Lawrence, preserved in the main chapel of the Ravenna cathedral. It shows close relation to several other similar pieces: the Reliquary of St Andrew and the Reliquary of forty-nine relics in the Basilica del Santo in Padua, and the Reliquary of St Lawrence from the Padua cathedral. Each of these goldsmith works share analogous features, and even some identical elements. An identical lost-wax cast figure of the angel which crowns the Florentine reliquary can be found adorning the Reliquary of St Andrew. In addition, the Reliquary of St Lawrence in Padua makes use of architectural features strikingly similar to those of the Florentine reliquary. This strongly suggests that both of them may have been realized in the same workshop, either Venetian or Paduan; in any case, certainly by craftsmen who were heavily influenced by Venetian goldsmiths. The Reliquary of the True Cross in London belongs to the same artistic culture of the above-mentioned artefacts but can be considered an unicum because of the distinctive structure of the frame enshrining the relic, which is likely to be the result of later modifications at an unspecified time. Another (now lost) True cross reliquary once in the church of the Celestia in Venice and rendered in Jan Grevembroch’s Varie Venete Curiosità Sacre e Profane offers valuable points for comparison. The two also share peculiar ways in which the relics are displayed within their cases, respectively. Altogether, these artefacts help extend our knowledge of a period marked by formal and stylistic novelties in every form of art. We can see the goldsmith evolving an artistic language and continually adapting to new tastes, while all the while, adhering to traditional forms and types of liturgical vessels.Download Free PDFView PDFReliquaries and other liturgical vessels in late medieval and early modern Venice: circa 1320-1475.

The Art of Commodities 13th–16th Centuries edited by Ella beaucamp and Philippe Cordez, London/Turnhout 2020, pp. 45-662020 • Manlio Leo MezzacasaWhile the conceptual link between the art of the goldsmith and the category of the commodity — even taking the latter in its most commonly accepted meaning as a ‘type of goods or raw material that is tangible and usable by the market, easily stored and preserved over time’ — may not be immediately clear, it is not unreasonable, as I shall attempt to show here. Venetian goldsmiths’ work in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries represents a wide range of production, a vast market, and a clear identity, with characteristics that allow it to be categorised as a typical Venetian product. An analysis of surviving materials gives us a sense of the scope of production between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, and shows how the art of goldsmithing was of crucial importance for the manufacturing industries of Venice, where a goldsmiths’ guild was established and given a charter (1233) at a particularly early stage.Download Free PDFView PDF'Holy metals': metalworks for private devotion in Renaissance household interiors in Venice, in "Domestic Devotion.

Scattered throughout witness testimony, many of these cases contain accounts of objects referred to as stregamenti, witchcraft things. This article examines the descriptions and role of stregamenti in Holy Office records to better understand how women practitioners and observers of stregheria perceived physical objects as potential sources of agency and, more broadly, analyzes the late Rinascimento Venetian belief in the ability of material things to take on spiritual significance. By employing material culture methodologies, this article utilizes promising new avenues for understanding how the meanings and uses of material things were constantly negotiated by female practitioners of magic in late Rinascimento Venice, a material realm believed to be infused with spiritual possibilities.Download Free PDFView PDFMEDIEVAL EUROPE IN MOTION V - MATERIALITIES AND DEVOTION: The sensory experience of the divine and the making of a Marian shrine.2019 • Gianvito CampobassoDownload Free PDFView PDFbib.irb.hrSomatic treasures: Function and Reception of Effigies on Holy Tombs in Fourteenth Century VeniceAna MunkDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
