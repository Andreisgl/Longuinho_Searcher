Beyond the fracas of politics and sensationalism of newspapers, this paper seeks to thoroughly understand and critically analyze the current crisis of undocumented minors at the southwestern border. To understand what is currently unfolding, it is necessary to dive into the causes of the problem that most of the literature and facts roots in Central America. Indeed for the fiscal year 2014 through September 30 Honduras made about 27.10 % of the apprehended Unaccompanied Alien Children, Guatemala 25.33% and El Salvador 24.36%.i Drug related gang violence seems trigger this migration. Also, this exodus is very much linked to dire poverty resulting of decades of socio-political instability, which in a non-negligible way was a byproduct of U.S. international politics. A third variable brought in to explain the crisis is the macro economical approach. It focuses on globalization and its push for ultra-liberal economies in these countries, which ultimately crushes local subsistence economies and leave populations to seek better opportunities elsewhere for them and their children. Consequently, the crisis at the U.S. borders is just part of a bigger problem that requires – if to be understood and properly tackled – a multilateral and international approachDownload Free PDFView PDFManuscript.

At the same time, the hype served to shed light on the humanitarian crisis fed by chronic violence that had been building up in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Indeed, in 2017, El Salvador and Honduras were among the countries with the highest rates of asylum-seekers in the world. Instead of considering the influx of refugees as a humanitarian crisis and addressing the root causes of out-migration from the Northern Triangle, the U.S. government response emphasized a strategy of “aggressive deterrence” of immigrants, engaging Central American governments to take security measures to stop migrants at their own borders. This transnational policy response has fed into a repressive approach toward migrants, increased gang conflict, and moved further away from potential resolutions to violence. Aggressive deterrence does not address underlying causes of conflict, and is contributing to aggravate the dynamics of armed violence in the region, rather than attending to humanitarian needs for international protection.Download Free PDFView PDFUnintended Return: U.S. Deportations and the Fractious Politics of Mobility for LatinosMarie Price, Derek BreeseA record-breaking 4.2 million people have been removed from the United States since 2000, with migrants from Latin America accounting for over 93 percent of all removals. The U.S. policy shift toward forced removals (commonly referred to as deportations) underscores many mobility politics and paradoxes that Latinos experience. Their determination to be mobile and leave their countries of origin often results in encountering various legal challenges in the United States that might limit their mobility within the United States and, sometimes, result in their involuntary mobility through forced return. This article is grounded in the politics of mobility literature interested in the frictions created within constellations of mobility that create unintended return. Drawing from administrative data produced by the Department of Homeland Security, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) data, and the U.S. Census, this research (1) documents the scope and uneven practice of forced removal; (2) suggests how unintended return is affecting Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras; and (3) develops the unintended returnee as an important mobility subject.Download Free PDFView PDFLegal Violence: Immigration Law and the Lives of Central American ImmigrantsCecilia MenjivarThis article analyzes how Central American immigrants in tenuous legal statuses experience current immigration laws. Based on ethnographic observations and over 200 interviews conducted between 1998 and 2010 with immigrants in Los Angeles and Phoenix and individuals in sending communities, this study reveals how the convergence and implementation of immigration and criminal law constitute forms of violence. Drawing on theories of structural and symbolic violence, the authors use the analytic category “legal violence” to capture the normalized but cumulatively injurious effects of the law. The analysis focuses on three central and interrelated areas of immigrants’ lives—work, family, and school—to expose how the criminalization of immigrants at the federal, state, and local levels is not only exclusionary but also generates violent effects for individual immigrants and their families, affecting everyday lives and long-term incorporation processes.Download Free PDFView PDFLASA ForumCentral Americans under Trump: Uncertainty on Both Sides of the Border2017 • Suyapa Portillo, Alicia Z MiklosDownload Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of SociologyLegal Violence: Immigration Law and the Lives of Central American Immigrants 12012 • Cecilia Menjivar, Leisy J.

Thus, family separation seems to be built into new immigration policies, and long-term and indefinite separations are not the exception. In this article, I examine the case of the largest Central American immigrant groups: Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans. Many of these immigrants are neither fully ‘undocumented’ nor ‘documented’, but often straddle both statuses as a result of having received a series of temporary permits over a period of more than a decade. This legal instability profoundly influences parenting across borders among these immigrants—both the relations between parents and children who are separated, and the links between these immigrant families and the different institutions in the host society. The experiences of Central Americans present a special opportunity to reflect on the effects of current immigration regimes on families separated across borders.Download Free PDFView PDFCahiers du CériumThe boomerang effect in US-Northern Triangle relations2019 • Philippe FournierThis report looks at the United States' policies towards the Northern Triangle (Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala) and its citizens in the last four decades and attempts to demonstrate that they have contributed to a gradual rise in poverty, insecurity and migration in the region. In particular, the militarization of Central American societies, the somewhat forced liberalization of the region, the waves of deportations from the United States and the US aid initiatives centered on judicial, military and police reforms show that US policies are reactive, short-term and rest primarily on domestic interests. In the end, these policies speak of a clear preference for security measures dictated by US public opinion and political elites rather than on comprehensive development programs.Download Free PDFView PDFTHE IMMIGRATION-CRIME NEXUS AND POST-DEPORTATION EXPERIENCES: EN/COUNTERING STEREOTYPES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND EL SALVADORRubén G. RumbautIn what follows, we report research findings of prevailing and persistent stereotypes about immigration and crime in Southern California and deportation and crime in El Salvador. With respect to the former, we “en/counter” enduring stereotypes and public perceptions of crime and immigration that are in sharp contrast to available evidence on crime and incarceration rates. We focus on the experiences of young adult children of immigrants in Southern California, especially Mexicans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans (and now increasingly Hondurans), who together account for two-thirds or more of the undocumented immigrant population in the United States. With respect to the latter, we focus on the experiences of men, including former gang members, who have been deported to El Salvador on criminal and non-criminal charges, and we challenge the stereotype of deportees as increasingly hardened criminal actors who, once removed, primarily focus their efforts on establishing and strengthening transnational criminal organizationsDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
