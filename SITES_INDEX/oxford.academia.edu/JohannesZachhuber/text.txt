Time and Soul. From Aristotle to St AugustineCan time exist independently of consciousness? In antiquity this question was often framed as an ... more Can time exist independently of consciousness? In antiquity this question was often framed as an enquiry into the relationship of time and soul. Aristotle cautiously suggested that time could not exist without a soul that is counting it. This proposal was controversially debated among his commentators. The present book offers an account of this debate beginning from Aristotle’s own statement of the problem in Book IV of the Physics. Subsequent chapters discuss Aristotle’s Peripatetic followers, Boethus of Sidon and Alexander of Aphrodisias; his Neoplatonic readers, Plotinus and Simplicius; and early Christian authors, Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine. At the centre of the debate stood the relation between the subjective time in the soul and the objective time of the cosmos. Both could be seen as united in the world soul as the seat of subjective time on a cosmic scale. But no solution to the problem was final. No theory gained general acceptance. The book shows the fascinating variety and plurality of ideas about time and soul throughout antiquity. Throughout antiquity, the problem of time and soul remained as intriguing as it proved intractable.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This volume brings leading scholars of medieval thought together to undertake the first major study of the sources and context of the so-called Summa Halensis (1236-45), which was one of the earliest and most signifi cant instalments in the Summa genre. This Summa was collaboratively authored by the founding members of the Franciscan school at Paris, who sought to lay down a uniquely Franciscan intellectual tradition for the fi rst time. In examining how the Summa reckons with some of the most signifi cant sources of the day, the contributions to the volume illustrate that early Franciscans interpreted their authorities to their own ends, developing highly innovative ideas that had a lasting impact on the Franciscan intellectual tradition and the disciplines of philosophy and theology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Rise of Christian Theology and the End of Ancient Metaphysics: Patristic Philosophy from the Cappadocian Fathers to John of DamascusOUP,  2020The Rise of Christian Theology and the End of Ancient Metaphysics: Patristic Philosophy from the ... more The Rise of Christian Theology and the End of Ancient Metaphysics: Patristic Philosophy from the Cappadocian Fathers to John of DamascusAbstract: It has rarely been recognized that the Christian writers of the first millennium pursued an ambitious and exciting philosophical project alongside their engagement in the doctrinal controversies of their age. This book offers for the first time a full analysis of this Patristic philosophy. It shows how it took its distinctive shape in the late fourth century and gives an account of its subsequent development until the time of John of Damascus.The book falls into three main parts. The first of them starts from an analysis of the philosophical project underlying the teaching of the Cappadocian fathers, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus. This philosophy, arguably the first distinctively Christian theory of being, soon becomes near-universally shared in Eastern Christianity. Few decades after the Cappadocians, all sides in the early Christological controversy take its fundamental tenets for granted. Its application to the Christological problem thus appeared inevitable. Yet it created substantial conceptual problems.Parts 2 and 3 of the book describe in detail how these problems led to a series of increasingly radical modifications of the Cappadocian philosophy. The chapters of Part 2 are dedicated to the miaphysite opponents of the Council of Chalcedon, while Part 3 discusses the defenders of the Council from the early sixth to the eighth century. Through this overview, the book reveals this period as one of remarkable philosophical creativity, fecundity, and innovation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Oxford Handbook of Nineteenth Century Christian Thoughtby Johannes Zachhuber, Joel Rasmussen, and Judith WolfeThrough various realignments beginning in the Revolutionary era and continuing across the ninetee... more Through various realignments beginning in the Revolutionary era and continuing across the nineteenth century, Christianity not only endured as a vital intellectual tradition, but also contributed importantly to a wide variety of significant conversations, movements, and social transformations across the diverse spheres of intellectual, cultural, and social history. The Oxford Handbook of Nineteenth-Century Christian Thought proposes new readings of the diverse sites and variegated role of the Christian intellectual tradition across what has come to be called 'the long nineteenth century'. It represents the first comprehensive examination of a picture emerging from the twin recognition of Christianity's abiding intellectual influence and its radical transformation and diversification under the influence of the forces of modernity. Part one investigates changing paradigms that determine the evolving approaches to religious matters during the nineteenth century, providing readers with a sense of the fundamental changes at the time. Section two considers human nature and the nature of religion. It explores a range of categories rising to prominence in the course of the nineteenth century, and influencing the way religion in general, and Christianity in particular, were conceived. Part three focuses on the intellectual, cultural, and social developments of the time, while part four looks at Christianity and the arts-a major area in which Christian ideas, stories, and images were used, adapted, and challenged during the nineteenth century. Christianity was radically pluralized in the nineteenth century, and the fifth section is dedicated to 'Christianity and Christianities'. The chapters sketch the major churches and confessions during the period. The final part considers doctrinal themes registering the wealth and scope through broad narrative and individual example. This authoritative reference work offers an indispensible overview of a period whose forceful ideas continue to be present in contemporary theology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

"In Luther's theological position lay a strong and uncompromising affirmation of the absolute centrality of the person of Jesus Christ for the Christian faith. In this sense, the principle, slogan or motto "Christ alone" (solus Christus) is the culmination of the other three, similar phrases - Scripture alone (sola scriptura); by faith alone (sola fide); by grace alone (sola gratia) - which are often associated with Reformation theology. The centrality of Luther's fixation on the person of Jesus Christ as the one, single redeemer of humankind will, I hope, open a perspective for the commemoration of Luther and his Reformation that should be of interest and concern for Protestants and Catholics alike.The paper uploaded is the original lecture given at Marquette University in April 2017Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of its crucial aspects is the emergence of a new awareness of human individuality. In this collection of essays, an interdisciplinary and international group of scholars documents and analyses this development. Authors assess the influence of seminal thinkers, including the Gnostics, Plotinus, and Augustine, but also of cultural and religious practices such as astrology and monasticism, as well as, more generally, the role played by intellectual disciplines such as grammar and Christian theology. Due to its thematic and disciplinary breadth, the volume will serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Theology as Science in Nineteenth-Century Germany. From F.C. Baur to Ernst TroeltschThis study describes the origin, development and crisis of the German nineteenth-century project ... more This study describes the origin, development and crisis of the German nineteenth-century project of theology as science. Its narrative is focused on the two predominant theological schools during this period, the Tübingen School and the Ritschl School. Their work emerges as a grand attempt to synthesize historical and systematic theology within the twin paradigms of historicism and German Idealism. Engaging in detail with the theological, historical and philosophical scholarship of the story's protagonists, Johannes Zachhuber reconstructs the basis of this scholarship as a deep belief in the eventual unity of human knowledge. This idealism clashed with the historicist principles underlying much of the scholars' actual research. The tension between these paradigms ran through the entire period and ultimately led to the disintegration of the project at the end of the century.  Drawing on a wealth of primary sources, many of which have never been used in English speaking scholarship before, Zachhuber embeds the essentially theological story he presents within broader intellectual developments in nineteenth century Germany. In spite of its eventual failure, the project of theology as science in nineteenth century Germany is here described as a paradigmatic intellectual endeavour of European modernity with far-reaching significance beyond the confines of a single academic discipline.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It contextualizes the nineteenth-century debate about theology as science both within the larger question of whether and, if so, how theology is Wissenschaft (scientia; ‘science’) and within the more specific situation arising from the mid-eighteenth century through the rise of historicism and the specific turn in philosophy of religion since Kant. It starts from a discussion of theology’s institutional context in the university and its the modern transformations; F. Schleiermacher’s contribution to this debate is specifically treated. Subsequent sections explore historicization as a general phenomenon of European culture at the turn of the nineteenth century and its effect on theology in particular as well as the specific contribution made by the rise of German Idealism.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The present book, which is the result of several years of interdisciplinary collaboration, suggests that in many ways the fascination with sacrifice has its roots in modernity itself. Theological developments following the Reformation, the rediscovery of Greek tragedies, and the encounter with the practice of human sacrifice in the Americas triggered a complex and passionate debate in the sixteenth century which has never since abated. Contributors to this volume, leading experts from theology, anthropology, and literary and cultural studies, describe and discuss how this modern fascination for the topic of sacrifice has evolved, how it has shaped theological debate, the literary imagination, and anthropological theory. Individual chapters discuss in depth major theological trajectories, theories of sacrifice including those of Marcel Mauss and René Girard, and current feminist criticism. They engage with sacrifice in the context of religious and philosophical thought, works of literature and film. They explore different yet overlapping aspects of modernity's obsession with sacrifice. The book does not intend to impose a single narrative over all these diverse contributions but brings them into a conversation around a common centre.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is subsequently explicated through a survey of approaches to sacrifice from the 16th century. Three contexts are explored in particular: the theological debate following the Reformation; the reception of Greek tragedy; the encounter with non-European practices of sacrifice in the wake of the age of discovery. There are evident overlaps between the three, and yet they have to be seen as in a way separate factors ensuring the abiding fascination of the modern West with the notion of sacrifice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It argues that the frequent use Gregory makes of phusis-terminology is not only a terminological predilection, but rather the key to the philosophical and theological foundations of his thought.Starting from an overview of the theological landscape in the early 360's the study first demonstrates the meaning and relevance of universal human nature as an analogy for the Trinity in Cappadocian theology. The second part explores Gregory's use of this same notion in his teaching on the divine economy. It is argued that Gregory takes this philosophical theory into the service of his own theology.Ultimately the book provides an example for the mutual interaction of philosophy and Christian theology in the fourth century.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Forgiving and Forgetting. Theology and the Margins of Soteriologyby Johannes Zachhuber and hartmut von sassForgiveness has traditionally been associated with a duty to remember in order for reconciliation... more Forgiveness has traditionally been associated with a duty to remember in order for reconciliation to be possible. Human failure, evil, and atrocities could thus only be forgiven on the basis of a saving memory. Forgetting, by contrast, had to be excluded in the interest of a truthful and genuinely new beginning. Historical experience, it seemed, supported this account. The essays collected in this volume seek to challenge this traditional picture – by elaborating on the notion of forgetting, by reappreciating its constructive or even necessary impact on our lives, by paying heed to the potential obstacles for reconciliation due to an unforgiving remembrance, by clarifying the relationship between remembrance and forgetting, which is not necessarily complementary, and by 􏰁nding new ways of relating forgiveness to forgetting ultimately leading to the precarious question of whether even God forgets when he forgives.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Contributors to this volume, leading experts from theology, anthropology, and literary and cultural studies, describe and discuss how this modern fascination for the topic of sacrifice has evolved, how it has shaped theological debate, the literary imagination, and anthropological theory. Individual chapters discuss in depth major theological trajectories, theories of sacrifice including those of Marcel Mauss and René Girard, and current feminist criticism. They engage with sacrifice in the context of religious and philosophical thought, works of literature and film. They explore different yet overlapping aspects of modernity's obsession with sacrifice. The book does not intend to impose a single narrative over all these diverse contributions but brings them into a conversation around a common centre.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

T... more The Introduction starts from the observation that sacrifice has been an obsession of modernity. This is subsequently explicated through a survey of approaches to sacrifice from the 16th century. Three contexts are explored in particular: the theological debate following the Reformation; the reception of Greek tragedy; the encounter with non-European practices of sacrifice in the wake of the age of discovery. There are evident overlaps between the three, and yet they have to be seen as in a way separate factors ensuring the abiding fascination of the modern West with the notion of sacrifice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It argues that the frequent use ... more This volume explores Gregory Of Nyssa's concept of human nature. It argues that the frequent use Gregory makes of phusis-terminology is not only a terminological predilection, but rather the key to the philosophical and theological foundations of his thought.Starting from an overview of the theological landscape in the early 360's the study first demonstrates the meaning and relevance of universal human nature as an analogy for the Trinity in Cappadocian theology. The second part explores Gregory's use of this same notion in his teaching on the divine economy. It is argued that Gregory takes this philosophical theory into the service of his own theology.Ultimately the book provides an example for the mutual interaction of philosophy and Christian theology in the fourth century.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Forgiving and Forgetting. Theology and the Margins of Soteriologyby Johannes Zachhuber and hartmut von sassForgiveness has traditionally been associated with a duty to remember in order for reconciliation... more Forgiveness has traditionally been associated with a duty to remember in order for reconciliation to be possible. Human failure, evil, and atrocities could thus only be forgiven on the basis of a saving memory. Forgetting, by contrast, had to be excluded in the interest of a truthful and genuinely new beginning. Historical experience, it seemed, supported this account. The essays collected in this volume seek to challenge this traditional picture – by elaborating on the notion of forgetting, by reappreciating its constructive or even necessary impact on our lives, by paying heed to the potential obstacles for reconciliation due to an unforgiving remembrance, by clarifying the relationship between remembrance and forgetting, which is not necessarily complementary, and by 􏰁nding new ways of relating forgiveness to forgetting ultimately leading to the precarious question of whether even God forgets when he forgives.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The world soul in early Christian thoughtAna Schiavoni-Palanciuc/Johannes Zachhuber(eds.), Platonism and Christianity in Late Ancient Cosmology: God, Soul, Matter, Leiden: Brill,  2022This chapter collects the evidence for engagement with the world soul in early Christian thought.... more This chapter collects the evidence for engagement with the world soul in early Christian thought. The prevailing scholarly opinion is that Christians could not accept this philosophical idea due to its connection with the postulate of a divine cosmos. By means of a close analysis of key Christian authors between the second and the fourth century, the article partly corrects this consensus. Without fully embracing either the Platonic or the Stoic concept, Christian thinkers as diverse as the Gnostic author of the Acts of John, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Origen adopted elements of the world soul theory to articulate their Christologies. In a final part, the chapter follows these ideas into the fourth century where they continue to exercise some influence albeit in modified form.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Sexuality and the Christian Self: Michel Foucault's Reading of the Church FathersToronto Journal of Theology,  2020This article discusses Michel Foucault's "last" book, the recently published Les aveux de la chai... more This article discusses Michel Foucault's "last" book, the recently published Les aveux de la chair. In the first part, an analysis is provided of Foucault's understanding and treatment of the patristic texts he decides to mine for his theory of sexuality. Foucault finds in the church fathers a general view of sexuality not too different from that of contemporaneous philosophers. The novelty that Christianity brings does not, therefore, consist in a more restrictive sexual ethic. Foucault goes so far as to argue that even the Christian notion of virginity was unexceptionable from a Greek point of view. The novelty of Christianity, rather, was the way sexuality was related to the self. Therefore, as discussed in the article's second part, Foucault includes in his presentation the baptismal catechesis and the institution of confession. The article concludes, however, that Foucault does not fully succeed in integrating patristic views of sexuality with the early history of church discipline. It is therefore proposed that this alignment was plausible to Foucault on account of his preconceived, teleological interpretation of patristic Christianity. Ultimately, he discovered in the church fathers the ideas his interpretation of early modern Catholicism led him to suspect there. The article's final part inscribes Foucault's newly available interpretation of the fathers into his broader thesis about the genealogy of the modern self and the role of Christianity in this history.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is argued that the text as it is extant should be understood as an attempt to build bridges to the small Eustathian community in Antioch. This is based on the parallels between Gregory's text and a fragment Adversus Photinum, ascribed to Eustathius in the sixth-century controversy between Damian of Alexandria and Peter of Callinicum. I argue that such an attempt is congruous with similar known attempts at bridge-building by Gregory. An opportunity for such an attempt would have been the Antiochene Synod of 379.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Through an investigation of polemical texts from the fifth and sixth centuries CE, I advance the thesis that two aspects of this genre of texts have to be consider together in order to appreciate them: the rational character of this discourse and its function in the context of identity formation. Attempts to reduce these writings to one or the other, consequently, fall short and fail to explain the phenomenon. Yet this raises further questions: what does it signify that early Christians conducted a major part of their identity construction in and through overtly rational debate? To tackle this question, I draw on the René Girard and his theory of mimetic crisis and the identification of scapegoats. My contention will be that the unique step taken in early Christian doctrinal polemic is that the scapegoating rhetoric is conducted through rational argumentation more than a mythical narrative. I will conclude by proposing that this development signifies a major step in the history of Western rationality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

My interest is in the dialectic of identity and difference which, I argue, plays out in this book on three levels: first, Jonas is playing with the idea that late antiquity itself is similar to his own age. In this regard, he draws especially on Oswald Spengler although I argue that the idea of such a special relationship is much older in relevant historical research. Second, Jonas analyses the problematic of the self as a stranger in a hostile world as the underlying self-understanding of Gnostic existence. Third, for Jonas Gnosticism itself is the other, it is Oriental difference interrupting the ancient world. I suggest that Jonas ultimately partakes of a 'dualistic' approach to history, in some continuity with a long tradition of research on Gnosticism which has tended to find in this movement the 'fascinating other'.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Starting from contextual observations, the paper moves, in a first step, to an analysis of citations from the Damascene in Peter Lombard’s Sentences. The authoritative role of the latter writing meant that its often idiosyncratic use of the Damascene was passed on to later scholastics, such as the authors of the Summa. A detailed consideration of ten quotations from the Damas- cene in the Summa, which makes up the second part of the paper, reveals a complex pattern of reception. Passages from De fide orthodoxa were often taken out of con- text, truncated, or both, in order to serve as building blocks in the Summa’s own, di- alectical presentation of a theological topic. In conclusion, the paper cautions against the conventional assumption equating the number of references to an au- thority in the Summa with their conceptual influence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I argue that the Damascene’s philosophical views can be explained by inscribing his reflections into a trajectory emerging from the Christological controversies of the fifth century. Specifically, I contend that the apologetic need to justify the Chalcedonian tenet that the Incarnate existed as one hypostasis in two natures, divine and human, can be shown to stand behind some of John’s most distinctive philosophical ideas. In this sense, I reconstruct the Damascene’s ideas on universals and particulars as a paradigmatic case of Patristic philosophy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In my paper, I present the most important of these changes highlighting their philosophical significance and their innovative potential.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I show how trinitarian theology around the middle of the 4th century necessitated for the first time systematic theological reflection about the nature of the universal. Its historically most influential result, which I then sketch, is Gregory of Nyssa's complex theory which he applies to a variety of other theological questions as well. One of those is Christology, but it turns out that this particular application becomes the crux of Gregory's theory. The latter part of my paper is dedicated to the proof that and how theological developments after the Council of Chalcedon (451) caused fundamental modifications to that theory, which in their turn had a wide-ranging impact on broader metaphysical issues.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Chevallier et al., Foucault, les pères et le sexe,  2019This paper examines Michel Foucault's conception of Christianity, sexuality, and the self in the ... more This paper examines Michel Foucault's conception of Christianity, sexuality, and the self in the Patristic period. It is based on the fourth volume of his History of Sexuality, which was only published in 2018. In this work, Foucault sought to weave together an account of Patristic attitudes to sexuality with the emergence of early confessional institutions, especially the baptismal catechesis. For Foucault, Christianity did not introduce a sexual morality that was fundamentally different from that of other late antique philosophers. Rather, it was the particular way sexuality became connected with a concept of the self that was novel in the new religion.I argue that Foucault is not fully successful in weaving the different strands of his narrative together from his late ancient sources. It is only when viewed from the vantage point of early modern Catholicism that the trajectory he constructs becomes fully intelligible and seemingly inevitable. His reconstruction of the history of sexuality in the Patristic period should thus be read as part of a genealogy of modernity which, for Foucault, was above all characterised by the inheritance of the confessional institutions of early modern Catholicism. While this is a fascinating story, it can put an overly deterministic interpretation on developments which were, in reality, much more open-ended as is evidenced by the very different historic churches that trace their origins to the Patristic period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is argued that Gregory, in his trinitarian theology and elsewhere in his thought, employs with remarkable coherence a kind of theory for which the universal is essentially the whole of its individuals (collection theory). For Gregory this is a realistic theory in which the concept of the whole is either entirely detached from that of the individuals (as ousia or hupostasis in his trinitarian theory) or related to them as actual to potential nature (for example in his cosmology). It is characteristic for him that he makes the whole collection the object of reference for the substance- sortal. This theory helps him avoid (to some extent) doctrinal ramifications within trinitarian theology as it explains the Trinity as a perfect unity-in- trinity which is both irreducibly one and irreducibly three.

This article will analyse in detail the meaning and significance of this demand in Ritschl's work. It will be shown that the systematic shape of theology was for Ritschl a wedge issue that permitted him to subject some individuals and traditions to a sharp critique while aligning himself with others. Among those singled out for criticism are Philipp Melanchthon and Friedrich Schleiermacher. Yet Schleiermacher, perhaps ironically, also emerges as perhaps the most important influence on Ritschl’s concept of the theological system. The paper will conclude with reflections on advantages and disadvantages of developing theology as a system in the tradition Ritschl represented and shaped.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Two aspects are pivotal: the revolutionary social changes of the time create a sense of rupture between past and present; and radical criticism calls into question the reliability of historical sources.

Theologians played an active part in this development, but their work cannot be understood without their wider context.

Beginning with some comments on Ritschl's reconstruction of the history of atonement theories, the account is focussed on his biblical theology, his philosophical foundations, and his remarkable views on Christian life and practice. Ritschl's relationship to Kant and Schleiermacher is considered as well as his indebtedness to mid-century philosophers, Adolf Trendelenburg and Hermann Lotze. A final part of the chapter gives an account of main developments in the academic school founded on the basis of Ritschl's theology. Wilhelm Herrmann, Julius Kaftan, and Adolf Harnack are discussed in their relationship to Ritschl's theology.

Strauss' Life of Jesus had far-reaching consequences for the German debate about theology as science. I suggest that Strauss modifies the previous status quaestionis by (1) making the scientific character of theology a matter of public concern; (2) aligning the Hegelian emphasis on science as knowledge with the emerging imperative of science as procedural research; and (3) indicating that this question was further connected with societal and political modernisation. The result was an explosive mixture as is evident from the passionate responses to Strauss' publication. His most extreme opponents, such as E.-W. Hengstenberg, were eager to accept his claim that modern theology = Hegelian 'pantheism' = political reform. Those closer to Strauss, on the other hand, notably other members of the Tübingen School, sought to moderate his claims by restricting the problem of theology's scientific character to an inner-university affair. On the other hand, more radical thinkers, such as Ludwig Feuerbach and Karl Marx, soon moved beyond Strauss' original proposal of a modern, philosophical Christianity. While Strauss' own position was thus repudiated on the right and the left, his main significance was as a catalyst for fundamental theological and intellectual transformations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this paper, I explore a different line of argument, the attempt to align religion with the cohesion of communities. I take my starting point in antiquity, specifically Varro's idea of political theology and its critique in Augustine's City of God. I then show how these ideas were picked up and transformed by various thinkers since the seventeenth century: Rousseau, de Maistre, Boland, Comte, and Durkheim. It becomes clear that both liberal and conservative thinkers during these centuries found the notion attractive that religion is needed as a bond holding societies together. This created a problematic relationship between religious and political dynamics.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It asks how theology disciplines and restrains as part of its rational character. the paper's particular focus is the theology that became institutionalised in the 19th century research university. Three different theories based on different understandings of religion and of rationality are discussed: Friedrich Schleiermacher's view of theology within a broad concept of practical rationality; David Strauss' critical reconstruction of theology on the basis of scientific rationality, and F.C. Baur's historicist version, based on the concept of historical reason. The three versions combine in strikingly different ways theology as the faith's rationality with an instrumentalist form of rationalisation. Ultimately, I argue that theological rationalisation is good when and insofar as it contributes to the practice of the Christian religion.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I show that such usage doesn't stretch back beyond Kant and that its real career only takes off in the 1830s. Major influences on this development are the debate about Spinoza's 'pantheism', Hegel's idealism, and the place of religion in the modern world. In a second part, I look at some historical scholarship of the time to illustrate how the duality of transcendence and immanence began to inform the reading of earlier religious history. I end by pointing to some new contexts that are beginning to emerge at the turn of the 20th century, notably Catholic thought, and which ensured that the popularity of that duality continued to grow.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This finding leads to far-reaching questions concerning the continuity and discontinuity in 19th-century theological development as well as today’s theological options in the reception of Schleiermacher.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This was not a 'Protestant Revolution', but the Churches had a considerable impact on the political changes, especially in the early stages. What is remarkable is that churches which traditionally saw their political role as extremely limited, due to their Lutheran theology, were willing to accept that role. I argue that earlier developments, beginning from the 1960s prepared the way for this unprecedented decision.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This, I show, becomes apparent once we observe two factors that are often neglected: first, gauge sola scriptura against its historical rival, the Tridentine doctrine of an oral tradition as a second source of revelation; secondly, accept that the Scripture principle can be held in a historicist version that acknowledges the Bible as the foundation of historic Christianity. I initially argue the former point by an examination of Joseph Ratzinger's engagement with the so-called Geiselmann thesis. In a second part of the paper, I explain the significance of historicisation for our understanding of Scripture and tradition. I defend my endorsement of a historicised version of the Scripture principle against its critique by Karl Barth while agreeing with Barth's historical observation of an increasing rapprochement between Protestant and Catholic views of Scripture since the 19th century.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Luther and Modernity, Capitalism, and LiberalismThe Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Martin LutherThe concept of modernity has emerged as a major philosophical, theological and sociological categ... more The concept of modernity has emerged as a major philosophical, theological and sociological category of interpretation in the aftermath of the French Revolution. It was meant to embrace fundamental changes to the fabric of Western culture including the rise of capitalism, liberalism, democracy, and secularity. From its inception, references to Luther and the Reformation have been a frequent element of this kind of theory. The first major theorist of modernity in this sense was arguably Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel who set the tone of subsequent contributions by aligning modernity with subjectivity. For him, the religious dimension of this development was crucial, and he was explicit in his claim that it was the Reformation that brought the turn to subjectivity in the realm of religion. A side-effect of the turn to subjectivity was the alienation of the subject from the world. Modernity is thus deeply ambivalent and so is Protestantism. Later thinkers developed further these insights, but also criticised the identification of Luther with the origin of modernity pointing to continuities between his theology and earlier, medieval thought.The article discusses the following thinkers: Hegel, Ritschl, Troeltsch, Weber, de Maistre, and Maritain.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Jesus Christ in Martin LutherThis article gives an account of Luther's Christology. Luther's theology is strongly Christocentr... more This article gives an account of Luther's Christology. Luther's theology is strongly Christocentric, but Christology is rarely the central focus of his writings. In some of his most considered summaries of his own faith, he presents Chalcedonian Christology alongside the Church's teaching on the Trinity as the uncontroversial foundation of the Catholic faith, which he shared with his opponents. At the same time, it is evident that Luther's most celebrated theological innovations, including his teaching on justification by faith, his theology of the cross, his soteriology, and in particular, his doctrine of the Eucharist had considerable Christological implications that sometimes seem at variance with received orthodoxy. Luther's Christology must therefore be largely reconstructed from these various strands in his thought. The result is a distinctive albeit not systematic Christology that is focused on the paradoxical unity of divine and human in Christ. In this, Luther often appears close to the teaching of the Alexandrian fathers but with a much fuller emphasis on the concrete humanity of the savior. His historical debt to late scholasticism is most evident in his few, albeit consequential, attempts to enter into the field of technical Christological doctrine, especially his affirmation of the ubiquity of Christ's human nature after the ascension in his controversy with Zwingli.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From at le... more The reception of Dionysius the Areopagite in Martin Luther can appear straightforward. From at least 1520, the reformer was scathing in his rejection of the late ancient writer, 'quisquis fuerit', as he would say echoing Erasmus. The Areopagite's fraudulently obtained quasi-apostolic authority lent support to ideas and practices in the church and theology which Luther had come to regard as highly problematic. The charge sheet was wide-ranging and included Dionysius' metaphysical justification of a hierarchical priesthood and his acceptance of multiple sacraments, but also his apparent endorsement of a mystical ascent directly to the transcendent God rather than through the incarnate and crucified Christ. Overall, Dionysius was, in Luther's famous phrase, 'more Platonist than Christian'. In this chapter, I will argue that the historical reality was considerably more complex than such a simple summary suggests. By the sixteenth century, the writings collected in the Dionysian Corpus had influenced generations of Eastern and Western theologians many of whom were of the utmost importance to Luther himself as well as his early followers. Luther's own debt to the mystical tradition, steeped in Dionysian ideas, is well known, but his early development was also affected by the humanist movement which considered the Areopagite the supreme mediator of classical and Christian culture. At the same time, there were multiple reasons for the Reformer to reject Dionysius notably his use as an authority for the sacramental order of the late medieval church. A further complicating factor was the humanist debate about the authenticity of the Dionysian corpus. In what follows, I shall start from an analysis of Luther's sharp and polemical rebuke of Dionysius in his On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, published in the autumn of 1520. In a second step, I trace this critique to earlier, more nuanced utterances which betray Luther's entanglements with the Dionysian tradition. In this connection, I will include a discussion of the controversial topic of Luther's relationship to mysticism more broadly.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They show the variety of responses to the Areopagite that was possible within Lutheranism. In a final part of the chapter, I discuss more recent debates in nineteenth and twentieth century Lutheranism. While Luther's critique of the Areopagite cast a long shadow, and most later authors accepted that Dionysius was not a first-century writer, his ideas were of considerable importance especially for those writers associated with the Pietist tradition.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I argue that until the 1960s secularisation was an interpretative paradigm with enormous practical consequences way beyond the academy ('Deutungsmacht'). The rise of 'secularisation theories', which did not really exist until the 1960s, arguably indicates the high water mark of the paradigm: at a time when secularising tendencies in Western societies reached new heights, the normative force of secularisation was beginning to wane. This development accelerated in subsequent decades and has by now led to a situation in which secularisation has practically ceased to function as a normative paradigm, yet in practice exerts more influence than ever. This 'pragmatic' secularisation, I conclude, is so powerful precisely because it's not driven by ideology but by political considerations about changing demographics and the shrinking power of religious institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Few would doubt that examples of such a strategy exist, but I argue that their proximity to some of the most fundamental formulations of Christian belief points to an ecclesiological paradox: a Church that is meant to include all cannot exist without excluding at least some. I discuss various liberal and conservative attempts to avoid the paradox, but conclude that it has to be accepted as unavoidable. The Church follows her mission precisely by recognising in her theological self-reflection the distance between its institutional reality and the ideal she is meant to embody.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There are fundamental methodological problems as it seems nearly impossible to articulate it without performative contradiction - remembering forgetting! I use Mark Augé's three forms of forgetting to investigate in particular the relationship between Christian notions of forgiveness and forgetting. I conclude that forgetting can ideally stand at the end of a process of forgiveness but only where the evil that had originally broken the relationship thereby ceases to exist. Where it continues to exist—for example because it has an impact on the life of others—remembering is necessary and forgetting a fault.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It starts from an exploration of a number of ambiguities within the concept of pacifism, which are ultimately traced to the problem that it is often defined with regard to its opposite, war. Therein, I then argue, lies a danger not dissimilar to the ambivalence within Christianity, a religion that promises the overcoming of evil but by doing so often has often instead furthered evil. The paper explores in particular Christian use of sacrificial terminology with regard to violence and warfare. What may be needed is the willingness to accept a world in which violence and war are real forces but at the same time resistance to the tendency to sacralise them. In this sense, the paper calls for a 'pacifism of perception'.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I argue that until the 1960s secularisation was widely accepted as an intellectual paradigm for the self-understanding of Western societies, but a theory of secularisation didn't exist at the time. Interestingly, theories of secularisation began to flourish from the 1960s - precisely at the moment when societies lost their certainty with regard to their secular future. They are latecomers, and it is thus not surprising that, once they have been developed, they immediately provoke a backlash at the theoretical and the ideological level. Today, we may have come full circle: while empirically secularisation is more evident than ever, ideas about secularisation have largely lost their sway over the Western public.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One way of describing this transformation is to see it as moving from an emphasis on sacrifice to one on processes of victimisation. Both concepts of course derive from the logic of traditional sacrifice, and it is the thesis of my paper that theological theories explaining Christ's atoning death on the cross can fruitfully be compared with those political and social transformations. As the traditional logic of a substitutionary sacrifice needed to propitiate the wrath of God seemed increasingly untenable, the death of Jesus was, in various ways, reconceptualised as the exemplary case of the willingness to sacrifice oneself for others. It is this transformation, I argue, which only made possible the application of sacrificial terminology to the death on the battlefield so popular for the past two hundred years (but not before) but also the more recent discourses of victimisation with their more implicit allusion to sacrificial logic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A further difference is that Europeans associate religion customarily with a Church and fail to see the specific form of 'civil religion' so typical for American public discourse.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper starts from sketching differing philosophical views to argue that Gregory, due to his theological angle, was drawn to one particular theory, found especially in Porphyry, but that this very theory led to further doctrinal difficulties, which he tried to avoid by falling back on an alternative philosophical account.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It therefore takes as its starting point his book Discipleship (Nachfolge) and argues that 'Nachfolge' is a very helpful concept to grasp the unity of Bonhoeffer's life and thought.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Perhaps for this reason, conventional theories of sacrifice have often conceived it as a quintessential expression of religiosity. By inverting mundane economies of value, sacrifice has been imagined as the ultimate manifestation of devotion to something beyond—or as the consummately irrational religious act. But secular values also often valorize—or even compel—logics of sacrifice, such as in the service of a revolutionary or national cause, or in more mundane, everyday contexts in which economies of value are inverted for non-religious ends. What do these inverted economies tell us about secularisms--and about "rationalities" themselves? Can a focus on secular sacrifice help us draw new registers of meaning within what Talal Asad has called “the anthropology of the secular” precisely by orienting us to secular values in extremis?  At the same time, the way that the transmundane economies of value produced by sacrifice are attached to different religious systems reflects a shifting set of political parameters: is a renunciation of value noble or barbaric? Compassionate or monstrous? Thoughtful or primitive? This political axis suggests that sacrifice as an inverted economy often falls across the line between the secular and the religious, complicating the question of how an action is determined to be religious or non-religious in the first place. What does it say about the secular that sacrifical economies of value—and the rhetorics and practices stemming from them—are still so prevalent?  Why are there secular formations of sacrifice and what does this tell us about the relationship between secularism and religion? How does sacrifice embed itself within political regimes? What does a reconceptualization of sacrifice as non-religious tell us about the category of religion itself? Does the interaction between sacrifice and power stick religious and secular meanings together? Does the prevalence of secular sacrificial economies change not only our assessment of what is secular and what religious, but our valuation of those categories?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Church and Social Sciences: How to re-think the Church History through Social Sciencesby Frédéric GABRIEL, Alain RAUWEL, Céline  Béraud, Johannes Zachhuber, Sabrina Corbellini, Amanda Power, Emilia Jamroziak, and Sita SteckelThe ‘institutionalocentrism’ of historians diagnosed by Michel Foucault often leads to a simplist... more The ‘institutionalocentrism’ of historians diagnosed by Michel Foucault often leads to a simplistic narrative confronting two monoliths, the Church and the State. This dichotomy isolated religious history from the analytical tools honed by social sciences—despite the fact that the ‘Church’ as an object of enquiry was at the very core of sociological thinking since the days of its founding fathers, Durkheim and Weber. This workshop aims to contribute to an ongoing editorial endeavour, a collaborative ‘Critical dictionary’ reassessing the historical object we commonly refer to as “the Church”. Through the familiar format of “dictionary headings” common assumptions about the Church as an ecclesiastical institution, as well as related topics, will be addressed.Through paired interventions, the speakers will question the formation and consolidation of traditional narratives concerning the Church in order to shift the focus away from classic “religious history” and confront the historical approach with the methodologies and concepts developed by social sciences. Deconstructing these grand narratives will highlight the ideological presuppositions of conventional normative accounts, insuring a critical historicization of classical conceptions about the Church and Churches from an anthropological and social-historical perspective.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
