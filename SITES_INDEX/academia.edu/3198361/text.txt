Please note that the symposium will be two and a half days: sessions will begin at 9 am on Friday, and conclude Sunday afternoon. In the Middle Ages and beyond, legal, documentary, exegetical, literary and linguistic traditions have organized the relationship between image and letter in diverse ways, whether in terms of equivalency, complementarity or polarity. In this symposium, we wish to explore those situations in which letter and image were fused, forming hybrid signs that had no vocal equivalent and were not necessarily bound to any specific language. Although imagistic scripts work on the visible, arranging representation, they challenge the legible in terms of linguistic signification. The incorporation of figures, objects, colors, even events, within the letter insists on the material dimension of the sign. As the iconicity of the letter transforms reading into gazing, the script-like character of the image compels consideration of the co-signification of sign forms. In mediating each other into altered formats, the script-image disrupts a-priori models and ideas and thus redefines both text and image in terms of their signifying and representational processes. The disruptive effect of imagistic script inheres in a suspension of meaning that opens the system of representation and signification in which it was produced and circulated. During the three-day conference, we propose to bring together scholars of Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Pre-Columbian cultures from numerous disciplines – art history, history, literature, religion, linguistics, and law – to consider the purpose, operations, agency and specular forms of iconic scripts. What sort of communication did they facilitate? Did they imply reception by the inner eye? In prompting recognition of the aesthetic dimension of texts, did they open governance, law, literature, diplomatics, and theology to sensorial appreciation? Did they enforce a latent principle of non-representability? Does their use imply what might be called an iconomy, a practice of policing images? The symposium is organized with Brigitte Bedos-Rezak (New York University) and Jeffrey F. Hamburger (Harvard University). Symposium speakers include Elizabeth Hill Boone, Ghislain Brunel, Anne-Marie Christin, Tom Cummins, Vincent Debiais, Ivan Drpić, Antony Eastmond, Beatrice Frankel, Cynthia Hahn, Herbert Kessler, Katrin Kogman-Appel, Didier Méhu, Irvin Cemil Schick and Irene Winter.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersDumbarton Oaks Annual Report 2016 - 2017Jan ZiolkowskiDumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection is an institute in Washington, D.C., administered by the Trustees for Harvard University.

Dumbarton Oaks also makes accessible ever more of its resources freely online. The founding donors, Robert Woods Bliss and Mildred Barnes Bliss, called upon future policy-makers “to remember that Dumbarton Oaks is conceived in a new pattern, where quality and not number shall determine the choice of its scholars; that it is the home of the Humanities, not a mere aggregation of books and objects of art; that the house itself and the gardens have their educational importance and that all are of humanistic value.” These ambitions continue to guide Dumbarton Oaks, but with close attention to ensuring that the Blisses’ “new pattern” retains its vitality through constant renewal.Download Free PDFView PDFIntroducing the Dover Quartet and World Premiere of Caroline Shaw's Dumbarton Oaks CommissionJan ZiolkowskiRemarks welcoming guests to a concert by the Dover Quartet, with the world premiere of Caroline Shaw’s “Plan & Elevation (The Grounds of Dumbarton Oaks).” The event took place in the Music Room, and was followed by a celebratory reception in the Fellowship House Oak Room at 1700 Wisconsin Avenue.Download Free PDFView PDFDumbarton Oaks Annual Report 2017 2018Jan ZiolkowskiDumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection is an institute in Washington, D.C., administered by the Trustees for Harvard University.
