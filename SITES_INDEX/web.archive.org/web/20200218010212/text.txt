The index measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18, given the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail in the country where she lives. It is designed to highlight how improvements in current health and education outcomes shape the productivity of the next generation of workers, assuming that children born today experience over the next 18 years the educational opportunities and health risks that children in this age range currently face.Human Capital IndexGlobal Economic Prospects - ForecastsAnnual GDP Growth (%)Trinidad and TobagoGlobal Economic Prospects examines trends for the world economy and how they affect developing countries.
