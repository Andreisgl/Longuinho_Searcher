Yet, it eventually developed into a very different system with a focus on providing individual justice in an ever growing number of member states. This transformation has raised fundamental questions as to the level of difference and diversity allowed within the common European human rights space. Was the system to rest on minimum standards with room for domestic differences, or was it to create uniform standards? These questions have come up as increasingly contentious issues over the past years and have triggered a number of reforms seeking to introduce more subsidiarity in the system, striking a different balance between the European and national oversight of human rights. The article analyses this turn to subsidiarity by exploring whether the reform process has introduced new forms of difference and diversity within the common space of Europe...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The situated and bounded rationality of international courts: A structuralist approach to international adjudicative practicesLeiden Journal of International LawUnderstanding international judicial behaviour requires the development of a perspective that con... more Understanding international judicial behaviour requires the development of a perspective that considers both individual and collective action. On the one hand, individual judges are influenced and shaped by their background and trajectory prior to their international judicial appointment; on the other hand, when appointed to international courts, they become part of a particular social setting and group dynamic. The article provides an interpretive, structural theory of judicial behaviour which allows for an understanding of international judicial action and the judicial institutional practices resulting from it. The article explains this double structuration of international judicial behaviour by first reconsidering and amending the notion of habitus, originally developed by Pierre Bourdieu, and secondly by applying this idea to the practice of the Caribbean Court of Justice.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article addresses certain recurrent mistakes about what ENLR’s commitment to being empirical implies. First, it emphasizes that empirical ENLR is firmly situated on the Sein-side of the Sein/Sollen divide. Against the claims of both critics and some proponents of empirical approaches, it further denies that this should restrict the ENLR program to pure quantitative approaches. On the contrary, empirical legal studies can and should include interpretive and qualitative approaches to law. Although this necessarily implies an acknowledgment of the internal normative aspect of law, the study does not thereby itself have to be normative. By restricting ENLR to an analysis of an empirical concept of legal validity it can account fully for the internal normative aspect while itself remaining descriptive and empirical.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The focus is not on these measures, per se, but rather on them as the product of inter-professional battles in, out and around that state. With an analytical starting point in the reflexive sociology developed by Pierre Bourdieu, the social space in which these struggles are taking place is seen as an open fluid field constituted by a mixture of loosely connected symbolic practices occupying different (and changing) positions within the field of state power. The article argues that the environmental space was initially dominated by a group of older lawyers and social scientists and was reconstructed by the arrival of young engineers and biologists, who came from the rad...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A 'Selfie' from Luxembourg: The Court of Justice and the Fabrication of the Pre-Accession Case-Law DossiersSSRN Electronic Journal,  2016How does the European Court of Justice view itself?

The question has riddled EU scholarship for decades. Due to a basic lack of empirical evidence, which is in part a consequence of secrecy surrounding the Court, no empirically firm answer has been provided. In this article we seek to close this gap in scholarship by using a unique data-set, compiled by the Court. We use a set of quantitative and qualitative methods to unpack the so-called historic case-law dossiers assembled by the Court, and presented to thirteen member states upon accessions in 2004, 2007 and 2013. We reconstruct the content of the selection as well as the rather specific legal EU that they project. From our empirical analysis, framed by social science theories on the relationship between knowledge and power, it follows that this was not a neutral compilation of what EU law is. On the contrary, the Court seized the opportunity to highlight its own role in the formation of the EU legal order. At the receiving end, the importance of the dossier was not in the detailed legal knowledge to facilitate the transition to the EU, but primarily the institutional knowledge on who were the real masters of the Treaties.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Agreeing with Ingo Venzke who wrote in his introduction to the symposium that ‘stakes are high’ in the debate over international law and methodology, we argue that both Klabbers and Augsberg, each in their own way, fail to take sufficiently seriously the ENLR challenge to doctrinal scholarship. We argue that Klabbers underestimates the evergreen and persistent character of this challenge when he portrays the current push for New Legal Realism as merely a whimsy fashion wave. And we argue that Augsberg&#39;s essentially Kelsenian defence of doctrinal scholarship is insufficiently robust because it inherits the excess epistemological liberalism ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In its supranational focus, it examines the sociological pressures which have given rise to European public law, the national origins of key transnational legal institutions and the elite motivations driving the formation of European law. In its national focus, it addresses legal questions and problems which have assumed importance in parallel fashion in different national societies, and which have shaped European law more indirectly. Examples of this are the post-1914 transformation of classical private law, the rise of corporatism, the legal response to the post-1945 legacy of authoritarianism, the emergence of human rights law and the growth of judicial review. This two-level sociological approach to European law results in unique insights into the dynamics of national and supranational lega...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses on the role and position of law and jurists in the emergence and transformation of the field of human rights in Europe. Evoking significant European traditions -legally, politically and culturally - the thesis analyses human rights in France, the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries. It provides not only a nationally-informed comparison of these countries but also a study of the regional and national specificities and the interdepency of the national and the international and particularly European dimensions of the progression of human rights following WWII. The analysis is concretely split up into two periods analysing, in a chronological order and in individual country-chapters, the periods 1945-1970 and 1970-2000, in order to show the two great moments of modern human rights : a historical genesis and a subsequent institutionalisation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

MAKING HUMAN RIGHTS INTELLIGIBLE : an introduction to a sociology of human rightsby Gert  Verschraegen and mikael R madsenHuman rights have become a defining feature of contemporary society, permeating public discourse ... more Human rights have become a defining feature of contemporary society, permeating public discourse on politics, law and culture. But why did human rights emerge as a key social force in our time and what is the relationship between rights and the structures of both national and international society? By highlighting the institutional and socio-cultural context of human rights, this timely and thought-provoking collection provides illuminating insights into the emergence and contemporary societal significance of human rights. Drawn from both sides of the Atlantic and adhering to refreshingly different theoretical orientations, the contributors to this volume show how sociology can develop our understanding of human rights and how the emergence of human rights relates to classical sociological questions such as social change, modernisation or state formation. Making Human Rights Intelligible provides an important sociological account of the development of international human rights. It will be of interest to human rights scholars and sociologists of law and anyone wishing to deepen their understanding of one the most significant issues of our time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
