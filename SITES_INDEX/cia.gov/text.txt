The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing. The government is struggling to reverse a surge in violent crime.TipVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.Definitions and NotesGeographyLocationCaribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of VenezuelaGeographic coordinates11 00 N, 61 00 WMap referencesCentral America and the CaribbeanAreatotal: 5,128 sq kmland: 5,128 sq kmwater: 0 sq kmcomparison ranking: total 173Area - comparativeslightly smaller than DelawareArea comparison map:Land boundariestotal: 0 kmCoastline362 kmMaritime claimsterritorial sea: 12 nmcontiguous zone: 24 nmexclusive economic zone: 200 nmcontinental shelf: 200 nm or to the outer edge of the continental marginmeasured from claimed archipelagic baselinesClimatetropical; rainy season (June to December)Terrainmostly plains with some hills and low mountainsElevationhighest point: El Cerro del Aripo 940 mlowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 mmean elevation: 83 mNatural resourcespetroleum, natural gas, asphaltLand useagricultural land: 10.6% (2018 est.)arable land: 4.9% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 4.3% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 1.4% (2018 est.)forest: 44% (2018 est.)other: 45.4% (2018 est.)Irrigated land70 sq km (2012)Population distributionpopulation on Trinidad is concentrated in the western half of the island, on Tobago in the southern halfNatural hazardsoutside usual path of hurricanes and other tropical stormsGeography - notePitch Lake, on Trinidad's southwestern coast, is the world's largest natural reservoir of asphaltPeople and SocietyPopulation1,407,460 (2023 est.)comparison ranking: 157Nationalitynoun: Trinidadian(s), Tobagonian(s)adjective: Trinidadian, Tobagoniannote: Trinbagonian is used on occasion to describe a citizen of the country without specifying the island of originEthnic groupsEast Indian 35.4%, African descent 34.2%, mixed - other 15.3%, mixed - African/East Indian 7.7%, other 1.3%, unspecified 6.2% (2011 est.)LanguagesEnglish (official), Trinidadian Creole English, Tobagonian Creole English, Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect of Hindi), Trinidadian Creole French, Spanish, ChineseReligionsProtestant 32.1% (Pentecostal/Evangelical/Full Gospel 12%, Baptist 6.9%, Anglican 5.7%, Seventh Day Adventist 4.1%, Presbyterian/Congregational 2.5%, other Protestant 0.9%), Roman Catholic 21.6%, Hindu 18.2%, Muslim 5%, Jehovah's Witness 1.5%, other 8.4%, none 2.2%, unspecified 11.1% (2011 est.)Age structure0-14 years: 19.04% (male 136,733/female 131,316)15-64 years: 67.4% (male 482,427/female 466,200)65 years and over: 13.56% (2023 est.)

paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)Airports - with unpaved runways2note: unpaved runways have a surface composition such as grass or packed earth and are most suited to the operation of light aircraft;
