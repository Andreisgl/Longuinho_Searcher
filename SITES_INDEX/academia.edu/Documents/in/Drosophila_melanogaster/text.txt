It is the point at which buildings become more intelligent than their occupants and designers. This will significantly change the roles of the built-environment professions in the design, fabrication, construction and operation of buildings. By exploring self-organizing behaviour in biological development this article describes the approaching challenges of this architectural singularity. Elements of morphogenetic design have been applied in various disciplines associated with intelligent building (IB), including architecture, engineering and computing. However, these previous discipline-specific approaches have not considered the trans-disciplinary implications of morphogenetic growth processes on the role of the disciplines associated with IB. Therefore, this article introduces a science fiction prototyping (SFP) scenario that proposes a morphogenetic design process for IBs based on Drosophila melanogaster development and grounded in the contemporary technologies of Building Information Modelling, digital fabrication and parametric design. Based on a discussion of the implications for the design team a morphogenetic architecture framework for IB is proposed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tim McGinley•  8  BIM (Architecture), Drosophila melanogaster, Parametric Design (Architecture), Digital MorphogenesisGenetic Change of Recombination Value inSelection of GI-Sb coupling heterozygotes was carried out for more than one hundred generations commencing with six independent lines drawn from a common base population.

Population sizes were eight, sixteen and forty-eight parents per generation. The effect of natural selection on recombination value was measured by sampling and testing females at varying intervals of time. There was a significant reduction in percentage recombination between GZ and Sb from fifteen to a level between five and ten in four out of six of the original lines. In most cases this reduction occurred rather rapidly after the initiation of the experiment. In the remaining two lines there was no significant decrease in recombination value; there was, however, a significant increase in at least one subline of this group. The rapid rate of change of recombination value is most readily explained by the presence of a recombination modifying gene which is linked to the modified region.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the MSL complex increases male X transcription approximately twofold. X-specific targeting is thought to occur through sequence-dependent binding to chromatin entry sites (CESs), followed by spreading in cis to active genes. We tested this model by asking how newly evolving sex chromosome arms in Drosophila miranda acquired dosage compensation. We found evidence for the creation of new CESs, with the analogous sequence and spacing as in D. melanogaster, providing strong support for the spreading model in the establishment of dosage compensation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shouyong Peng•  13  Molecular Evolution, Biology, Drosophila melanogaster, MedicineTrafficking and chromatin dynamics of holocarboxylase synthetase during development of Drosophila melanogasterSave to LibraryDownloadby Mario Zurita•  20  Drosophila melanogaster, Molecular Genetics, Gene expression, AntibodiesGlycosidases in the plasma membrane of Ceratitis capitata spermatozoaSave to LibraryDownloadby Maria-Elisa Perotti and +1Maria Pasini•  26  Zoology, Kinetics, Drosophila melanogaster, Protein StabilityRetrotransposon gtwin: structural analysis and distribution in drosophila strainsSave to LibraryDownloadby Nina Karpova•  11  Genetics, Drosophila melanogaster, Sequence Analysis, DrosophilaThe Drosophila EGF receptor gene homolog: Conservation of both hormone binding and kinase domainsChicken v-erB probe was used to isolate a unique clone of Drosophila melanogaster DNA.

A complete nucleotide sequence of the coding region has been obtained. The putative Drosophila EGF receptor protein is similar in overall organization to the human homolog. It shows three distinct domains: an extracellular putative EGF binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. The overall amino acid homology is 41% in the extracellular domain and 55% in the kinase domain. Two cysteine-rich regions, a hallmark of the human ligand-binding domain, have also been conserved. Fusion of the coding sequences of the kinase and extracellular domains generating the receptor gene must have occurred over 800 million years ago.Save to Libraryby Etta  Livneh and +1J.

For large-scale screens, RNAi is used to systematically down-regulate genes of interest and analyze their roles in a biological process. However, RNAi is associated with off-target effects (OTEs), including microRNA (miRNA)-like OTEs. The contribution of reagent-specific OTEs to RNAi screen data sets can be significant. In addition, the post-screen validation process is time and labor intensive. Thus, the availability of robust approaches to identify candidate off-targeted transcripts would be beneficial. Significant efforts have been made to eliminate false positive results attributable to sequence-specific OTEs associated with RNAi. These approaches have included improved algorithms for RNAi reagent design, incorporation of chemical modifications into siRNAs, and the use of various bioinformatics strategies to identify possible OTEs in screen results.

A loss of function mutation, heph(03429), results in varied defects in embryonic developmental processes, leading to embryonic lethality. However, the suite of molecular functions that are disrupted in the mutant remains unknown. We have used an unbiased high throughput sequencing approach to identify transcripts that are misregulated in this mutant. Misregulated transcripts show evidence of significantly altered patterns of splicing (exon skipping, 5&#39; and 3&#39; splice site switching), alternative 5&#39; ends, and mRNA level changes (up and down regulation). These findings are independently supported by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and in situ hybridization. We show that a group of genes, such as Zerknüllt, z600 and screw are among the most upregulated in the mutant and have been functionally linked to dorso-ventral pattern...Save to LibraryDownloadby Ravinder Singh•  16  Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, BiologyMeeting the energetic demands of insect diapause: Nutrient storage and utilizationSave to LibraryDownloadby David  Denlinger and +1Daniel Hahn•  11  Physiology, Zoology, Caenorhabditis elegans, Insect PhysiologyRole of Drosophila calcium channel cacophony in dopaminergic neurodegeneration andneuroprotectionSave to LibraryDownloadby Lyle Wiemerslage•  9  Brain Imaging, Obesity, Parkinson's Disease, DiabetesNutraceutical Interventions for Promoting Healthy Aging in Invertebrate ModelsAging is a complex and inevitable biological process that is associated with numerous chronically debilitating health effects.

Development of effective interventions for promoting healthy aging is an active but challenging area of research. Mechanistic studies in various model organisms, noticeably two invertebrates,Caenorhabditis elegansandDrosophila melanogaster, have identified many genes and pathways as well as dietary interventions that modulate lifespan and healthspan. These studies have shed light on some of the mechanisms involved in aging processes and provide valuable guidance for developing efficacious aging interventions. Nutraceuticals made from various plants contain a significant amount of phytochemicals with diverse biological activities. Phytochemicals can modulate many signaling pathways that exert numerous health benefits, such as reducing cancer incidence and inflammation, and promoting healthy aging.

Probing cosmid libraries with aMAGE-1 sequence, we identified 11 closely related genes. The analysis of hamster-human somatic cell hybrids indicated that the 12MAGE genes are located in the q terminal region of chromosome X. LikeMAGE-1, the 11 additionalMAGE genes have their entire coding sequence located in the last exon, which shows 64%-85% identity with that ofMAGE-1. The coding sequences of theMAGE genes predict the same main structural features for allMAGE proteins. In contrast, the promoters and first exons of the12 MAGE genes show considerable variability, suggesting that the existence of this gene family enables the same function to be expressed under different transcriptional controls. The expression of eachMAGE gene was evaluated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Six genes of theMAGE family includingMAGE-1 were found to be expressed at a high level in a number of tumors of various histological types. None was expressed in a large panel of healthy tissues, with the exception of testis and placenta.Save to LibraryDownloadby Karen Arden•  52  Information Systems, Genetics, Immunology, GenomicsEpithelial reorganization events during late extraembryonic development in a hemimetabolous insectSave to LibraryDownloadby Kristen Panfilio•  13  Developmental Biology, Drosophila melanogaster, Morphogenesis, ApoptosisProtective effect of ethanol on X-ray-induced mitotic recombination indrosophila melanogasterSave to LibraryDownloadby Ana  Palermo•  16  Free Radicals, Drosophila melanogaster, Free Radical, Biological SciencesThe influence of retinal innervation on neurogenesis in the first optic ganglion of drosophilaSave to LibraryDownloadby Hermann Steller•  18  Cognitive Science, Stem Cells, DNA replication, Drosophila melanogasterOLFACTORY BEHAVIOR IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTERSave to LibraryDownloadby Robert Anholt•Drosophila melanogasterBlockade of the central generator of locomotor rhythm by noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists inDrosophila larvaeSave to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Cattaert•  10  Cognitive Science, Drosophila melanogaster, Neurobiology, GlutamatePurification and characterization of the prothoracicotropic hormone of Drosophila melanogasterThe prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) of Drosophila melanogaster is a modulator of ecdysteroid (molting hormone) synthesis and was isolated and characterized from extracts of whole larvae (approximately 4 x 10(5) larvae).

The purification protocol included delipidation, salt-extraction, heat treatment, conventional column chromatography, and HPLC, and yielded about 50 microg of pure hormone. Biological activity was followed using a ring gland in vitro assay in which ecdysteroidogenesis by control ring glands as measured by radioimmunoassay was compared with ring gland incubations containing active fractions. The molecular weight of the purified PTTH was 45 kDa and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicated that those analyzed sequences displayed no significant homology with known peptides or peptide hormones, including PTTH from the silkmoth, Bombyx mori. Western blot analysis indicated that the native form of Drosophila PTTH was a single 66-kDa polypeptide with N-linked carbohydrate chains and intrachain disulfide bonds. The purified 45-kDa peptide is the deglycosylated form, a result of glycosidase activity present during preparation of the PTTH extract. The deglycosylated form shows heterogeneity, presumably as a result of varying degrees of deglycosylation at the N terminus.Save to LibraryDownloadby Chung Lee•  17  Immunohistochemistry, Drosophila melanogaster, Heat Treatment, MultidisciplinarySampson and Williams, 2012a, Protocol for ex vivo incubation of Drosophila primary post-embryonic haemocytes for real-time analysesSave to LibraryDownloadby Christopher Sampson•  4  Drosophila melanogaster, Cell Culture, Time-Lapse, Primary Cell CultureTranscription factor E93 specifies adult metamorphosis in hemimetabolous and holometabolous insectsSave to LibraryDownloadby Xavier Franch-Marro•  13  Drosophila melanogaster, Transcription Factors, Multidisciplinary, AnimalsRadiation-Induced Changes in the Life Span of Laboratory Drosophila melanogaster StrainsChronic irradiation (accumulated dose 0.6–0.8 Gy) was shown to change the life span in male Drosophila melanogaster.Death was retarded in wild-type strains and accelerated in mutant strains defective in DNA repair and displaying a higher... moreChronic irradiation (accumulated dose 0.6–0.8 Gy) was shown to change the life span in male Drosophila melanogaster.Death was retarded in wild-type strains and accelerated in mutant strains defective in DNA repair and displaying a higher sensitivity to induction of apoptosis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexey Moskalev•  4  Genetics, Drosophila melanogaster, DNA repair, Life SpanWavelet analysis of DNA sequencesSave to LibraryDownloadby Praveen Kumar•  23  Mathematics, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thalianaDrosophila Muller F Elements Maintain a Distinct Set of Genomic Properties Over 40 Million Years of EvolutionThe Muller F element (4.2 Mb, ~80 protein-coding genes) is an unusual autosome of Drosophila melanogaster; it is mostly heterochromatic with a low recombination rate.

To investigate how these properties impact the evolution of repeats and genes, we manually improved the sequence and annotated the genes on the D. erecta, D. mojavensis, and D. grimshawi F elements and euchromatic domains from the Muller D element. We find that F elements have higher transposon density (25%-50%) than euchromatic reference regions (3%-11%). Among the F elements, D. grimshawi has the lowest transposon density (particularly DINE-1: 2% versus 11%-27%). F element genes have larger coding spans, more coding exons, larger introns, and lower codon bias. Comparison of the Effective Number of Codons with the Codon Adaptation Index shows that, in contrast to the other species, codon bias in D. grimshawi F element genes can be attributed primarily to selection instead of mutational biases, suggesting that density ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Peterson Cullimore•  20  Bioinformatics, Genetics, Genomics, Computational BiologyInsect Vision: A Few Tricks to Regulate Flight AltitudeSave to LibraryDownloadby Jean-Christophe Zufferey•  12  Drosophila melanogaster, Biological Sciences, Navigation, CuesDevelopment of behavioral competence in youngDrosophila melanogaster adultsSave to LibraryDownloadby Scott McRobert•  5  Zoology, Behavior, Drosophila melanogaster, Central Nervous SystemThe search for cavitation in vivoSave to LibraryDownloadby Sheryl Gracewski•  20  Drosophila melanogaster, Ultrasound, Multidisciplinary, MammalsDrosophila soluble guanylyl cyclase mutants exhibit increased foraging locomotion: behavioral and genomic investigationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Marla Sokolowski•  20  Genomics, Behavior Genetics, Biology, Drosophila melanogasterDrosophila as a model system for studying lifespan and neuroprotective activities of plant-derived compoundsSave to LibraryDownloadby Hyungwook KWON•  17  Genetics, Zoology, Biology, Applied ResearchAyurvedic Amalaki Rasayana promotes improved stress tolerance and thus has anti-aging effects in Drosophila melanogasterAmalaki Rasayana (AR) is a common Ayurvedic herbal formulation of Phyllanthus emblica fruits and other ingredients and is used for general good health and healthy aging.

There are, however, two isolated reports of sialic acid occurring in the insect species Drosophila melanogaster and Galleria mellonella. Since insects are classified as protostomes, these findings call previous assumption on the phylogenetic distribution and thus on the evolution of sialic acids into question. Here, we report the occurrence of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in larvae of the cicada Philaenus spumarius. Cytochemical analysis of larval sections with lectins from Sambucus nigra and Limax flavus suggested the presence of sialic acids in the concrement vacuoles of the Malpighian tubules. The monoclonal antibody MAb 735, which is specific for polysialic acid, labelled the same structures. A chemical analysis performed by HPLC of fluorescent derivatives of sialic acids and by GLC-MS provided sound evidence for the presence of Neu5Ac in the Philaenus spumarius larvae. These data suggest that in this cicada Neu5Ac occurs in α2,8-linked polysialic acid structures and in α2,6-linkages. The results provide further evidence for the existence of sialic acids in insects and in linkages known to occur in glycoconjugates of deuterostomate origin.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lee Shaw•  8  Medical Microbiology, Drosophila melanogaster, Chemical Analysis, Galleria MellonellaPRC2 Controls Drosophila Oocyte Cell Fate by Repressing Cell Cycle GenesSave to LibraryDownloadby Giacomo Cavalli and +1Filippo Ciabrelli•  7  DNA replication, Drosophila melanogaster, Biological Sciences, FemaleWolbachia Infections in Anopheles gambiae Cells: Transcriptomic Characterization of a Novel Host-Symbiont InteractionSave to LibraryDownloadby Jason Rasgon•  18  Microbiology, Immunology, Medical Microbiology, MalariaHeat shock proteins and aging in Drosophila melanogasterSave to LibraryDownloadby Geneviève Morrow•  9  Aging, Drosophila melanogaster, Oxidative Stress, Molecular chaperonesFunctional Characterization of Drosophila microRNAs by a Novel in Vivo LibraryAnimal microRNAs (miRNA) are implicated in the control of nearly all cellular functions.

Due to high sequence redundancy within the miRNA gene pool, loss of most of these 21- to 24-bp long RNAs individually does not cause a phenotype. Thus, only very few miRNAs have been associated with clear functional roles. We constructed a transgenic UAS-miRNA library in Drosophila melanogaster that contains 180 fly miRNAs. This library circumvents the redundancy issues by facilitating the controlled misexpression of individual miRNAs and is a useful tool to complement loss-of-function approaches. Demonstrating the effectiveness of our library, 78 miRNAs induced clear phenotypes. Most of these miRNAs were previously unstudied. Furthermore, we present a simple system to create GFP sensors to monitor miRNA expression and test direct functional interactions in vivo.

Embryos from females homozygous for the mutation gnu undergo rounds of DNA synthesis without nuclear division to produce giant nuclei, and at the same time show many cycles of centrosome replication (Freeman et al. 1986). S phase can be inhibited in wild-type Drosophila embryos by injecting aphidicolin, in which case not only do centrosomes replicate, but chromosomes continue to condense and decondense, the nuclear envelope undergoes cycles of breakdown and reformation, and cycles of budding activity continue at the cortex of the embryo (Raff and Glover, 1988). If aphidicolin is injected when nuclei are in the interior of the embryo, centrosomes dissociate from the nuclei and can migrate to the cortex. Pole cells without nuclei then form around those centrosomes that reach the posterior pole (Raff and Glover, 1989); the centrosomes presumably must interact with polar granules, the materna...Save to LibraryDownloadby Myles Axton•  9  DNA replication, Drosophila melanogaster, Biological Sciences, MitosisSub-cellular localisation of the white/scarlet ABC transporter to pigment granule membranes within the compound eye of Drosophila melanogasterSave to LibraryDownloadby Gary  Ewart•  9  Genetics, Electron Microscopy, Drosophila melanogaster, GeneticaPb2+: An endocrine disruptor in Drosophila?Save to LibraryDownloadby Helmut Hirsch•  20  Genetics, Animal Behavior, Drosophila melanogaster, Gene expressionThe acetylcholinesterase gene and organophosphorus resistance in the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprinaAcetylcholinesterase (AChE), encoded by the Ace gene, is the primary target of organophosphorous (OP) and carbamate insecticides.
