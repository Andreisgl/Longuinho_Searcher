Dinka (Thuɔŋjäŋ)
Dinka is a member of the Western Nilotic branch of Nilo-Saharan 
 languages. It is spoken mainly in southern Sudan by about 2-3 million 
 people, who call themselves Dinka (Jiëŋ). There 
 are five major dialects: Ngok, Rek, Agaar, Twic/Twi East and 
 Bork, which are more or less mutually intelligible. The Rek dialect 
 is considered the standard or prestige variety. There are also 
 speakers of Dinka in Egypt, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands,
 UK and USA.
A number of methods for writing Dinka using the Latin alphabet
 were developed by missionaries during the 19th and 20th centuries. 
 Information about the language first appeared in Die Dinka-Sprache 
 in Central-Afrika by Johannes Chrysostomus Mitterrutzner, which 
 was publised in 1866. The current Latin orthography is derived from 
 the alphabet developed for the southern Sudanese languages at the 
 Rejaf language conference in 1928.
