 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. 
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.
Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)
  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.
This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

Published on Jun 23, 2014Over the last few years, MLW attendees have heard about the release and evolution of the Microsoft Multilingual App Toolkit (MAT) for Windows Store and Phone apps and the MS Translator service integration into the toolkit. In this talk, we will demonstrate MAT v.3 and will focus on how to create a service provider for any translation service source as a key extensibility feature. We will also briefly address new features and improvements in this release. As before, we continue to share our interest in support for the XLIFF standard as a showcase implementation.Talk delivered at the 7th MultilingualWeb Workshop (http://www.multilingualweb.eu/documen...), 7.May 2014, Madrid, Spain
