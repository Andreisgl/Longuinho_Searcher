The work is based on the Spiritual "I Want Jesus to Walk with Me." The oft-repeated assertion that the work was inspired by, written for, or in any other way related to the Selma-to-Montgomery "freedom marches" led by Dr. Martin Luther King, jr., is false. UPDATE: Excerpts from The "Montgomery Variations" will be performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the direction of Maestro Gustavo Dudamel on 15 July 2021 (see here:  https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/events/performances/1260/2021-07-15/peter-and-the-wolf-with-viola-davis-dudamel ).

Citizens most important role is as voter.  There is another concept of democracy deep in American history that I experienced first hand in the civil rights movement -- citizens as co-creators (and thus co-owners) of democracy.

Sartain's elegantly laid-out topic has enormous potential. We know very little about black women activists in the South in this time period (most historical scholarship focuses on women during Reconstruction or the Civil Rights era), and as the work of historians Elsa Barkley Brown, Annette Gordon-Reed and Deborah Gray White shows, when we learn more about African American women's historical activities, we often reframe the dominant narratives of major periods of American history. Thus Sartain's focus on women in the Louisiana National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is a welcome addition to the fields of African American historiography, women's history, and the history of social movements.

Ms. Moody was a civil rights pioneer and the famous author of Coming of Age in Mississippi. She grew up in Centreville, Miss., where she overcame poverty, racism, persecution, and the threats of death. She became a respected leader in the Civil Rights Movement.Drawing on the author's background in marketing and journalism, this document presents a list of practical ideas adapted by AMHP for promoting Ms. Moody's history. The ideas include promotional work through schools, churches, the local community, government agencies, social media, and the news media. In addition to honoring her with a street and highway bearing her name, AMHP plans call for having a proclamation issued for “Anne Moody Day.” The author, who serves as AMHP chairman, has said the promotional campaign is about “history, education and tourism.” Current and future generations need to know her story, according to the author.Note: Readers are encouraged to follow updates on Ms. Moody’s history by following @AnneMoodyHP on Twitter. #AnneMoodySave to LibraryDownloadby Roscoe Barnes III•  36  Christianity, History, Cultural Studies, Black Studies Or African American Studies“Paternalism has Ceased to be Good and Begins to be Ridiculous:” Knoxville College, University of Tennessee, and Campus Activism, 1964-1969.

Drawing on primary data that consist of detailed semi-structured interviews with members of the Nashville nonviolent movement during the late 1950s and 1960s, we contribute unique insights about how the nonviolent repertoire was diffused into one movement current that became integral to moving the wider southern movement. Innovating with the concept of serially-linked movement schools—-locations where the deeply intense work took place, the didactic and dialogical labor of analyzing, experimenting, creatively translating, and re-socializing human agents in preparation for dangerous performance—we follow the biographical paths of carriers of the nonviolent Gandhian repertoire as it was learned, debated, transformed, and carried from India to the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) and Howard University to Nashville (TN) and then into multiple movement campaigns across the South. Members of the Nashville movement core cadre—products of the Nashville movement workshop schools—were especially important because they served as bridging leaders by serially-linking schools and collective action campaigns. In this way they played critical roles in bridging structural holes (places where movement had yet to be successfully established) and were central to diffusing the movement throughout the South. Our theoretical and empirical approach contributes to the development of the dialogical perspective on movement diffusion generally and to knowledge about how the nonviolent repertoire became integral to the U.S. civil rights movement in particular.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jonathan  Coley•  2  Social Movements, Civil Rights MovementComing Out of the Psychedelic Closet (2015)Terence McKenna argued that sovereignty over one’s consciousness is the next great civil rights struggle after sexism, racism, and homophobia. “Coming out” about one’s psychedelic identity, interests, and/or experiences is an important... moreTerence McKenna argued that sovereignty over one’s consciousness is the next great civil rights struggle after sexism, racism, and homophobia. “Coming out” about one’s psychedelic identity, interests, and/or experiences is an important part of redefining the public perception of psychedelics and of those who choose to experience their effects.

It was a brutal killing by the manner in which Minneapolis policeman, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, slowly and viciously forcing the life out of Floyd for almost 9 minutes. While Chauvin’s fellow officers, by not coming to Floyd’s aid, were complicit to the crime. There was no need for Chauvin to have subdued Floyd in such a cruel and purposeful way until Floyd could no longer breathe, especially since Floyd had already been restrained. Nor, did Floyd have any weapon. Nor had he committed any crime warranting such force. In a video captured by a teenager, Floyd could be heard stating he could not breathe, and calling out for his deceased mother. Since 2014, there have been other police killings of African-Americans with no consequences for the police officers involved.Save to LibraryDownloadby J. P.

These include Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., in the Selma–Montgomery March in 1965, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who, along with their fellow worker James Chaney, were slain by local Ku Klux Klan members during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964. On June 12, 1965, three months after the Selma–Montgomery March and one year after the tragedy in Mississippi, Lynn Goldsmith departed from the Port Authority Bus Terminal near her hometown of Princeton, New Jersey. She had turned nineteen years old only two days prior. As one of twenty-three students from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, she was planning to spend that summer in South Carolina as a volunteer serving the civil rights movement. The group belonged to the Summer Community Organization and Political Education Project (SCOPE), operating under the auspices of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Atlanta, where Goldsmith arrived after a twenty-two-hour bus ride, was the location of the SCOPE orientation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Southern Jewish History•  6  Jewish History, American South, Civil Rights Movement, South CarolinaReview of Michael Ezra, ed., Civil Rights Movement: People and Perspectives.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Hutchinson•Civil Rights MovementPolitical Advocacy For Justice: Mary McLeod Bethune & the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW)***Description of this Reading***: This is chapter six of my dissertation with only eleven pages available for preview here on Academia.edu.

Till’s death and media coverage that followed generated an affective connection by white Northern liberals to the plight of African-Americans in the South; as a result, Till’s death and the mourning that followed contributed to subtle but important changes that enabled the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement to appeal to the white majority. This effort succeeded in generating white sympathy because it exposed the distance between formal law and law on the ground and expanded the audience to the conflict.Save to LibraryDownloadby Heather Pool•  4  Racial Identity, Civil Rights Movement, Death, Grief, and Mourning, Emmett TillJ.

Griggs (1872‒-1933) was among the most prolific African American authors at the turn of the twentieth century. In contrast to his Northern contemporaries Paul Laurence Dunbar and Charles Chesnutt, Griggs, as W. E. B. Du Bois, remarked, he “spoke primarily to the Negro race,” using his own Nashville-based publishing company to issue four of his novels. Griggs pastored Baptist churches in three Southern states, and played a leading role in the influential but understudied National Baptist Convention. Until recently little was known about the personal and professional life of this religious and community leader. Thus,: critics could only contextualize his literary texts to a limited degree and were forced to speculate about how he published them. This literary biography, the first written about the author, draws extensively on primary sources and late late-nineteenth- and early early-twentieth-century periodicals, local and national, African American and white. A very different Sutton Griggs emerges from these materials—--a dynamic figure who devoted himself to literature for a longer period and to a more profound extent than has ever been previously imagined, but also someone who also frequently found himself embroiled in controversy because of what he said in his writings and the means he used to publish them. The book challenges currently held notions about the audience for, and the content, production, and dissemination of politically engaged US black fiction, thereby altering the perception of the African American literature and print culture of the period.Save to LibraryDownloadby john gruesser•  9  African American Literature, Biography, Civil Rights Movement, NashvilleTo what extent did the aims of the campaigners for civil rights stay the same from 1865 to 1992?
