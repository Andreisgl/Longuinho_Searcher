Emerging 3D immersive VR/AR applications use noisy 3D point cloud, typically from single RGB-D camera (such as Microsoft&#39;s Kinect) to generate standalone (no reference) 3D human open mesh (with boundaries) in real time, that needs evaluation. A learning-based objective measure is proposed to rate the visual quality by emulating human perception of 3D human open mesh quality. 2-pronged objective evaluation is performed: (a) Global holistic score captures the efficacy of the mesh to represent the human model as a whole, by considering mesh completeness and mesh noise. (b) Local part-based score caters to the need of varying roughness in different parts of the human body, by finding the deviation in the face normals for all the adjacent triangles in ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Decision making in such applications is highly dependent on LiDAR data. Thus, it becomes crucial to authenticate the data before using it. Though authentication of 2D digital images and video has been widely studied, the area of 3D data forensic is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate and identify three possible attacks on the LiDAR data. We also propose two novel forensic approaches as a countermeasure for such attacks and study their effectiveness. The first forensic approach utilises the density consistency check while the second method leverages the occlusion effect for revealing the forgery. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forgery attacks and raise the awareness against unauthenticated use of LiDAR data. The performance analyses of the proposed forensic approaches indicate that the proposed methods are very efficient and provide the detection accuracy of more than 95% for certain kinds of forgery attacks. While the forensic approach is unable to handle all forgery attacks, the study motivates to explore more sophisticated forensic methods for LiDAR data.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From traditional mirror box to virtual reality-based approaches, a wide spectrum of treatments using mimic feedback of the amputated limb have been developed for alleviating phantom limb pain. In our previous work, Mixed reality-based framework for MAnaging Phantom Pain (Mr.MAPP) was presented and used to generate a virtual phantom upper limb, in real time, to manage the phantom pain. However, amputation of the lower limb is more common than that of the upper limb. Hence, in this paper, on top of demonstrating the reproducibility of the Mr.MAPP framework for upper limb, we extend it to manage lower limb phantom pain as well. Unlike an upper limb amputee, a patient with lower limb amputated is constrained to perform the training procedure in a sitting posture. Accordingly, virtual training games are designed for lower limb exercises with sitting posture such as knee flexion and extension, ankle dorsiflexion and tandem coordinated movement. Finally, the technical details of the system setup for playing the training games are introduced.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Visual Latency Estimator for 3D Tele-ImmersionProceedings of the 8th ACM on Multimedia Systems Conference,  20173D Tele-Immersion systems allow geographically distributed users to interact in a virtual world u... more 3D Tele-Immersion systems allow geographically distributed users to interact in a virtual world using their &quot;live&quot; 3D models. The capture, reconstruction, transfer, and rendering of these models introduce significant latency into the system. Implicit Latency (ℒ&#39;) can be estimated using system clocks to measure the time after the data was received from the RGB-D camera, till the request to render the result. The Observed Latency (ℒ) between a real world event and the event being rendered on the display, cannot be accurately represented by ℒ&#39; since ℒ&#39; ignores the time taken to capture, or update the display, etc. In this paper, a Visual Pattern based Latency Estimation (VPLE) approach is introduced to calculate the real world visual latency of a system without the need for any custom hardware. VPLE generates a constantly changing pattern that is captured and rendered by the 3DTI system. An external observer records both the pattern and the rendered results at high frame rates. ℒ is estimated by calculating the difference between the generated and rendered patterns. VPLE is extended to allow ℒ estimation between geographically distributed sites. Evaluations show that the accuracy of VPLE depends on the refresh rate of the pattern, and is within 4ms. ℒ of a distributed 3DTI system implemented on the GPU is significantly lower than the CPU implementation, and is comparable to video streaming. It is also shown that the ℒ&#39; estimates for GPU based 3DTI implementations are off by almost 100% compared to the ℒ.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, mobile HMDs are highly constrained with limited graphics processing units (GPUs) and low processing power and onboard memory. Hence, VR developers must be cognizant of the number of polygons contained within their virtual environments to avoid rendering at low frame rates and inducing simulator sickness. The most robust and rapid approach to keeping the overall number of polygons low is to use mesh simplification algorithms to create low-poly versions of pre-existing, high-poly models. Unfortunately, most existing mesh simplification algorithms cannot adequately handle meshes with lots of boundaries or nonmanifold meshes, which are common attributes of many 3D models.In this article, we present QEM4VR, a high-fidelity mesh simplification algorithm specifically designed for VR.

Our proposal illustrates the unique cyber-physical properties that sensor devices can leverage for their cyber-security. While traditional attestation algorithms exchange digital challenges between devices authenticating each other, our work instead proposes challenges that manifest physically in the field of view of the camera (e.g., a QR code in a display). This physical (challenge) and cyber (verification) attestation mechanism can help protect systems even when the sensors (cameras) and actuators (a display, infrared LEDs, color light bulbs) are compromised. In this article, we consider skillful adversaries that can capture the correct challenges (our system is sending) and can re-create them in the response to try fooling our verification system, and we propose new algorithms to detect these powerful attackers.

The quality of experience depends on the available network bandwidth, quality of the 3D model generated and the time taken for rendering. In a collaborative environment, achieving high quality, high frame rate rendering by transmitting data to multiple sites having different bandwidth is challenging. In this paper we introduce a network adaptive textured mesh generation scheme to transmit varying quality data based on the available bandwidth. To reduce the volume of information transmitted, a visual quality based vertex selection approach is used to generate a sparse representation of the user. This sparse representation is then transmitted to the receiver side where a sweep-line based technique is used to generate a 3D mesh of the user. High visual quality is maintained by transmitting a high resolution texture image compressed using a lossy compression algorithm. In our studies users were unable to notice visual quality variations of the rendered 3D model even at 90% compression.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this paper, we first present a real-time anti-forensic 3D object stream manipulation framework to capture and manipulate live RBG-D data streams to create realistic images/videos showing individuals performing activities they did not actually do. The framework uses computer vision and graphics methods to render photorealistic animations of live mesh models captured using the camera. Next, we conducted a visual inspection of the manipulated RGB-D streams (just like security personnel would do) by users who are computer vision and graphics scientists. The study shows that it was significantly difficult to distinguish between the real or reconstructed rendering of such 3D video sequences, thus clearly showing the potential security risk involved. Finally, we investigate the efficacy of forensic approaches for detecting such manipulations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Recent research [2, 3] has identified several possible scenarios of forgery attacks during such data communication between autonomous vehicles and human operators. Hence, there is a distinct requirement for forensics research on the multi-modal LiDAR and RGB camera data generated from autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a new dataset, ADD-FAR (Attacked Driving Dataset for Forensics Analysis and Research) that contains forged driving scenarios based on KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite [4, 5]. This dataset is created by identifying objects of interest using automated 3D object detection and carrying out the attacks with different levels of risk as defined in [3]. As part of the dataset, we are also providing the scripts used for automatically generating the different types of attacks. These scripts can easily be modified to work with other driving datasets apart from KITTI as well as for creating new forms of attacks.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
