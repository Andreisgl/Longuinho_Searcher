In this study, we investigate the geographic origins of invasiveX. laevispopulations in France and Portugal using the phylogeographic structure ofX. laevisin its native South African range. In total, 80 individuals from the whole area known to be invaded in France and Portugal were analysed for two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, allowing a comparison with 185 specimens from the native range. Our results show that native phylogeographic lineages have contributed differently to invasive EuropeanX. laevispopulations. In Portugal, genetic and historical data suggest a single colonization event involving a small number of individuals from the south-western Cape region in South Africa. In contrast, French invasiveX. laevisencompass two distinct native phylogeographic lineages, i.e., one from the south-western Cape region and one from the...Download Free PDFView PDFItalian Journal of ZoologyIdentification and potential origin of invasive clawed frogs Xenopus (Anura: Pipidae) in Sicily based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNAMario Lo ValvoAfrican clawed frogs of the widespread polytypic species Xenopus laevis Daudin, 1802 (ranging large parts of sub-Saharan Africa) have been spreading since the 1940s, and have established reproductive populations in Europe, Asia and the Americas, where they can have negative impact as competitors of native amphibians and as disease vectors for chytridomycosis or ranaviruses. Here we use two mitochondrial (cytochrome b, 16S rDNA) and one nuclear (RAG 1: Recombination Associated Gene 1) DNA markers to infer the potential origin of invasive clawed frogs from Sicily that represent the largest invasive population in Europe. Identical mtDNA haplotypes match with those of Xenopus laevis, and Sicilian clawed frogs very probably belong to a lineage from the Cape Region of South Africa, most likely originating from a laboratory stock.Nuclear data support this conclusion. Identical mtDNA sequences (cyt b, 16S) of frogs sampled across their range in Sicily suggest the occurrence of a single sour...Download Free PDFView PDFMeasey_et_al_2012_BiolInvFrancesco LilloDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS ONEImpacts of Climate Change on the Global Invasion Potential of the African Clawed Frog Xenopus laevis2016 • Thierry BackeljauDownload Free PDFView PDFImpacts of Climate Change on the Global Invasion Potential of the African Clawed Frog Xenopus laevis a11111G.

Part A, Ecological and integrative physiologyEcophysiological models for global invaders: Is Europe a big playground for the African clawed frog?2020 • Philipp GinalOne principle threat prompting the worldwide decline of amphibians is the introduction of nonindigenous amphibians. The African Clawed Frog, Xenopus laevis, is now one of the widest distributed amphibians occurring on four continents with ongoing range expansion including large parts of Europe. Species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools to predict the invasive risk of these species. Previous efforts have focused on correlative approaches but these can be vulnerable to extrapolation errors when projecting species&#39; distributions in nonnative ranges. Recent developments emphasise more robust process-based models, which use physiological data like critical thermal limits and performance, or hybrid models using both approaches. Previous correlative SDMs predict different patterns in the potential future distribution of X. laevis in Europe, but it is likely that these models do not assess its full invasive potential. Based on physiological performance trials, we calculate ...Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal realized niche divergence in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis2017 • Julien  CourantAlthough of crucial importance for invasion biology and impact assessments of climate change, it remains widely unknown how species cope to environmental conditions beyond their currently realized climatic niches (i.e., those climatic conditions existing populations are exposed to). The African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, native to southern Africa, has established numerous invasive populations on multiple continents making it a pertinent model organism to study environmental niche dynamics. In this study, we assess whether the realized niches of the invasive populations in Europe, South, and North America represent subsets of the species&#39; realized niche in its native distributional range or if niche shifts are traceable. If shifts are traceable, we ask whether the realized niches of invasive populations still contain signatures of the niche of source populations what could indicate local adaptations. Univariate comparisons among bioclimatic conditions at native and invaded range...Download Free PDFView PDFManagement of Biological InvasionsHigh abundance of invasive African clawed frog Xenopus laevis in Chile: challenges for their control and updated invasive distribution2019 • MARTA ARAUZ MORADownload Free PDFView PDFHistorical perspectives on global exports and research of African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevisG. John MeaseyTrade in live animals has been associated with populations of invasive species as well as the spread of disease. The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, was exported from its native region of southern Africa for use in pregnancy testing, and later for laboratory use as the model amphibian. We use historical export figures and publication records to detail the size and extent of the global trade. In addition, we explore the link between exports, scientific use, and invasive populations and chytrid outbreaks. Exports reached 400 000 animals in the first 30 years from 1940, but only 86 000 were sent outside Africa. Exports out of Africa peaked in the 1950s, while scientific publications using Xenopus laevis grew in the 1970s, coinciding with a rise in invasive populations and chytrid outbreaks. We show a lag between exports of Xenopus laevis and a rise in invasive populations of around 15 years. Our data demonstrate the global reach of the exports of Xenopus laevis from South Africa, and a later, much wider distribution via the scientific network which was supplied by secondary means outside of South Africa. We contend that our data demonstrate that by 1970, Xenopus laevis was the world's most widely distributed amphibian: institutions in 48 countries were supplied with live colonies on all continents except Antarctica. There is some evidence linking exports and scientific studies with invasive populations, but others appear to be linked to secondary distributors of this species.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
