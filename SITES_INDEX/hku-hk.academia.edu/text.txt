In this paper we discuss whether ananalogous distinction can be drawn in philosophy of language. Our conclusion is negative: Evenif you think that distinction can be put to work within moral and political philosophy, there’s nouseful way to extend it to work that has been done in the philosophy of language.

People were then engaged in the engineering of various philosophical concepts (in various sub-disciplines), but typically not self-consciously so. Qua philosophical method, conceptual engineering was under-explored, often ignored, and poorly understood. In my lifetime, I have never seen interest in a philosophical topic grow with such explosive intensity. The sociology behind this is fascinating and no doubt immensely complex (and an excellent case study for those interested in the dynamics of academic disciplines). That topic, however, will have to wait for another occasion. Suffice it to say that if ​ Fixing Language​ (​ FL​) contributed even a little bit to this change of focus in philosophical methodology, it would have achieved one of its central goals. In that connection, it is encouraging that the papers in this symposium are in fundamental agreement about the significance and centrality of conceptual engineering to philosophy. That said, the goal of ​ FL​ was not ​ only​ to advocate for a topic, but also to defend a particular approach to it: The Austerity Framework. These replies have helped me see clearer the limitations of that view and points where my presentation was suboptimal. The responses below are in part a reconstruction of what I had in mind while writing the book and in part an effort to ameliorate. I'm grateful to the symposiasts for helping me get a better grip on these very hard issues.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This thought is central is much scepticism about philosophy as a discipline: Surely, the thought goes, if the goal is to find answers to important questions, philosophers have failed: they've been at it for more than 2000 years and they haven't managed to agree on anything! This paper is an extended response to that line of thought and also an exploration of the sources of persistent disagreement in philosophy. 1 I argue for three central theses: 1. We have no evidence that there is more persistent disagreement in philosophy than in relevantly similar disciplines.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Language Turned on Itself: The Semantics and Pragmatics of Metalinguistic Discourseby Ernie Lepore and herman cappelenSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Context and CommunicationContext and Communication offers an introduction to a central theme in the study of language: the... more Context and Communication offers an introduction to a central theme in the study of language: the various ways in which what we say (or ask, or think) depends on the context of speech and thought. The period since 1970 has produced a vast literature on this topic, both by philosophers and by linguists. It is one of the areas of philosophy (and linguistics) where most progress has been made over the last few decades. This book explores some of the central data, questions, concepts, and theories of context sensitivity. It is written to be accessible to someone with no prior knowledge of the material or, indeed, any prior knowledge of philosophy, and is ideal for use as part of a philosophy of language course by students of philosophy or linguistics.Context and Communication is the first in the series Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy of Language. Each book in the series provides an introduction to an important topic in philosophy of language. Three more volumes are in preparation, on reference, the metaphysics of meaning, and conceptual analysis and philosophical methodology. These textbooks can be used as a module in a philosophy of language course, for either undergraduate or graduate students.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The other series started with their 1997 paper 'Varieties of Quotation'. The central theme throughout is that only when communicative content is liberated from semantic content will we make progress in understanding language, communication, contexts, and their interconnection. These are the papers in which Cappelen and Lepore introduced speech act pluralism and semantic minimalism, and they provide the foundation for one of the most powerful attacks on contextualism in contemporary philosophy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
