Key findings
This edition of the ‘Size & Health of the UK Space Industry’ examines the 2020/21 financial year – a period when the country was enduring the global COVID-19 pandemic – and finds a remarkably robust industry, resiliently weathering disrupted operations to return growth in income, employment and Gross Value Added (GVA).
Furthermore, the growth in the industrial population, continuing high levels of private investment, strong exports, commercial focus and the expanded scope of the UK space industry, particularly in high-growth and emerging markets (such as space surveillance & tracking, space travel and habitation, in-orbit servicing, debris removal) is encouraging for future growth – supported by the positive 3-year outlook of survey respondents.
The findings are estimates based on research and analysis of 1,590 UK-based organisations with space-related activities. The research comprised an industrial survey (achieving a record 303 survey responses), supplemented by secondary research of more than 1,000 organisations (sources: Companies House records, statutory financial accounts, annual reports, company websites, and know.space proprietary databases).
State of the industry
All growth rates are real (inflation-adjusted) growth rates since 2019/20.
Total UK space industry income grew +5.1% in real terms to £17.5 billion in 2020/21 – the second fastest annual growth in the last seven years.
The UK space industry growth (+5.1%) outpaced the growth of the global space industry (+1.6%)[2], whilst the wider UK economy declined by -7.6%.[3]
The industry numbers 1,590 organisations, with 29 new incorporations since last year[4].
Segments that experienced growth were: Space Applications (+7%, +£843m, driving most of the growth); Ancillary Services (+13%, +£72m) and Space Operations (+4%, +£63m). One segment experienced decline: Space Manufacturing (-6%, -£134m).
The activities that saw the most significant growth were:
    
By growth value: Direct-to-Home (DTH) broadcasting (+8%, +£592m); Supply of user devices and equipment (+31%, +£405m); Proprietary satellite operations (inc. sale/lease) (+30%, +£275m); and Mobile satellite communication services (+10%, +£128m).
By growth rate: Third-party ground segment operations (+149%, +£59m); Space Surveillance & Tracking (SST) (+135%, +£29m); Legal and financial services (+106%, +£13m); Policymaking, regulation and oversight (+99%, +£37m); Launch and satellite insurance (inc. brokerage) services (+47%, £46m); and In-Orbit Servicing (+33%, +£0.3m).
The activities that had notable declines were: Ground station networks (-58%, -£293m); Location-based signal service providers (-61%, -£210m); Launch services (-53%, -£5.1m); and Launch brokerage services (-77%, -£1.3m).
Importance of the industry
Direct employment grew to an estimated 48,800 jobs in 2020/21 (from 47,000 in 2019/20), equivalent to 0.15% of the total UK workforce, supporting a total of over 126,800 jobs across the supply chain.
The industry directly contributed £7.0 billion of GVA to UK economic output in 2020/21 (0.34% of UK GDP)[5], up +1.7% since 2019/20, and a total GVA effect of £18.3 billion (including supply chain effects).
Labour productivity (GVA per employee) for the UK space industry was £144,000 in 2020/21 (down from £149,000 in 2019/20), but still 2.5 times the UK average labour productivity (£56,614).
The UK space industry workforce is particularly highly-skilled, with over 3 in 4 (77%) employees holding at least a primary degree – higher than any sector in the ONS Census.[6]
Exports remained unchanged in real terms at £5.9 billion in 2020/21, accounting for 34% of total income – up from 32% in 2019/20 and above the UK average (30%). The space export intensity increases to 57% if Direct-To-Home (DTH) satellite broadcasting is excluded.
The most important export market for the UK space industry is the Rest of Europe, representing 55% of total exports and 19% of total income (up from 48% and 15% in 2019/20, respectively).
With Research & Development (R&D) investment of £788 million (down 6% since 2019/20, equivalent to 11% of GVA), the space industry is more than 5 times more R&D intensive than the UK average.
The UK space industry has a strong commercial focus – 80% of income is commercial, comprised of sales to consumers (including DTH broadcasting) at 50% and sales to other businesses at 30%. That said, there is a strong role for public demand (20%), comprised of: Defence (10.2%), Civil Government (5.4%), European Space Agency (ESA, 2.3%), Space Agencies (2.0%), and European Commission (0.4%).
Remaining the largest single activity, the share of income accounted for by DTH broadcasting grew to 46% in 2020/21 (from 45% in 2019/20) but is expected to resume its longer-term decline as fibre broadband replaces satellites for signal distribution in the UK.
The industry is concentrated and dominated by a few large organisations, with just 14 organisations accounting for 81% of total space income, 148 for the next 13% and 1,428 for the remaining 6%. Only 162 organisations generate space income of more than £5m.
All UK regions/nations are home to headquarters of space organisations, though industrial sites (and employment) are concentrated in London, the South East, South West & East of England, and Scotland.
Services from satellites (be they UK or non-UK, and public or commercial, satellites) support wider industrial activities in the UK non-financial business economy that contribute at least £370 billion to UK GDP (17.7%), broken down by type as follows (not mutually exclusive):
    
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) services support £320 billion of GDP (15.3%).
Meteorological satellite services support £212 billion of GDP (10.2%).
Communications satellite services support £112 billion of GDP (5.4%).
Earth Observation satellite services support £106 billion of GDP (5.1%).
Outlook for the industry
Nearly half of survey respondents experienced a negative impact of COVID-19 on their workforce and income (46% each), suppliers (45%) and demand (44%). Investments were less affected (only 29% reporting negative impact), and some respondents even reported positive impacts: notably for demand (15%), income (12%) and workforce (10%).
The ongoing cost-of-living crisis has a negative impact across the board for survey respondents notably on organisations’ own operations (79%), employees (76%), suppliers (65%), customers (62%), and investment (40%).
According to survey responses on future outlook (next 3 years), economic uncertainty was the most prevalent obstacle to commercial success (51%), followed by limitations on EU programme involvement (49%) and recruiting staff (46%).
That said, survey respondents indicated optimism with respect to near-term growth: 3 in 5 expect income to be higher in the coming three years (63%, of which 39% expect much higher). Over half (58%) expect to employ more staff, and around 1 in 2 expect higher investment (50%), increased R&D expenditure (47%). 3 in 10 expected increased exports (32%) and only 10% anticipated a drop.
UK-headquartered space companies attracted investment of £635m in total over 34 identified investment deals, with acquisitions accounting for the majority of the total investment value (75%, 15% of deals) but Venture Capital representing most of the investment volume (56%, 23% of value).
7 in 10 respondents cited support and engagement with the UK Space Agency as a key enabler for commercial success (though this may reflect bias in the sample of respondents), followed by increased spend across UK national space programme (70%) and UK funding via ESA programmes (64%).
Some survey respondents reported contributing to at least one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, most notably Climate Action (58%), Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure (56%) and Sustainable Cities & Communities (42%), aligning with wider Government agenda (e.g. Net Zero, Science & Technology Superpower and Levelling Up the UK).
Summary
Introduction
The UK Space Agency aims to catalyse investment to maximise the space sector’s long-term growth, deliver missions and capabilities to meet national needs and help enhance our understanding of the Universe, and champion space.[7] To guide its work, the UK Space Agency needs a means to monitor the health of the industry and to track the effectiveness of its activities and strategy.
Undertaken since 2010, the Size & Health of the UK Space Industry is a long-running study series that quantifies and tracks changes in the UK space industry. It measures if the industry is growing, and highlights the nature and source of the growth, including trends within sub-sectors, sources of income, and future expectations. It is the principal source of information on the UK space industry, and a key resource for the Government’s evidence-based strategy, policy design and decision-making – but also for the wider industry (e.g. strategy, business cases, investor decks, scientific impact).
The UK Space Agency commissioned know.space – the specialist space economics consultancy – to conduct the latest edition. In collaboration with the UK Space Agency, improvements were made to study design (expanded analytical scope, enhanced trend analysis, innovative data collection, and record survey participation) whilst maintaining comparability with previous editions.
This edition of the ‘Size & Health’ covers a particularly challenging time. The period of analysis (2020/21) was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic (with the first government lockdown starting in late-March 2020 and varying degrees of movement restrictions until mid-July 2021), and survey research was undertaken during the ongoing cost-of-living crisis (energy, inflation).
This study offers valuable findings, highlighting the resiliency of the industry in the face of successive lockdowns and disrupted operations, as well as offering an insight into survey respondents’ outlook for the next 3 years. This 2022 report summarises the findings for the 2020/21 financial year (FY).
Given the tumultuous economic circumstances since 2020, the 2021/22 in-year estimate has been conservatively forecasted using a combination of published accounts (where already filed), survey responses (factoring in respondents’ confidence in their estimate) and a three-year historical average.
Scope
The ‘space industry’ is defined to include all organisations that are engaged in any space-related activity, comprising both:
Non-commercial organisations (e.g. universities, research institutes) that secure income to contribute space-specific research and expertise throughout the industry supply chain, often in partnership with commercial organisations. Non-commercial income includes grant funding, core funding, research funding, tuition fees, departmental expenditures, and operating budgets.
Commercial organisations (i.e. businesses, companies, firms) that earn revenue from the manufacture, launch and operation of satellites/spacecraft, and from utilisation of the signals and data supplied by satellites/spacecraft to develop value-added applications. Such organisations may also secure non-commercial income (e.g. grants) to undertake specific R&D.
The term ‘income’ covers both commercial revenues and non-commercial funding.
‘Space-related activity’ is defined to include any of the following:[8]
Space Manufacturing: Design and/or manufacture of space equipment and subsystems. Including: launch vehicles and subsystems, satellites/payloads/spacecraft and subsystems, scientific instruments, ground segment systems and equipment (control centres and telemetry), suppliers of materials and components, scientific and engineering support, fundamental and applied research.
Space Operations: Launch and/or operation of satellites and/or spacecraft. Including: launch services, launch brokerage services, proprietary satellite operation (inc. sale/lease of capacity), third-party ground segment operation, ground station networks, in-orbit servicing, debris removal, Space Surveillance & Tracking (SST), space tourism, in-space manufacturing.
Space Applications: Applications of satellite signals and data[9]. Including: Direct-To-Home (DTH) broadcasting, fixed and mobile satellite communications services (including Very-Small-Aperture Terminals (VSATs)), location-based signal and connectivity service providers, supply of user devices and equipment, processors of satellite data, applications leveraging satellite signals (e.g. GPS devices and location based services) and/or data (e.g. meteorology, geographic information system (GIS) software and geospatial products), other (e.g. Quantum Key Distribution).
Ancillary Services: Specialised support services. Including: launch and satellite insurance (inc. brokerage) services, financial and legal services, software and IT services, market research and consultancy services, business incubation and development, policymaking, regulation and oversight.
The outputs of the UK space industry are used to considerable benefit by a large and increasingly wide range of public, commercial and consumer users[10]. Commercial users are defined as businesses in an industrial sector other than space that utilise satellite applications operationally to improve delivery of their core proposition. The value of commercial use is captured in the value of UK GDP supported by satellite services (p.42).
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards
The OECD works to agree and promote international standards for measuring the space industry. In support of this and to facilitate international comparison, this edition breaks down UK space income by the OECD’s defined space sectors (called Capabilities in previous Size & Health editions).[11]
OECD also recommends a standard list space segments and the activities within them. The Size & Health already employs a more granular delineation of space segments and activity than the OECD recommended standards. [12] Thus, findings are not additionally grouped by OECD-defined segments or activities.[13]
Methodological approach
This edition maintains methodological consistency with previous editions to ensure comparability with time series to identify patterns of growth and emerging trends.
The research was undertaken employing a combination of primary research (303 responses to an online survey[14], including 187 complete responses[15] – a record number of responses from the industry) and secondary research (desk-based research of more than 1,000 organisations) to deliver comprehensive coverage of the UK space industry. Sources used for the secondary research include: Companies House records and statutory financial reports; Subscription-based databases and information sources; know.space proprietary knowledge and databases[16]; and Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Business Survey (ABS) and supporting economy-wide data from the ONS and the Bank of England.
For many metrics (e.g. income and employment, breakdown by segment and capabilities) the total industry estimates are produced by combining survey response data with secondary data (to validate and supplement response data, and to provide data for non-respondents). Unless otherwise stated, this is the approach taken. For other metrics where secondary data is not available (e.g. Research & Development (R&D) spending, input costs, gender split, etc.), survey responses alone are used.
The survey was voluntary and despite best efforts to maximise coverage and participation, the achieved sample of respondents may not be representative of the industry as a whole – indicators of coverage and profile of the survey respondents are provided below. This approach was taken given the infeasibility of undertaking an industry census or using a quota sampling approach.
In this edition, 303 (19%) of a total 1,590 organisations responded to the survey, accounting for 19% of total industry income.[17] The distribution of organisation size of the achieved survey sample is broadly reflective of the industry population.
Throughout the report we indicate the source and derivation of the numbers, and where the source is exclusively the survey, we note how representative the survey response is.[18] For this 2022 edition:
The segmentation of the studies since 2016 was maintained, with ‘Capabilities’ of the UK space industry updated to match the OECD’s terminology to facilitate international comparison;
Expanded identification of UK space-related organisations was undertaken, based on updated UK space-relevant conference lists. The findings presented in this report are based on 1,590 UK-based space organisations[19]; and
Micro-level secondary research of over 1,000 organisations using a wide range of secondary data sources to determine UK and space relevance was conducted.
Additionally, a number of changes were implemented:
Novel metrics were introduced (e.g. UK contribution to climate variables, scientific contribution);
Some of the metrics dropped in the 2021 (e.g. wider UK GDP supported) and 2020 (‘light touch’) editions were re-introduced;
Additional analyses of both the composition of the industry and the decomposition of industry growth were added; and
An analysis about the impact of COVID-19 and cost-of-living crisis (energy, inflation) on the UK space industry was included.
Caveats and limitations
Though the research has been conducted by independent analysts with specialist knowledge of the space industry, using best practice and best judgement to calculate robust and fair estimates, the following limitations apply:
Measurement error and uncertainty of estimation: The analysis employs estimation and approximation techniques based on survey and secondary data sources. The true coverage of the analysis and the measurement and estimation errors are unknown, but are believed to be similar to previous years, giving confidence in the historical comparability of the estimates[20].
Unidentified omissions: It is probable that some UK-based organisations with space-related activities have been missed, but any omissions are expected to be small and have a negligible impact on estimates[21].
Sample bias: Every identified organisation in the UK with space-related activities was invited to participate in the survey. The achieved sample reflects the willingness of individual organisations in the invited population to respond, rather than a random sampling process, so is likely to reflect some participation bias (e.g. those with stronger opinions may be more likely to respond). A number of checks have been undertaken to assess representativeness of the sample, and desk-based research was used where possible to validate and fill gaps in survey responses. Response rates and indicators of representativeness are noted where relevant throughout this report.
Scope: This study is intended to calculate key metrics of the UK space industry and identify trends relative to past editions, rather than to investigate the mechanisms or events driving behind observed changes. Explanation of changes is provided where supported by evidence, but we have sought to avoid speculation and, therefore, for certain metrics explanation of changes is left to further research.
Financial years: Each organisation may choose the start and end dates of its financial year, so these vary across organisations. Our estimates of space-related income and employment therefore reflect the different dates organisations choose to report for.
Exchange rate fluctuations: The reference currency for this analysis is GBP, and any input (e.g. company accounts stated in EUR) or comparator values (e.g. international statistics) must be converted to GBP using the prevailing exchange rate (Bank of England, Year Average 2021).
Note: Unless otherwise noted: all figures are in 2020/21 prices, all growth rates are real (inflation-adjusted) and are calculated as compound annual growth rates (CAGR).
Size of the UK space industry
Population
The industrial population (i.e. all UK-based organisations confirmed in our research to have space-related activities in the period of analysis) is 1,590 organisations.
Income
Total UK space industry income grew to £17.5 billion in 2020/21 (up from £16.6 billion in 2019/20, inflation adjusted).[22]
By far the largest segment is Space Applications with 75% of total income. Space Applications is dominated by DTH broadcasting, and DTH broadcasting’s share of total industry income stayed largely the same at 46% (up from 45% in 2019/20, regaining its 2018/19 level of 46%), after gradually falling since 2010/11. Without DTH broadcasting, the overall space industry income would be £9.4 billion, but with Other (non-DTH broadcasting) applications worth £5.0 billion, Space Applications would remain the largest segment of UK space activity. Space Manufacturing (12.3%) is the second largest segment, followed by Space Operations (9.1%), and Ancillary Services (3.5%).

Another way to break down UK space industry income is by capability (equivalent to OECD ‘sectors’). This breakdown shows which high-level space capabilities UK organisations support with their space activity. Analysis of UK space industry income by capability / OECD sector highlights a strong focus on Broadcasting. Organisations with capabilities in wider Satellite Communication (excluding Broadcasting), Defence/Military and Positioning, Navigation, Timing (PNT) (including GNSS) also account for large shares of income.

Note: OECD does not define defence/military as a distinct sector but suggests the tracking of different types of procurers of space products and services including defence organisations. Previous editions of the study have included defence/military as a separate capability, and we retain this to show the distinction between civil and military sectors.
Analysis by customer type reveals the strong commercial focus of the UK space industry – 80% of total income is commercial, comprised of sales to consumers (including DTH broadcasting) at 50% and sales to other businesses at 30%. That said, there is a strong role for public demand (20%): Defence (10.2%), Civil Government including Research/Science (5.4%), European Space Agency (ESA, 2.3%), UK and Other Space Agencies (2.0%), and European Commission (0.4%).

Exports
In terms of exports[25], the UK space industry generated almost 34% (£5.9 billion) of income from abroad (up from 32% in 2019/20)[26]. At 34%, the UK space industry’s export share is higher than the export share of the UK economy as a whole (30%).[27] The picture improves further if DTH broadcasting – which has a strong domestic market focus – is filtered out. Indeed, the export share of the UK space industry excluding DTH broadcasting stands at 57% in 2020/21.
The most important export market for the UK space industry is the Rest of Europe[28], representing 55% of total exports and 19% of total income (up from 48% and 15% in 2019/20, respectively). The second and third most important markets are North America and Asia & Oceania (19% and 12% of total exports and 6% and 4% of total income, respectively).

Gross Value Added (GVA)
In 2020/21, the UK space industry is estimated to have directly contributed £7.0 billion (up from £6.9 billion in 2019/20, inflation-adjusted) of Gross Value Added (GVA)[30] to UK economic output, equivalent to 40% of space industry income (41% in 2019/20) and 0.34% of total UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (0.31% in 2019/20).[31]
The majority of UK space GVA is generated in the Space Applications segment (73%). This is less than the segment’s contribution to industry income (75%). As with income, this segment is led by Direct-To-Home broadcasting (contributing 41%). When further comparing each segments’ contribution to industry GVA relative to their contribution to industry income, we see that Space Manufacturing accounts for a higher share of GVA (16%) than income (12%). Space Operations accounts for a smaller share of GVA (7%) than income (9%). Ancillary Services contributes almost the same to both space industry GVA and income (both 4%).

Employment
Total employment (headcount) in the UK space industry was almost 48,800 in 2020/21 (47,000 employees in 2019/20) – equivalent to 0.15% of the total UK workforce.[32]
Space Applications also dominated employment, accounting for 67% of the industry’s total, of which DTH broadcasting is 45% of the total. Space Manufacturing employs a greater number of staff than Space Operations (19% and 7%, respectively), with Ancillary Services making up a small but important workforce (7%).

Productivity and Skills
The labour productivity (GVA per employee) for the UK space industry in 2020/21 is estimated at £144,000 (down from £149,000 in 2019/20, reflecting relative movements in GVA and employment) – 2.5 times the UK’s average labour productivity in 2020 (£56,614), suggesting the space industry continues to outperform the wider economy in terms of productivity. [33]
ONS data can be used to compare the labour productivity of the UK space industry to that of other industries. The UK space industry’s high relative labour productivity signals that UK space workers are some of the most productive in the UK. Space industry labour productivity is higher than that of the ‘Information & Communication’ and ‘Manufacturing’ industries, and similar to that of the ‘Financial & Insurance’ industry.

This high level of labour productivity reflects the particularly skilled workforce of the UK space industry. Using survey data, we estimate that most employees have undertaken university education, with over 3 in 4 employees (77%) possessing at least a bachelor’s degree. In terms of the ‘share of employees holding a higher degree, first degree or HNC/HND and equivalent qualifications’, the average estimated qualification level of space industry employees is higher than any sector covered by ONS labour force data.[35] This applies for the whole space industry and all four of the value chain segments. However, further research would be needed to test how representative our sample is of the wider industry population.
Research and Development (R&D)
An estimated £788m was spent on space-related R&D (equivalent to 4.5% of total industry income) in 2020/21 – a decrease of 6% since 2019/20 (which had seen an increase of 17% from 2018/19). This R&D investment was funded almost equally from internal (49%) and external[36] (51%) sources. Investment in R&D can have a long and broad economic effect if it generates new knowledge, technologies, capabilities and derived products and services. This is particularly true in the space industry whereby capabilities developed in the R&D-intensive manufacturing and operations segments are commercialised in the applications segment and by commercial users.
With the equivalent of 11% of direct industry GVA invested in R&D, the UK space industry’s R&D as share of GVA is more than 5 times the UK business average.[37] About 1.8% of the total UK R&D spending by businesses is space-related.[38]

Industry composition
The UK space industry covers the full spectrum of organisation size (in terms of space-related income and not total organisation income), from start-ups with low space-related income to multinational conglomerates turning over tens of millions in space-related income. However, the space industry is concentrated and dominated by a few large organisations, with just 14 organisations accounting for 81% of total space-related income, 148 for the next 13% and 1,428 for the remaining 6% – a similar pattern to 2019/20. Only 162 organisations generate space income in excess of £5m.

International comparison
It is important to contextualise the UK’s activities in space by examining what other countries are doing. Though this is a challenging task due to the limited availability of consistent global data and differing definitions of the ‘space industry’, we can explore UK performance in different areas, such as government spending for space, the provision of climate monitoring data sources, and science outputs.
The UK government spends 0.05% of its GDP on space, which is 5 times lower than the United States (US, 0.24%), 4 times lower than Russia (0.20%) and almost 3 times lower than France (0.13%). It is, however, similar to Italy (0.07%), Germany, Belgium, and China (all 0.06%), and higher than Spain (0.03%) and Canada (0.02%). For the biggest European spenders, the largest expenditure is subscription to ESA programmes, which distributes the funding to the space industry through the geographical return mechanism).[39]

However, it should also be caveated by the fact that different countries have different definitions of space (notably around the extent of the inclusion of defence activities).
Currently, several other countries conduct some form of reporting on the size and growth of their space industries, but true international comparisons are not yet feasible: a lack of standardisation in definitions in scope can lead to misleading comparisons of ‘total’ industry sizes. Some countries only measure their upstream manufacturing base (normally because they survey both their aerospace and space industries together, like France and Japan), or they may include space-adjacent employment, like the US.

The Size & Health defines the space industry as comprising of organisations involved in activity in one of the four segments: space manufacturing, space operations, space applications, and ancillary services.[42] The Size & Health is therefore an attempt to measure the full range of national space activities – and not only the upstream segment, but across the whole value chain. Though recommended in the OECD guidance,[43] the UK’s comprehensive definition of the value chain for measurement is still relatively unique internationally: currently, the Canadian ‘State of the Canadian Space Sector’ is the most similar study (and therefore most comparable to the UK findings) as it also encompasses upstream, downstream and ancillary services activities.
Nonetheless, it is possible to look at other international industry reports to get a sense of scale of international space industries. Above, we show a sample of countries that survey (at least part of) their space industry. The US reports its space economy to generate $200bn a year, roughly 10 times the UK’s total income, while employing over 7 times as many people (354,000). France and Italy each employ at least 32,000 and 64,000 (upstream only) respectively. France reported €10.8bn in upstream revenue in 2020, while Italy reported €13bn in total revenue in 2021. For reference, the UK space industry generated £17.5bn in income and employed almost 48,800 employees in the headline year (2020/21) across upstream, downstream, and ancillary services activities.
Health of the UK space industry
Population growth
The industrial population included in the Size & Health has grown on average 21% every year since the 2012 edition of this study. This year, it grew to 1,590 organisations with confirmed space-related activities.
The total population change year-on-year is 297 organisations, which includes 29 new incorporations, 309 newly captured organisations, and 41 exits.

The 29 new incorporations in 2021 and 2022 continues a steady trend of new incorporations, with 47 new space incorporations per year on average between 2000 and 2020.[44]
The 309 newly captured organisations include traditionally non-space organisations incorporated before 2021 that have commenced space activities, and organisations that were not identified in previous editions (often because of a lack of public presence or small size). Though numerous, their collective impact on income is small (£208m).
Due to the complexity of establishing which of the 309 newly captured organisations are ‘truly’ new entrants to the industry and which were active but missed in previous years, we draw a distinction between organic growth – the growth of previously captured organisations and new incorporations – and growth accounted for by new captures.[45]

Three quarters of the industry’s income growth year-over-year (y-o-y) is accounted for by previously included organisations (72%) and new incorporations (3%), and can thus be considered organic growth. A quarter of income growth (25%) is accounted for by new captures, which includes ‘truly’ new space income from new entrants to the industry but also previously unidentified income. All growth calculations elsewhere in the report refer to the total growth. This breakdown of growth demonstrates the dynamism of the industry – with new entrants such as start-ups, spin-outs, and (traditionally) non-space organisations all offsetting the industry’s attrition.
Income growth
UK space industry income grew 5.1% in real terms between 2019/20 and 2020/21, the second highest annual growth rate since 2013/14. This rate is higher than recent years (2.2% annually between 2015/16 and 2019/20) and towards the average long-term growth trend of 6.4% growth annually since the turn of the millennium. The real growth rate (2019/20 – 2020/21) falls to 2.8% if DTH broadcasting growth is excluded.
The UK space industry growth outpaced the growth of the global space industry in the same period (1.6%[46]) as well as the general UK economy, which contracted by -7.6% from 2019/20 to 2020/21.[47] This is not the first time the UK space industry has outperformed the UK economy: from 2009/10 to 2019/20, the UK economy has seen an average annual real growth of 1.7%, compared to the UK space industry’s annual real growth of 4.8% in the same period (3.5 times faster than the economy as a whole).
Given the tumultuous economic circumstances of the 2020/21-2021/22 period, the 2021/22 numbers have been conservatively forecasted using a combination of account (where already filed with Companies House), survey responses (factoring in the respondent’s confidence in their forecast), and a three-year historical average.
Survey respondents highlighted many factors that influenced the increase in income since 2019/20. The development of launch activities (e.g. vehicles, launches, insurance, spaceports) was cited by a number of surveyed organisations[48]. Other respondents also explained that their income increase was due to funding awards (e.g. from UK and European Union (EU) organisations, ESA, investors), products and services becoming market-ready, growing end-user markets, a growing space industry, and COVID-19 support. A few respondents reported factors that hindered income growth, such as effects of the UK’s exit from the EU and the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, it should be noted that these influencing factors reflect the opinions of some survey respondents and are thus specific to their organisations. Therefore, they may not be reflective of all UK space-related organisations and should be treated with caution.
A longer-term perspective reveals the success story of the UK space industry: industry income has more than tripled (x3.4) in real terms since the turn of the millennium (a CAGR of 6.4% since 2000/01), and increased by 68% in real terms since 2009/10.

The activities that saw the most significant growth were:
    
Third-party ground segment operations (+149%, +£59m);
Space Surveillance & Tracking (SST) (+135%, +£29m);
Legal and financial services (+106%, +£13m);

Despite having grown in the past year (8%), DTH broadcasting’s share of the total industry income (46%) remains much lower than in 2010/11 (69%), having gradually declined this past decade. DTH broadcasting nevertheless remains the largest single activity by some distance.
The one segment that experienced decline was Space Manufacturing (-6%, -£134m), possibly due to the need for in-person activities, which were challenging in 2020/21 due to government COVID-19 restrictions (e.g. lockdowns).
The activities that had notable declines were:
    
Launch brokerage services (-77%, -£1.3m);
Location-based signal service providers (-61%, -£210m);
Ground station networks (-58%, -£293m); and

The income of small and large organisations (<£5m  and the >£100m bands) grew since 2019/20. These organisations drove the increased income of the UK space industry (£428m for organisations in the <£5m band and £643m for those in the >100m band). This compensated the decreasing income of organisations in the £5m-£50m and £50m-£100m bands (-£134m and -£93m respectively).

Survey respondents highlighted various factors that influenced the increase in employment since 2019/20. A general growth in business and increased revenue from new contracts and grants were credited by some organisations for headcount increases. A few respondents reported challenges resulting from the UK’s EU exit, indicating that they faced difficulties remaining attractive and competitive to current and prospective employees, higher costs to hire talent from the EU, and a loss of income opportunities (e.g. lower exports). Respondents also noted the uncertainty and risk of losing access to Copernicus and other large EU programmes. These influencing factors reflect the opinions of survey respondents and relate to individual organisations rather than representing the wider population.[50]
Employment in the UK space industry has grown strongly (CAGR 6.0%) since 2000/01.

Focus on Direct-To-Home broadcasting
DTH broadcasting satellite services (more commonly known as ‘satellite TV’) have been, and still are, the leading source of income and employment in the UK space industry. DTH broadcasting represented 46% of total UK space income (£8.1bn) in 2020/21. This share has dropped in the past decade (from 69% in 2010/11), though the decrease has slowed since 2016/17.

DTH broadcasting employment has been growing slowly since 2014/15, plateauing since 2019/20 ( almost 22,000 employees in 2020/21). DTH broadcasting’s share of total space employment has also been gradually decreasing, and this decrease has also slowed since 2019/20 (45% in 2020/21).
The observed gradual decrease in DTH broadcasting’s dominance of UK space income and employment may be explained by the decrease in penetration of DTH broadcasting satellite TV in the UK (from 42% in 2014/15 to 35% in 2019/20)[52]. Ofcom notes fundamental shifts in viewing habits and industry structures, notably due to the rise of Over-the-Top (OTT, online content delivery) and the emergence of global video providers (e.g. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon)[53].

DTH broadcasting’s decreasing dominance in the UK space industry’s income and employment is expected to continue, notably due to OTT TV services. Sky, the leading single UK space employer (nearly 21,700 employees, 45% of total employment) and income source (£8.1bn, 47% of total income) has released Sky Glass in late 2021 (meaning effects would not have been captured in this study’s period of analysis), which removes the need for a satellite dish by providing video services over broadband connection.
Investment into the UK space industry
External investment
This analysis highlights the types, volume, magnitude, and sources of investments into the UK space industry. Research of investments[54] into UK-headquartered space companies[55] between 2012 and 2022[56] using Crunchbase found that:
More than £635m was invested in total in 2022, in 34 identified investment deals[57] (bringing cumulative investment deals since 2012 to 293).
Private investors were the source of most investment (89%, 59 investors), with non-private investors representing 11% (7 investors) of total investment.
Acquisitions accounted for the vast majority (75%) of total investment value for 2022, despite only representing 15% of total deals (5/34 deals).
Venture Capital investments represented over half (56%, 19/34) of deals, but only 23% of the £635m invested in 2022. However, when filtering out mega-deals over £100m, Venture Capital dominates total investment value.
Both the population of investors and number of investments per year have remained at a similar level over the last 10 years, albeit with some considerable fluctuations amongst the population of investors.

Obstacles to securing external investment
In an open-ended question, many surveyed organisations explained that they did not seek external investment (i.e., due to their type or development stage), though those that did emphasised numerous obstacles to attracting investment from external private investors (listed from most to least cited):
Lack of internal resources (e.g., dedicated staff, time, investment knowledge and experience, marketing material);
Insufficient Technology Readiness Level (TRL) maturity;
Unwillingness to share/lose control;
Risk-averse internal strategy and processes;
Lack of visibility;
Macro funding environment and economic outlook;
Lack of clarity/availability of public funding; and
Lack of interest from investors.
Internal investment
New this year, survey respondents were questioned on their internal investments (e.g. from reserves, owners, group, headquarters (HQ)). They reported a total of £65m internal investment for 2020/21, and expected that figure to increase to £78m in 2021/22. Importantly, these figures only represent the input of 98 survey respondents covering 11% of total industry income (21% of non-DTH broadcasting income). No attempt at extrapolation to the wider industry was made.
Regional distribution of the UK space industry
Population by region
Based on survey response data on employment by industrial site (i.e. an office or facility involved in space-related activities) supplemented by desk-based research for non-respondents (e.g. company reports and websites), it is possible to analyse the regional composition of the UK space industry workforce across the twelve ‘International Territorial Level 1’ (ITL 1)[60] regions of the UK – the nine regions of England and the three country-level regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – and the British Crown Dependencies.

Note: The total of regional sites exceeds the UK organisation total as some organisations have presence in multiple regions.
As in 2019/20, space-related activity sites are concentrated in the South of England – comprised of South East (501 sites), London (398 sites), and South West (250 sites) – East of England (187 sites) and Scotland (183 sites). Wales is home to 72 space-related organisation sites, and Northern Ireland has 40 sites. All ITL 1 regions have a count of space-related organisation sites in the double-digits, whilst there were 3 such sites in the British Crown Dependencies.
Income by region
The geography of income is defined with respect to the location of the organisation’s HQ. Though each of the 13 regions/nations is home to many headquartered organisations, the distribution of total income varies greatly across regions/nations.
London accounted for the majority (£10.5bn, 60%) of total UK space industry income in 2020/21, followed by the South East (£2.9bn, 16%), East of England (£2.2bn, 12%) and West Midlands (£0.8bn, 5%). Together, the 4 regions account for 94% of total UK space income.
Several regions/nations displayed significant income growth since 2018/19[61], notably the North East (47%), North West (41%), South West (34%), East Midlands (33%) and Scotland (30%). The West Midlands returned to a space income comparable to that of 2018/19 (£849m in 2020/21), after a large decrease in 2019/20. London continued to see steady growth (8%), while the South East’s income decreased by 2.1%.

Note: Income distribution reflects the location of the HQ rather than the distribution of value creation.
Employment by region
When examining where employees are based (i.e., organisation sites, not necessarily organisation HQ), space employment is more evenly distributed across regions/nations than income, reflecting that large UK space organisations (especially those headquartered in London and the East and South East) have locations in multiple regions/nations.
London (28%, up from 27% in 2019/20) and the South East (21%, unchanged) employ the most staff and account for half of all employees combined. Scotland and the East of England follow, with shares of 18% (unchanged) and 8% (up from 7%), respectively.

Supply chain effects
To capture the full economic impact of the UK space industry, it is necessary to consider not only its direct impact, but also indirect (secondary demand to UK suppliers) and induced impacts (derived demand from employee expenditure) across the economy[62].
This is achieved by estimating and applying a series of economic multipliers using Input-Output analysis and analytical tables published by the ONS. ONS analytical tables provide data on which sectors supply inputs to other sectors, which allows us to trace interdependencies and estimate how activity in one sector will impact on other sectors in the economy (reflected in economic multipliers). The space-related GVA share of more than 200 different sectors (5-digit SIC codes) are then used to estimate multipliers specific to the make-up of the UK space industry.
In this section, we present the Type II multipliers for GVA and employment, which measure the direct, indirect, and induced effects.
Gross Value Added (GVA)
The Type II GVA multiplier is estimated at 2.63, implying that each £1 of space industry GVA generates £1.63 worth of GVA in the supply chain and supporting sectors[63].
The total contribution of the UK space industry including indirect and induced effects is therefore estimated at £18.3 billion in 2020/21. This implies that the industry’s direct GVA of £7.0 billion generates an additional GDP contribution of £11.2 billion in the UK economy through indirect and induced impacts.
Employment
The Type II employment multiplier is estimated at 2.64, suggesting that the activity of 100 employees in the space industry supports 164 additional employees among suppliers and in other economic sectors (such as retail and services)[64]. Using this multiplier, we estimate that the total UK-based employment supported by the activities of the UK space industry in 2020/21 is over 126,800 employees. Direct employment in the space industry (approximately 48,800) thus supports over 78,000 additional UK jobs through indirect and induced effects.
Future growth potential
As part of this edition’s survey, organisations were asked to provide their views on enablers and barriers to growth, the impact of crises (COVID and cost-of-living), and their three-year outlook. Because a response to these questions was not mandatory for a response, there may be particularly prevalent sampling biases (e.g. organisations choosing not to report unfavourable outlooks). Findings are therefore not reported as indicative of the wider industry and care should be taken when extrapolating these findings. Nonetheless, survey respondents to these questions represent (on average across the questions) a significant 19% of total industry income (36% of total non-DTH broadcasting income).
Enablers of growth
119 of 169 survey respondents (70%) cited support and engagement with the UK Space Agency  as a key enabler for ongoing commercial success[65], followed by the increased spend across UK national space programme (118 respondents, 70%), UK funding via ESA programmes (109 respondents, 64%), efforts to encourage Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) uptake through education and outreach activities (75 respondents, 44%), and the National Space Strategy (71 respondents, 42%).

Impact of COVID-19
As highlighted throughout the analysis, at a macro level the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have had an impact on survey respondents’ performance, with 42 of 163 respondents (25%) reporting COVID-related challenges as obstacles to success.
When enquiring in more detail about the impact of the pandemic, the 163 respondents to this question (representing 18% of industry income) seem to have had different experiences, with a third to half of the respondents (depending on the enquired impacted category) reporting no impact. Over 2 in 5 organisations highlighted at least some negative impact for their suppliers (45%), workforce (46%), income (46%) and demand (44%). Meanwhile, investment seems less affected, with only 29% reporting any negative impact. COVID-19 even led to positive impacts in certain categories, notably for demand (15%), income (12%) and workforce (10%).
The pandemic’s varying effects on UK space organisations may reflect the nature of respondents’ activities, notably whether they were able to adapt to government restrictions and whether they were affected by supply chain issues (among many other influencing factors). It should also be noted that the start of the pandemic was nearly 3 years ago, and thus respondents’ perspectives may be biased (e.g. peak-end rule)[66].

Impact of cost-of-living crisis
The ongoing cost-of-living crisis (energy, inflation) experienced in the UK since 2021/2022 is having a notable negative impact on UK organisations in our sample. 59 of 162 survey respondents (35%) qualified it as an obstacle to success and negative impacts were reported across the board – own operations (79%), employees (76%), suppliers (65%), customers (62%), and investment (40%).
The detrimental impact is particularly pronounced for survey respondents’ own operations and employees (59% and 56% reporting a ‘significant negative impact’, respectively). Out of all 5 enquired categories, investment seems to be the least impacted by the cost-of-living crisis (41% reporting no or positive impact).
These findings should be nuanced by the fact that the cost-of-living crisis is ongoing, and thus organisations’ opinion on its impact may change in the future.

Future sentiment: 3-year outlook
From a sample of 166 survey respondents, optimism was indicated with respect to near-term growth.
3 in 5 (63%) expect income to be higher in the coming three years, of which 2 in 5 (39%) expect income to be much higher (79% and 58% respectively in 2019/20).
Over half (58%) of respondents expecting to employ more staff (74% in 2019/20).
Around half of respondents expect higher investment (50%) and increased R&D expenditure (47%) (58% and 56% respectively in 2019/20).
2 in 5 (42%) respondents foresee increased exports (53% in 2019/20).
The picture is not all positive, however, as almost 1 in 5 (16%) respondents expect income to be lower, and 14% expect reduced investments, R&D spending, and employment. Additionally, optimism seems more tempered than in 2019/20.

Wider impact of space activities
UK GDP supported by satellite services
The impact of space extends far beyond the space industry to a wide range of public, commercial and consumer users. Beyond the activities of the space industry itself, an assessment was made of which (non-space) UK industries employ satellite services in their commercial operations to derive an estimate of the proportion of UK GDP that is supported by satellite services.
The estimates are not a valuation of the economic value contributed by satellite services, and the estimates are not specific to UK-owned/operated satellites. Rather, the estimates indicate the total value of output of those industries that are supported by satellite services from UK and non-UK satellites.
Caveat: The analysis does not cover the full UK economy. Instead, it reflects the coverage of the ONS’s Annual Business Survey (ABS) and is limited to the UK Non-Financial Business Economy which accounts for approximately two thirds of the UK economy in terms of GVA. In other words, it excludes: financial and insurance, public administration and defence, public provision of education, public provision of health and all medical and dental practice activities. Furthermore, the ABS is a sample-based snapshot (cross sectional) rather than a time-series data source and changes in the sample can affect the approximated GVA results.
On the basis of the latest granular industry data (Annual Business Survey 2020, released in June 2022) it is estimated[67] that satellite services (be they from UK or non-UK, and public or commercial, satellites) support wider industrial activities across the UK (non-financial business) economy that contributed at least £370 billion to UK GDP in 2020, equivalent to 17.7% of UK GDP[68] (up from £360 billion and 16.9% when last calculated with reference to 2018). For context, it should be noted that UK GDP experienced an unprecedented fall during this period, contracting by 19.8% between April and June 2020,[69] owing to public health measures (e.g. social distancing, travel restrictions, closure of non-essential shops) undertaken to protect the country from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Delving deeper reveals the importance of satellite services, but highlights the particularly high adoption of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems, or more commonly: ‘satnav’), which enables a wide range of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) applications:[70]
GNSS satellite services support an estimated £320 billion of UK GDP (15.3%).
Meteorological satellites support an estimated £212 billion of UK GDP (10.2%).
Communications satellites support an estimated £112 billion of UK GDP (5.4%).
Earth Observation satellites support an estimated £106 billion of UK GDP (5.1%).
Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals
Many of the 178 respondents to this question survey reported contributing to at least one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Their space-related activities were perceived as notably benefiting:
Goal 13: Climate Action (104 respondents, 58%)
Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (100 respondents, 56%)

These SDGs align with national priorities such as Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener, UK as a Science and Technology Superpower Agenda and the Levelling Up the United Kingdom Agenda. [71]
While the contribution of the UK space industry to the achievement of the SDGs is out of scope for this study, it is clear that UK space-related activities are playing a role in reaching international and national sustainable development targets.

Note: Based on a non-representative, voluntary response sample consisting of 177 responses to this survey question, covering 20% of the total industry income (37% of non-DTH broadcasting income).
In line with the UK government’s Net Zero Strategy[72] (i.e. achieving net zero by 2050), organisations across the country are in the process of setting up their own initiatives to help achieve this national target and monitor their progress.
As part of this edition’s survey, organisations were asked to provide an estimation of their carbon emissions. Given this question was not mandatory, there may be sampling bias (e.g. organisations choosing not to report unfavourable emissions). Findings are therefore not reported as indicative of the wider industry and care should be taken when extrapolating emissions numbers. Nonetheless, survey respondents to this question represent a significant 20% of total industry income (37% of total non-DTH broadcasting income).
54 of 177 survey respondents (31%) reported estimating their carbon emissions in 2020/21, and 32 of those 54 shared their emissions levels in the survey.
Among the 32 respondents who shared their emissions, the median carbon emission was 31 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). The mean reported emissions, however, jumps to over 116,000 tonnes of CO2e, reflecting the wider economy trend that the largest organisations account for most emissions. The distribution of organisations based on their reported emissions is shown in the histogram below, which shows two of 32 organisations already reporting a negative carbon footprint.[73]
These figures are provided as a baseline and future annual reporting of the UK space industry’s carbon emissions will help identify growth patterns in emissions for the industry and assess how well the industry is contributing to the UK’s Net Zero emission ambition.

Climate Change monitoring
The UK currently plays, and will continue to play, an increasingly key role in providing the necessary data to monitor climate change and its effects. The country is planning to double its provision/ownership of climate monitoring data sources, reflecting the Government’s emphasis on addressing climate change, as outlined in the National Space Strategy and Net Zero Strategy. This is in addition to ESA’s data sources, which the UK contributes to through its significant participation in EO and climate programmes (£315m at the 2022 Ministerial, a 45% increase since the 2019 Ministerial).[73] As highlighted above, UK space organisations are also in the process of setting up initiatives to achieve the Government’s Net Zero target and monitor their own progress.

Contribution to scientific knowledge
The UK’s scientific community produces particularly impactful research in space-related fields. Its impact is higher than the global average for both EO & Planetary Science and Physics & Astronomy, outperforming countries like France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan (in both fields) and the US (in EO & Planetary Science)[76].
Conclusion
This 2022 edition of the ‘Size & Health of the UK Space Industry’ examined the 2020/21 financial year – a period when the country was enduring the global COVID-19 pandemic – and found a remarkably robust industry, resiliently weathering successive lockdowns and disrupted operations to return growth in income, employment and Gross Value Added (GVA). UK space industry income grew 5.1% in real terms – the second fastest annual growth in the last seven years, though there was variation in performance across activities.
Beyond contributing to the National Space Strategy’s objectives, the UK space industry is also feeding into wider Government strategies, notably achieving Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener and becoming a Science Superpower, with a majority of survey respondents contributing to the Climate and Innovation Sustainable Development Goals. It is also playing a key role in the Levelling Up the United Kingdom agenda: England’s North East, North West, South West, East Midlands and Scotland displayed the highest growth rates for space-related income; whilst North West and East England had the highest growth rates in employment.
Furthermore, the growth in the industrial population, continuing high levels of private investment, strong exports, commercial focus and the expanded scope of the UK space industry, particularly in high-growth and emerging markets (such as space surveillance & tracking, space travel and habitation, in-orbit servicing, active debris removal) is encouraging for future growth – supported by the positive 3-year outlook of survey respondents.
Glossary
Typology
Key term
Definition
Capability /     OECD sector
Capabilities are different from ‘activities’ and ‘segments’ and refer to what space capability is being support by an organisation. Capabilities include: Defence/Military; Earth Observation (excl. Meteorology); Meteorology; Positioning, Navigation, Timing (inc. GNSS); Satellite Communications (excl. broadcasting); Broadcasting; Science; Space Exploration (inc. ISS, rovers, and probes); Space Transportation (inc. launch); Space technologies (used in multiple systems, e.g. solar); Generic technologies/components that enable space capabilities (e.g. AI). OECD ‘sectors’ match what the Size & Health of the UK Space Industry study traditionally reports as ‘Capabilities’. For the sake of clarity, they are reported as ‘Capability / OECD sector’ in this report.
Segment
Supply chain segments, including Space Manufacturing, Space Operations, Space Applications and Ancillary Services. For reference, Space Manufacturing and Space Operations combined can (roughly) be considered as ‘upstream’, and Space Applications as ‘downstream’. Ancillary Services provide specialised support to all other value chain segments.
Space Applications
1 of 4 segments, refers to applications of satellite signals and data.
Space Manufacturing
1 of 4 segments, refers to the design and/or manufacture of space equipment and subsystems.
Space Operations
1 of 4 segments, refers to launch and/or operation of satellites and/or spacecraft.
Ancillary Services
1 of 4 segments, refers to specialised support services.
Space-related activity
Refers to the wide-ranging activities related to the delivery of a space product or service, across the supply chain (full list p.8).
Investment[77]
Key term
Definition
Acquisitions
An acquisition   occurs when one company purchases and gains control over another company.
Corporate round
A   corporate round occurs when a company, rather than a venture capital firm,   makes an investment in another company. These are often, though not   necessarily, done for the purpose of forming a strategic partnership.
Crowdfunding
Funding by   raising money from numerous sources. Equity   crowdfunding platforms allow individual users to invest in companies in   exchange for equity. Typically on these platforms the investors invest small   amounts of money, though syndicates are formed to allow an individual to take   a lead on evaluating an investment and pooling funding from a group of   individual investors. In a product   crowdfunding round, a company will provide its product, which is often   still in development, in exchange for capital. This kind of round is also   typically completed on a funding platform.
Debt and equity financing
In a   debt round, an investor lends money to a company, and the company promises to   repay the debt with added interest.
Grant/Prize
A grant is when   a company, investor, or government agency provides capital to a company   without taking an equity stake in the company.
Initial Public Offering (IPO)
An Initial   Public Offering is the first public sale of stock (shares) by a privately   owned company.
Private Equity
A private   equity round is led by a private equity firm or a hedge fund and is a late-stage   round. It is a less risky investment because the company is more firmly   established, and the rounds are typically upwards of $50M.
Venture capital
Venture   funding refers to an investment that comes from a venture capital firm and   describes Series A, Series B, and later rounds.
Other key terms

Definition
Compound Annual   Growth Rate (CAGR)
The mean annual growth rate over a period of time.
Constant prices
Values have   been adjusted to the price level of the stated base year (i.e. adjusted to   remove the effect of inflation) so that comparison can be made between years   to identify change in real terms.
Current prices
Values are expressed in nominal terms in the price   level of each year, and are not adjusted for inflation. Any comparison   between years will be in nominal terms and include the effect of inflation.
Direct effects
The most   immediate or ‘first round’ spending effects. This covers income generated   within the space sector and those employed directly by the sector.
Direct-to-Home   (DTH) broadcasting
The distribution of television broadcasting services   to a subscriber’s home, via satellite.
Downstream
Activities   based on space technology or making use of a space-derived systems.
Field Weighted   Citation Impact (FWCI)
Refers to the ratio of citations received to   citations expected, based on the subject field average.
Financial Year (FY)
Accounting   reference period used for financial reporting – each organisation may choose   the dates of their own financial year, so it may align to the calendar year,   the tax year, or any other dates in the year. Also known as a fiscal year or   budgetary year.     The UK   government financial year (also the tax year) commences on April 6th   and ends on April 5th the following year.
Gross Domestic   Product (GDP)
Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the   combined economic activity of all the people, businesses, and government of a   country.
Gross Value Added (GVA)
Approximated as: GVA=Income ×(1-Input share). Gross value added is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. It represents an industry’s direct contribution to GDP (Gross Domestic Product).
Headquarters   (HQ)
Location of the   UK head office of an organisation.
Indirect effects
Organisations in the supply chain of space   organisations benefit from increased sales in the space industry, as the   demand for intermediate inputs increases.
Induced effects
Different sectors benefit from additional household income and   consequent spending from those employed in the space industry and its supply   chain.
Industrial site
An office or facility involved in space-related   activities (which can be different to an organisation’s headquarters).
Input share
Percentage of   income spent on inputs, i.e. the cost of sales.
Investment
This covers capital deployed to further R&D,   capital expenditures (such as equipment), investment in people and tools to   develop intellectual property. Internal investment refers to   investments originating within an organisation (e.g. reserves, owners, group,   headquarters). External investment   refers to investment originating from a third-party to the recipient   organisation.
ITL
International   Territorial Level, refers to ONS’ new domestic classification framework,   developed after the UK’s exit from the European Union. This moves away from   the use of Eurostat’s NUTS.

[4] The 1,590 organisations with confirmed space-related activities contribute to the total estimated industry income and employment figures for at least one of the two examined years (2020/21 and 2021/2022e). The total population change year-on-year is 297 organisations, which includes 29 new incorporations, 309 newly captured organisations, and 41 exits. The 309 newly captured organisations include traditionally non-space organisations incorporated before 2021 that have commenced space activities, and organisations that were not identified in previous editions (often because of a lack of public presence or small size). Though numerous, their collective impact on income is small (£208m).

[19] The total population change year-on-year is 297 organisations, which includes 29 new incorporations, 309 newly captured organisations, and 41 exits. The 309 organisations that were newly captured this year include (traditionally) non-space organisations that have entered the industry and smaller space organisations (including startups) identified for the first time.
[20] Survey responses were sense-checked and compared to previous years data to ensure results presented are as reliable as possible. Survey data for larger organisations was also cross-referenced with online sources, notably Companies House data. Due to the methodological approach employed, it is not beneficial to provide uncertainty bands or ranged estimates. Sources for each metric are made clear and the reader is encouraged to show caution in extrapolating survey responses to the whole industry, particularly for smaller sample sizes.
[21] An extensive search was conducted to ensure broad coverage of the UK space industry, building on know.space’s existing proprietary databases. Multiple sources, including company websites, existing databases, and conference lists, were leveraged to identify UK space organisations. It is probable that some smaller organisations have been omitted, but we are confident that the larger organisations have been captured.
[22] The 2019/20 year was reported as £16.5 billion (in 2019/20 prices) in the 2021 edition, which is equivalent to £16.6 billion when adjusted for inflation to 2020/21 prices.
[23] The purpose is to highlight the higher value (by income) activities and their relative sizes, so lower value activities are not displayed to ensure legibility.
[24] Note that the UK government invests in ESA, which delivers programmes on behalf of its member states, including the UK. This enables UK participation in ESA programmes, including large-scale missions and technology development.
[25] Although export value and shares are based on many respondents, single large contracts may affect the overall results.
[26] By definition, goods and services sold to ESA are an export as the ownership of goods or intellectual property changes hands from a UK entity to an entity that is based in a foreign country and which is not majority-controlled by UK interests.

[42] Organisations that operate in multiple industries and not just the space industry have a factor applied to their total income and employment to get space-related activity. This share is often provided directly by survey respondents.

[44] New incorporations without a public presence will not have been captured yet, so this number is likely to grow in future editions as these organisations are identified. The 2021 edition of the study listed 27 incorporations for 2020, whereas this number has now grown to 38. The number of identified 2022 incorporations in this edition is 5.
[45] The growth associated with new incorporations can be included in ‘organic growth’, but for clarity we report them separately here.

[48] These were the most cited amongst answers to a freeform survey question, though are some discrepancies with estimated activity growth rates from 2019/20 to 2020/21. This may be due to the sub-sample of respondents and/or differences in time period: survey respondents answered in autumn 2022, which for many organisations was more than a year later than the end of their 2020/21 financial year and, notably, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic period.

[50] Of those reporting issues related to EU exit, no clear common characteristics could be drawn out, but respondents include both commercial and academic organisations, as well as organisations not directly receiving EU funding.
[51] GVA is a function of income and input share (see Glossary). Given income has risen over the period, this fall in GVA is the result of a rising input share.

[54] Investment types covered by Crunchbase are: Funding Round, Equity Crowdfunding, Product Crowdfunding, Angel, Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series Unknown, Convertible Note, Grant, Non-Equity Assistance, Post-IPO Equity, Debt Financing, Post-IPO Debt, IPO, and acquisition.
[55] Of the total 1,590 space organisations, approximately 1,041 appear on Crunchbase, of which 707 list a UK headquarters.
[56] Investments are dated according to year of announcement, rather than completion.
[57] Many deals have an ‘undisclosed’ deal value and so have been treated conservatively as £0. The figures (both 2022 and previous years) should be considered lower bound estimates.
[58] Note that whilst investments must be into UK-headquartered companies to be included, investors are worldwide.
[59] 2021 investment numbers are taken from the Size & Health 2021 edition, which used a different source and methodology to the 2020 and 2022 editions. As a result, caution should be exercised when making comparisons between 2021 and other years.
[60] In previous editions, Eurostat’s Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions of the UK were used. Since the UK’s exit from the EU, ONS has set out to develop a domestic classification framework separate from NUTS called International Territorial Level (ITL). As of this edition, ITLs continue to mirror NUTS classifications and thus have no impact on the backwards compatibility of the regional analysis.
[61] Methodological differences in the regional analysis limits the reliability of one-year regional growth rates, so two-year real growth rates are shown here instead.
[62] See Glossary for technical definitions.
[63] The Type I GVA multiplier is estimated at 1.69.
[64] The Type I employment multiplier is estimated at 1.81.
[65] Note that the survey was entirely voluntary and conducted on behalf of the UK Space Agency. As such, it is possible that respondents were biased towards having a more favourable opinion of the Agency.
[66] The peak-end rule is a cognitive bias that shapes how individuals remember past events. People tend to judge an experience based on how they felt during intense positive or negative moments ( ‘peaks’) and the final moments (‘end’).
