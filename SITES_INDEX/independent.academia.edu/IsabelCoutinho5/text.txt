But it is difficult to capture students’ attention to it, and the loss of students in the STEM field hinders society&#39;s development, and Portugal is no exception. The students feel that this field is difficult, they feel disappointed as the academic outcomes are more difficult to obtain in the upper secondary, and they easily give up on this area and/or choose other fields. To mesmerize students in the science area and reinforce their positive emotions a project was elaborated based on flipped classrooms with a laboratory station model and started in September 2021. A study case was designed to perceive the impact of the laboratory station methodology and flipped classrooms on the motivation of upper-secondary science students.

With the pandemic, Portuguese students that enrolled in the 10th grade in September 2021, had lower experience in the experimental work, since practical classes at school were suspended from mars 2019 to September 2021. So, students had difficulties in measuring or working with simple laboratory apparatus. They had difficulties in giving meaning to the experimental procedure, describing an observation, collecting data, analyzing data, and interpreting the results. In this context, it was necessary to have a learning and teaching approach different from the one they had in the last three years, to develop the skills they need. The first proposal was to use “Practical work by laboratory stations but it was not enough in the present context. So, a new learning and teaching project that blended digital tools/platforms and practical work in the laboratory was conceived.

In thi... more Doctoral education is the link between research and higher education, being a hybrid area. In this context, the doctoral research project must correspond to the demands of both areas. The PhD. supervisor must be a team leader and, at some time, a doctorate guide, and a teacher. The PhD students must learn how to be a part of the research team, and simultaneously develop their research skills and knowledge. But PhD continues to be an individual and solitary journey, being the justification for it, the originality of knowledge created during the PhD. In the last years, in Portugal, PhD students and PhD supervisors were auscultated. The supervisors’ rules were captured, doctorate experiences were collected, and supervision processes were analysed and deepened knowledge about doctoral education. But still, this vision is incomplete not only because few supervisors took part in the research (first because the sample population were limited to one Portuguese University (NOVA Lisbon Univer...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this research work, we start to study the pedagogy and the supervision practices that were perceived by doctoral students in a specific population Science Education PhD. First, an exploratory survey was applied to PhD students that were participating in a national meeting of Science Education for young researchers. Secondly a similar survey was applied, but in another specific context –students enrolled in Science Education PhD at Nova Lisbon University (UNL). Some similarities were found: the pedagogy perceived by students and the evidence that students’ don ́t monitor or evaluate the research process during the PhD. In addition, some differences were also verify not only in the supervision practices, but as well as in the supervisor engage in the PhD research process.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Knowledge construction occurs in a specific scientific area with rules previously defined. The PhD students must enter is this new environment - academic environment - and learn how to deal with it. In this sense, the knowledge construction includes a socialization process which implies the integration and acculturation processes. Even though, an original research will emerge, as it is developed by the student alone and new knowledge will be constructed. Peers, as others researchers in the area, will be important in times of disappointments, difficulties and stress reinforcing the students´ well-being.

It ́s a period of construction of the research and is also a time for integration in the academy, in the field of research, and at the higher education system. During the enrolment in the PhD, the person&#39;s growth and the live experience change the perception that the doctorate has of the PhD and the research journey. The experiences as a doctoral student and as a researcher under construction, who is supervised/oriented/ guided by a supervisor, shape the way of thinking and action regarding the institution and the academy but also influence the way they see and felt the PhD journey and their beliefs. It is argued in this paper that an initial (de)formed perception of the real PhD journey and supervision, may influence the satisfaction of the students with it, and the disappointment impact the option to leave the academy or to continue.
