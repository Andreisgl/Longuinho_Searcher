Having said that, I must make myself more precise: of course I don't mean that there are no substratum words in Baltic and Slavic languages. There are certainly plenty of them, although, as we will see, discovering them is a very difficult matter. What I will claim is that there is no layer of substratum words that can be posited for Proto-Balto-Slavic, and that is not shared by other branches of Indo-European, especially by Germanic, Celtic, and Italic.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSeven Slavic etymologies: *ędro, *gъrdъ, *koristь, *kosъ, *myslь, *naglъ, *němъRanko MatasovićDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Accentuation of Balto-Slavic Vrddhi FormationsRanko MatasovićDownload Free PDFView PDFWiener Slavistisches Jahrbuch, Neue Folge 1, 294-303Notes on Balto-Slavic etymology: Russian norov, mjat’, ruž’ë, dialectal xajat’ ‘to care’, xovat’ ‘to keep’ and their Slavic and Baltic cognates2013 • Tijmen PronkThe article discusses the etymologies of the Slavic etyma reflected in Russian norov ‘character, nature’, mjat’ ‘to rumple, break (flax), scutch’, ruž’ë ‘weaponry’, dialectal xajat’ ‘to care’ and xovat’ ‘to keep, hide, steal’. Baltic cognates of the first three are Old Prussian arwis ‘true, real’, Lithuanian mìnti ‘to trample, scutch’ and reñgti ‘to prepare, equip’. In each case existing etymologies are analyzed and a new etymology is proposed. All words are argued to have cognates in other branches of Indo-European. They are derived from Proto-Indo-European *h2er- ‘to fix, adjust, make proper’, *meiH- ‘to diminish’, *uerǵ- ‘to act, work’ and *keh2- ‘to love, care’ respectively.Download Free PDFView PDF'To hide' and 'to cover' in Proto-Indo-EuropeanRanko MatasovićDownload Free PDFView PDFZbornik Matice srpske za filologiju i lingvistiku LXI/2 , 7-20SCr. krd(o) ‘herd’2018 • Aljoša MilenkovićThe article deals with the history of SCr. krd(o) and its Balto-Slavic cognates. A supposed descendent of the zero-grade root *ḱr̥dh-, SCr. krdo acquired its plain velar as a result of the Proto-Indo-European depalatalization before a syllabic resonant. The other root variant reflected in Balto-Slavic, *skerdh-, which underlies Lith. sker͂džius ‘shepherd’ and sker͂dis ‘id.’, was also regularly depalatalized, as PIE *ḱ expectedly yields *k if preceded by *s. The e-grade without the s-mobile provided no conditions for the said depalatalization to occur, which points to the analogical spread of the plain velar from the other two variants. / Članak obrađuje istoriju sh. reči krd(o) i njoj srodnih baltoslovenskih oblika, sa posebnim osvrtom na poreklo inicijalnog velara.Download Free PDFView PDFPhonological evidence for a Proto-Baltic stage in the evolution of East and West BalticEugen  HillThe position of the so-called ‘Baltic’ languages Lithuanian, Latvian and Old Prussian within the Balto-Slavonic branch of Indo-European is still a matter of debate. Within Balto-Slavonic, the Slavonic sub-branch is clearly identifiable due to an exclusive set of phonological and morphological innovations not shared by ‘Baltic’. The ‘East Baltic’ languages Lithuanian and Latvian are similarly separated from both Slavonic and the ‘West Baltic’ language Old Prussian by a set of characteristic innovations. What remains to be clarified, is the exact position of Old Prussian. Traditionally, Old Prussian is either grouped with ‘East Baltic’, thus implying a common Proto-Baltic stage after the disintegration of Proto-Balto-Slavonic, or it is seen as a separate sub-branch of Balto-Slavonic. The situation is additionally complicated by several nontrivial features shared by ‘East Baltic’ and Slavonic but not found in Old Prussian. Such features point to a third possible position on the sub-branches of Balto-Slavonic, i.e. grouping East Baltic together with Slavonic which implies a particularly early separation of Old Prussian from the rest of the branch. The paper intends to foster the theoretical discussion by pointing out two nontrivial phonological developments which must be assumed for both ‘East’ and ‘West Baltic’ but not for Slavonic and therefore may constitute evidence for Proto-Baltic as a parent language of both ‘Baltic’ branches.Download Free PDFView PDFFalse exceptions to Winter’s LawGuus KroonenDownload Free PDFView PDFDelabialization after *u and the distribution of labiovelars in dialectal Proto-Indo-EuropeanRobert WoodhouseEvidence is presented in support of a typologically based hypothesis of a pre-final stage of PIE in which palatovelars were opposed to a single set of phonemes, each phoneme comprising plain velar allophones and labiovelar allophones. During this stage delabialization of the labiovelar allophones took place in the environment after *u, the output being reinterpreted as palatovelars. The stage was terminated when one of the backvelar allophones – which one depending on the dialect – spread beyond its original environment(s) and became dominant in a specific set of dialects. The hypothesis thus contributes (1) a solution to the gutturalfrage that is not limited to inadequately motivated rejections of one or other of the three series of tectal phonemes on offer in the current mainstream reconstruction of PIE occlusives; (2) a rationale for the rise of labiovelars in PIE, (3) a coherent explanation for a currently unacknowledged source of gutturalwechsel, viz. delabialization after *u in satem languages and (4) motivation for the replacement of the awkward concept of “palatalization after *u” in Armenian by a straightforward delabialization.Download Free PDFView PDFTectal neutralization after *s in PIE: a corrected restatementRobert WoodhouseStatements on the neutralization of the opposition in PIE between palatovelars and labiovelars developed by Frederik Kortlandt are tested against the evidence and found wanting. Among other findings, which support Kortlandt’s contention that PIE contained no plain velar series, are (1) there is nothing un-Indo-European about the root onset *skw- (where *kw represents a PIE labiovelar) and (2) there is no basis for believing that PIE *sKi- > Slavic sь/i-.Download Free PDFView PDFTransactions of the Philological Society Volume 113:3 (2015) 327–348Singulative n-stems in Indo-European2015 • Tijmen PronkMost Indo-European n-stem nouns are either individualizing, e.g. Avestan marətan- ‘mortal’, i.e. ‘the dead one’, or they denote body parts, e.g. Greek ōlḗn ‘elbow’. In this article, it is argued that most Indo-European n-stems denoting body parts originally had a singulative function, denoting a single instance of a body part of which the body has more than one. This analysis allows us to connect the ‘body part’ function of the Indo-European suffix *-n- to its well-established individualizing function. The following evidence in favour of a singulative suffix *-n- will be discussed: (1) the productive singulative suffix *-(e)n-i̯o- in Celtic; (2) suppletive paradigms in various Indo-European languages in which a singular is (based on) an n-stem, e.g. Armenian duṙn, pl. durk‘ ‘door, gate’, Gothic kaurno ‘single grain’, kaurn ‘corn’, Russian súdno, pl. sudá ‘vessel’; and 3) words for body parts naturally occurring in pairs or larger quantities which are attested with and without the nasal suffix, e.g. Armenian akn, Gothic augo and Old Prussian agins ‘eye’, but without a nasal Greek ósse and Old Church Slavic oči ‘eyes’.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
