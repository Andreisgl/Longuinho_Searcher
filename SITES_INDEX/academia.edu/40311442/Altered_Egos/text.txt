By necessity, these projects take place outside the orthodoxy of the ‘white cube’ in order to include the transition of daylight at the sites in which they are both made and experienced. For Neeson, this liberates representation from a debilitation imposed on it from outside the form. Neeson’s projects initially grew out of an examination of the Still Life as a marginalised genre. Over the last five years, Neeson has worked to arrange and document Still Life in the streets and lanes of inner Melbourne using window ledges and blind niches that read as ‘Bodegóns’. In employing an attitude related to the dérive and the flâneur, he has more recently ceased practicing such interventions to simply record foundStill Life on his smartphone. Although this activity takes place outside traditional exhibition environments, Neeson nonetheless conforms to certain conventions of display and social commentary inherent to the Still Life canon—an activity which in turn addresses the role of authorship and intent within the genre. John R. Neeson is a current PhD candidate at the University of Tasmania. Previous research includes PhD, Monash, 2002, Royal College of Art, London- Samstag Scholarship Program 1996/97. Venue specific projects include Conical, WestSpace, Techno Park Studios, Melbourne, blackartprojects, Melbourne & Milan, AC Institute & Point B New York, Arthouse and GasWorks London, Ar.Co- Centro de Arte e Comunicação Visual, Lisbon (and forthcoming in 2015 at The Institut für alles mögliche, Berlin).

Katz and Conor Moynihan at the 2016 Queer Arts Festival by Pride in Art in Vancouver, BC, Drama Queer explores the role of emotion in contemporary queer art as a form of political practice. Emotion has been identified by scholars and activists as central to much queer contemporary work. This exhibition places the queer utility of emotion into a historical context. Drama Queer solicits a range of contemporary work that engages how feelings function in our political present and the different facets of art and emotion—political emotion, erotic emotion etc. This exhibition explores art that seeks to engender social change by making the viewer an accomplice, queering their perspective or seducing them into seeing the world from a dissident vantage point. Catalogue includes title essay by Jonathan D. Katz and Conor Moynihan, an introduction by SD Holman, and artist essays by Carl Pope, Joey Terrill, and Del LaGrace Volcano.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
