Critics say it has been opaque in explaining its dealings.It is reeling under an estimated $11 billion debt, which has weighed on the ringgit that tumbled to its lowest level since July 2005 on Friday, amid allegations of mismanagement and murky overseas transactions.Critics, including influential former premier Mahathir Mohamad, have called for criminal investigations, but both Najib and 1MDB have denied wrongdoing in the past, saying the company is on a solid footing.Under pressure, Najib earlier this year ordered his auditor-general to examine 1MDB’s books. Its report has not yet been released.TopicsMalaysiaAsia Pacific1MDBnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
