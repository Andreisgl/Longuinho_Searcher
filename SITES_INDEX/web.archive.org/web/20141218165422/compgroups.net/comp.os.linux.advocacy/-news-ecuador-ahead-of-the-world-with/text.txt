 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. 
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.
Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)
  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.
This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

Democratization of Knowledge, P2P alternatives and more in Ecuador
,----[ Quote ]
| I asked Marco Fioretti of the Italian Digifreedom to report on the congress 
| on free software and education that we both attended as speakers in Quito, 
| Ecuador, and which was organized and hosted by the Salesian teaching order, 
| who preferentially work with the children of the poor.

Ecuador: A Weekend of Free Software Throughout the Country
,----[ Quote ]
| In Ecuador, this event gathered a lot of attention, especially since the 
| President of the Republic, Rafael Correa, by means of decree No. 1014 of 
| April 10, 2008, ruled that the computers in the public administration should 
| utilize free software. This decree fulfills a promise made in a speech in 
| 2007 that would migrate all of the country's computers to these free systems.

South America warms to Open Source
,----[ Quote ]
| In South American countries, as in most other areas of the world, the 
| government is by far the biggest purchaser of software. Thus the Open Source 
| trend that is now established in the government sector across the continent 
| will doubtless spur Open Source adoption in the private sector.   
| 
| There are a variety of motives for Open Source adoption in play in there, 
| from the reduction in software costs to the desire to provide a "leg-up" to 
| the local software industry. However, the motivation of the Peruvian 
| government is unique in that the Peruvian supporters of the bill see "Open 
| Source" as a citizen's right. The ownership and responsibility for the use of 
| data and software have become a political issue in Peru.     
| 
| This is an idea that is unlikely to go away.

South American Software Development
,----[ Quote ]
| Who ultimately forced Sun to open-source Java? Was it external pressure, 
| either from Java developers or the open-source community? Or was it internal, 
| perhaps a mandate from CEO Jonathan Schwartz?  
| 
| Answer: None of the above. According to Jonathan himself, it was Brazil.

Success for free software in Latin America!

| And today was the day that the president elect pronounced himself in

| 
| Ecuador is a small country, with a population hovering around 13
| million inhabitants. About 80% of the population is poor. A good
| half of the entire population barely has resources to eat.

| 
| Evidently, monopoly rents (licenses) in proprietary software are
| simply incompatible with our economy. If we want to take advantage
| of computers, our only options are the GNU and Linux systems ands
| oftware out there. Otherwise, we'll be attempting to out-compete
| the competition, using their ground rules. Ha!

Ecuador migrates to Free Software and Open Standards
,----[ Quote ]
| On April 10, 2008, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa Delgado signed a decree 
| ordering that the software used by public administrations in the country be 
| free software (and implicitly based on open standards). Fuller story in

Venezuela Launches Sale of "Bolivarian" Computers

| While the open-source aspect of this is noteworthy, and the goal of this is 
| to "...make faster progress toward interoperability," CCHIT's fatal flaw is 
| that it still returns to the knee-jerk response of preserving the proprietary 
| EHR business model status quo at all costs.
