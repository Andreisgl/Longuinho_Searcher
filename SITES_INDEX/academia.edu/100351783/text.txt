The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of selectively collected MSW and biochar as components of the coir-based substrate to spinach grown. An experiment was carried out to evaluate five substrates, coir and four coir-based blends (coir + biochar + perlite, coir + municipal waste compost + perlite, coir + biochar + pine bark, and coir + biochar + pine bark) with 12% (v/v) MSW or biochar and 10% (v/v) perlite or pine bark. Spinach seedlings were transplanted into Styrofoam planting boxes filled with the substrate. Each planting box was irrigated daily by drip with a complete nutrient solution. Plants grown with MSW had a higher content of calcium. Shoot Mn increased in the biochar-containing mixes. The shoot dry weight of the plants grown in the different blends was higher than ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHorticulturaeCoir-Based Growing Media with Municipal Compost and Biochar and Their Impacts on Growth and Some Quality Parameters in Lettuce SeedlingsRui  MachadoThe purpose of this study was to develop substrates with little or no peat by combining coir-based growing media with municipal compost and/or acacia biochar, two locally produced renewable resources, and to assess their effects on lettuce seedling emergence and growth, as well as their content in photosynthetic pigments and total phenols. Two experiments were carried out, the first with six mixes using compost and biochar blended with perlite, pine bark, and blonde peat to adjust some physicochemical characteristics. The mixes of coir: compost: pine bark: blonde peat (73:12:5:10, v/v) and coir: compost: biochar: blonde peat (73:12:10:5, v/v) had physicochemical characteristics closer to or within the normal range of the substrates. The presence of 12% compost and 10% biochar in the mixtures had no adverse effect on lettuce seed germination and cumulative seed emergence, which ranged from 90 to 99%. The seedling growth in those mixes was vigorous and higher than in other mixtures.

The study aimed at assessing the nutrient uptake and growth of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) grown in soils amended with cow manure after a co-composting process. Methods Sandy loam and silt loam soils were amended with cow manure after co-composting with poplar leaf litter at 1:0, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. The compost was applied to soil at the rate of 20 t ha-1. Spinach was grown for 8 weeks and then harvested to measure plant shoot bio-mass. Spinach shoot samples were digested and nutrient contents in the shoots were determined. Results Co-composted manure significantly improved the growth and nutrients availability to the spinach. Dry bio-mass, P and K contents in spinach shoot varied among manure: leaf litter ratios: 1:0 \ 1:1 \ 1:2 \ 1:3. Conversely , N, Zn, Fe, Cu and Cd contents in spinach shoot reduced with the manure amendment with increasing amount of leaf litter. Water extractable micro-elements in the post-harvest soils were found in the order of Zn [ Fe [ Cu [ Cd. Co-compost amendments increased the P and K availability except N, NO 3 and NH 4 in the post-harvest soils. Trace elements in the post-harvest soils reduced with leaf additives in the compost. Conclusions Co-composted cow manure with leaf litter proved to be superior in terms of bioavailability of plant nutrients over the composted manure without leaf litter. This may also assist in mitigating the environmental contamination of heavy metals in the farm lands.Download Free PDFView PDFHorticulturaeEffects of Municipal Solid Waste Compost Supplemented with Inorganic Nitrogen on Physicochemical Soil Characteristics, Plant Growth, Nitrate Content, and Antioxidant Activity in SpinachI.  Alves-PereiraIn this study, we evaluated the effects of municipal solid waste compost supplemented with inorganic N on the physicochemical properties of soil, plant growth, nitrate concentration, and antioxidant activity in spinach. Experiments were carried out in neutral and acidic soils that were low in organic matter. A fertilized soil was used as a control, while four compost treatments—two compost rates of 35 and 70 t ha−1, supplemented or not with inorganic N (92 kg N ha−1 as Ca (NO3)2)—were applied by fertigation. The addition of compost increased the soil organic matter content and pH in both soils. The compost supplementation with N greatly increased the shoot dry weight and spinach fresh yield by nearly 109%. With the highest compost rate and 43% N applied, the yield increased in both soils, similar to results obtained in fertilized soil (3.8 kg m−2). The combined application of compost and N could replace inorganic P and K fertilization to a significant extent. The compost application...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of soil science and plant nutritionAgronomic properties and characterization of rice husk and wood biochars and their effect on the growth of water spinach in a field test2013 • Eva Rivera, Odette MillaDownload Free PDFView PDFAfrican Journal of …Chemical changes of spinach waste during composting and vermicomposting2011 • Jatinder KatnoriaDownload Free PDFView PDFAfrican Journal of BiotechnologyEffects of biochar and sewage sludge on spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) yield and soil NO3- content in texturally different soils in Glen Valley, Botswana2020 • ugele  majauleDownload Free PDFView PDFAgronomyInteractive Effects of Biochar and Sewage Sludge on Bioavailability and Plant Uptake of Cu, Fe, and Zn, and Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) Yields under Wastewater Irrigationugele  majauleBiochar can influence bioavailability of micronutrients and crop yields in sewage sludge-treated soils, but the mechanisms of its effects remain poorly understood. Therefore, this field experiment was conducted on a Luvisol and Cambisol to investigate the bioavailability and uptake of some micronutrients and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) yields grown in soil amended with biochar and sewage sludge. Ten treatments arranged in randomized complete block design with three levels of biochar (0, 2.5, 5 t/ha) and sewage sludge (0, 6, 12 t/ha) and combinations thereof were applied. High rate of sole sewage sludge, and its combination with biochar significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased yield on the Luvisol. On the Cambisol, only marginal yield increase resulted from high rates of sole organic amendments and chemical fertilizer, while co-applications decreased yields. Co-amendments generally increased bioavailability of micronutrients relative to sole amendments in the order Fe &gt; Cu = Zn, w...Download Free PDFView PDFAnnals of Tropical Medicine and Public HealthBiotechnology Effect ofrice husk and chicken manure on highly acidic soils on spinach(Spinacia Oleracea L.)Saad MahmoodDownload Free PDFView PDFArabian Journal of GeosciencesEffect of poultry litter biochar on chromium (Cr) bioavailability and accumulation in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) grown in Cr-polluted soil2019 • khalid  rafiqDownload Free PDFView PDFHeliyonEffectiveness of cattle dung biogas digestate on spinach growth and nutrient uptakeOlusolao OloladeDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
