Esther  ChadwickYale University,  History of Art,  AlumnaEighteenth Century Print Culture+10I am a specialist in eighteenth-century British art, with a focus on printmaking. I studied Art History at the University of Cambridge and completed my doctorate at Yale University in 2016. Before joining the Courtauld, I worked as a curator in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum.My research addresses questions of mediation, transmission and translation of visual information, the materiality of printed images, the visual culture of transatlantic slavery and revolution, and the construction of race. I am interested in the global contexts of British art. In 2014, I co-curated "Figures of Empire: Slavery and Portraiture in Eighteenth-Century Atlantic Britain" at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven. At the British Museum in 2018, I curated "A revolutionary legacy: Haiti and Toussaint Louverture". I'm currently working on a book that examines the formative role of printmaking in the work of British artists, entitled "The Radical Print: Art and Politics in Late Eighteenth-Century Britain".Supervisors: Timothy Barringerless236 Followers97 FollowingTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall6 Talks2 Exhibitions6 Reviews3 Other writing2 PapersTalks'"Copper in the Manner of Wood”: An Experimental Vignette by Thomas Bewick'The Romantic Eye: 1760-1860 and Beyond.
