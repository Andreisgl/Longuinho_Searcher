Antichistica 9/Studi Orientali 4Maurizio VianoWith written sources dated to the end of the fourth millennium B.C., Sumerian is the most ancient language so far documented and remained the language of education in scribal circles for over three millennia. In the Late Bronze Age the dissemination of Sumerian literature, which is best known from Old Babylonian sources, reached the Western periphery, i.e. Syria and Anatolia. This book investigates the transmission of Sumerian literary texts to the Western periphery and offers a comprehensive study of Sumerian literature in the Late Bronze Age.Download Free PDFView PDFC.

However, until very recently, attention has not focused on the important northern city of Kiš. Although many of the literary and liturgical duplicates from Kiš have been translated and discussed, neither the curricular nor the lamentational corpora have been treated as a whole. The goal of my dissertation, therefore, is to survey and analyze the entirety of the Old Babylonian (ca. 2000-1600 BCE) curricular and lamentational textual material from Kiš in order to identify local features or traditions that were unique to these genres. The survey of the curricular textual material will seek to accomplish two goals. First, it will identify the curricular compositions that were used in scribal education at Kiš during the OB period. Second, it will determine the ways in which the Kiš scribal curriculum deviated from the curricula that are known from other OB cites, such as Nippur, Ur, and Sippar. The latter investigation will reveal two patterns at Kiš. First, it will demonstrate that, although several curricular duplicates varied from manuscripts found at the major scribal center, Nippur, there is evidence to suggest that there were lines of textual transmission that connected the OB Kiš lexical tradition to those that were found in the MB and the first millennium. This evidence suggests that, although many of the Kiš curricular texts duplicate manuscripts that were found at Nippur, those that do not sometimes correspond with duplicates found in later periods, which appear to follow a more northern lexical tradition. Secondly, relative to the number of similar exercises found at the other OB cities, the Kiš curriculum included significantly higher numbers of Akkadian exercises (approximately two to four times as many), and appear in the elementary, intermediate, and advanced stages of the curriculum. It appears that students were required to copy Akkadian texts throughout their scribal training, beginning in the early stages of the curriculum. This relative abundance and broad application of Akkadian exercises in the whole of the curriculum speaks to the practical importance that Akkadian had in the day-to-day life of the scribes. The survey of the lamentational liturgies will seek to identify local features or traditions that were made to the Kiš laments in order to make them more appropriate for use in ritual performance. Many of these local features included city-specific modifications, such as deletions, additions, and replacements of proper nouns. Further investigation will reveal other local features, such as variant litanies, complete with unique incipits, unduplicated Kirugus, and modified refrains. Thematically, both the duplicated and unduplicated Kiš laments concerned themselves most often with the lamenting goddess. In short, I will conclude that the gala-priests were able to modify their liturgies to fit local consumption, and these traditions, in part, were incorporated into the standardized corpus of lamentational liturgies of the first millennium. Finally, the dissertation will investigate one final local feature that, while not unique to Kiš, was disproportionately used at the city: phonetic writings. The goals will be to identify the patterns or rules that were used to compose a text phonetically and to determine the most likely purpose for composing in this phonetic style in both lamentational and literary texts. The results of this dissertation will show that, although the OB Kiš corpus is poorly preserved and has lacked corpus-based investigation, both the curricular and lamentational texts are able to fill significant gaps in the study of scribal education and lamentational performance. The volume of curricular duplicates, though fragmentary and under published, reveals an active scribal educational system, complete with local characteristics and practical emphases. And although the evidence for lamentational performance in the OB period is scant compared to the myriad of texts composed in the first millennium, by revealing the content of many of the unduplicated liturgies at Kiš, and demonstrating local variants that appear in the laments, it will illuminate further aspects of OB lamentational performance. In the end, we see that the curricular and lamentational texts speak to the day-to-day activities that took place at OB Kiš, both in the curriculum, and in the cult. It will be seen that these Kiš traditions informed and influenced the standardized lexical and liturgical traditions of the first millennium, traditions that affected and shaped, to varying degrees, educational and theological concepts throughout Mesopotamian society.Download Free PDFView PDFPatterson 2018 Elements of the Neo-Sumerian Military.pdf2018 • Dan PattersonThe Neo-Sumerian (Ur III) period is known for having produced tens of thousands of tablets though, paradoxically, much of the history and culture of this period remains in the dark. One of these areas is the history and organization of the Ur III military. This dissertation is an investigation of selected issues and the terminology related to the military history of this period. It attempts to rectify the absence of monographic studies on this topic and to clarify problematic issues that recur in the secondary literature. Chapter one introduces the historical background of the Ur III period, focusing on the available sources and their associated biases. Chapter two establishes the framework for a military history of this period by utilizing year-names and textual references to plunder, and teases out some of the problems involved in using this data. This chapter utilizes the vast administrative corpus to build portraits of the enemy toponyms mentioned in year-names and attempts to determine their organizational structure and political relationship to the kingdom of Ur. Chapter three discusses the primary terms for soldiers (eren2, aga3-us2, gar3-du) and the garrison system that was established in the periphery. It demonstrated that the taxes on garrison settlements (gun2 ma-da) exhibited an array of formats and utilized a multiplicity of terms; this aids our understanding of the political statuses of a number of foreign toponyms. Chapter four investigates the context of the messenger text genre and some of the military terminology found within. This resulted in the discovery that different provinces and their messenger text corpora dealt with different regions of the periphery. Additionally, it was discovered that foreign groups from the periphery traveled in greater numbers and with greater frequency than previously assumed. Lastly, selected military terms were investigated and some previous assumptions regarding their meaning were challenged. This dissertation increases and redefines our knowledge of the military and political contexts of the Third Dynasty of Ur and provides a beginning point for further research into this area.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
