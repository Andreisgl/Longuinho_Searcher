Display issue[edit]
I just created a new topic, same way I've created a hundred others, but today the new topic is displaying in a most ugly manner. The pagebanner is ignored and I get a butt-ugly article TOC block. Doesn't look like a WV page. Did I do something wrong?  The page is Chignahuapan.  Mrkstvns (talk) 20:15, 8 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The {{pagebanner}} doesn't like the File: prefix for the filename. Fixed. –LPfi (talk) 20:30, 8 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Thank you, sir! I didn't realize I'd done anything different in the pagebanner. Glad you were able to spot the issue so quickly! I owe you a beer. Mrkstvns (talk) 20:43, 8 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
My pleasure. I have done the same a number of times, and forgot it and got puzzled every now and then. –LPfi (talk) 09:33, 9 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I wonder if we could make the template smarter about that – either to cope, or to emit a useful warning message.  I'd bet that someone at w:en:WP:VPT would know how to do that. WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:42, 9 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
They'd certainly know. I have the impression that many templates on sv-wp accept both forms, but didn't find any simple template that handles it. You need an #ifeq on the beginning of the file parameter ({{{1}}}) to check whether it matches "File:". I haven't been doing string manipulation, but something like this should work:
{{#ifeq:{{#invoke:String|sub| s={{{1}}} | i=1 | j=5 }} |File:|{{{1}}}|File:{{{1}}} }}
I don't know whether there is some parser function that could do this directly and whether invoking a module is expensive (module:String is already used in the template). Perhaps adding a warning in the template documentation (now done) is enough.

Oh what's that Simmons500 (talk) 19:31, 10 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The pagebanner shown at the top of on every page. This is a technical question better suited for some other forum, so don't worry about it. –LPfi (talk) 08:31, 29 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Merging small town[edit]
When merging a small town into a nearby larger town, does the town information get added into Go Next and redirect the article? For instance, Essex (Montana) should likely go to West Glacier. I need some general guidance, not just for this article, since there are several instances this will crop up as I expand Montana. Thanks! Tbennert (talk) 06:01, 18 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
There are different ways to do a merge. Different subsections could be used, for example. Adding merged information to "Go next" would be unusual. Ikan Kekek (talk) 07:31, 18 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
If the small town is clearly separate, one approach is to use a Nearby section, see Wikivoyage:Article skeleton templates/Sections#Nearby. Another approach, appropriate when there are several towns and no clear main one, is to use the rural area article template. In this case, the subsection approach suggested by IK may be the best one – for listings. Understand, Get in and Get around should be written to incorporate Essex sensibly.

travel[edit]
when would Asansol get its wings, i mean AIRPORT 2607:FEA8:41DF:93E0:78A2:E62:8A83:7D56 01:02, 29 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
According to w:Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport, it already opened 8 years ago. This isn't a travel question, though. SHB2000 (talk | contribs | meta) 01:10, 29 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
