Improper muscular contractions and relaxations of the stabilizers may ead to injury. Understanding muscle activation [patterns and muscle fatigue is necessary for prevention and rehabilitation of low back pain (1).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Manipulative and Physiological TherapeuticsReliability of Surface Electromyography in the Assessment of Paraspinal Muscle Fatigue: An Updated Systematic Review2014 • Mohammad Mohseni-bandpeiDownload Free PDFView PDFDisability and RehabilitationValidity and everyday clinical applicability of lumbar muscle fatigue assessment methods in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain: a systematic review2016 • Massimiliano  GobboThis systematic literature review aimed at examining the validity and applicability in everyday clinical rehabilitation practise of methods for the assessment of back muscle fatiguability in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP). Extensive research was performed in MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from their inception to September 2014. Potentially relevant articles were also manually looked for in the reference lists of the identified publications. Studies examining lumbar muscle fatigue in people with CNSLBP were selected. Two reviewers independently selected the articles, carried out the study quality assessment and extracted the results. A modified Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) scale was used to evaluate the scientific rigour of the selected works. Twenty-four studies fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the systematic review. We found conflicting data regarding the validity of methods used to examine back muscle fatigue. The Biering-Sorensen test, performed in conjunction with surface electromyography spectral analysis, turned out to be the most widely used and comparatively, the most optimal modality currently available to assess objective back muscle fatigue in daily clinical practise, even though critical limitations are discussed. Future research should address the identification of an advanced method for lower back fatigue assessment in patients with CNSLBP which, eventually, might provide physical therapists with an objective and reliable test usable in everyday clinical practise. Implications for Rehabilitation Despite its limitations, the Biering-Sorensen test is currently the most used, convenient and easily available fatiguing test for lumbar muscles. To increase validity and reliability of the Biering-Sorensen test, concomitant activation of synergistic muscles should be taken into account. Pooled mean frequency and half-width of the spectrum are currently the most valid electromyographic parameters to assess fatigue in chronic non-specific low back pain. Body mass index, grading of pain and level of disability of the study population should be reported to enhance research quality.Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Musculoskeletal DisordersPosterior muscle chain activity during various extension exercises: an observational study2013 • Guy VanderstraetenDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of Applied PhysiologyThe effect of sex and chronic low back pain on back muscle reflex responses2010 • Martin Bilodeau, Forget RobertDownload Free PDFView PDFArchives of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationElectromyographic assessment of back muscle weakness and muscle composition: Reliability and validity issues2002 • Patrick LoiselDownload Free PDFView PDFArchives of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationBack muscle strength and fatigue in healthy and chronic low back pain subjects: A comparative study of 3 assessment protocols2005 • Rubens Antonio SilvaDownload Free PDFView PDFBMC musculoskeletal disordersAssessment of the paraspinal muscles of subjects presenting an idiopathic scoliosis: an EMG pilot study2005 • Charles RivardIt is known that the back muscles of scoliotic subjects present abnormalities in their fiber type composition. Some researchers have hypothesized that abnormal fiber composition can lead to paraspinal muscle dysfunction such as poor neuromuscular efficiency and muscle fatigue. EMG parameters were used to evaluate these impairments. The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical potential of different EMG parameters such as amplitude (RMS) and median frequency (MF) of the power spectrum in order to assess the back muscles of patients presenting idiopathic scoliosis in terms of their neuromuscular efficiency and their muscular fatigue. L5/S1 moments during isometric efforts in extension were measured in six subjects with idiopathic scoliosis and ten healthy controls. The subjects performed three 7 s ramp contractions ranging from 0 to 100% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and one 30 s sustained contraction at 75% MVC. Surface EMG activity was recorded bilaterally from...Download Free PDFView PDFArchives of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationEffect of fatigue on torque output and electromyographic measures of trunk muscles during isometric axial rotation2003 • Mohamad parnianpourDownload Free PDFView PDFEffect of load level on the emg spectra of longissimus thoracis muscle during isometric fatiguing contractions2010 • MAURO GONÇALVESThe present study analyzed the effect of different magnitudes of isometric contraction of longissimus thoracis muscle until fatigue by means power spectra analysis. Eight healthy male subjects volunteered for this study The electromyography signals were sampled at 1 kHz using surface electrodes placed bilaterally over the longissimus thoracis muscle at the level L1. The isometric contraction was made at 30% and 60% of isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) randomly in the MA ISOSTATION 2001 with the trunk at 45 degrees of flexion. A gain of 1000, a high pass filter at 20 Hz and low pass filter at 500 Hz was used. The endurance time with the load of 30% was longer than the load of 60%. It was found a significant drop in the median frequency and in the mean power frequency for both loads in both sides with progression of time. Also, analyzing the load effect, it was found significant differences in the total power and peak power for the longissimus thoracis in the interval of 0...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Electromyography and KinesiologyBack muscle fatigue of younger and older adults with and without chronic low back pain using two protocols: A case-control study2015 • Edgar Vieira, Rubens da Silva, Adriana Carvalho, Alexandre NowotnyDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
