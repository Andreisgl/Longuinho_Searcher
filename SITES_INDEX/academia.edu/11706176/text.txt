Current interior construction progress monitoring methods involve submission of periodic reports and are constrained by their reliance on manually intensive processes and limited support for recording visual information. Recent advances in image-based visualization techniques enable reporting construction progress using interactive and visual approaches. However, analyzing significant amounts of as-built construction photographs requires sophisticated techniques. To overcome limitations of existing approaches, this research focuses on visualization and computer vision techniques to monitor detailed interior construction progress using an object-based approach. As-planned 3D models from Building Information Modeling (BIM) and as-built photographs are visualized and compared in a walk-through model. Within such an environment, the as-built interior construction objects are decomposed to automatically generate the status of construction progress. This object-based approach introduces an advanced model that enables the user to have a realistic understanding of the interior construction progress.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBIM-Based Cost Estimation/ Monitoring For Building ConstructionWafae DarkaouiProper Cost Estimate, Monitor and Control (CEM&C) are vital for the success of construction projects. Starting from preliminary design to project closing, CEM&C progressively becomes more complex and challenging. Visualization can add another dimension to monitor and control where major deviations can be visually detected and analyzed. However, literature related to visualization in construction and integrating it with cost control is still in its early stages. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can have promising impact in that domain. In this paper, a comprehensive cost estimating and monitoring model is presented. The model is integrated with BIM to provide the user with the capability of visualizing actual cost expended in different building elements and compare it with that budgeted at different time intervals. It provides construction practitioners with vital data that help them in taking appropriate corrective actions in case of any deviation from the budget. An example application is presented to demonstrate the capability and applicability of the model.Download Free PDFView PDFResearch Report of Building Information ModellingHuan DamonBuilding information modelling has been widespread in AEC industry in recent years. Many organizations have adopting BIM as the main technology to apply in the whole stage of construction project. However, the implementation of BIM still need to develop constantly for future more sophisticated environment in AEC industry. Quantities of research have being conducting to promote BIM to be more optimal in different fields. This report is aim to classify, compare and contrast the findings of reviews from 150 abstract of BIM article. The main methodology is tried to find out the significant opinion and relation between different articles and classify them into several board areas and considerable subareas. Making further research about every article, to understand what the main research subjects are. Finally, to conclude and evaluate the findings in the report through critical analysis and comprehensive understanding. In a word, the report illustrated the current important research findings of BIM and different relevant fields.

SEPBesides the constant updating of training in the new graphic resources available to engineering and architecture professions, and in widespread and frequent use, the school should also adapt its teaching activities to the new tools of visual communication. In Civil Engineering, the capacity to visualise the construction, management and maintenance of buildings can be added through the use of three‐dimensional (3D) models which, facilitate the interpretation and understanding of target elements of maintenance and construction and of 4D models (3D + time) through which the evolution of construction steps and deterioration of materials can be visually demonstrated and understood. Furthermore, the possibility of interaction with the geometric models can be provided through the use of Virtual Technology (VR). The text presents diverse perspectives of introduction a new technology in school. It can be used as a tool to create didactic applications and as a new issue in the training of students. The students involved, in the research works had to learn advanced software of geometric modelling and visualization and to explore the capacities of a VR technology system. Also programming skills had to be adapted to establish the integration needed for the creation of virtual prototypes. Furthermore, the structure of different kind of databases had to be studied and implemented, integrating diverse type of information, needed to develop the interactive virtual model. The VR technology was introduced in school in order to prepare civil engineering students to consider this knowledge as an important support, later in professional activity, and also to facilitate the link between, engineering theory and its implementation.Download Free PDFView PDFArabian Journal for Science and EngineeringA Concept for Automated Construction Progress Monitoring: Technologies Adoption for Benchmarking Project Performance Control2018 • Dr. Sepehr AlizadehsalehiDespite recent advances in technologies and equipment for automated progress monitoring, most construction companies worldwide do not utilize them for their projects. This can be due to many reasons, such as the high cost of technologies and equipment, need for skilled staff, and lack of sufficient information about the impact of automated progress monitoring on project performance control. The aim of the present research is to investigate the impact of automated progress monitoring on key project performance indicators: time, cost, and quality. This study prepared based on a survey of contracting and engineering consulting firms in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. In the first part of this study, structural equation modeling is used to identify the relations of different factors of project progress monitoring (both conventional and automated) with project performance control. In the second part of the study, a benefit analysis is evaluated based on the sixteen (16) journal and international conference papers and also twenty-four (24) international construction projects for which automated progress monitoring was employed. The research findings validate the positive impact of real-time, accurate, and cost-effective automated progress monitoring environments and reveal how automated progress monitoring affects construction project success.Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the 13th International Conference on Construction Applications of Virtual RealityMohamad  KassemWe are honored to welcome you to the 13th International Conference on Construction applications of Virtual Reality (CONVR 2013) organized by Teesside University.
