Welcome to the Endowed Fund for Polish Studies 
The University of Pittsburgh has a 50-year long history of offering courses in Polish language, literature, and culture. In addition to regular course offerings, it offers summer study in Poland and maintains the internationally recognized Polish Language Website (including an on-line dictionary, home-study Polish course, and much more). The University library, incorporating the Alliance College Collection, houses one of the largest collections of Polish books in the United States.
This program will go out of existence without your support, and time is urgent. Please support our efforts to preserve this valuable program with a donation to the Endowed Fund for Polish Studies. Once this program disappears, it cannot be replaced.
