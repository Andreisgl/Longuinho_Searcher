The 'Swastika' is synonymous with antisemitism in a multicultural Australia where Indic identity groups like Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs are model minorities. Two extreme threads represent the misappropriation of 'Swastika' in Australia. The first thread is the fringe White Supremacists inspired by their American and European counterparts. The second thread is the deliberate ignorance maintained by the ecosystem of media and academia to maintain Western Universalism.Save to LibraryDownloadby BS HOLLA•  4  Nazism, Hindu Studies, Aryan, SwastikaJames Mill - The legacy and impact of The History of British India.James Mill's 'The History of British India ' is the first Hinduphobic work published in the guise of Utilitarianism to help Britain for parliamentary reforms and defame and destroy India.

Adolescent pregnancy is therefore a significant public health problem. Most births to adolescents (95%) occur in resource-constrained countries. The aim was to review the available evidence about the factors associated with adolescent pregnancy in low-income and lower middle-income countries. The review used the PRISMA procedure of identification, screening and eligibility of publications. PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, SCOPUS and CINAHL plus were searched systematically for peer-reviewed English language papers published before December 2013. In total, 2005 articles were identified and 12 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Despite varied methods, there was substantial consistency in the findings. Limited education, low socioeconomic position, insufficient access to and non-use of contraception were consistently found to be risks for pregnancy among adolescents. There was some evidence ...Save to Libraryby Rina Pradhan•  15  Human Geography, Developing Countries, Adolescent, Social ClassPregnancy among adolescent women in Nepal: a mixed methods investigation of a complex persistent phenomenonBackground: Pregnancy related morbidity and mortality is much more prevalent among adolescents than adults.

Adolescent pregnancy is therefore a significant public health problem. Most births to adolescents (95%) occur in resource-constrained countries. However, little is known about the risk factors for adolescent pregnancy in these settings. Objectives: The first objective of this study was to describe the prevalence and determinants of pregnancy among adolescents in Nepal using the Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). The second was to ascertain the views and perspective of young married and unmarried women in rural Nepal about pregnancy among adolescents. The third was to understand from the perspectives of key informants from relevant policy and programme sectors why adolescent pregnancies persist in Nepal and what efforts have been made to date to reduce them. Methods: Mixed methods were used consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods.

However, its potential to detect PCMDs in culturally diverse low- and lower-middle income countries (LALMICs) is unclear. This systematic review aimed to appraise formally validated local language versions of the EPDS from these resource-constrained settings. Following the PRISMA protocol, we searched MEDLINE-OVID, CINAHL-Plus and PUBMED to identify studies reporting translation, cultural adaptation and formal validation of the EPDS to detect PCMDs among women in LALMICs. The quality of the studies meeting inclusion criteria was assessed using standard criteria and a new process-based criteria; which was developed specifically for this study. We identified 1281 records among which 16 met inclusion criteria; three further papers were identified by hand-s...Save to LibraryDownloadby Rina Pradhan•  20  Nursing, Psychiatry, Psychometrics, PovertyFactors Associated with Pregnancy among Married Adolescents in Nepal: Secondary Analysis of the National Demographic and Health Surveys from 2001 to 2011Save to LibraryDownloadby Rina Pradhan•  17  Demography, Poverty, Medicine, MultidisciplinaryAdditional file 2: of Reliability and validity of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for detecting perinatal common mental disorders (PCMDs) among women in low-and lower-middle-income countries: a systematic reviewPRISMA (2009) checklist for studies included for this systematic review.
