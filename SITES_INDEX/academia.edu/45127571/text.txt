THE TRANSLATION OF MĀR ŠARRI AND ITS IMPACT ON THE SUCCESSION IN THE NEO-ASSYRIAN PERIODAuday  Hussein2020, State Archives of Assyria BulletinIn this study I examine the term mār šarri across the range of Assyrian documents and contexts and show that although the term mār šarri is used in most contexts to refer to the crown prince, it does not mean “crown prince”, rather it simply means “the prince” in definite mode. Equipped with the accurate understanding of the term mār šarri, I re-evaluate the most prominent theories of the succession of the Sargonids, especially the succession arrangement of Sennacherib, and demonstrate that the misunderstanding of the term mār šarri, especially in legal contracts, has resulted in an inaccurate picture of the succession history of the Sargonids.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIn: Proceedings of the 57th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Rome, 2011. forthcoming Groß Innovation and tradition in the sphere of Neo-Assyrian officialdomResearch Network Imperium & OfficiumDownload Free PDFView PDF2012 Groß Innovation and Tradition in the Sphere of Neo-Assyrian OfficialdomResearch Network Imperium & OfficiumDownload Free PDFView PDFA.

(eds.), Prince of the Orient: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Memory of H.I.H. Prince Takahito Mikasa,  2019 (ISBN 978-4-600-00114-8), pp.237-257.2019 • Kazuko WatanabeWhen Esarhaddon (680–669 BC) decided that Aššurbanipal was to be the next king of Assyria, Šamaš-šumu-ukīn the next king of Babylonia, his greatest concern was how to prevent any rebellions which might be caused by his other, discontent sons. Through an analysis of the text of Esarhaddon’s Succession Oath Documents (ESOD), the author will show that a number of his sons had raised the king’s keen anxiety. At the same time, however, Esarhaddon’s attitude towards his sons differed among the several different groups of them. The documents also indicate what kind of people could be instigators and what action should be taken against a rebellion or even the planning of one, and also how to denounce the instigators or to inform Aššurbanipal effectively. The constant paraphrasing of these explanations in the texts along with the massive distribution of the tablets of ESOD helped bring about a kind of globalization of concepts for the grouping of peoples as well as formulae for desirable action.Download Free PDFView PDF2014 Groß The Babylonian court during the Neo-Assyrian periodResearch Network Imperium & OfficiumDownload Free PDFView PDFCHANGE IN NEO-ASSYRIAN IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION: Evolution and RevolutionNatalie Naomi MayDownload Free PDFView PDF“My Brother’s Keeper: Assurbanipal versus Šamaš-šuma-ukīn” Journal of Ancient Near Eastern History 6.1 (2019): 19-52.Shana ZaiaDownload Free PDFView PDFChange in Neo-Assyrian Imperial Administration: Evolution and Revolution.

He was the addressee of many letters written by the subjects of the Empire. He appears on a number of contemporary documents. The present study demonstrates that the correspondence of Sargon's brother and vizier, together with some historical documents, show that Sīn-aḫu-uṣur was ruling Babylonia on behalf of his brother, the king. The paper will analyse the spheres of the king's brother's involvement in the state affairs. The article investigates the extraordinary status and functions of the sukkallu of Sargon, who restored the grandeur of this office based on the Middle Assyrian precedent especially for his brother. The author further explores Ḫarrān as the seat of the collateral royal family members and the role of the precedent of the Middle Assyrian dynasty of sukkallus, the kings of ḪaniGALbat, 2) in the ideology of the Sargonids. Lastly, I will argue that the relationship between Sargon and Sīn-aḫu-uṣur served a model for Esarhaddon in his division of power between his two sons and heirs, Assurba-nipal and Šamaš-šumu-ukīn.Download Free PDFView PDFPetr Charvát, Kateřina Šašková, Lukáš Pecha (eds.): Shepherds of the Black-headed People: The Royal Office vis-à-vis godhead in ancient MesopotamiaKateřina Šašková, Petr CharvatDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
