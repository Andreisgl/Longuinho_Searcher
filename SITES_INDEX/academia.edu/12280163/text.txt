Report of the 2008-2009 campaigns2012 • Paola Sconzo, Gioacchino FalsoneThe Italian excavations at Shiyukh Tahtani have recently resumed, revealing a long occupation sequence on the mound’s eastern slope (Area CD). In Trench D23, on the summit, an Iron Age level II building contained a rich array of pottery, sheep knuckle bones, clay ‘bobbins’ and an unstratiﬁed Egyptian scarab of Menkheperre. An earlier massive building (LBA ?) was also excavated below the Iron Age II occupation. Halfway down the slope the lower level of a large burnt complex of Middle Bronze I date contained rich ﬁnds and various burials characterized by peculiar rituals. Finally, in a deep trench down below the slope, EB I-II remains included niched mud-brick architecture of ﬁne Mesopotamian tradition as well as many pot burials of the Carchemish ‘champagne-­cup culture’. All these ﬁnds enhance the knowledge about the Bronze and Iron Age civilization of the Syrian Euphrates.Download Free PDFView PDF Proceedings of the 7th International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East (ICAANE), London, April, 12th-16th 2010.

Results of the 2008-2009 field seasons are reported here. The survey covered a 133 hectare area near Wadi Abyad. In addition, two sites with Neolithic and Chalcolithic remains, Khirbet Bezi and Khirbet Shane, have been surveyed for surface finds. During the 16-day-survey, more than 21,000 sherds as well as lithics and pottery slag were retrieved, and their distribution was used to create interpolated raster layers of their density. We also have tested satellite-derived sites of high/low probability predicted by Jason Ur and Bjoern Menze (Menze, Ur 2007). Geophysical surveys at sites showing Neolithic to Iron Age remains were also carried out during the 2008 campaign in Syria. The Scintrex Navmag SM-5 Cesium Magnetometer measured the vertical gradient of the magnetic field over an area of 11.25 ha with a resolution of 1.0 x 0.15 m. The informative value of the geophysical survey varied from site to site, depending on the degree of (recent) soilmodification."Download Free PDFView PDF2018 Agriculture and economy in the Phoenician homeland ‒ the Sidon hinterland as a case study (ICAANE München)Aaron SchmittDownload Free PDFView PDFWeeping figurines: function and symbolism of some rare mourning records found inside ancient Egyptian tombs.Alessandra ColazilliMourning and weeping were an essential part of the ancient Egyptian ritual of rebirth, due to their mythical background. Rare terracotta figurines found inside tombs seem to confirm the will to keep up this practice, in addition to the well-known painted or relief evidence. Recovered exemplars date back to at least the Middle Kingdom up to the Greco-Roman period. Two types can be observed: the “mourning pot” type, obtained from vases adding heads, breasts and arms moulded in typical mourning attitudes, and the “human-shaped” type moulded to suggest the same grief. Both types were buried next to the deceased to guarantee an everlasting mourning. The reason of pursuing a perpetual wail lies in textual sources evoking the god Osiris who gained rebirth thanks to his two wailing sisters. Hence the symbolism behind these little figurines justifies their presence inside tombs. As part of a PhD research on the expression of feelings in Egyptian literature, the purpose of the paper will be to investigate, with the support of archaeological and literary records, the role of these mourning figurines, their symbolism and their position inside tombs.Download Free PDFView PDFPinnock_Colours and Light in the Royal Palace G of Early Syrian Ebla_7ICAANE.pdfFrances PinnockDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
