The problem, he argued, was that Peru' s immense natural resource endowments are not legally titled, and therefore cannot be traded, do not attract investment, and do not generate employment. The result: continuing poverty. This situation persists, he maintained, because of the "law of the dog in the manger, which says if I can't do it, nobody can do it"-a position argued by "the old anti-capitalist Communists of the 19th century, who disguised themselves as the protectionists of the 20th century and then changed T-shirts again in the 21st century to be environmentalists." García bemoaned that "there are millions of hectares for timber extraction that lie idle, millions more that communities and associations have not, and will never, cultivate, in addition to hundreds of mineral deposits that cannot be worked."

Following a period in which safeguards and forest dwellers' territorial rights were strengthened under more permissive political opportunity structures, the current period has been characterized by efforts to weaken these protections and to facilitate large-scale private investment in previously protected lands. We describe these investment-based threats to forests and rights, and the nature of regulatory rollbacks in the region. We then discuss some of the ways in which social movement actors have responded to these pressures and the extent to which they have affected the policies driving these pressures on forests and rights. While in prior decades movements were able to exercise mediated influence on policy, at present the channels open to them are mostly indirect, though opportunities for collaboration between movements organizations and rights-defending government agencies do emerge periodically offering channels for mediated influence.Download Free PDFView PDF“'The colonos come in like termites to take our land': A study of indigenous leadership, women representatives, and conflict in the bolivian amazon"

I examine the complex relationships between the indigenous communities, the Federación Nativa de Madre de Dios y Afluentes (FENAMAD) that represents them, and the Peruvian Government in the southeastern region of the Amazon, to argue that the State’s conservationist discourse limits the indigenous organization’s struggle against oil extraction, preventing it from effectively representing the needs of the communities it claims to represent. Based on analysis of personal interviews with community members, published statements from FENAMAD, and legal complaints against Hunt Oil, this paper suggests that the divisions between these stakeholders are directly impeding progress towards defining and acting upon shared regional goals. I compare the desirable futures as defined by the Native Community Shintuya, FENAMAD, and the State to conclude that contrary to the federation’s stance, the community sees oil as a potential opportunity for community growth. Through examination of the current strategies of indigenous umbrella organizations and other actors in the face of natural resource extraction, my case study reveals the challenges confronting indigenous communities in their struggles to define their own development and suggests strategies for moving forward toward desirable futures.Download Free PDFView PDFReclaiming collective rights: land and forest tenure reforms in Peru (1960-2016)Iliana Monterroso, Danny PinedoIn Peru, since 1974, more than 1,200 communities have been titled in the Amazon for over 12 million hectares, representing about 20% of the country’s national forest area. This working paper analyzes policy and regulatory changes that have influenced how indigenous peoples access, use and manage forest and land resources in the Peruvian Amazon during the last fifty years. It reviews the main motivations behind changes, the institutional structures defined by law and the outcomes of these changes in practice. The paper discusses political priorities related to land and forest tenure, social actors involved in reform debates and the mechanisms used for recognizing indigenous rights claims. The paper argues that there has not been a single reform process in Peru; instead multiple reforms have shaped forest tenure rights, contributing to both progress and setbacks for indigenous people and communities. This working paper is part of a global comparative research initiative that is analyzing reform processes that recognize collective tenure rights to forests and land in six countries in highly forested regions.Download Free PDFView PDFGovernmentality, Development and the Violence of Natural Resource Extraction in PeruGiorgos KallisDownload Free PDFView PDFThe politics of extractive governance: Indigenous peoples and socio-environmental conflictsRoger  MerinoSocial conflicts related to extractive industries in Peru tend to be conceptualised as problems of governance, namely, as conflicts generated from ill-designed policies for distribution of revenues from extractive industries, formal political participation, transparency and conflict management. The governance approach, however, does not analyse the historical connection between extractive policies and exploitation/dispossession of indigenous peoples and the permanence of colonial patterns of domination. The main argument of this paper is that many social conflicts related to extractive activities do not derive from problems of ‘governance’, but more profoundly, they emerge due to divergences that transcend the current governance and express different political ontologies. This argument will be developed through the case study of the Baguazo and the Awajun territorial struggles in the Peruvian Amazon.Download Free PDFView PDFEl Perro del Hortelano: Producing Activist Film in the Peruvian AmazonDevin BeaulieuDownload Free PDFView PDFSocialism and DemocracyLaw of the jungle in Peru: Indigenous Amazonian uprising against neoliberalism2009 • Gerardo ReniqueDownload Free PDFView PDFWhat is “Post” in Post-Neoliberal Political Economy? Indigenous’ land rights and the extractive industry in Peru, Bolivia and EcuadorRoger  MerinoIndigenous movements in Latin America are considered as important actors in the processes of “radical democracy” and the constitution of “post-neoliberal regimens”. In Bolivia and Ecuador political parties representing indigenous people have promoted legal and institutional reforms towards the creation of a plurinational state. In Peru, indigenous movements have supported the candidature of the recently left-wing elected president, forming “chains of equivalence” with environmentalists, unions, and liberal democrats against a radical conservative neoliberal party. And yet, in these three countries, many indigenous people are still ignored or repressed, particularly when they protest against mining, oil and developmental projects led either by the government or transnational corporations. By exploring the discordance between multicultural policies on the one hand, and extractivist economic dependence on the other hand, I suggest that in spite of the legal recognition of indigenous rights, multiculturalism in Latin America has not challenged the legal and economic mechanisms of assimilation of indigenous peoples’ land rights. Thus, in the Ecuadorian and Bolivian contexts there is a deep tension between the communal paradigm of the “Buen vivir” and the liberal framework of the sovereignty of the nation state which owns all natural resources; whereas in the Peruvian context the governmental rhetoric of “social inclusion” is embedded in the logic of neoliberal assimilation.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Devil's Curve: Indigenous Rights and Resource Extraction in PeruJesse H Hudson"Indigenous people and their communities have a vital role in environmental management and development because of their knowledge and traditional practices. States should recognize and duly support their identity, culture, and interests and enable their effective participation in the achievement of sustainable development." The soft language of Principle 22 of the Rio Declaration above doesn't provide much in the way of concrete and actionable rights for indigenous peoples vis-à-vis mining, oil, and other encroaching extractive corporations. A body of law articulating indigenous rights and giving them force is working its way up the slow climb of state practice and opinio juris towards codification in customary international law. This paper surveys that law, focusing specifically on Peru.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
