Welcome toAcademia Engineering A new open access journal in engineering brought to you by Academia.eduWelcome toAcademia Engineering A new open access journal in engineering brought to you by Academia.eduContribute to the acceleration and advancement of engineering researchSubmit an article for publication in Academia Engineering SUBMIT AN ARTICLEAbout Academia EngineeringFast publishing in the field of engineeringOur goal is for peer review, the editorial process, and publication to happen within four weeks of submission.Robust peer review and editorial processEach paper will be peer reviewed by two scientists working in the field of the paper. A member of Academia Engineering's Editorial Board will oversee the peer review process.Broad and accurate disseminationEach paper published in Academia Engineering will be distributed to the relevant people within Academia’s global network of 222 million people.Discussion, engagement, & community exchangeAfter publishing a paper, authors can increase the impact of their paper by engaging with questions about the paper from scientists in Academia’s community.Aims & ScopeAcademia Engineering is an innovative open access journal publishing original research and review articles related to engineering sciences. The editors welcome interdisciplinary submissions from the cutting edge of engineering research encouraging those that drive connectivity between disciplines including but not limited to materials engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, energy and environment engineering, industrial and manufacturing engineering. By engaging the Academia.edu community, the global team of Academia Engineering editors will provide authors with rapid and robust single-blind peer review feedback prior to publication.The journal will apply for indexing and will be disseminated using services requested by the community.Our mission is to accelerate the world's research.Our mission to accelerate the world's research.Following the success of Academia Letters—our former online platform for publishing and sharing short-form research articles, including orphaned findings and case studies—Academia.edu is launching a suite of open access journals for the global research community. Our journals will open up new avenues for disseminating research results and ensuring that the most recent findings are freely available to all.Each journal will mobilize its global research community to drive debate and conversation around submitted research. The conversation will be led by an authoritative Editor-in-Chief, who will work alongside a global team of editors. This editorial team will facilitate industry leading, rapid and robust single-blind peer review by engaging the extensive Academia.edu audience.47 Million+papers hosted in our network233 Millionregistered users across hundreds of disciplines2.4 Millionresearch topics added as tags to papers42%of the world's faculty use academia.eduUsed by academics at 16,909 universitiesSections Covered in Academia Engineering Aerospace EngineeringAgriculture EngineeringArchitecture EngineeringBiomedical EngineeringChemical EngineeringCivil EngineeringComputer EngineeringControl EngineeringElectrical EngineeringElectronic EngineeringEnergy EngineeringEngineering ManagementEnvironmental EngineeringGeotechnical EngineeringIndustrial EngineeringInformation EngineeringManufacturing EngineeringMaterials EngineeringMechanical EngineeringMining EngineeringNuclear EngineeringPetroleum EngineeringStructural EngineeringThermal EngineeringAcademic Editors Prof. Thurmon LockhartArizona State University, USAProf. Raul D.S.G.

DombrovskyJoint Institute for High Temperatures, Russia Prof. Gianvittorio RizzanoUniversity of Salerno, Italy Prof. Ramesh K AgarwalWashington University in St. Louis, USAPraise for Academia Letters Publishing with Academia Letters was great. I had this short essay and I couldn’t set the time aside to work on it. This is a great opportunity–it will go out there and people will read it. Faculty, Tel Aviv University Academia Letters has the potential to become a great hit, and a great mover of science towards faster, more open, and more progressive ways of scholarship. Faculty, University of Melbourne Richard Pricefounder and ceoI founded Academia.edu when I was at Oxford, finishing my doctorate in the philosophy of perception. I conceived of Academia as a global platform where academics could connect and share research. Today 233 million people have joined Academia globally, and researchers have uploaded 47 million papers to their profiles. Two of Academia's values are speed and openness. We want to ensure that a paper is routed from author to reader as quickly as possible; and we want every paper, ever written, on the internet, available for free. The academic publishing process has historically been slow and closed. My first paper took 3 years to come out: from submission to publication. The average time from submission to publication is ~12 months. Our goal with our journal, Academia Engineering, and our future journals, is to create journals that are fast, open, and robust. Fast means 4 week turnaround times: peer review, editorial, and publication completed in four weeks from the time of submission. Open means that the journals will be open access: papers will be free to read, and authors will pay an article processing charge at the time of publication. Robust means that we will use our AI technologies to identify the most relevant reviewers from the Academia network for any given paper. We will ask at least two relevant peer reviewers to review a paper before the paper is published. The peer review process will be overseen by the Editorial Board of senior scientists. With Academia Engineering, and future Academia journals, we intend to introduce a new era of fast, open and robust academic publishing. Sincerely,D.Phil, University of OxfordBroad dissemination of your work to over 233 million academics, professionals, and students Share your work with the world and help advance engineering research SUBMIT AN ARTICLE
