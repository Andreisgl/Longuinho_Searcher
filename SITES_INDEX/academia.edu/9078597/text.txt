Rhoby and N.

Abstract Metrical polyeideia is an important quality in many poetic traditions, from the antiquity to Byzantine times and beyond. As with their ancient models, the Byzantines even combined more than one meters within a single work, such as short epigrams, long metrical commentaries and novels. However, it has gone unnoticed that after the year 1000, many authors composed even cycles of poems or stanzas for the very same occasion, yet written in different meters. This article aims to examine this neglected practice and shed some light on the driving motivations behind the composition of such works. It demonstrates its continuous popularity throughout the twelfth century, since there are numerous multimetric cycles by Theophylaktos of Ochrid, Theodore Prodromos, Niketas Eugenianos, Manganeios Prodromos, and Efthymios Tornikes. Moreover, all these multimetric cycles are associated with a wide range of types of occasional poetry, including monodies, epitaphs, epithalamia and panegyrics. Since the composition of ceremonial poetry on commission reached its heyday in the twelfth century, it is argued that many authors made use of the multimetric cycles to present novel compositions to their patrons. In order to achieve generic innovation, they mixed not only contents, motifs and modes from different literary generic categories, but also different metrical forms.Download Free PDFView PDFMitteilungen aus der Österreichischen Byzantinistik und Neogräzistik 32 (2018)2018 • Andreas KülzerDownload Free PDFView PDFPoetry and its contexts in eleventh-century ByzantiumFloris  BernardByzantine poetry of the eleventh century is fascinating, yet underexplored terrain. It presents a lively view on contemporary society, is often permeated with wit and elegance, and is concerned with a wide variety of subjects. Only now are we beginning to perceive the possibilities that this poetry offers for our knowledge of Byzantine culture in general, for the intellectual history of Byzantium, and for the evolution of poetry itself. It is, moreover, sometimes in the most neglected texts that the most fascinating discoveries can be made.This book, the first collaborative book-length study on the topic, takes an important step to fill this gap. It brings together specialists of the period who delve into this poetry with different but complementary objectives in mind, covering the links between art and text, linguistic evolutions, social functionality, contemporary reading attitudes, and the like. The authors aim to give the production of 11th-century verse a place in the Byzantine genre system and in the historic evolution of Byzantine poetry and metrics. As a result, this book will, to use the expression of two important poets of the period, "offer a small taste" of what can be gained from the serious study of this period.Download Free PDFView PDFEpigram, Art, and Devotion in Later ByzantiumIvan  DrpićThis book explores the nexus of art, personal piety, and self-representation in the last centuries of Byzantium. Spanning the period from around 1100 to around 1450, it focuses upon the evidence of verse inscriptions, or epigrams, on works of art. Epigrammatic poetry, Professor Drpić argues, constitutes a critical – if largely neglected – source for reconstructing aesthetic and socio-cultural discourses that informed the making, use, and perception of art in the Byzantine world. Bringing together art-historical and literary modes of analysis, the book examines epigrams and other related texts alongside an array of objects, including icons, reliquaries, ecclesiastical textiles, mosaics, and entire church buildings. By attending to such diverse topics as devotional self-fashioning, the aesthetics of adornment, sacred giving, and the erotics of the icon, this study offers a penetrating and highly original account of Byzantine art and its place in Byzantine society and religious life.Download Free PDFView PDFMitteilungen aus der Österreichischen Byzantinistik und Neogräzistik 33 (2019)2019 • Andreas KülzerDownload Free PDFView PDFMitteilungen aus der Österreichischen Byzantinistik und Neogräzistik 31 (2017)Andreas KülzerDownload Free PDFView PDFBMGS 40, Issue 2 (2016)Theodore Prodromos and the use of the poetic work of Gregory of Nazianzus: Appropriation in the service of self-representationNikos ZagklasGregory of Nazianzus and Theodore Prodromos are two of the most influential poets of Byzantium. And yet, no study has examined the various intertextual correspondences between their poetic works. This article is the first to demonstrate the extensive appropriation of Gregory's work by Prodromos. It is divided into three parts:1 the first discusses poems composed by Prodromos in praise of Gregory; the second part attempts to show which of Gregory's poems Prodromos read and his technique of ‘plundering’ words from Gregory's corpus; the third part concentrates on Prodromos’ creative imitation of Nazianzus’ poetry in terms of wording, genre and sentiments, which eventually enabled him to craft part of his authorial self-portrait.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Function of Text: Byzantine Reliquaries with Epigrams, 843–1204 (PhD diss., Florida State Univ., 2016)Brad  HostetlerThis dissertation re-contextualizes the types, uses, and meanings of reliquaries in the Middle Byzantine period (843–1204). Relics are the remains of—or the materials associated with—Christ, the Mother of God, apostles, martyrs, and saints. For the faithful, they were the physical presence of the divine, imbued with miraculous power and grace. Reliquaries are the containers that enshrined, protected, and displayed this sacred matter. They are/were made of lavish materials—gold, silver, gems, and pearls—which conferred honor upon, and testified to the spiritual value of, the contents. Numerous Middle Byzantine reliquaries survive or are known through textual descriptions, but there has not been a study that examines these objects as a group. This dissertation fills this gap, charting out a paradigm for understanding the forms and functions of these objects. I take as my focus those reliquaries inscribed with metrical inscriptions, or epigrams. These texts provide a great deal of information about reliquaries, and they served a variety of functions—as ex-voto prayers, as expressions of identity, as performative texts, and as descriptions of the objects that they accompany. I demonstrate that epigrams are also visual, functioning as but one part of the reliquaries’ complex visual programs in which word, image, and sacred matter converge, complement, and interact with each other. I examine the mechanisms of these interactions, revealing the messages they conveyed on behalf of the patrons and the ways in which reliquaries and epigrams functioned in the artistic and literary culture of Byzantium. Chapter 1, “Introduction,” defines the critical terms of this dissertation, presents an overview of the scholarship, and outlines my methodological contributions. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce the reader to the forms and functions of reliquaries in the Middle Byzantine period, and are thus the foundation for the dissertation. Chapter 2 outlines the different types of reliquaries that were inscribed with epigrams. It presents aspects of their design and form, including imagery and the placement of the epigrams. Chapter 3 provides a brief historical survey of the various contexts in which reliquaries were used, from personal possessions to public veneration practices. Chapters 4–6 focus on epigrams. Chapter 4 examines the ways in which epigrams—both in content and placement—function to make relics visually and haptically accessible to the faithful. Chapter 5 explores the relationship between reliquary and metaphor. What are the ways in which the ekphrastic character of epigrams describes, interprets, and presents reliquaries for and to their owners? Chapter 6 situates reliquaries in the context of religious gift-giving by addressing the various ways in which a patron articulates his/her identity, connection with a holy figure, and what he/she hopes to receive in return. Chapter 7 presents my conclusions concerning the forms of reliquaries, relic accessibility, viewer interpretations, and patron motivations. The Appendices catalogue the 74 Middle Byzantine reliquaries inscribed with epigrams. The case studies I present in these chapters demonstrate that Middle Byzantine reliquaries with epigrams are/were a complex system of texts, images, relics, and materials that interact with each other. I demonstrate that epigrams—in addition to being textual—have visual and spatial dimensions, wrapping the exterior, interior, front, back, and sides of reliquaries. They are dynamic texts that pulled the viewers in and taught them how to see, interpret, and handle the reliquaries, and how to access relics.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
