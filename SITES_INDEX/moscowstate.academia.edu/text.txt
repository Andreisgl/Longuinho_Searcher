Kaiser Justinian und das Erbe des Konzils von Chalkedon [Altertumswissenschaftliches Kolloquium. Interdisziplinäre Studien zur Antike und zu ihrem Nachleben. Bd. 30].

Ein zentraler Lehrsatz des Konzils, dass in der Person Christi die göttliche und die menschliche Natur ‚unvermischt‘ und ‚unzertrennlich‘ vereinigt seien, bedeutete die endgültige Verurteilung der monophysitischen Lehre. Seitdem war die Bevölkerung des Imperium Romanum in Anhänger und in Gegner des Konzils von Chalkedon gespalten – die sogenannten Antichalkedonier, welche die größte religiöse Gruppierung im oströmischen Reich des 5.–6. Jahrhunderts ausmachten. Für Kaiser Justinian, wie für manchen seiner Vorgänger auf dem Kaiserthron von Konstantinopel, war daher ein wichtiges Anliegen seiner Kirchenpolitik, die religiöse Spaltung des Reiches durch theologische Vermittlung zu überwinden. Michail Grazianskij analysiert die Kirchenpolitik Ostroms zwischen den Jahren 451 und 571 mit Schwerpunkt auf der Regierungszeit Justinians (527–565). Dabei untersucht er die Maßnahmen des Kaisers auf Grundlage aller relevanten Quellen und bewertet sie auf ihre Ziele hin. Die Rolle des Kaisers, die Grundlagen und Eigenart seiner Politik und ihr Einfluss auf die spätere Entwicklung im Imperium Romanum werden von Grazianskij genau beschrieben und unter kritischer Aufnahme der vorgängigen Forschung gedeutet.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This case is a vivid example of an ecclesiastical conflict, for the elimination of which various ecclesiastical legal mechanisms were involved — the court of local bishops, a conciliar verdict and a retrial of the case as a result of the intervention of the Bishop of Rome. In general, it has many similarities with the famous case of presbyter Apiarius and unfolds in the same years. The article examines the course of the case, especially its aspect related to Antoninus’ appeal to Pope Boniface. This appeal resulted in Antoninus’ case being retried in Numidia, and the report being sent to Boniface’s successor, Pope Celestine. The author of the article explores the degree of involvement of the Roman see in these events, given by the letters of Augustine, which help to better understand the policy of the popes during this period, what legal grounds there were for the intervention of the pope in this African affair, and how this intervention was perceived by the Numidian bishops. The author comes to the conclusion that, according to indirect evidence, the investigation of the case of Antoninus after the intervention of Pope Boniface was based on the 7th canon of the Council of Serdica and therefore this case can be considered as one of the rarest documented cases when this canon could actually be applied. The case of Antoninus was also, among other things, the basis for the Council of Carthage in 424 to send the famous letter Optaremus to Pope Celestine. The article is accompanied by a commented translation of both letters of Augustine into Russian.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Спор Никеи и Никомидии на Халкидонском соборе за статус митрополии: гражданский аспект [The Dispute Between Nicaea and Nicomedia over the Status of Metropolis at the Council of Chalcedon: The Civic Aspect]Вестник Волгоградского государственного университета. Серия 4, История. Регионоведение. Международные отношения,  2022Introduction. The subject of research in this paper refers to the imperial edict, conferring the ... more Introduction. The subject of research in this paper refers to the imperial edict, conferring the title of metropolis on the city of Nicaea in 364 AD, and the imperial rescript of the same year, confirming the rights of Nicomedia to the same title and the status of the first city of the province. The documents were presented by bishops of Nicaea and Nicomedia in the course of litigation between them at the 4 th Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon (451 AD). The objectives of this work are to present the translation of these documents and substantiate its correctness in comparison with other available translations into foreign languages. Further task is to identify and highlight through commenting those realities of the Roman world, which are reflected in the analyzed documents. Methods. The work is based on the application of the historical-critical method of analysing source data of the original texts, compiled in Greek. Analysis. The article deals with the dating of the documents, the peculiarities of the terms and expressions used in them, which regard to intercity relations in Roman times, the issue of city statuses and traditional elements of the provincial ceremonies associated with the imperial cult. In this context, special attention is given to the edict for Nicaea, which is dedicated to the metropolis status of Nicaea, and deals with peculiar ceremonial issues of "coronation", "procession", and the office of Bithyniarch. Results. The litigation between Nicaea and Nicomedia is a clear evidence of the preservation of ancient Hellenistic and Roman traditions in the era of the Christian empire. The fact that the bishop of Nicaea at the Ecumenical Council, in justifying the ecclesiastical and administrative rights of his city, resorted to arguments drawn from the sphere of intercity relations within the framework of the traditional provincial assemblies, speaks for the connection between the institutions of provincial assemblies and church councils. The author concludes that the traditional forms of urban life, intercity relations within the province and determination of the status of cities by traditional criteria were of key importance for the position of the city in the system of the provincial church hierarchy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Проблема рукоположения мирян как пример «межведомственного» конфликта и взаимодействия в папских посланиях конца IV – начала V вв. [The Issue of Lay Ordination as an Example of “Interdepartmental” Conflict and Interaction in the Papal Letters of the Late 4th — Early 5th Centuries]Византийский временник,  2022The article is devoted to the study of a number of canonical decrees, as well as recommendations ... more The article is devoted to the study of a number of canonical decrees, as well as recommendations contained in papal letters, regarding the ordination of laymen who enter the church clergy after the end of their career as a municipal or state servants. According to the orders of Popes Siricius, Innocent, Zosimus and Celestine, based on older conciliar decrees, the laity were not to enter directly into the office of bishop, but had to first undergo repentance and begin service in the Church from lower positions. Among such laymen, the popes include both those who had been in the military or civil service of the emperor, and those who had occupied the highest posts in the municipal service. Particular attention in the papal letters is given to those who had held the office of priest (sacerdos) — the city or provincial head of the imperial cult. The occupation of all these positions, according to the popes, entailed the commission of sins and the neglect of Christian rites. At the same time, it turns out from the papal letters that the practice of appointing bishops from among highranking retirees was very common and did not contradict the city customs of appointing citizens who had reached certain heights in other branches of service to ritual positions. This, in turn, testifies to the close interaction of different branches and levels of municipal and state power, part of which, in the period of late antiquity, church power also becomes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Кризис авторитета Римской Церкви в понтификаты Зосима (417–418) и Бонифация (418–422) [Reputation Crisis of the Roman Church in the Pontificates of Zosimus (417–418) and Boniface (418–422)]Vizantiiskii vremennik,  2021The article is dedicated to the study of different aspects of the history of the Roman Church in ... more The article is dedicated to the study of different aspects of the history of the Roman Church in the pontificates of Zosimus (417–418) and Boniface (418–422). The research is mainly based on the study of the papal correspondence, acts of the Church councils and imperial legal documents. The article analyzes the key events of the two pontificates, as they are presented in the surviving sources. First of all, this concerns the vicissitudes of the case of Pelagius and Coelestius, the attempts to assert papal primacy through the falsified Nicene canons and the actions of the emperor in relation to the «divine matters», both related to the doctrine and to personnel issues within the ecclesial hierarchy. The last aspect is considered on the example of the participation of the emperor in the decisions concerning succession to the Roman see after Zosimus’ death. According to the observations of the author, during the period under review there is an obvious crisis of the authority of the papacy: in the case of Pelagius and Coelestius, Pope Zosimus was forced to obey the will of the emperor, who supported the position of the African Churches against the position of the Church of Rome, the falsified canons of the First Ecumenical Council in Nicaea promoted by the papacy were publicly rejected by the Carthage Council of 419, which recognized the authority of the Eastern Churches in the matter of preserving the authentic Nicene tradition, and the issue of the succession to the Roman see proved to be entirely within the competence of the emperor. Thus, the author draws a conclusion about the decisive role of the emperor in resolving internal church conflicts, defining church doctrine and deciding about the succession to the key church sees, as well as an authority crisis of the pope, forced to obey both imperial orders and conciliar decisions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The article shows how the state-political interests in Southern Gaul were realized through the intervention in the Gallic affairs of the Pope, who at the same time tried to strengthen his authority among the Churches outside the area of his jurisdiction.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Despite multiple references to the proposed topic in the scholarly literature, it still seems relevant to identify and consistently describe the entire set of measures taken at the Council of Chalcedon in order to raise the status of the see of Constantinople. Methods. The work is based on the application of the historicalcritical method of analysing source data of the original text, compiled in Greek and Latin. Analysis. The article consistently describes and analyses the church-political steps and actions taken during the conciliar meetings, which paved the way for the elevation (“addition to honour”) of the see of Constantinople, which took place during the 17th conciliar act. These measures included the corroboration of the status of the Council of Constantinople in 381 as the Second Ecumenical Council, the use of the ecclesiastical and political actions of the see of Constantinople in the previous period as court of appeal and “superprovincial” instance as precedents, as well as a demonstration of the equal status of the Archbishop of Constantinople in relation to his Roman counterpart. The result was the adoption of the so-called 28th canon and its approval by the officials presiding at the council, and then by the emperor Marcian himself. Results. The author concludes that the actions taken by the officials, who were presiding at the council, and the representatives of the Church of Constantinople during the council were planned and consistently aimed at establishing the equal honour of the see of Constantinople in relation to the see of Rome and its second place in regard to the latter. He also points to certain similarities in the process of elevation of both sees.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Вопрос делегирования полномочий в послании папы Иннокентия I к Руфу Фессалоникскому  [The Issue of Delegating Prerogatives in the Letter of Pope Innocent I to Rufus of Thessalonica]Вестник ПСТГУ. Серия I: Богословие. Философия. Религиоведение. № 97,  2021The article analyses the letter of Pope Innocent I (402–417) to the Bishop of Thessalonica Rufus,... more The article analyses the letter of Pope Innocent I (402–417) to the Bishop of Thessalonica Rufus, sent in 412 and preserved as part of the so-called Collectio Thessalonicensis — a collection of papal letters to Illyrian bishops from the 4th–5th centuries. The letter was a document by which the pope gave to the bishop of Thessalonica the prerogatives to adjudicate ecclesiastical matters in Eastern Illyricum. The objective of the article is to study and clarify the composition and nature of these prerogatives, as well as the legal grounds, which allowed the Pope to believe that he possessed the power to delegate them. Innocent invests Rufus of Thessalonica with the right to consider appeals from the provincial churches “in pope’s place” (vice), which was the fact that gave researchers the reason to claim that Innocent, in fact, created a “papal vicariate” of Thessalonica. Innocent also prescribed to Rufus jurisdictional boundaries and the procedure for considering “church affairs” within them. The article discusses which canonical and state-administrative decrees could enable the Roman bishop to believe that he possessed full ecclesiastical power, and how this attitude influenced the composition and nature of the prerogatives delegated to the bishop of Thessalonica. The popes’ idea that they possessed the fullness of power within the Church, by virtue of which they could delegate prerogatives to the lower (in their opinion) levels of church administration, is compared with the Roman state-legal system, within which the emperor had full power and delegated his judicial and administrative prerogatives to imperial officials, which were designated by the term vice sacra iudicantes. The author concludes that the Pope acted within the same logic. In the meantime, not all of the civilian officials vice sacra iudicantes were vicars. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to apply either to the bishop of Thessalonica the title of “papal vicar”, which is not attested  in the sources, or the name of “papal vicariate” to the churches of Eastern Illyricum.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Jahrhunderts im Hintergrund der Kirchenpolitik Justinians zu schildern. Die Mission im eigentlichen Sinne (d.h. die Außenmission) stellt dabei nur die Mission des Priesters Julianos zu den Nobaden dar, wobei die Mission Johannes von Ephesus als «innere Mission» zu bezeichnen ist. Bei der Beschreibung der letztgenannten Mission wird allein ihre konfessionelle Ausrichtung hervorgehoben: trotz seiner monophysitischen Überzeugungen taufte Johannes die kleinasiatischen Heiden im Sinne des chalkedonischen Glaubens. In Bezug auf die Missionierung Nubiens von seiten des Priesters Julianos und seines Nachfolgers Longinos Ende der 60-er Jahre werden die Umstände ihrer Tätigkeit analysiert, wie diese Ephesus finden. Unter Heranziehung anderer, weniger umfangreicher Quellen wird relative Unzuverlässigkeit der Angaben Johannes' im Teile seiner Geschichte nachgewiesen, der den Vollzug und Erfolg des ganzen Unternehmens allein der Kaiserin Theodora zuschreibt. Im Aufsatz wird ein* Versuch unternommen, zu beweisen, daß die Initiative für die Mission in Nubien vielmehr von Kaiser Justinian ausging und von ihm vorbereitet worden war. In der Abteilung II werden die Umstände der Tätigkeit Jakob Baradai beschrieben. Zuallererst wird gezeigt, daß die monophysitische Tradition, welche die Ordination Jakobs dem Theodosios von Alexandrien zuschreibt, nicht verläßlich ist. Vermutlich fand seine Ordination unter Beteiligung nicht-monophysitischer Bischöfe statt. Es wird auch mangelnde Glaubwürdigkeit der Angaben der monophysitischen Viten von Jakob festgestellt und die Tatsache hervorgehoben, daß seine Tätigkeit vom kaiserlichen Hof aus kontrolliert und gelenkt wurde.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These epistles are of interest from the point of view of the church-administrative model, which for various reasons was promoted by these popes in the aforementioned churches. The use of this model is seen as a concrete practical expression of a certain stage in the development of the concept of papal primacy of power, which was based on the idea of   the exclusive “apostolic” status of the Roman see. In fact, it was about the creation of special ecclesiastical and administrative districts, vertically integrated with the Roman see, in which the popes assumed a modifi cation of the system of administration, providing for the emergence of the fi gure of the bishop-primate at the “superprovincial” level, and for the special jurisdiction of this bishop. In relation to each of the regions, this model had some peculiarities, expressed in the way of functioning of the synodal institutions, the role and place of the metropolitans, and the relationship of the primate with the Roman see.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since his rival Eulalius had been initially approved as a legitimate bishop by Emperor Honorius (395–423), Boniface had to go through a complicated procedure of legitimation, whose decisive factor was the position of the emperor. The article examines the role of institutional factors in the legitimisation of church authority, in this case in relation to the See of Rome. By institutional factors the author means, first of all, state power represented by its regional and central authorities and the community of bishops united by the principle of conciliar functioning. The article examines the approaches of the imperial power to resolving the crisis of legitimacy of the Roman bishop. Based on the presentation of source data, it is demonstrated that Emperor Honorius intended to resolve the crisis through a deliberation by a council that was to include representatives of both prefectures of the Western Roman Empire. Despite his initial intention, the emperor was forced to resolve the crisis on his own and Boniface was confirmed as bishop of Rome by his personal decision. The author of the article draws a conclusion that the decisive role in the sphere of church administration belonged to the emperor and that the Roman bishop did not have an exceptional position among the bishops of the Western Roman Empire: the affairs of the See of Rome could be transferred by order of the emperor to the court of Western bishops, and the right of the final decision belonged to the emperor himself. Thus, the latter used the conciliar principle of administrating the church as a possible instrument for resolving internal church conflicts, but he also reserved the right of taking his own independent decisions in the ecclesial sphere, and the See of Rome was not an exception.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ein zentraler Lehrsatz des Konzils, dass in der Person Christi die göttliche und die menschliche Natur ‚unvermischt‘ und ‚unzertrennlich‘ vereinigt seien, bedeutete die endgültige Verurteilung der monophysitischen Lehre. Seitdem war die Bevölkerung des Imperium Romanum in Anhänger und in Gegner des Konzils von Chalkedon gespalten – die sogenannten Antichalkedonier, welche die größte religiöse Gruppierung im oströmischen Reich des 5.–6. Jahrhunderts ausmachten. Für Kaiser Justinian, wie für manchen seiner Vorgänger auf dem Kaiserthron von Konstantinopel, war daher ein wichtiges Anliegen seiner Kirchenpolitik, die religiöse Spaltung des Reiches durch theologische Vermittlung zu überwinden.

Проблема апелляций к римской кафедре в письмах блж.

This case is a vivid example of an ecclesiastical conflict, for the elimination of which various ecclesiastical legal mechanisms were involved — the court of local bishops, a conciliar verdict and a retrial of the case as a result of the intervention of the Bishop of Rome. In general, it has many similarities with the famous case of presbyter Apiarius and unfolds in the same years. The article examines the course of the case, especially its aspect related to Antoninus’ appeal to Pope Boniface. This appeal resulted in Antoninus’ case being retried in Numidia, and the report being sent to Boniface’s successor, Pope Celestine. The author of the article explores the degree of involvement of the Roman see in these events, given by the letters of Augustine, which help to better understand the policy of the popes during this period, what legal grounds there were for the intervention of the pope in this African affair, and how this intervention was perceived by the Numidian bishops. The author comes to the conclusion that, according to indirect evidence, the investigation of the case of Antoninus after the intervention of Pope Boniface was based on the 7th canon of the Council of Serdica and therefore this case can be considered as one of the rarest documented cases when this canon could actually be applied. The case of Antoninus was also, among other things, the basis for the Council of Carthage in 424 to send the famous letter Optaremus to Pope Celestine. The article is accompanied by a commented translation of both letters of Augustine into Russian.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Спор Никеи и Никомидии на Халкидонском соборе за статус митрополии: гражданский аспект [The Dispute Between Nicaea and Nicomedia over the Status of Metropolis at the Council of Chalcedon: The Civic Aspect]Вестник Волгоградского государственного университета. Серия 4, История. Регионоведение. Международные отношения,  2022Introduction. The subject of research in this paper refers to the imperial edict, conferring the ... more Introduction. The subject of research in this paper refers to the imperial edict, conferring the title of metropolis on the city of Nicaea in 364 AD, and the imperial rescript of the same year, confirming the rights of Nicomedia to the same title and the status of the first city of the province. The documents were presented by bishops of Nicaea and Nicomedia in the course of litigation between them at the 4 th Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon (451 AD). The objectives of this work are to present the translation of these documents and substantiate its correctness in comparison with other available translations into foreign languages. Further task is to identify and highlight through commenting those realities of the Roman world, which are reflected in the analyzed documents. Methods. The work is based on the application of the historical-critical method of analysing source data of the original texts, compiled in Greek. Analysis. The article deals with the dating of the documents, the peculiarities of the terms and expressions used in them, which regard to intercity relations in Roman times, the issue of city statuses and traditional elements of the provincial ceremonies associated with the imperial cult. In this context, special attention is given to the edict for Nicaea, which is dedicated to the metropolis status of Nicaea, and deals with peculiar ceremonial issues of "coronation", "procession", and the office of Bithyniarch. Results. The litigation between Nicaea and Nicomedia is a clear evidence of the preservation of ancient Hellenistic and Roman traditions in the era of the Christian empire. The fact that the bishop of Nicaea at the Ecumenical Council, in justifying the ecclesiastical and administrative rights of his city, resorted to arguments drawn from the sphere of intercity relations within the framework of the traditional provincial assemblies, speaks for the connection between the institutions of provincial assemblies and church councils. The author concludes that the traditional forms of urban life, intercity relations within the province and determination of the status of cities by traditional criteria were of key importance for the position of the city in the system of the provincial church hierarchy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

According to the orders of Popes Siricius, Innocent, Zosimus and Celestine, based on older conciliar decrees, the laity were not to enter directly into the office of bishop, but had to first undergo repentance and begin service in the Church from lower positions. Among such laymen, the popes include both those who had been in the military or civil service of the emperor, and those who had occupied the highest posts in the municipal service. Particular attention in the papal letters is given to those who had held the office of priest (sacerdos) — the city or provincial head of the imperial cult. The occupation of all these positions, according to the popes, entailed the commission of sins and the neglect of Christian rites. At the same time, it turns out from the papal letters that the practice of appointing bishops from among highranking retirees was very common and did not contradict the city customs of appointing citizens who had reached certain heights in other branches of service to ritual positions. This, in turn, testifies to the close interaction of different branches and levels of municipal and state power, part of which, in the period of late antiquity, church power also becomes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Кризис авторитета Римской Церкви в понтификаты Зосима (417–418) и Бонифация (418–422) [Reputation Crisis of the Roman Church in the Pontificates of Zosimus (417–418) and Boniface (418–422)]Vizantiiskii vremennik,  2021The article is dedicated to the study of different aspects of the history of the Roman Church in ... more The article is dedicated to the study of different aspects of the history of the Roman Church in the pontificates of Zosimus (417–418) and Boniface (418–422). The research is mainly based on the study of the papal correspondence, acts of the Church councils and imperial legal documents. The article analyzes the key events of the two pontificates, as they are presented in the surviving sources. First of all, this concerns the vicissitudes of the case of Pelagius and Coelestius, the attempts to assert papal primacy through the falsified Nicene canons and the actions of the emperor in relation to the «divine matters», both related to the doctrine and to personnel issues within the ecclesial hierarchy. The last aspect is considered on the example of the participation of the emperor in the decisions concerning succession to the Roman see after Zosimus’ death. According to the observations of the author, during the period under review there is an obvious crisis of the authority of the papacy: in the case of Pelagius and Coelestius, Pope Zosimus was forced to obey the will of the emperor, who supported the position of the African Churches against the position of the Church of Rome, the falsified canons of the First Ecumenical Council in Nicaea promoted by the papacy were publicly rejected by the Carthage Council of 419, which recognized the authority of the Eastern Churches in the matter of preserving the authentic Nicene tradition, and the issue of the succession to the Roman see proved to be entirely within the competence of the emperor. Thus, the author draws a conclusion about the decisive role of the emperor in resolving internal church conflicts, defining church doctrine and deciding about the succession to the key church sees, as well as an authority crisis of the pope, forced to obey both imperial orders and conciliar decisions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Despite multiple references to the proposed topic in the scholarly literature, it still seems relevant to identify and consistently describe the entire set of measures taken at the Council of Chalcedon in order to raise the status of the see of Constantinople. Methods. The work is based on the application of the historicalcritical method of analysing source data of the original text, compiled in Greek and Latin. Analysis. The article consistently describes and analyses the church-political steps and actions taken during the conciliar meetings, which paved the way for the elevation (“addition to honour”) of the see of Constantinople, which took place during the 17th conciliar act. These measures included the corroboration of the status of the Council of Constantinople in 381 as the Second Ecumenical Council, the use of the ecclesiastical and political actions of the see of Constantinople in the previous period as court of appeal and “superprovincial” instance as precedents, as well as a demonstration of the equal status of the Archbishop of Constantinople in relation to his Roman counterpart. The result was the adoption of the so-called 28th canon and its approval by the officials presiding at the council, and then by the emperor Marcian himself. Results. The author concludes that the actions taken by the officials, who were presiding at the council, and the representatives of the Church of Constantinople during the council were planned and consistently aimed at establishing the equal honour of the see of Constantinople in relation to the see of Rome and its second place in regard to the latter. He also points to certain similarities in the process of elevation of both sees.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Вопрос делегирования полномочий в послании папы Иннокентия I к Руфу Фессалоникскому  [The Issue of Delegating Prerogatives in the Letter of Pope Innocent I to Rufus of Thessalonica]Вестник ПСТГУ. Серия I: Богословие. Философия. Религиоведение. № 97,  2021The article analyses the letter of Pope Innocent I (402–417) to the Bishop of Thessalonica Rufus,... more The article analyses the letter of Pope Innocent I (402–417) to the Bishop of Thessalonica Rufus, sent in 412 and preserved as part of the so-called Collectio Thessalonicensis — a collection of papal letters to Illyrian bishops from the 4th–5th centuries. The letter was a document by which the pope gave to the bishop of Thessalonica the prerogatives to adjudicate ecclesiastical matters in Eastern Illyricum. The objective of the article is to study and clarify the composition and nature of these prerogatives, as well as the legal grounds, which allowed the Pope to believe that he possessed the power to delegate them. Innocent invests Rufus of Thessalonica with the right to consider appeals from the provincial churches “in pope’s place” (vice), which was the fact that gave researchers the reason to claim that Innocent, in fact, created a “papal vicariate” of Thessalonica. Innocent also prescribed to Rufus jurisdictional boundaries and the procedure for considering “church affairs” within them. The article discusses which canonical and state-administrative decrees could enable the Roman bishop to believe that he possessed full ecclesiastical power, and how this attitude influenced the composition and nature of the prerogatives delegated to the bishop of Thessalonica. The popes’ idea that they possessed the fullness of power within the Church, by virtue of which they could delegate prerogatives to the lower (in their opinion) levels of church administration, is compared with the Roman state-legal system, within which the emperor had full power and delegated his judicial and administrative prerogatives to imperial officials, which were designated by the term vice sacra iudicantes. The author concludes that the Pope acted within the same logic. In the meantime, not all of the civilian officials vice sacra iudicantes were vicars. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to apply either to the bishop of Thessalonica the title of “papal vicar”, which is not attested  in the sources, or the name of “papal vicariate” to the churches of Eastern Illyricum.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Jahrhunderts im Hintergrund der Kirchenpolitik Justinians zu schildern. Die Mission im eigentlichen Sinne (d.h. die Außenmission) stellt dabei nur die Mission des Priesters Julianos zu den Nobaden dar, wobei die Mission Johannes von Ephesus als «innere Mission» zu bezeichnen ist. Bei der Beschreibung der letztgenannten Mission wird allein ihre konfessionelle Ausrichtung hervorgehoben: trotz seiner monophysitischen Überzeugungen taufte Johannes die kleinasiatischen Heiden im Sinne des chalkedonischen Glaubens. In Bezug auf die Missionierung Nubiens von seiten des Priesters Julianos und seines Nachfolgers Longinos Ende der 60-er Jahre werden die Umstände ihrer Tätigkeit analysiert, wie diese Ephesus finden. Unter Heranziehung anderer, weniger umfangreicher Quellen wird relative Unzuverlässigkeit der Angaben Johannes' im Teile seiner Geschichte nachgewiesen, der den Vollzug und Erfolg des ganzen Unternehmens allein der Kaiserin Theodora zuschreibt. Im Aufsatz wird ein* Versuch unternommen, zu beweisen, daß die Initiative für die Mission in Nubien vielmehr von Kaiser Justinian ausging und von ihm vorbereitet worden war. In der Abteilung II werden die Umstände der Tätigkeit Jakob Baradai beschrieben. Zuallererst wird gezeigt, daß die monophysitische Tradition, welche die Ordination Jakobs dem Theodosios von Alexandrien zuschreibt, nicht verläßlich ist. Vermutlich fand seine Ordination unter Beteiligung nicht-monophysitischer Bischöfe statt. Es wird auch mangelnde Glaubwürdigkeit der Angaben der monophysitischen Viten von Jakob festgestellt und die Tatsache hervorgehoben, daß seine Tätigkeit vom kaiserlichen Hof aus kontrolliert und gelenkt wurde.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These epistles are of interest from the point of view of the church-administrative model, which for various reasons was promoted by these popes in the aforementioned churches. The use of this model is seen as a concrete practical expression of a certain stage in the development of the concept of papal primacy of power, which was based on the idea of   the exclusive “apostolic” status of the Roman see. In fact, it was about the creation of special ecclesiastical and administrative districts, vertically integrated with the Roman see, in which the popes assumed a modifi cation of the system of administration, providing for the emergence of the fi gure of the bishop-primate at the “superprovincial” level, and for the special jurisdiction of this bishop. In relation to each of the regions, this model had some peculiarities, expressed in the way of functioning of the synodal institutions, the role and place of the metropolitans, and the relationship of the primate with the Roman see.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since his rival Eulalius had been initially approved as a legitimate bishop by Emperor Honorius (395–423), Boniface had to go through a complicated procedure of legitimation, whose decisive factor was the position of the emperor. The article examines the role of institutional factors in the legitimisation of church authority, in this case in relation to the See of Rome. By institutional factors the author means, first of all, state power represented by its regional and central authorities and the community of bishops united by the principle of conciliar functioning. The article examines the approaches of the imperial power to resolving the crisis of legitimacy of the Roman bishop. Based on the presentation of source data, it is demonstrated that Emperor Honorius intended to resolve the crisis through a deliberation by a council that was to include representatives of both prefectures of the Western Roman Empire. Despite his initial intention, the emperor was forced to resolve the crisis on his own and Boniface was confirmed as bishop of Rome by his personal decision. The author of the article draws a conclusion that the decisive role in the sphere of church administration belonged to the emperor and that the Roman bishop did not have an exceptional position among the bishops of the Western Roman Empire: the affairs of the See of Rome could be transferred by order of the emperor to the court of Western bishops, and the right of the final decision belonged to the emperor himself. Thus, the latter used the conciliar principle of administrating the church as a possible instrument for resolving internal church conflicts, but he also reserved the right of taking his own independent decisions in the ecclesial sphere, and the See of Rome was not an exception.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

During the session the representatives of Stephanus, a metropolitan of Larissa in Greece, handed in petitions, which referred to that case, and, according to the acts, brought with them the Collectio itself. The article investigates the circumstances of the deposition by the Patriarch of Constantinople of the metropolitan Stephanus of Larissa, the Primate of the churches of Thessaly, the latter being a province of the Roman Empire located in the Prefecture of Illyricum. It also analyzes the content of the petitions of Stephanus and his comrades, as well as the statements contained in the acts, with the aim of demonstrating the perception by Stephanus’ suffragans of the Roman ecclesiology and the prerogatives of the See of Rome as the supreme judicial instance in the Church. The author concludes that those passages in the petitions, which speak about the pope’s exclusive rights of jurisdiction over all Churches, including the Illyrian ones, as well as the remark, made by the Bishop of Echinus Theodore, that preceded the presentation of the Collectio Thessalonicensis, are in all likelihood interpolated. The author revises the opinions regarding the origin of the Collectio from Thessalonica. As a result, he concludes that the materials presented during the sessions of 531 by Theodore of Echinus cannot originate either from Thessalonica or from the rest of Illyricum. The author postulates their Roman origin, and substantiates a thesis on the artificial compilation of the acts of 531 and the Collectio Thessalonicensis, that was carried out presumably during the pontificate of Nicholas I (858–867).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Т. 104,  2020The article investigates of Pope Innocent I’s views on the role and position of the Church of Rom... more The article investigates of Pope Innocent I’s views on the role and position of the Church of Rome in its relations with other churches of the Roman Empire both in the West and in the East. With this aim the extant letters of Innocent are being considered. First of all, the task of the article is to identify and analyze all passages containing the statements of this pope, which characterize his perception of St. Peter’s role as a supposed founder of the Church of Rome. This latter fact, according to Innocent, is a reason for a special position of the Church of Rome. Another reason is that the Roman Church serves for the churches of the West as a guarantor and transmitter of Nicene canons. In the statements of Innocent, in comparison with extant works of his predecessors, there is a number of innovations. Thus, he believes that Peter and his disciples personally founded all the churches of the West. However, it does not appear from his statements that Peter was the first bishop of Rome.Nevertheless, Innocent didn’t oppose the opinion that Peter was in some way inextricably linked with the Roman see and that an appeal to the latter turns out to be an appeal to the apostle. In the pontificate of Innocent it becomes obvious, that the contamination of Nicene and Sardican canons had been accomplished in Rome, that allowed Innocent to proclaim the right of the Roman Church to consider affairs of other churches — the right that he highly likely deduced from the interpolated Nicene canons. At the same it seems impossible to declare that Innocent, in terms of executing power, represented the idea of the Roman primacy among other churches of the Roman Empire, and that he implemented it in his political activities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The task of the authors of the article is to analyse the church-political actions of Pope Zosimus in the broad historical context of the early 5 th c. and to determine the degree of his independence in decision-making. The article analyses the measures of the Ravenna court to restore control over the region of Southern Gaul in the situation when the imperial administration lost this control as a result of mutinies and the arrival of barbarian tribes, as well as the role assigned to the Roman bishop in this process. In this context, the article investigates the events of the Roman Synod of September 417, at which church-political and church-administrative affairs related to Gaul and Africa were examined. There were considered two groups of cases, related to one another due to the involvement of same persons, who, in their turn, had been involved into ecclesiastical politics in Gaul during the usurpation of Constantine III. These persons, former bishop of Arles Heros, former bishop of Aquae Sextiae (Aix en Provence) Lazarus and bishop of Marseille Proculus, became subjects of conciliar condemnation. At the same time, within the framework of the same process, the Synod undertook the rehabilitation of Pelagius and Caelestius, who had previously been condemned by the African Synod and pope Innocent I (401-417). The latter circumstance actually implied the undermining of the authority of both Innocent and the papacy. The authors conclude that the agenda of the Synod was entirely dictated by state interests and aimed at eliminating the consequences of the usurpations in Southern Gaul and reintegrating this region into the administrative system of the Western Roman Empire.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to clarify the meaning of this term, the author has undertaken a study of the use of the term “exarch” as an indication of an archpriest. It turns out that already in the Byzantine period there was no exact understanding of what it meant, as it appeared from the contradictory opinions of the twelfth century canonists in regard to this subject. Another objective of this paper is to clarify the term “diocese” as applied to the church-administrative sphere. Further, the author makes an attempt to trace the reception of these Chalcedonian canons in the Byzantine church legislation. The conclusion is that the term “exarch of the diocese” should be understood in the context of the revision of a number of cases concerning the disputes of the metropolitans, in which the patriarch of Constantinople was involved, at the Council of Chalcedon. The analysis of these cases and of a number of canons of the first ecumenical councils is intended to illustrate the concept of the ecclesiastical head of the diocese, with the “diocese” turning out to be a state-administrative term. Subsequently, the term “exarch” was used in different church-administrative contexts in the period when the dioceses as state-administrative units had already ceased to exist. The term “patriarch of the diocese” repeatedly occurred in Justinian’s legislation, where it should be considered a parallel to the “exarch of a diocese” of the Chalcedonian canons. This legislation also provides the solution to the problem of the double jurisdiction of the cases against metropolitans.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Res divinae и res saeculares в восприятии папы Льва Великого: К предыстории возникновения геласианской теории [Res divinae and res saeculares in the Perception of Pope Leo the Great: On the Prehistory of the Gelasian Theory]Vestnik drevnei istorii. Vol. 80/4,  2020The article deals with two concepts present in the writings of Pope Leo the Great (440–461): ‘div... more The article deals with two concepts present in the writings of Pope Leo the Great (440–461): ‘divine matters’ (res divinae), which, according to the pope, belong to the Church and are managed by priests, and ‘secular matters’ (res saeculares), which fall under the authority of the Roman emperor. These concepts, the interpretation of which Leo was the first among the Roman pontiffs to provide, were later accepted by one of his successors, Gelasius I (492–496), and laid a foundation for a set of ideas, commonly known as the ‘Gelasian theory’, from which the medieval “two swords theory” evolved. The author discusses the time and political circumstances under which Pope Leo formulated his view on the distinction between ‘secular matters’ and ‘divine matters’. The need to point out the distinction between both spheres arose as a result of the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon in 449 and 451 convened by the Eastern emperors Theodosius II (407–450) and Marcianus (450–457), which were unacceptable to the papacy. Pope Leo made the first attempt in the history of the papacy to challenge the imperial decisions taken at these councils, arguing that the competence of the emperor mainly concerned ‘secular matters’, while ‘divine matters’ had a different quality and should be managed by ‘priests’ (sacerdotes). At the same time Pope Leo ignored the powers of the Roman emperor in sacris (in sacred matters), which the latter possessed as a guarantor and performer of public law. The pope’s attempt was not successful: by the end of his pontificate he fully agreed with the emperor’s leading role in ecclesiastical affairs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As an example, the author takes a litigation between the bishops of Tyre and Berytus from the Roman province Phoenicia Prima during the 4th Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon (451). While the bishop of Tyre was the ruling metropolitan of the province, the city of Berytus (modern Beirut) received in 449 or 450 the metropolitan status through the imperial decree. The bishop of the new metropolis, Eustathius, took control of the churches of six cities in the north of the province, which Metropolitan Photius of Tyre considered to be an uncanonical step and subsequently appealed to the emperor Marcian (450–457). The latter referred the matter to the Council, ordering that the dispute be resolved on the basis of church canons, and not state laws. As a result, the usurpation by the bishop of a newly created metropolis of ordination rights in the provincial cities was recognized noncanonical and the bishop of Berytus was instructed to be content only with the title of Metropolitan, while church administration remained in the hands of the Metropolitan of Tyre, the latter being the capital of the civil province. The example of litigation between Tyre and Berytus clearly illustrates the interaction of civil (imperial) and church jurisdictions in regulating the affairs of ecclesiastical administration and reveals at the same time the leading role of the emperor. This example is also important as an illustration of the mechanism of how generally binding church canons evolved from concrete cases.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Папа Сириций (384–399) и римская экклезиология в эпоху после окончания арианских споров [Pope Siricius (384–399) and Roman Ecclesiology During the Period After the End of Arian Controversy]Вестник ПСТГУ. Серия I: Богословие. Философия.

The article examines extant letters of the pope and analyses all the places in them which pertain to Siricius’ ecclesiological views. These are primarily expressed in his idea about the role of Apostle Peter as the founder of the “apostolic see” of Rome, the place of the Roman see as a guarantor of the Nicene canons and their translator for the churches of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the pope’s vision of the limits of power of the Roman bishop. Based on the analysis of Siricius’ letters, the article comes to the conclusion that the idea of the imperious position of the Roman see in regard to the Churches outside the Roman ecclesiastical area was alien for this pope. In relations with churches outside the suburbicarian provinces, the pope strictly adhered to the conciliar principle, addressing them by conciliar letters, in which auctoritas sedis apostolicae was expressed. In relation to the bishops of his area, he acted as primate and communicated with them on the basis of the principles stipulated by the 34th canon of the Holy Apostles. Siricius regarded the Roman see as having special authority, but this authority was expressed in the broadcast to other Churches of the canons adopted both in Rome and in the East. Siricius did not regard Rome as “the center of communion”. The Roman see, although it was considered to be founded by the apostle Peter, did not have special prerogatives of power. Siricius did not call St Peter fi rst bishop of Rome, he rather considered himself successor of his own predecessor Damasus (366–384) and only in the figurative sense “heir to the administration” (administrationis haeres) of St Peter. The connection of the Roman see with St Peter resulted in moral obligations of the Roman pontiff , rather than his prerogatives of power.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
