  Sheffield FC: 150 years of history(FIFA.com) Wednesday 24 October 2007  Print Email to a friend Thank you. Your FIFA.com story has been successfully e-mailed to your friend(s). English football supporters will proudly boast of having the
most senior football league in the world. A glance at the
birthdates of the country's current top flight clubs certainly
supports their unrivalled ancestry. Indeed, just one member of
Premier League's present 20-strong cast - Wigan Athletic - have
yet to celebrate their centenary year. 
The competition's current leaders Arsenal came into
existence in 1886, while its reigning champions Manchester United
were founded in 1878. However, this heavyweight pair have been
significantly outlasted by Sheffield FC, the oldest football club
in the world, which today celebrates its 150th anniversary.A remarkable milestone, such longevity represents a stunning
achievement for an outfit now competing in the eighth tier of the
English Football League system.Late-night dreamIn 1855, members of a local cricket club began to partake in
kick-arounds, which were enjoyable if somewhat chaotic due to the
absence of fixed regulations. These impromptu games continued over
the next couple of years, but it was not until May 1857 that this
pastime took on a more serious tone.William Prest and Nathaniel Creswick were cricket enthusiasts
but the sport had one conspicuous drawback: it was exclusively a
'summer' sport. The men desired a sport that, during the
'winter' months, would enable them to keep up their fitness
levels and quench their thirst for competition. Association
football, they decided over a lengthy, late-night chat, was the
answer.Henceforth, plans were drawn up to form a football club and on
24 October 1857, Sheffield FC was born - its headquarters located
in a potting shed and green house. Creswick was appointed captain
and secretary and he and Prest went about establishing a set of
rules that would allow for the activity's progression.It was an arduous task but based on other guidelines from
football and influences from other sports, they fine-tuned what
become known as 'Sheffield Rules'. When the English
Football Association was instituted in 1863, it adopted and
modified this code of conduct.Sheffield FC quickly became popular and matches between its
members, which took place between teams based on occupation, age or
marital status, began to stimulate interest within the local
community. Before long a number of teams in and around the
Sheffield area were formed. In fact, there were 15 by 1862,
including Hallam FC, with whom Sheffield FC share the oldest derby
in the world.PioneersSheffield FC have been behind a number of innovations over
the years. Besides their rules, which initiated the use of a solid
crossbar instead of rope, free-kicks, corners and overhead
throw-ins, they were also fathers of the aerial game, which was
unheard of in the south of the country until they travelled down to
the Oval to take on a London XI. The sight of their opponents
heading the ball provoked fits of hysteria from the London players,
but the next time they got together they spent their time
practicing the art which would become a trait of English
football.Sheffield FC also helped with the 1889 founding of Sheffield
United, who along with Sheffield Wednesday represent the city in
the 2007/08 Championship, the second tier of English football. As
for the Ancients, as they are sometimes known, they have since
tumbled from the heights of English football, failing to appear in
the FA Cup proper since the 1880s.
However, under the guidance of chairman Richard Tims,
Sheffield FC has undergone a recent resurgence. Financially, they
are in a more stable position than ever and they also own a ground
for the first time in their remarkable history. The team's
on-field fortunes have improved too, underlined by last
season's promotion into the Unibond League Division One South.
Undoubtedly, the evolution of this great sport owes much to
the English, whose disciples have spread football's popularity
from its infancy. There is, however, no doubting Sheffield's
founding role in this process.Incredibly, Sheffield FC were 30 years old when the inaugural
league got underway in England; 31 by the time Glaswegian Alexander
Hutton emigrated to Argentina and founded an English school and
then the Argentinian Football Association; 37 when Charles Miller
travelled from Southampton to Sao Paulo and began to popularise
football in Brazil; almost 50 when Blackburn-born Daniel Woolfall
became the second FIFA President; 65 when the old Wembley Stadium
was opened and 108 when England won the FIFA World Cup™.It is a testament to what a special club Sheffield FC is that, a
century-and-a-half on, they are still going strong.  Print Email to a friend Add your comment Thank you. Your FIFA.com story has been successfully e-mailed to your friend(s).
