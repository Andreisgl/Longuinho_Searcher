Here we document paleoceanographic conditions and the (in)stability of the Wilkes Land subglacial basin (East Antarctica) during the mid-Miocene (~17-13.4 million years ago) by studying sediment cores from offshore Adélie Coast. Inland retreat of the ice sheet, temperate vegetation, and warm oligotrophic waters characterise the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; 17-14.8 Ma). After the MCO, expansion of a marine-based ice sheet occurs, but remains sensitive to melting upon episodic warm water incursions. Our results suggest that the mid-Miocene latitudinal temperature gradient across the Southern Ocean never resembled that of the present day. We demonstrate that a strong coupling of oceanic climate and Antarctic continental conditions existed and that the Ea...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The objective was to obtain a long-term record of the Cenozoic Antarctic glaciation, including the greenhouse-icehouse transition, and its intimate relationships with global climatic and oceanographic change. Expedition 318 recovered ~2000 m of middle Eocene-Holocene sediments spanning ~53 million years of Antarctic history. The cores reveal the history of the Wilkes Land Antarctic margin from an ice-free &amp;quot;greenhouse&amp;quot; Antarctica, to the first cooling, to the onset and erosional consequences of the first glaciation and the subsequent dynamics of the waxing and waning ice sheets, all the way to thick, unprecedented &amp;quot;tree ring style&amp;quot; records with seasonal resolution of the last deglaciation that began ~10,000 y ago. The cores also reveal details of the tectonic history of the Australo-Antarctic Gulf from 53 Ma portraying the onset of the second phase of rifting between Australia and Antarctica, to ever subsiding margins and deepening, to the present continental and ever widening ocean/continent configuration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Late Quaternary climatic and productivity changes in the Sicily Channel (Central Mediterranean Sea)A 440 cm long sediment core (CS2001) collected in the Sicily Channel in 2001 (37°02.36´N; 13°09.1... more A 440 cm long sediment core (CS2001) collected in the Sicily Channel in 2001 (37°02.36´N; 13°09.10´E; 470m water depth) was analysed for geochemistry, organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts and alkenones to describe climatic and productivity changes preserved in the sedimentary record with a multi-proxy approach. Six 14C analyses were also performed, indicating that the core covers a time interval between 19000 and 900 cal. years BP. SSTs (Sea Surface Temperatures) derived from alkenone analyses display lower values (between 11°C and 15°C) in the late Pleistocene section. The transition to the Holocene is marked by a ca. 3°C increase, which leads to the highest SST values in the Early Holocene (up to 20°C between 10000 and 6000 cal. years BP). SSTs then gradually decrease to 16°C in the most recent part of the core. A Warm/Cold ratio derived from selected organic-walled dinocyst species matches this trend. Bulk geochemistry analyses indicate a sharp change in the carbonate/silicate ratio occurring at about 15000 cal. years BP. In addition, contemporaneous changes in other geochemical indexes suggest a major shift in sediment texture and provenance at that time. Using the geochemical Ba/Al ratio and the relative abundance of heterotrophic dinocysts as potential indicators for paleoproductivity, we identified two major increases between 16000 and 15000 cal. years BP and between 9500 and 6800 cal. years BP. The latter is synchronous with sapropel S1 deposition in the Mediterranean Sea.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
