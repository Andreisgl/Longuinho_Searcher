The leading proponents of these subversive ideas often sought to direct and regulate artistic production through various ways. In this context, Rudolf Steiner’s dynamic interaction with young artists who came to attend his lectures offers an interesting paradigm that stands in sharp contrast to other practices followed by more traditional scholarly simulated lectures. After 1907, by weaving together esoteric Christianity with Goethe’s colour theory and projecting them into an art historical narrative, Steiner denounced the mainstream theosophical doctrine, spread by Annie Besant, and was ready to express contemporary preoccupations regarding the importance of colour in the reinvention of artistic practice. Both a transmitter of ideas and an eclectic recipient of contemporary artistic discourses, Steiner urged young artists to engage with specific art-theory discourses and interfered in the artistic production by commissioning art works or by providing instructions for them.Download Free PDFView PDFTheosophical Appropriations: Esotericism, Kabbalah, and the Transformation of Traditions, edited by Julie Chajes and Boaz HussTheosophical Appropriations: Esotericism, Kabbalah, and the Transformation of Traditions, edited by Julie Chajes and Boaz Huss2016 • Boaz Huss, Julie ChajesTheosophical Appropriations Esotericism, Kabbalah and the Transformation of Traditions Editors: Julie Chajes, Boaz Huss The thirteen chapters of this volume examine intersections between theosophical thought and areas as diverse as the arts, literature, scholarship, politics, and, especially, modern interpretations of Judaism and kabbalah. Each chapter offers a case study in theosophical appropriations of a different type and in different context. The chapters join together to reveal congruencies between theosophical ideas and a wide range of contemporaneous intellectual, cultural, religious, and political currents. They demonstrate the far-reaching influence of the theosophical movement worldwide from the late-nineteenth century to the present day.

University of Amsterdam, 25-27 September 2013. Harald Szeemann (1933-2005) was one of the most prominent curators of his generation, having organized more than 150 art shows during a career that spanned almost 50 years. Far from being concerned only with contemporary art, he organically worked on a body of exhibitions characterized by a vivid interest for topics such as utopia, Gesamtkunstwerk, the history of intentions and obsessions, trying to build an European history of alternatives based on a multi-disciplinary approach and on the study of Art brut, psychoanalysis, pataphysics, religious devotion and, last but not least, Theosophy and Anthroposophy. In this context, a special role is played by his lifelong project of building a museum on Monte Verità, the hill in Ticino which hosted from the second part of the XIX century onwards different groups and colonies of anarchists, vegetarians, nudists, artists and life reformers. In my paper, I will address the role of Theosophy and Anthroposophy in Szeemann’s practice as a curator, as well as in his thinking about modern art, particularly focusing on the exhibitions in which he presented works by Rudolf Steiner, or had Theosophy as a central theme: the already mentioned Monte Verità (1978), Der Hang zum Gesamtkunstwerk (1983) andMoney&Value–The last taboo (2002), that represent mayor examples of mainstream temporary display of Theosophy-related material in the last decades. Special attention will be devoted also to the relationship and professional collaboration with Joseph Beuys, presented in 17 of Szeemann’s mayor exhibitions and considered by the curator to be the most important artist of the second half of the XX century, and to an unrealized project dated 1975, La Mamma, meant to focus on the idea of a feminine deity and to the body of women, which was supposed to present also the life and work of Helena Blavatsky and Annie Besant.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Greek Pavilion in the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.  New Perspectives for National Art in the Context of RegionalismPolina KosmadakiThis paper discusses the impact of the ideological trends of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne which took place in Paris, in 1937, on Greece's national participation in the exhibition. The modern artworks it showcased will serve as a case study to investigate notions of regionalism. The paper considers the conception and realisation of the Greek pavilion in association with the Exposition's affirmed focus on regionalism and examines the relation between nationalism and regionalism at that time. The Greek pavilion and its artists will also be discussed in regard to the local ideologies they expressed or contributed to generate. The aim of this paper is to highlight how, on the occasion of the 1937 exhibition, the Greek quest for a new form of national art – an authentic expression of "Greekness" able to overturn the European perception, which identified the "Greek" with the "classical" – converged or diverged from European regionalist and nationalist discourses as expressed by the exhibition's commissioner, as well as to draw attention to the paradoxes of this connection.Download Free PDFView PDFQuêtes de modernité(s) artistique(s) dans les Balkans au tournant du XXe siècleQUAND LE MIROIR DEVIENT LAMPION : ASPECTS DE LA RÉCEPTION DE L’OEUVRE TARDIVE DE NIKOLAUS GYSIS ENTRE ATHÈNES ET MUNICHSpyros PetritakisDownload Free PDFView PDF«  La  réception  du  symbolisme  en  Grèce  à  travers   l’œuvre  de  Costis  Parthénis  pendant  la  période  1900-1930  »Evgenios  MatthiopoulosDownload Free PDFView PDF'Theosophy and orientalism in the artistic legacy of Nikolay Raynov (1889-1954): A belated polymath and Theosophic “heresiarch”’Yuri Stoyanov, Marco PasiDownload Free PDFView PDF'Theosophy, Occultism and Greek Symbolism: the Case of Frixos Aristeus'Victoria FerentinouThe interrelation between Symbolism and occultism was often articulated in the work of Symbolist poets, artists and critics in the turn-of-the-century Greece. Theosophy, in particular, is documented as one of their primary interests. Theosophical ideas were popularized and disseminated in Greece as early as the 1890s through periodicals that sought to acquaint the Greek readership with the cultural developments in France, Germany and other European countries. Moreover, in 1894 the socialist politician, author and academic Plato Drakoulis (1858-1934), who knew Helena P. Blavatsky personally, published Light from Within, the first book in Greek to elaborate on the main ideas of Theosophy as expounded by Blavatsky and Anna B. Kingsford. Drakoulis’s work had an impact upon Greek Symbolists who became intrigued by Theosophical ideas. Yet their interest was usually disguised, infiltrated through or sidelined by other belief systems and forms of religiosity, specific to the Greek milieu of the time, so that Theosophical concepts were not organically embedded in the dominant artistic discourse in Greece. Within this context there were few visual artists associated with Symbolism, who were more receptive to occultism and used ideas drawn from Theosophy and other occult currents for their purposes. An illustrative example is the painter and illustrator Frixos Aristeus (Greek: Φρίξος Αριστεύς, 1879-1951). Aristeus developed a friendship with the Greek author Polyvios T. Dimitrakopoulos (1864-1922), alias Paul Arcas, who was interested, inter alia, in spiritualism and Theosophy. Aristeus himself openly admitted that he believed in a pantheistic world, that he often communicated with ‘supernatural’ entities, and that his images were inspired by his ‘otherworldly’ visions, thus pointing to the supersensible origin of his Symbolist art. The first objective of this paper is to sketch out the peculiarities and complexities of the dissemination and appropriation of Theosophy in Greece at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries and briefly discuss its interaction specifically with the visual arts. The second aim is to trace the Theosophical ideas permeated in the work of Aristeus and explore the ways he revised and integrated his often superficial and eclectic understanding of Theosophy and occultism into his oeuvre.Download Free PDFView PDFReginald W. Machell (1854-1927): Blavatsky's Child, British Symbolist, Theosophical ArtistMassimo IntrovigneReginald Willoughby Machell (1854–1927) was a promising young artist from a prominent family in North-West England when he was introduced to Madame Blavatsky in 1886. Machell joined the Theosophical Society, abandoned his academic style and decided to devote his life to creating didactical art aimed at illustrating Blavatsky's doctrines. When the Theosophical Society split after Blavatsky’s death, Machell sided with the American faction led by William Q. Judge and later by Katherine Tingley. In 1900, the artist moved to Lomaland, Tingley’s Theosophical colony in California, where he remained for the next 27 years of his life. He continued to paint Theosophical subjects and to write articles on the relationship between Theosophy and the arts. He also emerged as a successful wood carver and as a gifted teacher of younger Theosophical painters, who formed the so called Lomaland Art Colony. Best remembered for a single iconic Theosophical painting, The Path, Machell was extremely popular for several decades among alla branches of the Theosophical movement. At the same time, his almost exclusive focus on Theosophy led to his marginalization in wider artistic circles, although other teachers recruited by Tingley for the Lomaland art school, including Maurice Braun (1877–1941), eventually managed to be accepted by the American art establishment.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Historical Review/La Revue HistoriqueGounaris, B. & Christopoulos, M., Reassessing the Greek National Schism of World War I: The Ideological Parameters2018 • Marianna ChristopoulosThe National Schism that erupted in Greece during the First World War has already been thoroughly analyzed in the bibliography as a crisis of national unification, defined by geographical, political and socio-economic criteria. The aim of our paper is to move a step forward supporting that the National Schism might also be considered as an act of the broader and much older Greek ideological drama, that of the tantalising and incomplete “return” to the East via the European West. It is argued that the Schism, far from being a bipolar confrontation between supporters and opponents of Europe, did select from the East-West debate whatever arguments were necessary to invest military and political choices with a “deeper” meaning. Our approach focuses mostly on the rhetoric produced by the two opposing camps, Venizelists and the anti-Venizelist block, from 1914 up to 1922. It is, however, complemented by a retrospect presentation of the 19th - century debate over the Enlightenment and the Liberalism on the one hand and the German idealism on the other.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
