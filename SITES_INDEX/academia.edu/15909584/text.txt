Polypharmacy and the high risk of medication-related problems among older people are associated with adverse health consequences due to drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, and adverse drug effects. This study aims to assess the factors associated with polypharmacy and the high risk of medication-related problems among community-dwelling older people in the Netherlands, Greece, Croatia, Spain, United Kingdom.

Polypharmacy may lead to numerous adverse health effects, which become more prevalent when combined with biological changes in seniors. In this cross-sectional study, 500 Polish adults aged ≥60 years (M = 67.9 ± 4.2) were asked to complete a questionnaire via telephone calls, allowing us to identify sociodemographic and health-related factors influencing the daily medications consumption. Our findings revealed that all of the participants were receiving medications; 60.2% of them receive at least 1 to 3 drugs per day (301/500). The most commonly used medications included antihypertensive drugs and analgesics (51.0% and 46.0%, respectively). Taking into account clinical conditions, independent predictors of receiving over 3 medications per day turned out to be (1) coronary artery disease (OR = 6.77; CI 95%, 2.86–16.1), (2) diabetes (OR = 3.23, CI 95%, 1.75–5...Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of Clinical PharmacologyPolypharmacy: correlations with sex, age and drug regimen1998 • Lars BjerrumDownload Free PDFView PDFPolypharmacy among the elderly in the city of São Paulo, Brazil-SABE Study2012 • Yeda  DuarteDownload Free PDFView PDFBMC Clinical PharmacologyIncreasing polypharmacy - an individual-based study of the Swedish population 2005-20082010 • Göran Petersson, Bengt ÅstrandDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
