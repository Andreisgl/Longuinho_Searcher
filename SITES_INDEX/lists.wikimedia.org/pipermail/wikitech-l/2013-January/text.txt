...  Hi all,
 I've been taking a look at the SVN history[0], and it doesn't look like
 anything is actively using SVN anymore. Looking at the logs, it doesn't
 look like much of anything has been committed in the last few months
 that hasn't since been moved to Git (in Gerrit or elsewhere). This being
 said:
 I'm going to mark all of the MediaWiki SVN repository as read-only
 tomorrow, Jan. 25th.
 Note this won't make anything in SVN go away, as we're still committed
 to leaving the SVN repositories available in a read-only manner. This
 also doesn't prevent us from converting extensions or other code to
 Git if someone decides to resurrect a project. Finally, this does not
 affect the Wikimedia repository, which still has a couple of active
 projects.

This is now complete.
To remind everyone (I was already asked): this *does not*
affect pywikipedia or the wikimedia repository.
