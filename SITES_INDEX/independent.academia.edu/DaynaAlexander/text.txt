This study assessed prevalence and correlates of HTP awareness, ever use, and current use among US middle and high school students. Methods Data came from the 2019 and 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, a cross-sectional survey of US public and private, middle and high school students. HTP awareness, ever use, and current (past 30-day) use were assessed. Weighted prevalence estimates and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were assessed overall and by sex, school level, race/ethnicity, and current other tobacco product use. Results In 2019, 12.8% (3.44 million) of all students reported HTP awareness, increasing to 19.3% (5.29 million) in 2020 (p &lt; .01). Ever [2019: 2.6% (630 000); 2020: 2.4% (620 000)] and current [2019: 1.6% (420 000); 2020: 1.4% (370 000)] HTP use did not significantly change from 2019 to 2020.

Do the high‐protein recommendations for athletes set some on a path to kidney injury and dialysis?Seminars in Dialysis,  2021Athletes and fitness enthusiasts are often encouraged to follow high-protein diets to optimize mu... more Athletes and fitness enthusiasts are often encouraged to follow high-protein diets to optimize muscle protein synthesis, modify body composition, and enhance performance, yet the safety of these higher protein intakes has been debated. Many people with kidney dysfunction are unaware of their condition, and the potential harm of excess protein intake on the kidneys may not be adequately reported in the sports nutrition literature. Studies suggesting that high-protein intake may be associated with incident kidney disease have led the nephrology community to make conservative recommendations. In contrast, the fitness community suggests that high dietary protein intake is safe and poses no risk of kidney injury. These claims often fail to acknowledge limitations in the internal validity and generalizability of the study results, despite many studies not being adequately powered to support such claims. It is essential to make dietary recommendations that consider the totality of the data and follow the ethical norm of &quot;do no harm.&quot; Studies that evaluate the use of high-protein diets among athletes must consider the balance of efficacy with safety. While an intervention may be safe in one population, it does not mean that safety can be assumed for all groups.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Purpose: This article describes an intervention among 2 groups—a program group and an information group (intervention and comparison)—that assessed cardiovascular risk factor knowledge among African American women. Methods: The Coronary Heart Disease Knowledge Test was administered to participants prior to study participation. Participants (N = 345) aged 34–66 self-selected into either the intervention group (n = 166) or the comparison group (n = 179). Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to assess participant characteristics and determine whether changes occurred in participants’ knowledge. Results: Data analysis indicated no significant differences between the groups regarding knowledge; however, significant differences appeared between pre- and posttest scores over time. The 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA indicated differences based on education. Discussion: Results suggest that intervention duration should be longer to ensure that participants understand cardiovascular risk factors. Future research could assess African American women’s current cardiovascular preventative practices and add a qualitative component to provide context on knowledge and actions. Translation to Health Education Practice: Results confirm the need for culturally tailored, gender-specific programming to help close awareness and knowledge gaps.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Semistructured interviews (n = 16) were conducted with pharmacy staff at 3 community pharmacies in 2 Eastern states. The interview guide elicited pharmacy staff experiences interacting with children and their perceived barriers and facilitators to providing medication counseling. Transcripts were reviewed for accuracy and a codebook was developed for data analysis. NVivo 10 was used for content analysis and identifying relevant themes. Ten pharmacists and 6 pharmacy technicians were interviewed. Most participants were female (69%), aged 30 to 49 years (56%), with ≥5 years of pharmacy practice experience. Eight themes emerged as barriers to pharmacists&#39; engaging children in medication counseling, the most prevalent being the child&#39;s absence during medication pickup, the child appearing to be distracted or unintere...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One strategy for preventing childhood obesity is helping caregivers to recognize their child is overweight or obese. The purpose of this study is to assess African American caregivers&#39; perceived level of their child&#39;s obesity status and concordance between caregiver&#39;s reported height and weight of their children compared to the objective measure of their child&#39;s height and weight. Caregivers completed a paper-based survey about perceptions of their child&#39;s weight status including body silhouettes (n = 119) and self-reported their child&#39;s body mass index status (n = 68). Children&#39;s (n = 71) height and weight were objectively measured. Spearman rho and independent sample t tests were calculated to assess the relationship between caregiver&#39;s self-reported and objective BMI status.

The objective of this study was to examine whether the IMB model predicted medication adherence among vasculitis patients. Adult vasculitis patients (n=228) completed online questionnaires at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Linear regressions were calculated to determine the direct effects of information and motivation on medication adherence (P&lt;0.05). A mediation analysis using a bootstrapping approach was used to test whether behavioral skills significantly mediated the effect of information and motivation on medication adherence. Participants reported high levels of information (M=4.0; standard deviation [SD]=0.68), moderate levels of motivation (M=2.7; SD=1.00), and high levels of behavioral skills (M=4.1; SD=0.74).

School nurses recruited a convenience sample of 25 children with asthma (ages 7-17) and assessed their inhaler technique. Children then watched a tailored video that provided: (1) step-by-step feedback on which steps (out of 8) they performed correctly, (2) praise for correctly-performed steps, and (3) statements about why incorrectly-performed steps are important. Nurses reassessed the child&#39;s inhaler technique immediately after watching the video and again 1month later. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests were calculated to assess whether children&#39;s technique significantly improved from baseline to post-video and baseline to 1-month follow-up.
