The papers... more This is an edited collection of research studies in education that work with Bourdieu. The papers in a rich variety of ways implicitly, and sometimes explicitly,  make the case for a Bourdieusian analysis of education. The vital lesson from Bourdieu’s scholarship they all adopt, through one means or another,  is that empirical research can be a powerful tool for breaking through the taken-for-granted, everyday assumptions about the purposes and practices of education. At the core of all these papers is the attempt to achieve a truer knowledge of how education works, the ways power operates in and through the educational system, and whose interests it serves. Despite doing this in very different ways, and drawing on diverse aspects of Bourdieu’s conceptual framework, what they all clearly illustrate is that  Bourdieu is extremely useful for thinking with.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It reveals how we have ended up with an educational system that still educatesthe different social classes in fundamentally different ways, and vitally - what we can do to achieve a fairer system.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is known to favor middle class people. But what of those middle classes deliberately choosing ordinary and even 'low performing' secondary schools for their children? What are their motives, and how do they experience the choice? What is it like for the young people themselves? Where do they end up? And what does all this show us about contemporary white middle class identity and its formation? This  study offers some answers to these questions. Based on detailed fieldwork with parents and children, it examines 'against-the-grain' school choices, looking in particular at family history, locality, the nature of 'choice' itself and associated anxieties, relationships to other ethnic groups and to whiteness, and the implications for democracy. The book highlights an inescapable acquisitiveness but also more hopeful dimensions of contemporary white middle class identity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on a large-scale study involving 500 applicants to university, it makes extensive use of quantitative and qualitative data in order to analyse the complex process whereby students across class, gender ethnicity and age move into higher education. It provides a succinct analysis of the current paradoxical situation in the UK, where mass participation in higher education has seen the class `gap' widening rather than shrinking, producing a system which is `neither equal nor common for all'Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It demonstrates how class is played out in the educational work and support that is primarily the province of women. It is based on a substantive ethnographic study of two London primary schools and focuses on mothers of year five children. Developing a feminist reworking of Pierre Bourdieu's social theory, the book argues for a more sophisticated understanding of social class, one that recognises difference and diversity within social classes as well as between them.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Educational inequality is not one thing but an intricate and complicated amalgam of many different factors. The dominant political view regarding education is one that accepts the efficacy of the market, and does not question the consequences of the preoccupation with performativity and outcomes for learning processes and pedagogy (Warmington, 2015). Furthermore, there has been a general endorsement rather than challenge of social mobility as the main mechanism of social justice in education, an acceptance of private schools, and an influential movement within the discipline that promotes the notion of knowledge as power rather than any strong concern with analysing and understanding the workings of power within education. I will focus on all these trends and their consequences for educational inequalities, taking a multi-disciplinary approach that brings together insights from sociology and psychology as well as education. However, first I will examine the issue of measurement in relation to educational inequalities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the one hand the work was criticised for its determinism and pessimistic prognosis of the possibilities of educational change and, on the other hand, praised for its complex analysis of the relationship between education and class inequalities, and the workings of class domination through the educational system. This paper explores the reception Reproduction, and its companion text The Inheritors received before examining the contribution they have made, and continue to make, to understandings of social class inequalities in education. It argues that the work has continuing significance in contemporary England just as it had in 1960s France. As well as examining the relevance of Reproduction for the twenty-first century, it also focuses on the potential of Bourdieu and Passeron's analysis for enabling animated and agentic conceptualisations of educational and social reproduction by drawing on recent case-study data from English schools. However, it also argues that the lack of sufficient questioning of the dominant educational code, as well as the absence of any moral dimensions of class culture make their study a work in progress which needed the insights of Bourdieu's later work to bring its analysis to fruition.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It draws on ethnographic research in schools over a twenty-five year period to illustrate the damage the illusion of meritocracy inflicts on children and young people, but particularly those from working class backgrounds. It argues that the consequences of the pretence of meritocracy are to be found in everyday practices of testing, hyper-competition and setting, and beyond the classroom in the designation of predominantly working class schools as 'rubbish schools for rubbish learners'. It concludes that, beyond the negative consequences for working class learners, there are wider consequences for British society, exacerbating social divisions and encouraging the growth of distrust, prejudice, envy, resentment, and contempt between different social groups.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

My academic career spans over twenty-five years taking the work of Pierre Bourdieu to the limit. Taking Bourdieu's work to the limits is to engage with his research affectively as well as intellectually, to recognise our own social and academic positioning in the same powerful way he recognised and worked with his own autobiography (Bourdieu, 2007). It also requires the deconstruction and reconstruction of his concepts in relation to our own distinct experiences. In this article I attempt to tease out the many different and antagonistic embodiments of the relationship between a habitus and a field, taking myself as a case study. I am going to focus on two fields: the working-class coal-mining community of my childhood and youth, and the educational system.

Bourdieu... more This paper examines the relationship of working-class feminist academics to the Academy. Bourdieu (1990: 155) argues that 'resistance can be alienating and submission liberating such is the paradox of the dominated and there is no way out of it'. Our paper interrogates this tension between resistance and submission from the perspective of four educationally successful working-class women who have become academics. The paper starts with an overview of the state of the Academy at the beginning of the 21 st century before addressing the conundrum articulated in earlier work by one of us (Reay 1997) that, for women from working-class backgrounds, success is often configured as, or feels like, failure. Building on this earlier work, the paper develops and reflects on four central themes: the dilemmas of belonging within higher education, the challenge of continuing class exclusions, the oppressive and exploitative class relations that remain and are rarely recognized or addressed, and finally the difficulties around sustaining 'authentic' and meaningful relationships with the still working-class. We conclude with questions and suggestions about what possibilities exist for those of us who grew up working-class to put into practice Bourdieu's injunction to be organic intellectuals.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Transitions of workingclass young people in England are beset with competition,individualism and low expectations. Employing PierreBourdieu’s concepts of habitus, capital and field, the articleargues that working class transitions to university revealthe failure of the English educational system toprovide anything like a level playing field to support workingclass young people who are seen to be educationalsuccesses. Focusing on those working class young peoplewho are particularly successful by gaining access to eliteuniversities the paper argues that even this small selectgroup face discrimination, set‐backs, and a degree of socialexclusion.

In this paper I briefly explore both the history of those relationships and representations of the working classes within dominant discourses, before moving on to outline some of the consequences of contemporary educational policy for working-class subjectivities. I do this by drawing on data from three research projects: one on higher education choice; one on transitions to secondary schooling; and a third on assessment in primary schools. However, working-class relationships to education cannot be understood in isolation from middle-class subjectivities so I also try to begin to map out some of the unconscious aspects of class that implicate both middle- and working-class subjectivities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The first is located within critical sociological studies of youth identity, drawing upon the notion of the often silenced voices of the marginalised,“Othered” or subordinated as a means of exposing oppressive power relations. The paper outlines an alternative theorisation of student voice we call, following Bernstein, the sociology of pedagogic voice.

The problematization of agency in postmodern theory: as feminist educational researchers, where do we go from here?by Louise  Archer, Heather Mendick, B.

The views of the two invited speakers, who raised concerns about the impact of post-modernism on political projects, are reported. The content of the general discussion around subjectivity, agency and structure are then set out. The group struggled with the possibilities and limitations of theory in these areas. In discussing how feminist theory might be taken forward, the group stressed the centrality and necessity of collectivities as enabling resistance and other expressions of agency. The group felt that further exploration and analysis of the notion of and feelings of selfhood are necessary to adequately conceptualize individual and collective agency, and the way in which structure inflects such agency and collectivities. Such work would also need to attend to issues of 'difference' such as social class and ethnicity, and to the emotional and/or psychic dimension involved in our construction of agency and selfhood.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It looks at class identity, the inadequate sticking plaster of social mobility, and the effects of wider economic and social class relationships on working class educational experiences. The book addresses the urgent question of why the working classes are still faring so much worse than the upper and middle classes in education. It reveals how we have ended up with an educational system that still educates the different social classes in fundamentally different ways, and vitally-what we can do to achieve a fairer system.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It first looks at the range of goals different countries have pursued in relation to education. It then focuses more closely on policies in a range of European countries, that have inhibited or enabled greater educational equality, with a specific focus on England as a negative case study of what to avoid when pursuing greater educational equality. It concludes by drawing lessons from abroad to inform debates in Ireland around how to achieve greater social justice in education.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the one hand the work was criticised for its determinism and pessimistic prognosis of the possibilities of educational change and, on the other hand, praised for its complex analysis of the relationship between education and class inequalities, and the workings of class domination through the educational system. This paper explores the reception Reproduction, and its companion text The Inheritors received before examining the contribution they have made, and continue to make, to understandings of social class inequalities in education. It argues that the work has continuing significance in contemporary England just as it had in 1960s France. As well as examining the relevance of Reproduction for the twenty-first century, it also focuses on the potential of Bourdieu and Passeron’s analysis for enabling animated and agentic conceptualisations of educational and social reproduction by drawing on recent cas...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The consequences of the current status quo can be seen in diminishing funding and rising inequalities. The author argues that the answer lies not in tinkering with an unjust education system but rather in big, bold initiatives that are transformative rather than incremental.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Race and Elite Universities in the UKDismantling Race in Higher Education,  2018Growing diversity within Higher Education (HE), rather than producing a more inclusive higher edu... more Growing diversity within Higher Education (HE), rather than producing a more inclusive higher education, has resulted in a segregated and increasingly polarised system. In the United Kingdom (UK) we are maintaining, and further strengthening, a university hierarchy built on class and race in which upper and upper middle class pursuit of the educational exclusivity they experienced in private and selective state schooling has relegated both Black and White working classes to the universities that the more privileged do not want to attend. As a consequence, new opportunities for BME students have diminishing value because they are studying in low ranking universities with ‘too many’ students like them. However, this chapter focuses on the role the elite universities, and, in particular, Oxbridge, play in preserving a university system that remains exclusive and excluding at the top of its hierarchy. High achieving Black students struggle to gain admission, while the few BME students, particularly those from working class backgrounds, who do make it to the elite institutions are having to manage a range of challenges. They can experience marginalization, a sense of being ‘out-of-place’ and insidious, as well as more overt, forms of racism. This chapter focuses on the repercussions of being outsiders in a white elite culture, and makes the argument for institutional change.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Tawney, it then explores the barriers raised by the pandemic for socially just education in the future, and the possibilities opened up.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Working class educational transitions to university: The limits of successEuropean Journal of Education,  2018Educational transitions experienced within a context of wide and growing inequalities such as Eng... more Educational transitions experienced within a context of wide and growing inequalities such as England result in very different transition experiences to those experienced by young people growing up in relatively equitable societies with strong communal links. Transitions of working class young people in England are beset with competition, individualism and low expectations. Employing Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus, capital and field, the article argues that working class transitions to university reveal the failure of the English educational system to provide anything like a level playing field to support working class young people who are seen to be educational successes. Focusing on those working class young people who are particularly successful by gaining access to elite universities the paper argues that even this small select group face discrimination, set‐backs, and a degree of social exclusion. The paper concludes that the vast majority of working class young people, including many of those who are the most academically successful have very different transitions to higher education, and experiences within it, from their middle and upper class peers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As the number of graduates has grown the degree has become an increasingly common entry qualification for a growing number of high-level occupations. Thus, higher education has played a progressively greater part in the reproduction of the occupationally-based class structure. So it is not surprising that class inequalities have persisted. Nor is it surprising that class differentials among women are just as marked as they are among men (Blackburn and Jarman, 1993, p205).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It interrogates the repercussions of an elitist and masculinised academy for, in particular, women and academics from working class and ethnic minority backgrounds,  and describes some of the consequences for  academic identities of neoliberal  new managerialist practices. Drawing on the analyses of Pierre Bourdieu,  and  that of contemporary feminist academics the paper maps out some of the gendered and classed institutional practices that result in pervasive social injustices within academia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

After a brief overview of the history of social class in higher education, it maps out the contemporary landscape focusing on, but also looking beyond, the statistics. The main part of the chapter highlights the actual experiences of working class students in UK higher education, drawing on data from two ESRC projects of classed experiences  of higher education in the 21st century (Reay et al 2005; Reay et al 2010).  The massification and democratisation of higher education has led to the admittance of far more working class students, but it has also resulted in a steeply hierarchical and stratified system with working class students, for the most part, clustered in the low status, poorly resourced,  institutions (Crozier et al 2009; Stich 2012).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
