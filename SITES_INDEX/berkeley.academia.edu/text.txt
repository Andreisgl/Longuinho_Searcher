Cette communication ne vise en aucun cas à trancher la question en présentant le zouk comme solution ou source des problèmes auxquels l’ensemble de la population guadeloupéenne fait face aujourd’hui.

She adds, "could it be that we also need to think about affect to understand the nature of power?" Based on this premise, this keynote paper, presented at the International Association for the Study of Popular Music XX Biennial Conference 2019, goes against the tendency to schematize and universalize emotions and affect. Instead, I argue for the need to address affect historically and ethnographically within the fields of power in which musical experience takes place. This article focuses on the 2017 Road March song, 'Full Extreme', the song that played almost 500 more times than its closer competitor at the judging points during Carnival Tuesday in Trinidad (West Indies). I examine this song as an event to reveal the various forces that are at play in foregrounding simultaneously a "collective effervescence" (Emile Durkheim's expression) and the local tradition of calypso's critical rhetoric. By exploring how it has galvanized massive support, I show how this song confronts what has been at the core of the exclusionist politics of modernity. I also call attention to what is called for not only to create mass appeal, but also to encourage public engagement and political debate in modern democracies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Music and Militarization: Soca, Space, and SecurityViolence and security are ubiquitous issues in the Caribbean and the subject of heated discourse ... more Violence and security are ubiquitous issues in the Caribbean and the subject of heated discourse in Trinidad, particularly during Carnival season. Locating music and militarization in the long Caribbean history of slavery and plantations, this paper takes on the relationships of armed violence and mass musical events in Trinidad. Writing against cause and effect narratives, and focusing instead on the necessity of historical and contextual analysis, this paper shows how the promotion of carnival culture in Trinidad entangles the roles of private security forces and the state police with agendas of cultural entrepreneurs and desires of citizens and travelers. The proliferation of “all-inclusive” fetes provides a particular example of this complex entanglement.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There is no problem with that. The importance of interdisciplinarity and its benefits does not have to be defended. Many universities are trying hard to develop what they call “course threads”—groups of courses focusing on particular themes, issues, or practices across disciplines to encourage students to develop a deep knowledge about the theme, issue, or problem in question from various perspectives. The difficulty is that ethnomusicology to a large extent continues to be viewed by those from many of the disciplines from which it borrows in the arts, humanities, and social sciences as contributing little theory of its own. Looking at publications in anthropology, for example, few if any ethnomusicologists’ names and studies are mentioned in their bibliographies. And even though 20% of the members of the Society for Ethnomusicology who completed their 2008 membership survey listed “cultural studies” as part of their intellectual training, there is a glaring imbalance among the references that cultural studies publications include. Most of them refer to studies associated with disciplines in the social sciences and in the humanities with very few, if any, referring to ethnomusicology. In a 2005 publication entitled Cultural Studies: A Critical Introduction, Simon During recognizes cultural studies’ long intimacy with pop music, but he adds: “The discipline’s [cultural studies’] engagement . . . with music does not have the political force that it does with topics such asSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
