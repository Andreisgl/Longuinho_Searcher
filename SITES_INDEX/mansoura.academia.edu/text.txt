Methods These metals levels were measured by atomic spectroscopy techniques, including flame-AAS, GF-AAS, and ICP-AES. Results The bioavailability of trace elements to plants was affected by soil factors such as soil pH, organic matter (OM) content. Soil considered alkali soil (pH range from 7.4- 8.6) with low organic contents (1.26-1.80 %). By comparing the soil content around the phosphate mining area in the Western Desert as part of the extremely dry deserts range with the ideal agricultural soil content of macronutrients, it was found that there were low contents of them.

(camelthorn) is a dominant desert plant indigenous in various habitats, including the Western Desert of Egypt. The plant is especially prevalent in and around economic iron ore deposits. Nutrient and heavy metal levels in A. maurorum tissues and soil samples were assessed to identify associations between heavy metal levels in plants and soil. The objective was to evaluate this species as an indicator of heavy metal pollution. Photosynthetic pigments, protein, proline, alkaloids, flavonoids, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylscavenging, reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, antioxidant enzymes, and stress-related gene expression were assessed to determine their functional roles in metal stress adaptation in ultra- and molecular structure. Additionally, the molecular genetic variation in A. maurorum samples was assessed using co-dominant sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR).

Seaweed extracts as prospective plant growth bio-stimulant and salinity stress alleviator for Vigna sinensis and Zea maysJournal of Applied PhycologyThe objective of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of seed priming with seaweed liqui... more The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of seed priming with seaweed liquid extracts (SLEs) prepared from three Egyptian seaweeds ( Ulva fasciata , Cystoseira compressa , and Laurencia obtusa ) in a concentration of 20 g L -1 on seed germination and seedling growth of Vigna sinensis and Zea mays as well as the effectiveness of these extracts in ameliorating salinity stress. Laurancia extract (LLE) induced the maximum positive response in germination as well as producing the maximum increases in all seedling morphological parameters with percent of response 87.14% for hypocotyl growth of V. sinensis and 85.71% coleoptile elongation of Z. mays. The maximum amylase and protease activities were recorded with LLE priming. Ulva , Cystoseira , Laurencia liquid extract consortium (UCLLE) induced the highest promotion effect for both V. sinensis and Z. mays giving significant increments for all growth criteria, dry biomass 0.301 and 0.438 g seedling -1 , Chl a 18.98 and 13.79 mg g -1 FW, total carbohydrates 460.88 and 518.14 g seedling -1 , protein 219.72 and 207.49 g seedling -1 respectively. Seeds primed with UCLLE consortium exhibited remarkable tolerance for salinity stress, meanwhile the highest ameliorating effect was pronounced with 10% SW supplementation. Priming with SLEs enhances the growth of either V. sinensis or Z. mays under salinity stress, whereas UCLLE consortium induced significant increases in biomass 0.231 and 0.379 g seedling -1 , respectively. Seed priming with SLEs enhanced guaiacol peroxidase activity giving the highest value with UCLLE consortium conjugated with 25% SW (12.47 and 13.05 μmol min -1 g -1 FW), respectively. Application of Canonical Corresponding analysis (bi-plot) demonstrates a significant correlation between variables of SLEs components and germination indices of the two plants concluding total nitrogen, total phosphorous, potassium, ascorbic acid, and amino acids besides carbohydrate content. Therefore, results maintain the concept of SLEs as agricultural biocatalyst which could be practiced as prospective biostimulants for being feasible, sustainable, eco-friendly, and effective in improving salinity tolerance for some plants.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The plant parts and their soils were collected from three sites (El-Gedida mining ore site (S1), accommodation of mining workers (S2) and Harra Oasis (S3)) at Bahariya Oasis, as the Libyan part of the Western Desert in Egypt. In C. bonariensis, photosynthetic pigments and flavonoids showed a significant increase at S1 at which the shoots accumulated high amounts of TE(s) whereas, the same photosynthetic pigment fractions showed a significant increase in S3 at which the shoots accumulated the least amounts of TE(s) for A. viridis. For A. viridis flavonoids showed a significant increase at S1 (higher accumulation of TEs in shoots). C. bonariensis accumulated the higher concentrations of macronutrients in tissues than A. viridis. The translocation factors of both species varied among the TEs as well as among the different studied sites. This indicates that C. bonariensis plants tolerated toxic TE(s) stress present in the mining area which enhances the hypothesis that this plant could be used as a successful tool for phytoremediation of toxic TE(s) in polluted areas.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the present investigation, Portulaca oleracea was examined to estimate its role in the accumulation of Mn(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III) and Pb(II) ions and recognize its persistence against the industrial effluent toxicity from different farmlands located beside these regions (S1:S9) in Dakahlia district, Egypt. The most recorded associate plants were; Amaranthus viridus, Malva parviflora, Chenopodium murale and Echinochloa colonum, which have high potentiality of heavy metals (HM) accumulation. The phytoremediation efficiency (bioconcentration factor (BCF), bioaccumulation factor (BF), translocation factor (TF), enrichment coefficient of shoot (ECS) and element accumulation index (EAI)) of P. oleracea were calculated. Considering the results, S7 showed the highest BCF value for Cu(II), 7.40; Fe(III), 2.06; and Zn(II), 4.33, while Mn(II), 2.06 at S1 and Pb(II), 3.89 at S3. BF and TF values were less than unity 1.0 for most of the sites. However, ECS values showed small variations among the investigated HM at the nine sites. EAI values were higher in shoots out of all the sites except S2 &amp;gt; EAI of roots of the same sites. Also, there was positive correlation between the soil HM concentrations in most sites. Moreover, total protein was estimated quantitatively and qualitatively. The protein profile showed 16 bands of molecular weight ranged from 30.9 to 240.6 KDa. Finally, P. oleracea can be used for decontamination of soils with heavy metals due to the high ecological amplitude and phytoremediation characteristics.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reports displayed the distributions and accumulations of ZnO-NPs on the nematode (J2s) body under direct exposure, which might be the reason of NP-mediated toxicity and disruption for M. incognita.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Seaweed extracts as prospective plant growth bio-stimulant and salinity stress alleviator for Vigna sinensis and Zea maysThe objective of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of seed priming with seaweed liqui... more The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of seed priming with seaweed liquid extracts (SLEs) prepared from three Egyptian seaweeds (Ulva fasciata, Cystoseira compressa, and Laurencia obtusa) in a concentration of 20 g L-1 on seed germination and seedling growth of Vigna sinensis and Zea mays as well as the effectiveness of these extracts in ameliorating salinity stress. Laurancia extract (LLE) induced the maximum positive response in germination as well as producing the maximum increases in all seedling morphological parameters with percent of response 87.14% for hypocotyl growth of V. sinensis and 85.71% coleoptile elongation of Z. mays. The maximum amylase and protease activities were recorded with LLE priming. Ulva, Cystoseira, Laurencia liquid extract consortium (UCLLE) induced the highest promotion effect for both V. sinensis and Z. mays giving significant increments for all growth criteria, dry biomass 0.301 and 0.438 g seedling-1 , Chl a 18.98 and 13.79 mg g-1 FW, total carbohydrates 460.88 and 518.14 g seedling-1 , protein 219.72 and 207.49 g seedling-1 respectively. Seeds primed with UCLLE consortium exhibited remarkable tolerance for salinity stress, meanwhile the highest ameliorating effect was pronounced with 10% SW supplementation. Priming with SLEs enhances the growth of either V. sinensis or Z. mays under salinity stress, whereas UCLLE consortium induced significant increases in biomass 0.231 and 0.379 g seedling-1 , respectively. Seed priming with SLEs enhanced guaiacol peroxidase activity giving the highest value with UCLLE consortium conjugated with 25% SW (12.47 and 13.05 μmol min-1 g-1 FW), respectively. Application of Canonical Corresponding analysis (bi-plot) demonstrates a significant correlation between variables of SLEs components and germination indices of the two plants concluding total nitrogen, total phosphorous, potassium, ascorbic acid, and amino acids besides carbohydrate content. Therefore, results maintain the concept of SLEs as agricultural biocatalyst which could be practiced as prospective biostimulants for being feasible, sustainable, eco-friendly, and effective in improving salinity tolerance for some plants.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Assessment of trace element and macronutrient accumulation capacity of two native plant species in three different Egyptian mine areas for remediation of contaminated soilsThe present study aimed to compare the ability of Conyza bonariensis and Amaranthus viridis to ac... more The present study aimed to compare the ability of Conyza bonariensis and Amaranthus viridis to accumulate macronutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK) and trace elements (TEs) in their underground and aboveground tissues from the soils in the mining areas. The plant parts and their soils were collected from three sites (El-Gedida mining ore site (S1), accommodation of mining workers (S2) and Harra Oasis (S3)) at Bahariya Oasis, as the Libyan part of the Western Desert in Egypt. In C. bonariensis, photosynthetic pigments and flavonoids showed a significant increase at S1 at which the shoots accumulated high amounts of TE(s) whereas, the same photosynthetic pigment fractions showed a significant increase in S3 at which the shoots accumulated the least amounts of TE(s) for A. viridis. For A. viridis flavonoids showed a significant increase at S1 (higher accumulation of TEs in shoots). C. bonariensis accumulated the higher concentrations of macronutrients in tissues than A. viridis. The translocation factors of both species varied among the TEs as well as among the different studied sites. This indicates that C. bonariensis plants tolerated toxic TE(s) stress present in the mining area which enhances the hypothesis that this plant could be used as a successful tool for phytoremediation of toxic TE(s) in polluted areas.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the present investigation, Portulaca oleracea was examined to estimate its role in the accumulation of Mn(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III) and Pb(II) ions and recognize its persistence against the industrial effluent toxicity from different farmlands located beside these regions (S1:S9) in Dakahlia district, Egypt. The most recorded associate plants were; Amaranthus viridus, Malva parviflora, Chenopodium murale and Echinochloa colonum, which have high potentiality of heavy metals (HM) accumulation. The phytoremediation efficiency (bioconcentration factor (BCF), bioaccumulation factor (BF), translocation factor (TF), enrichment coefficient of shoot (ECS) and element accumulation index (EAI)) of P. oleracea were calculated. Considering the results, S7 showed the highest BCF value for Cu(II), 7.40; Fe(III), 2.06; and Zn(II), 4.33, while Mn(II), 2.06 at S1 and Pb(II), 3.89 at S3. BF and TF values were less than unity 1.0 for most of the sites. However, ECS values showed small variations among the investigated HM at the nine sites. EAI values were higher in shoots out of all the sites except S2 &amp;gt; EAI of roots of the same sites. Also, there was positive correlation between the soil HM concentrations in most sites. Moreover, total protein was estimated quantitatively and qualitatively. The protein profile showed 16 bands of molecular weight ranged from 30.9 to 240.6 KDa. Finally, P. oleracea can be used for decontamination of soils with heavy metals due to the high ecological amplitude and phytoremediation characteristics.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic methods such as HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The isolated compounds displayed strong to weak antitumor activity against HepG2 and MCF7 cancer cell lines, with echiumins A and D showed the most potent activity.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
