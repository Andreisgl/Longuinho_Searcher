'Participatory Curating in Southeast Asia', 13 May 2022, University of BraunschweigRequest PDF'Participatory Curating in Southeast Asia', 13 May 2022, University of BraunschweigEva BentchevaAbstractTalk: 'Participatory Curating in Southeast Asia'
While the Indonesian collective, ruangrupa, has recently come into the international limelight through their curation of documenta 15, participatory curating has a much broader history within Southeast Asia. Putting ruangrupa in context alongside other Southeast Asian artistic and curatorial formations, such as the Chiang-Mai Social Installation in Thailand and The Artists Village in Singapore, among others, this talk presents the close-knit  - and often intertwined - relationship between artistic practice, curating, urban infrastructure and socio-political participation across a number of 'grassroots' curatorial collectives in the region.
