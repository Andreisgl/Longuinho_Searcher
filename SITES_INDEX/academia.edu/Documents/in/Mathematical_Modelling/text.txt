Mathematical modeling approaches have recently been used to correlate the effects of lipid composition changes in the physicochemical properties of raft-like membranes. Here we propose an agent based model to assess the effect of lipid changes in lipid rafts on the evolution and progression of Alzheimer&#39;s disease using lipid profile data obtained in an established model of familial Alzheimer&#39;s disease. We have observed that lipid raft size and lipid mobility in non-raft domains are two main factors that increase during age and are accelerated in the transgenic Alzheimer&#39;s disease mouse model. The consequences of these changes are discussed in the context of neurotoxic amyloid β production. Our agent based model predicts that increasing sterols (mainly cholesterol) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) (mainly DHA, docosahexaenoic acid) proportions in the m...Save to LibraryDownloadby Mario Díaz•  10  Systems Biology, Biology, Mathematical Modelling, MedicineThe Non-Uniform Spatial Development of a MicrometastasisSave to LibraryDownloadby michael wilson•  5  Computer Science, Angiogenesis, Theoretical Medicine, Computational and Mathematical ModelingEnergy and exergy analysis of an indirect solar cabinet dryer based on mathematical modeling resultsSave to LibraryDownloadby Amir Hossein Rahimi•  18  Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Science, ChemistryPeningkatan Kemampuan Siswamemahami Konsep Pengurangan Bilangan Bulatmelalui Model Pembelajaran Konstruktivismedi Kelas IV SDN 03 Simpurtahun 2010Save to LibraryDownloadby Siti Rokhati•  3  Psychology, Physics, HumanitiesOn the velocity distribution at equilibrium in the mathematical theory of vehicular traffic flowSave to LibraryDownloadby lorenzo mussone•  8  Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Parameterized ComplexityFrom experiments to hydrodynamic traffic flow models: I—modelling and parameter identificationSave to LibraryDownloadby lorenzo mussone•  11  Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Parameter Identification, Traffic FlowThe MR12-UAV BombardierThis research paper presents a new prototype is called "MR12-UAV BOMBARDIER."

The utility of predicted moisture content values from two droplet drying models were compared with experimental data for spray dried pineapple juice, using the Ranz-Marshal and its modified variants for the heat and mass transfer correlations. The droplet Diffusion model, using the Zhifu correlation, gave estimates with errors of about 8% at 165 oC, 9% at 171 oC, 26% at 179 oC and 2% at 185 oC. The Ranz-Marshal correlation also gave comparable results with this model while results using the Downing and modified Ranz-Marshall correlations widely diverged. The Energy balance model predicted completely dried juice particles, and short drying times, in contrast to the experimental data.

The irreducible character of this interference was seen by N. Bohr as the principal distinction between classical and quantum physics and grounded his interpretation of quantum phenomena and quantum theory. Bohr sawcomplementarity as a generalization of the classical ideal of causality, which defined classical physics and relativity. While intimated by Bohr, the relationships among observational technology, complementarity, causality and the arrow of events (a new concept that replaces the arrow of time commonly used in this context) were not addressed by him either. The article introduces another new concept, that of quantum causality, as a form of probabilistic causality. The argument of the article is based on a particularinterpretation of quantum phenomena and quantum theory, defined by the concept of ‘reality without realism (RWR)’. This interpretation follows Bohr’sinterpretation but contains certain additional features, in particular the Dirac postulate. The article also considers quantum-like (Q-L) theories (basedin the mathematics of QM) from the perspective it develops.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arkady Plotnitsky•  3  Philosophy of Time, Philosophy of Physics, Quantum Physics, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Philosophy of CausationCompressible Euler-Maxwell limit for global smooth solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann systemSave to LibraryDownloadby Renjun Duan•  5  Physics, Compressibility, Boltzmann equation, Boltzmann constantPredicting fungal growth: the effect of water activity on Penicillium roquefortiSave to LibraryDownloadby Ľubomír Valík•  20  Microbiology, Food Science, Water, BiologyCharacterisation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus VT1 and its effect on the growth of Candida maltosa YP1The combined effect of initial amount of 18 h L. rhamnosus VT1 inoculum and incubation temperature on the growth of Candida maltosa YP1, an oxidative food spoilage yeast strain, was primarily modelled and studied by standard response... moreThe combined effect of initial amount of 18 h L. rhamnosus VT1 inoculum and incubation temperature on the growth of Candida maltosa YP1, an oxidative food spoilage yeast strain, was primarily modelled and studied by standard response surface methodology. This study resulted in the following linear regression equations characterising lag time and growth rate of C. maltosa YP1 in milk in competition with the potentially protective lactobacillus strain. Lag-phase of C. maltosa was strongly influenced by the amount of lactobacillus inoculum (V0) and incubation temperature (1/T). The synergic effect of both these factors was also evident as results from the equation lag = –33.50 + 186.38 × V0 × 1/T + 512.27 × 1/T – 5.511 × V0 (R2(λ) = 0.849). The growth rate was sufficiently described by the linear relation: GrCm = –0.00046 + 0.0033 × T – 0.0016 × V0 (R2(Gr) = 0.847).

In order to investigate the development of these competencies, we examined 49 prospective mathematics teachers studying in a course that included a sequence of modelling activities. During the course, groups of 5–6 participants engaged in these modelling activities as learners. The data include two sets of reports by the prospective teachers on their observations of a recorded modelling activity carried out by a group of five 6th grade students. The first set of reports was collected before the prospective teachers worked on any modelling activities, while the second set was collected after they had engaged in the modelling activities. The findings indicate that, prior to working on modelling activities, most of the prospective teachers described the students’ modelling activity as a linear process and focused on the final math...Save to LibraryDownloadby Juhaina.

The main subjects in which the research has been focused have been the control of pronation and the reduction of impact forces. Several studies have been dedicated to analyse the effect of midsole construction in ground reaction forces or pronation. Nevertheless in some of them no effect associated with different hardness has been found. In a previous work it has been found that a post associated with an external heel counter was an effective feature to control pronation. Besides a new methodology has been developed to characterize the mechanical characteristics of the materials simulating real loads. In this paper a study of the effect of the material the midsole is made with, the midsole thickness and the presence or not of a post associated with an external heel counter in GRF is investigated.

The potential for flooding can increase riverbed degradation and local scouring, which adds to the bridge threat sub-structures. Batujajar Bridge, located in Batujajar District, West Bandung Regency, has two pillars within the Citarum river. The 150 m long bridge is at risk of collapse due to local scouring of the pillars. So it&#39;s necessary to evaluate the depth of the scours with mathematical modeling using the HEC-RAS application in live-bed scour conditions. In general, scour modeling is obtained by modeling river geometry, bridge design, and river flow. Scour modeling used the CSU method and the Froechlich method in the HEC-RAS 5.0.7 application. Topographical conditions were obtained from the DEM of the study area using Global Mapper 2.0 software and river geometry modeling using RAS Mapper.

Based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and 07 March 2022. Methods We used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to four weeks.

The hybrid scheme is used to discretize the convection terms and SIMPLER algorithm is adopted to couple the velocity and pressure field in the momentum equations. The temperature fields, variation of horizontal velocity along the centre line of the channel, average Nusselt number and the thermal resistance in different aspect ratios are presented. It is observed that aspect ratio mainly affected the temperature gradient as well as heat transfer. Analyzing the results of numerical simulations indicates that with increasing aspect ratio, horizontal velocity along the centre line increased and then, average Nusselt number and the inlet and outlet thermal resistance decrease in the microchannel.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ghanbar Ali Sheikhzadeh•  8  Materials Science, Mechanics, Heat Transfer, NanostructuresTumour–host dynamics under radiotherapySave to LibraryDownloadby Eloy Oswaldo Hernández Hernández•  11  Engineering, Neuroscience, Mathematics, Radiation TherapyEffect of expanding opioid agonist therapies on the HIV epidemic and mortality in Ukraine: a modelling studySave to LibraryDownloadby Alexei Zelenev•  5  Environmental Health, Medicine, Population, BuprenorphinePrediction of retention times of proteins in hydrophobic interaction chromatography using only their amino acid compositionSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan A.

Feedback loops attenuate or amplify signals, change the network dynamics and modify the input-output relationships between the signal and the target. Negative feedback provides robustness to noise and adaptation to perturbations, but as a double-edged sword can prevent effective pathway inhibition by a drug. Positive feedback brings about switch-like network responses and can convert analog input signals into digital outputs, triggering cell fate decisions and phenotypic changes. We show how a multitude of protein-protein interactions create hidden feedback loops in signal transduction cascades. Drug treatments that interfere with feedback regulation can cause unexpected adverse effects. Combinatorial molecular interactions generated by pathway crosstalk and feedback loops often bypass the block caused by targeted therapies against oncogenic mutated kinases.

These interactions, as proposed through the continuing education of early years teachers, show that coordination between these two fields is beneficial to the training of educators, both facilitating the learning of mathematical content and contributing in various ways to the development of skills used to investigate and understand the role mathematics plays in society. Furthermore, the article highlights how these discussions have proved valuable in allowing teachers to understand the importance of possessing specialized content knowledge for teaching mathematics, as posited in the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching model, developed by Ball, Thames and Phelps (2008).Save to LibraryDownloadby Arthur B.

In the literature, classical model assume that an ignorant individual enters the latent period and decide whether to become a spreader or stifler. In our model we introduce a new compartment called the blackmailers, another type of spreaders who spread the rumour for selfish reason. The model equations are first transformed into proportions, thus reducing the model equations from five to four differential equations. The model exhibit two equilibra, namely the Rumour Free Equilibrium (RFE) and the Rumour Endemic Equilibrium (REE). Using the method of linearized stability, we establish that the RFE state exist and is locally asymptomatically stable when R0 &lt; 1  and that when R0 &gt; 1 the endemic state exist. The model allows us to discuss the relationship between spreaders and blackmailers, and the effect of blackmailers on the stiflers.

Precipitation can be essentially influenced by the adjustments in organization and weight of the crude oil. For instance, asphaltenes hasten after blending of contradictory oils or solvents to crude oils, and weight consumption in traditional oils containing arrangement gas. Moreover, crude oils with no or almost no water are constantly considered for asphaltene precipitation estimations and demonstrating.
