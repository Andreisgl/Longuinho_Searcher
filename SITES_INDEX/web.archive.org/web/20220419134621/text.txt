The World Economic Outlook (WEO) database contains selected macroeconomic data series from the statistical appendix of the World Economic Outlook report, which presents the IMF staff's analysis and projections of economic developments at the global level, in major country groups and in many individual countries. The WEO is released in April and September/October each year.
Use this database to find data on national accounts, inflation, unemployment rates, balance of payments, fiscal indicators, trade for countries and country groups (aggregates), and commodity prices whose data are reported by the IMF.
Data are available from 1980 to the present, and projections are given for the next two years. Additionally, medium-term projections are available for selected indicators. For some countries, data are incomplete or unavailable for certain years.
The World Economic Outlook (WEO) database is available in SDMX format from our Entire Dataset page. For more information about SDMX, please visit SDMX.org
Changes to the April 2022 Database
For Ecuador, fiscal sector projections are excluded from publication for 2022–27 because of ongoing program review discussions.
Ethiopia’s forecast data, which were previously omitted due to an unusually high degree of uncertainty, are now included.
Fiji’s fiscal data and forecasts are now presented on a fiscal year basis.
For Tunisia, projections are excluded from publication for 2023–27 because of ongoing technical discussions pending potential program negotiations.
For Ukraine, all projections for 2022–27 except Real GDP are omitted due to an unusually high degree of uncertainty. Real GDP is projected through 2022.
Venezuela redenominated its currency on October 1, 2021, by replacing 1,000,000 bolívares soberano (VES) with 1 bolívar digital (VED).
For Zambia, general government net and gross debt projections for 2022-27 are omitted due to ongoing debt restructuring.
Beginning with the April 2022 WEO, the interest rate assumptions are based on the three-month and ten-year government bond yields, which replace the London interbank offered rates. See the Assumptions section of the WEO Statistical Appendix for more details.
