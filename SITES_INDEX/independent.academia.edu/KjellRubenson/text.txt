Over the last 50 years, adult education has evolved as a field of practice and scholarship. It can also been seen as an international movement in the struggle for democracy and a way to combat inequalities. While the structure and provision of adult education vary considerably from country to country, some main sectors are discernable. A hotly debated issue in the literature has been whether or not adult learning should be understood as a distinctive process that significantly differs from the way children learn. With increased investment in adult education, there is a growing focus on its economic and social benefits. Recent scholarly developments demonstrate that a full appreciation of adult education and learning requires that they be seen in their socioeconomic, political, and cultural contexts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Panelists will discuss findings from their respective parts of the world and consider how research and theory on this important phenomenon can be advanced. Background, overview. The increased interest of governments world-wide in educational reform and the promotion of lifelong learning has stimulated renewed interest in the phenomenon of adult participation in a whole range of educational endeavors, both formal and informal. At the same time, major new surveys in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia have made their appearance. These suggest the perpetuation of ‘inequities’ so well documented in earlier surveys, even as they provoke new questions about who participates in adult education and why; the benefits of participation beyond the realm of vocational expediency; how the field of adult education as a whole is changing; and why participation related issues rec...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Global Report on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE): Strengths, weaknesses and future directionsInternational Review of EducationOne of the core outcomes of the Sixth International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA VI) ... more One of the core outcomes of the Sixth International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA VI) held in 2009 was the Belém Framework for Action (BFA). Its signatories committed to monitoring the most recent development stages of adult learning and education (ALE) worldwide on a regular basis, and to present and assess results in a global report. Coordinated by the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning, surveys have been conducted and documented in four GRALE reports over the past decade. A fifth report is currently being prepared for CONFINTEA VII, to be held in June 2022. This article critically analyses the project of compiling a Global Report on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) at roughly three-year intervals. Drawing on an evaluative framework for research quality developed by Pär Mårtensson and colleagues, the authors of this article investigate to what extent the GRALE approach to monitoring and reporting on ALE so far has been (1) credible (e.g. based on rigorous resear...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on Bourdieu’s concept of the scientific field, we argue that adult education is a “weak” field. Our findings suggest that the field is facing three main challenges. First, the regional fragmentation of the field that was noticed at the end of the 1990s, has continued and seems to have intensified. Second, a disciplinary fragmentation and “hollowing out” of the field can be observed. Third, we note a disconnect between academic adult education research and policy-related research. We provide a couple of speculations as to the future of adult education as a field of study, with a particular focus on the issue of policy relevance, which is contested among adult educators.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As such, the paper explores the perceptions on research and teaching of full-time faculty members affiliated with Canadian universities. Overall, faculty members revealed that Canadian universities have strong, engaging, and vibrant research and teaching environments, yet there are also areas for improvement. Specifically, findings showed that faculty members perceived considerable autonomy with respect to research activities, despite the increasing need to secure external funding for research. Also, faculty expressed substantial commitment to t...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We begin this chapter by providing a brief overview of the context of academic work in Canadian universities, followed by a description of the methodology for the survey of university academics that provided the foundation for this analysis. We then report and discuss study findings related to overall job satisfaction, provide an analysis of academic staff satisfaction with a range of workplace and institutional factors, and explore differences in reported satisfaction by demographic characteristics of academic staff. We summarise our findings and offer a number of conclusions in the final section of this chapter.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
