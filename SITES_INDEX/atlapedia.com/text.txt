LOCATION & GEOGRAPHY: United Kingdom is located off the 
                      northwestern coast of Europe between the Atlantic Ocean 
                      and the North Sea. It is separated from the continent by 
                      the Strait of Dover and the English Channel, and from the 
                      Irish Republic by the Irish Sea and the St. Georges Channel. 
                      The United Kingdom is comprised of four constituents, England, 
                      Wales and Scotland which alone form Great Britain and combined 
                      with Northern Ireland and several island groups, form the 
                      United Kingdom. Most of England consists of low plains and 
                      downs with the major hill regions situated to the north, 
                      west and southeast where elevations do not rise above 305 
                      metres (1,000 feet) at any point. The Cheviot Hills run 
                      east to west along the Scottish border, while from the Scottish 
                      border to Derbyshire in Central England lie the north to 
                      south Pennine Range. The Central Midlands, a plains region 
                      that consists of low, rolling hills and fertile valleys 
                      is located south of the Pennines. The Eastern Coast is protected 
                      by embankments from gales or high tides, although most of 
                      the low-lying coast is below 5 metres (15 feet) above sea 
                      level. Scafell Pike, England's highest point is located 
                      in the northwest with an elevation of 978 metres (3,210 
                      feet). Its principal rivers are the Severn, Thames, Humber, 
                      Tees, Tyne, Tweed, Avon, Exe and Mersey. Scotland is divided 
                      into three topographical regions. (1.) The Northern Highlands 
                      which occupy the northern half of the country and contains 
                      the highest point in the British Isles, Ben Nevis at 1,343 
                      metres (4,406 feet). (2.) The Central Lowland which contains 
                      the valleys of the Tay, Forth and Clyde Rivers, and also 
                      has and average elevation of 152 metres (500 feet). (3.) 
                      The Southern Uplands with moor land that is cut by rivers 
                      and valleys, and rises Merrick Peak at 842 metres (2,764 
                      feet). Wales is a country of hills and mountains with high 
                      plateaux and ranges dissected by river valleys. In the south, 
                      west and north, there are narrow coastal plains while the 
                      Cambrian Mountains occupy most of the land area and include 
                      Wales' highest point, Mount Snowdon at 1,085 metres (3,560 
                      feet). Northern Ireland consists mostly of low lying plateaux 
                      and hills while the Mourne Mountains in the southeast include 
                      Northern Ireland's highest point, Slieve Donard at 852 metres 
                      (2,796 feet). Lake Neagh lies in a central depression of 
                      Northern Ireland and is the Kingdom's largest lake. Major

MODERN HISTORY - WWII TO 1993: In Oct. 1945 Britain became a
  founding member of the UN and in 1949 joined the North Atlantic Treaty
  Organization (NATO). In Feb. 1950 the Labor Party led by Clement Attlee
  was re-elected. In Oct. 1951 the Tories and Winston Churchill were returned
  to power. In Feb. 1952 King George VI died and was succeeded by his eldest
  daughter who was crowned Queen Elizabeth II. In Apr. 1955 Prime Minister
  Churchill was forced to resign through illness and was succeeded by Sir
  Anthony Eden. In Oct. 1956 Britain and France bombed Cairo and captured
  Port Said in Egypt, after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. On Nov. 23,
  1956 a ceasefire was declared after strong US and UN pressure and the Anglo-French
  troops were withdrawn. In Jan. 1957 Prime Minister Eden resigned due to
  illness and was succeeded by Harold Macmillan. In Oct. 1959 Macmillan was
  re-elected and during the early 1960's a number of British overseas colonies
  were granted independence. In Aug. 1961 Britain applied for European Community
  (EC) membership, however, it was vetoed by France. In 1962 the Parliament
  tightened control of the Commonwealth Immigration Act to restrict the number
  of immigrants from the Caribbean and Indian subcontinent. In Oct. 1964
  Harold Wilson and the Labor Party won the general elections. In Jan. 1965
  Winston Churchill died and in 1967 Britain made another application for
  EU membership which was again dismissed. In 1969 riots in Londonderry broke
  out between the Catholic and Protestant communities which resulted in troops
  being sent to restore order and in Dec. 1969 an Ulster Member of Parliament,
  Bernadette Devlin was imprisoned on an incitement to riot charge. In June
  1970 the Tories under Edward Heath were elected to power. In 1971 the Irish
  Republican Army (IRA) began its terrorist campaign against British troops
  stationed in Ireland. In Jan. 1972 Britain's EU membership was approved
  and in April, Prime Minister Heath imposed direct British rule on Ulster
  (Northern Ireland) after the IRA bombed and killed seven soldiers. In 1973
  Dublin, Belfast and London established a joint Council of Ireland, although
  it collapsed in May 1974 and direct rule was again imposed. In Mar. 1974
  Wilson was returned to office but resigned in Mar. 1976 and was succeeded
  by James Callaghan. In 1979 strikes also known as the "winter of discontent"
  escalated in Britain. In May 1979, after a vote of no confidence in the
  government, Margaret Thatcher became Britain's first woman Prime Minister.
  Prime Minister Thatcher remained in power for around 11.5 years and reversed
  Britain's economic downward spiral with a massive program of privatization.
  In 1980 and 1984 there were Embassy sieges by Iranian and Libyan terrorists.
  During 1981 there were riots in Ulster and also by youths in South London
  and Liverpool. In Apr. 1982 Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and
  Britain responded by sending a task force which liberated the Islands in
  June. In Mar. 1984 coal miners went on a strike until Mar. 1985. In Oct.
  1984 the IRA unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Thatcher
  with a bomb attack that killed five people. In Nov. 1985 Britain and Ireland
  signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement that allowed Ireland to have a consultative
  role in Ulster's future. In Feb. 1986 the French and British governments
  signed the Channel Tunnel agreement. In July 1990 the IRA assassinated,
  Ian Gow a Tory Member of Parliament. During the late 1980's and in 1990
  Prime Minister Thatcher clashed with other EU council leaders over the
  EU's single currency monetary union, although she was finally outvoted.
  In Apr. 1990 the government introduced a controversial community charge
  called the poll tax. On Nov. 1990 Prime Minister Thatcher resigned and
  was succeeded by John Major. In early 1991 Britain assisted the US in liberating
  Kuwait, after Iraq's invasion in Aug 1990. On March 14, 1991 the Court
  of Appeal released the "Birmingham Six" following their conviction
  for the murder of 21 people in two IRA bomb attacks in 1974. On March 21,
  1991 the government announced that the poll tax would be abolished and
  a new "council tax" would be introduced in 1993. On June 17,
  the British government held talks with North Ireland's main political parties
  in Belfast's parliament, Stormont. Sinn Fein, the IRA's political win,g
  was excluded from the talks and on July 3, 1991 the talks were adjourned
  without any substantial agreement being made. On June 28, 1991 former prime
  minister Thatcher announced that she wouldn't seek reelection at the next
  planned general elections. In July 1991 Prime Minister Major announced
  a "Citizens Charter" that was hoped to restore the party's poor
  public service reputation, particularly regarding health services. In the
  same month the Bank of England revoked the Bank of Credit and Commerce
  International's (BCCI) license and commenced the international shutdown
  of the bank in which many thousands of UK patrons lost their savings. On
  July 9, 1991 Defense Secretary Tom King announced the government intended
  to reduce the size of its armed forces by 20% and cut expenditure by 6%
  over three years. On Sept. 2, 1991 Prime Minister Major visited Beijing,
  China to sign an agreement with China to build a new airport at Hong Kong.
  In Nov. 1991 Robert Maxwell one of the UK's largest media moguls died,
  following which investigations found that Maxwell had misappropriated some
  426 million pounds from his companies' pension funds to support his ailing
  empire. In Dec. 1991 the country's inflation rate fell to 4.5%. Also during
  1991 there were several IRA terrorist attacks including one in Feb. 1991
  on the Prime Minister residence. On March 11, 1992 Prime Minister Major
  announced general elections for April 9. On April 9, 1992 John Major was
  reelected Prime Minister, albeit with a much reduced parliamentary majority.
  On May 21, 1992 the House of Commons ratified the European Communities
  Amendment Bill. On July 1, 1992 the UK took over the presidency of the
  EU. On Aug. 18, 1992 the government announced plans to send some 1,800
  peacekeeping troops to the former Yugoslavia. In Sept. 1992 there was a
  speculative attack on the Sterling and on Sept. 16, 1992 the government
  in response to the devaluation of its currency raised official interest
  rates and then suspended its European exchange-rate mechanism membership.
  On Oct. 6, 1992 the Conservatives held their annual conference which resulted
  in heated debate led by the Euro-skeptics, a small group of Tory MPs opposed
  to the Maastricht Treaty. On Nov. 4, 1992 Prime Minister Major put the
  Maastricht Treaty issue to the Parliament which narrowly passed by three
  votes, although the government agreed to delay the ratification of the
  legislation until a second Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was
  held. On Nov. 20, 1992 a severe fire destroyed much of Windsor Castle,
  following which the government announced it would finance the Castle's
  restoration. Also in 1992 the Royal Family became the center of controversy
  with various revelations that Princess Di wished to end her marriage with
  Prince Charles while the IRA continued its bombing campaign throughout
  Northern Ireland and London for several weeks at a time. In 1993 Prime
  Minister Major endeavored to have the Parliament ratify the European Communities
  Amendment Bill which would commit the UK to the Maastricht Treaty although
  providing it with the right to opt out of two key issues, monetary union
  and the "social chapter". On Jan. 26, 1993 the Bank of England
  cut its official base interest rate to 6%, the lowest since 1977. In March
  1993 Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer (Treasurer), announced
  the government's budget which included tax increases and a value-added
  fuel tax. On May 27, 1993 Prime Minister Major under considerable pressure
  sacked Lamont and appointed Kenneth Clarke as his successor. In June 1993
  the UK's annual inflation rate fell to 1.2%, the lowest since 1964. On
  June 21, 1993 a key Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, responsible
  for the controversial plan to shutdown most of the country's coal collieries,
  suffered a heart attack. On July 22, 1993 two "Maastricht" proposals
  were put to the House of Commons, one by the Labor Party and the other
  by the Conservative government, both of which were defeated. As a result
  Prime Minister Major announced that a debate would be held in which a motion
  of confidence would be linked to the Maastricht Treaty, thereby ensuring
  fresh elections if the government failed. On Aug. 2, 1993 the government
  ratified the treaty legislation. On Oct. 20, 1993 the government announced
  that 12 state-owned coal collieries, which had earlier received a reprieve
  from closure, would be shut down and further shutdowns were inevitable.
  In the same month, Baroness Margaret Thatcher published her memoirs entitled
  "The Downing Street Years" which openly criticized Prime Minister
  Major and resulted in further aggravation for the Conservative government.
  On Nov. 5, 1993 the government passed another controversial bill to privatise
  many of British Rail's services which met with stiff opposition from BR's
  management. On Dec. 3, 1993 Princess Diana announced that she was withdrawing
  from public life to spend more time with her sons and indicated that the
  intrusive nature of the tabloid press was responsible for her decision.
  On Dec. 15, 1993 Prime Minister Major and the Irish Republic's Prime Minister,
  Albert Reynolds announced a joint peace initiative and that if the IRA
  ceased its terrorism campaign it could join negotiations three months after
  the cessation. Also in 1993 the government sent a further 1,200 troops
  to the former Yugoslavia while the UK and China continued their stalemate
  over a proposed bill by Chris Patten, HK's Governor, to restructure Hong
  Kong's Legislative Council to make it more representative of the HK people.
  Terrorist acts by both the IRA and the Protestant paramilitary groups continued
  throughout 1993 resulting in a considerable loss of life and property damage.
