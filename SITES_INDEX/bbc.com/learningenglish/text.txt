About BBC Learning English
As part of the BBC World Service, BBC Learning English has been teaching English to global audiences since 1943, offering free audio, video and text materials to learners around the world.
From our mobile English courses in Bangladesh and Latin America to our online offer for millions of Chinese learners, BBC Learning English provides multimedia English language teaching materials to meet learners' needs. 
Many of our materials are delivered as full length courses but each component of the course is standalone and can be studied on its own. This means the learner can choose the best way to study for them; by following a full course or by following the individual materials most appropriate to them. You can find out more about our current and future courses here.
We also have a range of long-running features such as 6 Minute English, The English We Speak and Lingohack. 
Partners
In addition to our public service offer, we also work with international donors, NGOs and commercial partners to produce tailor-made materials for specific markets. If you are interested in collaborating with BBC Learning English please contact paul.scott2@bbc.co.uk
