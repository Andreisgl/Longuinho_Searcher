The purpose was to use visual ethnography to critique our teaching over twenty years of annual five-day bush-based residential camps. The bush camps were situated in an outdoor education programme contributing to a four-year undergraduate teacher education Bachelor of Physical Education in Aotearoa New Zealand. The research method involved photo-elicitation of selected photographs representing students’ experiences and our practices. We each wrote about the photographs using introspection and recall to create a layered narrative analysis reflecting on the educative focus of the images. We responded to one another’ s narratives, challenging and/or supporting the reflexivity, to interpret our joint perspectives about the learning context, pedagogic rationale and outcomes. The research highlights our teacher educator perspectives about experiential learning. Some of this learning was directly attributed to our intentional pedagogy and some to the unpredictable, incidental, situated experience made possible by engagement in the outdoor environment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maureen Legge•  5  Teacher Education, Experiential Education, Outdoor Education, Physical EducationEffects of a College Adventure Orientation Program on Student Development BehaviorsSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael A.

These changes significantly impacted various OAEE programs in multiple ways and at different levels of intensity. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to ascertain the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the OAEE fields and identify how OAEE organizations have responded to those impacts. Methodology/Approach: Using a three-phase study and a multi-method approach to data collection and analyses, respondents from 115 OAEE organizations (N=115) were asked to indicate how and in what ways their organizations have been impacted by the pandemic and in what ways their organizations have responded to those challenges.

Data collection methods such as; psychodrama, non-participant observation, open-endedquestions and content analysis were used within a qualitative approach in a case study format. Activities inboth the indoor and outdoor experiential programmes were designed in accordance with Kolb’s theory onexperiential teaching. While the indoor activities were used for control group 1, and traditional methodsused for control group 2; the outdoor activities were used for the experimental group. At the end of theresearch, the following terms emerged in participants’ expressions: ‘interest, anxiety, curiosity, motivationand complaint’. The most outstanding expressions belonged to the experimental outdoor group.Save to LibraryDownloadby Emel Okur•  5  Environmental Education, Experiential Education, Outdoor Education, Affective Learning DomainA New Model for Risk TakingSave to LibraryDownloadby Simon Priest•  9  Psychology, Education, Cognitive development, Experiential EducationThe Rites of Passage and Outdoor Education: Critical Concerns for Effective ProgrammingRites of passage practices have caught the attention of educators seeking better methods of teaching adolescents.

The fascination with the rites of passage model (ROP) is especially strong among outdoor educators. Once Van Gennep (1960) defined the rites of passage, a three-stage system of social transformation mediating role changes in a community, anthropologists were able to observe his social conception throughout all cultures. Outdoor educators have demonstrated interest in framing outdoor programs as rites of passage because of the structural similarities between outdoor programs and Van Gennep&#39;s first and second stages of a rite of passage. While the ROP model has similarities to outdoor programs, the model is generally ineffective in most contemporary contexts because of challenges associated with the third stage of the ROP model.

As one of the instructors for the project, I reflect on how our emergent pedagogical methods interfaced or conflicted with students interests, and plant employees. Principles of phenomenological research inspired my early steps to the study. However, its operative conceptual framework follows the thoughts of socially engaged artists Suzanne Lacy (2010) and Pablo Helguera (2011), guiding an analysis of the relationships between students and workers with instructors as observer-participants. I investigate how these roles and relations developed through different modalities that ranged from familial sentiments to memorializing impulses, including the industrial conditions that inspired various sensual and aesthetic student responses. I argue that the production of artwork as autonomous objects, which constituted the self-evident outcome of this community-focused experience, contributed only a transactionalSave to LibraryDownloadby Rebecca Bourgault•  3  Experiential Education, Community Art, Arts and the CommunityThe Engaged InternSave to LibraryDownloadby Fred Sweitzer•  3  Experiential Education, Applied Learning, InternsipsSocial Justice in Outdoor Experiential Education: A State of Knowledge ReviewSave to LibraryDownloadby Nina S Roberts and +1M.

The 2018 update allows us to look closely at the trends in higher education admissions and have a discussion about what it looks like to have a 'gap-friendly' institutional admissions procedure. This poster addresses the project history, emerging themes, results, and the current state of the project.With overwhelming evidence that a planful and structured gap year bears fruit in student development, there is still a body of literature supporting 'academic momentum.' We agree that momentum is important to human development and student success. Because we believe that momentum from one developmental experience to another is important, partnerships between gap year programs and higher education admissions is critical for bridging those transitions. The significance of inspiring 'gap-friendly' higher education institutions means that more students and their families can consider a gap year as part of their goals and vision.  Cite this: Flowers, S.M.F.

They are more likely to fail and drop from education greatly reducing the prospect of becoming constructive, productive community members. Consequently strategies to promote engagement with learning and education need to be investigated. This study explores the impact on an individual's self-concept and social networking skills through participation in an experiential learning program at sea conducted in Australia's national sail training ship STS Young Endeavour and how this may influence student engagement with learning and education. Using qualitative interviews, engagement with learning and education of five participants from different educational backgrounds was examined pre and post voyage. The results suggest participation in the Young Endeavour program had a positive effect on development of social relationships, general self-concept, motivation to study, and sense of purpose for learning. Key contributing factors appear to be experiential learning activities specifically designed to support the development of greater self-concept and social skills such as climbing aloft, working together as a 'watch' and taking control of the vessel.Save to LibraryDownloadby Murray Henstock•  14  Education, Educational Research, Experiential Learning (Active Learning), Experiential EducationLeading the budding citizen and emerging adultAs the quote goes, it is better to build strong children than to repair broken men and women so we need to address the transitional types of skill building and preparation for the adult and working world that can happen in our... moreAs the quote goes, it is better to build strong children than to repair broken men and women so we need to address the transitional types of skill building and preparation for the adult and working world that can happen in our organizations. We frequently refer to our work as pedagogy but we fall short of capturing the uniqueness of learners who are not children. In adult education, we use the term andragogy, but there is another layer of learning that happens in between; the citizen building of the Ephebus—the youth.If our goal is to foster the whole learner, the robustness of programming that involves cultural, social, and out-of-doors education is just as important as the literacy and numeracy of college attendance. In order to build the strong leaders of tomorrow, we must sow seeds of the skills and dispositions necessary for fully-fledged and contributing members of our society.We know that “academics” and “education” have nuanced differences and there are principles and models that will help us to understand the opportunities that our programs can offer. Too often, we hear youth criticized and young people accused of ill preparedness for the adult and working world. All the while, schools chip away at the non-academic programming that is precisely the sort of education that young people need in order to bloom. Mapping out the practices of ephebagogical teaching stands to impact teaching and learning in, secondary levels, post-secondary, and transitional development programs. Cite this: Flowers, S.M.F.

Attempts at an explanation have varied within scientific disciplines from the very beginning. After almost three decades of a principally drug-driven practice of treatment, in recent years, ethical, social, pedagogical, and—obviously—medical concerns, regarding such an alignment’s adverse aspects, sharply regained in public as well as academic relevancy. In this paper, I am giving credit to the findings of Hüther et al., who, since 2009, investigated potential alternative ways of giving therapy to attention affecting syndromes by taking ADHD diagnosed children out into nature, discontinuing their medication for several months—and returned with results that were astonishing, showing that alternative ways of dealing with attention affecting syndromes generally existed. These findings altogether resonate with my own observations and long-standing experiences in working with adolescents in an experiential educational and Steiner/Waldorf pedagogical context, which I exemplify in order to endorse and make a reinforcing case for Hüther’s preliminary findings and hypothesis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dirk M Steiner•  11  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD (Psychology), Experiential Education, Alternative PedagogyAnalýza metodologických postupů publikovaných prací v oblasti zážitkové pedagogikyTh is article’s main theme is an analysis of accessible published degree work and contributions in education journals with a focus on what is known as “experiential education”.

Westart by introducing the concept of experiential education and trying to defi ne it. We then turn to the analysis of student degree work (masters, doctoral examination work and dissertations) and look specifi cally at the methodology and particular research tools used. Together with the qualifi cation work we analyse articles published in selected Czech educational journals – Pedagogika, e-Pedagogium, Pedagogická orientace, Gymnasion – likewise with a focus on experiential pedagogy. Our aim is to analyse the methodological techniques exploited in Czech experiential education as presented in the student degree work and in the articles. Overall we analysed 1,088 student works, 107 of which met the criteria that we hadchosen and related to the fi eld of experiential pedagogy. Of these 76 were empirical in research character. Because the overwhelming majority of these works used their own questionnaires or survey questions as research tools, and also interviews and observation, this methodology has only minimal potential for future studies in the fi eld of experiential education. 7 authors used standardized tools for their research. We list these in the text. We analysed a total of 336 articles from the selected educational journals, and of theseonly 6 met our chosen criteria and related to “experiential education”. None of them contained empirical research, and so there was no methodology or research instrument. Unlikein the case of the student qualifi cation works we registered no increased interest yet in the theme in the educational journals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ivo Jirásek and +2Martina ŠulcováAdéla Dvořáčková•  8  Education, Higher Education, Educational Research, PedagogyGer her to the green: The role of outdoor experiential education in the development of body image resilienceWhile existing in a patriarchal society, women are taught that they are merely their body, an object to be viewed, accepted or rejected and ultimately discarded.

Research has shown a need for body image resilience curriculum and media literacy courses. However, most of thecurriculum or content being created is for college-aged women and younger and taught in a passive way. This study introduced outdoor experiential education to body image resilience curriculum by looking at the experiences of women ages 25-40 in a body image resilienceworkshop. By examining these experiences, this study offers recommendations for Beauty Redefined, a Salt Lake City 501c3 who’s curriculum was used for the body image resilience workshop, and how they can have a more sustainable impact on the participants.

The standards are focused on promoting fair trade learning principles in the management and operation of volunteer programmes. Because of the unique social mission, research, and evaluation capacities of higher education, we propose first applying these principles specifically to international volunteer programmes operating at the university-community nexus. These standards have emerged through a collaborative, in-person and online process during the last two years with input by numerous concerned global citizens, international education practitioners and researchers, nongovernmental organization representatives, and community members.

For some time it has been suggested by many Sail Training operators that “Sail Training is a life changing experience” [1 - 8]. However; other providers suggest that the experience can change attitudes and provide essential life skills which enable a young person to change their own life [9 - 11]. It cannot be denied that Sail Training as an experiential education tool has the potential to have a profound effect on a young person, particularly those who originate from a disadvantaged background. However, does the experience in itself change a young person’s life or could it be part of a much larger systematic change; which can in turn alter a young person’s lifestyle and/or direction in life. In essence – is it more accurate to ask: Can a marine experiential education experience change a young person’s behaviour?Save to LibraryDownloadby Laura E Lyth•  2  Experiential Education, Sail TrainingAllison, P. & Von Wald, K.

This chapterexplores some aspects of the outdoors as a fantasy space. I will compare thisway of using spaces with concepts of play and storytelling and suggest that,whilst drawing on these traditions, what has developed has unique elementsthat suit it to the modern western world. I will describe the way in which themeta-narratives of the hero’s journey are used to create a structure in whichpeople can explore their autonomy, power and creativity that is their agency.In particular I will discuss how the hero’s journey offers a rite of passagefrom youth to adult at a time when this transition has become increasinglyproblematic. As outdoor education has provided this opportunity largelyunintentionally and unsystematically, this interpretation will help identifysome weaknesses in normative provision. I will conclude by identifying waysin which the hero meta-narrative might improve practice.Save to LibraryDownloadby Chris Loynes•  8  Youth Studies, Youth Work, Experiential Education, Outdoor EducationWild pedagogies and wilding pedagogies: Teacher-student-nature centredness and the challenges for teachingThe notion of wild pedagogies entreats teachers to act – to wild pedagogies – by acknowledging that more than a singular will characterizes pedagogical situations.

Wilding pedagogies requires going beyond ideas of teacher-centred and student-centred pedagogies to encompass nature-centred pedagogies: recognizing the self-will of wider nature. In attempting this wilding, we suggest teachers can learn from the previous movement from teacher-centred pedagogy to what Larry Cuban describes as teacher-centred progressivism; a hybrid pedagogy that emerged as a result of compromises between teacher-centred and student-centred pedagogies. Attempting to incorporate nature-centred pedagogies presents difficulties and opportunities for educational responses and we highlight a way forward that might be achievable via Dewey’s notion of education through occupations.Occupations are important to Dewey’s theory of experience, drawing together purpose and meaning into occupational wholes. This, we argue, presents challenges for teaching.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Quay•  5  Environmental Education, Teacher Education, Experiential Education, Outdoor EducationOutdoor Adventure Experiences for Grieving Children and Adolescents in a Transcultural ContextBereavement is theorised in many ways that have cultural as well as theoretical differences (Kuebler-Ross, 2014; Neimeyer, 2012; Smeding, 2010; Wolfelt, 2012).

As there have been radical socio-cultural changes from five generations ago to today the trend to privatization, individualization and hospitalization of dying, death and grief have forged ahead immensely. For this reason, the demand for grief counselling is increasing (Lammer, 2014). Nevertheless, children and adolescents are the so-called ‘forgotten mourners’ in North American and European societies and need special attention for this reason. The hypothesis that the outdoors can have healing effects for grieving children and adolescents will be tested and the encountered findings will be presented. This theoretical and qualitative research will shine a light on the similarities and differences between North American and European healing concepts for the bereaved in the context of outdoor activities. The socio-cultural ‘Theory of Change’ method will be used which takes a look at the topic from three different perspectives. Thus, their connections will be challenged from a grief and mourning perspective, from a human-nature relationship perspective and an outdoor educational perspective. From this theoretical background, a concept for an outdoor adventure experience for grieving children and adolescents in a transcultural context developed in cooperation with OUTWARD BOUND Germany will be introduced. Here the core values stand for the right to have fun, the awareness of fellow sufferers and the presentation of the outdoors as a healing space. The development of this program is a thought piece at this time and aims to enrich the literature on the healing effects of the outdoors for grieving children and adolescents. In practice, it will be realized for the first time in the summer of 2017 with OUTWARD BOUND Germany.Save to LibraryDownloadby Therese Oettl•  5  Experiential Education, Outdoor Education and Learning, Children and Adolescents, Grief, Loss, BereavementIncreasing Feedback Opportunities Learning the Ropes TogetherSave to LibraryDownloadby Kimberly M Cuny•  8  Feedback (Education), Experiential Education, Corrective feedback, Communication CentersAncestral Knowledge in EducationAncestral knowledges are systems of knowledge based on the epistemologies (ways of knowing), and written, oral, and spiritual traditions of Indigenous peoples.

Because of colonialism, slavery, genocide and other systems of oppression, Ancestral knowledge of some Indigenous peoples has been threatened and even erased. Ancestral knowledge has also been preserved and passed on. For example, as many Indigenous nations in the U.S. were forced into other areas of the U.S., and as Africans were enslaved in the U.S. and Latin America, they maintained varying levels of their Ancestral knowledge. Researchers suggest that it is crucial for these knowledges to be identified, maintained, and centered in schooling and other educational activities for Indigenous and Minoritized youth. Ancestral knowledges should not be viewed as a side, marginal, or elective class. Nor should they be viewed as static, finalized bodies of knowledge. Rather, they should be the centerpiece of a dynamic knowledge (and curriculum) for all students, including non-Indigenous students from dominant cultural groups. The purpose of this research brief is to highlight some of the research related to the importance of Ancestral knowledge in all schools, and particularly those that serve Indigenous and other Minoritized youth. We wish to highlight the importance of wholly accepting Indigenous youth as Ancestral (inheriting, adapting/adding to, and conveying knowledge) as well as intergenerational (gaining insight from elders, and thus assuming place in a line of knowledge transmission between generations).Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Khalifa•  14  Indigenous Studies, Indigenous education, Community Engagement & Participation, Community Based EducationOutdoor education and school curriculum distinctiveness: More than content, more than processFor many years now, those of us engaged with outdoor education curriculum work in Australia have been debating questions which orbit around the issue of defining outdoor education.

We claim to be doing so in order to clarify what we are pursuingeducationally, our purpose, not only for ourselves but for others, so that we can legitimately stake out our position, our ownlittle piece of educational turf, amongst the other subjects in the school curriculum. However, this debate has never beeneasy and any attempts to bring it to a resolution inevitably, it seems, settle some issues while heightening tensions in otherareas. In this paper I explore two of the more recent approaches to the question of outdoor education’s positioning in theschool curriculum: the question of distinctiveness and the question of indispensability. Then, through an historical excursioninvolving Australian and US curriculum history, I highlight some of the difficulties created by shifts in language use. FinallyI argue, using definitions of outdoor education that emerged in the United States in the 1950s, that the distinctiveness ofoutdoor education lies in neither a body of knowledge (content) nor skills and practices (process) but in a deeper level ofeducational understanding which emphasizes ways of being.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Quay•  8  Curriculum Studies, Curriculum Theory, Experiential Learning (Active Learning), Experiential EducationThe Substance Beneath the Labels of Experiential Learning: The Importance of John Dewey for Outdoor EducatorsThis paper recommends a reconceptualisation of “experience learning”.

It is premised on a belief that the simplistic learning cycle is problematic and moreover is an oversimplified interpretation of Kolb’s original model of experiential learning. Weargue that to understand experiential learning fully a return to the original theoretical conceptualisation by John Dewey isnecessary. Importantly Dewey conceives of an experience, and therefore the learning that results from it, as a transaction between the individual and their environment and is therefore a consequence of their ‘trying’ and ‘undergoing’ within that experience. Dewey also emphasises the importance of ‘meaning’ within experiential learning, something not fully accounted for within the simplified model. We argue that with an appreciation of Dewey the full potential of learning by, and through, the experience of outdoor education can be maximised and the full meaning of that experience explored.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark Leather and +1Jon  Ord•  3  Experiential Learning (Active Learning), Experiential Education, Experiential LearningExperiential Education as Pedagogy for Social JusticeExperiential Education as Pedagogy for Social Justice, Praxis and Practice for Shaping 21st‑Century Global Citizen Leaders Stellenbosch University’s Division Student Affairs, Centre for Student Leadership, Experiential Education end... moreExperiential Education as Pedagogy for Social Justice, Praxis and Practice for Shaping 21st‑Century Global Citizen LeadersStellenbosch University’s Division Student Affairs, Centre for Student Leadership, Experiential Education end Citizenship’s Co-curriculum Office, presented the Stellenbosch University Experiential Education Conference (SUEEC) from 10 to 11 November 2020.  This was Stellenbosch University’s first online conference and a first in South Africa and Africa focusing on experiential education and social justice. This two-day virtual highereducation conference was designed with experiential educators in civil society, university student affairs practitioners, and academics from across the world.The conference theme of ‘Experiential education as pedagogy for social justice: praxis and practice for shaping 21st-century global citizen-leaders’ emerged even more pertinent at a time of mass global upheaval, uncertainty, and humanitarian crises. The intention of the SUEEC was to spotlight emerging trends and transitions in the higher education experiential learning domain and the intersections thereof with social justice and the formation of the global citizen leader. To accomplish the above entailed inviting world-renowned keynote speakers and subject matter experts, and to call for abstracts, master classesand exemplars (examples of best practice in experiential education).Save to LibraryDownloadby Ruth Andrews•  3  Experiential Education, Educational leadership higher education, Experiential Learning TheoryExperiential Education and Learning Engagement for Year Nine Students: A Case StudyMany aspects of experiential education (EE) are well researched but there is scant research looking into the relationship between EE and learning engagement.

This research is a case study of a wide ranging EE program for year nine students and the correlation found from self-reported data through participation in the program and learning engagement.The theoretical interpretive framework (TIF) used in this study was derived from recent learning engagement literature and features three dimensions and eight axes allowing for the interpretation of primary and secondary sources of collected data. This study lies within the interpretive paradigm with data collected through a number of methods from six different sources, to allow for the con rmation of the study  ndings. Secondary data sources of existing school records including absentee data, interviews with year nine students of previous years and written work students had submitted describing their recollections of the EE program experiences. Primary data were gathered through questionnaires for students who had participated in the EE program, teachers who had worked with, or were working with, students who had participated in the program, and a focus group of current year nine students.Some signifcant  ndings include  ve broad themes relating to personal development, transfer of learning, relationships, metacognition and experiential learning, with many respondents reporting positive improvement in each of these areas. Besides these, learning engagement in the affective, behavioural and cognitive dimensions is reported on with the TIF a useful instrument to organise and report the study  ndings.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tony  Robinson•  3  Experiential Education, Outdoor Education, Motivation (Education)Outdoor studies and a sound philosophy of experienceScholars in outdoor studies have long engaged with the notion of experience in education.

This effort is necessitated by its status as a ‘field based’ endeavour, one that often attempts to challenge educational orthodoxy. The construct of experience offers a possible way through the thicket of educational questions entailed within any programme of reform, but its interpretation remains an unresolved issue.Any focus on experience draws education together with philosophy, as the two are intimately entwined. John Dewey – widely regarded as the chief architect of experience ineducation – argued, ‘if we are willing to conceive education as the process of forming fundamental dispositions, intellectual and emotional, toward nature and fellow-men [sic.], philosophy may even be defined as the general theory of education’ (1916, p. 383). In this chapter we build on Dewey’s pragmatism to outline an account of experience for outdoor studies, crafted also from Martin Heidegger’s phenomenology.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Quay•  10  Philosophy of Education, Martin Heidegger, Experiential Education, Outdoor EducationSocial Group Work in Action: A Sociometry, Psychodrama, and Experiential Trauma Group Therapy CurriculumThe demand for group work in social work practice has steadily increased while the group work education provided in social work programs has exponentially declined.

Social work education and social work practiceare intimately linked – one cannot be examined without considering the other. The historical, theoretical, andclinical intersections of social work with groups and the triadic system of J.L. Moreno (sociometry,psychodrama, and group psychotherapy) will be explored. Moreno’s work will be framed through a socialwork lens with primary concepts defined. Two trauma-specific psychodrama models (Therapeutic SpiralModel and Relational Trauma Repair Model) will be outlined with their emphasis on strengths, containment,and safety. The clinical research and integrated neurobiology research will be presented as a growing evidencebase for psychodrama and experiential trauma therapy. Next, an overview of the state of sociometry,psychodrama, and experiential group psychotherapy education will be outlined to provide a global andhistorical contextualization with an emphasis on experiential education and its complimentary nature withsocial work education. Finally, an MSW course curriculum will be provided to mediate the existing hole insocial work education resulting from the decline of group psychotherapy training.Save to LibraryDownloadby Scott Giacomucci•  12  Group Therapy, Psychodrama, Social Work, Trauma StudiesMetaverse: Building Affective Systems and Its Digital Morphologies In Virtual EnvironmentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Donizetti Louro•  8  Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality (Computer Graphics), Serious GamesTuckman revisited: Proposing a new model of group development for practitionersSave to LibraryDownloadby Kate  Cassidy•  6  Education, Experiential Education, Adventure Education, Group developmentExperiential EducationAllison, P. & Seaman, J.
