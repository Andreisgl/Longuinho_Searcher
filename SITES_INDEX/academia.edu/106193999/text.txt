VK 5738:2 is another exemplar of a well-attested clay cone of Gudea of Lagaš. The clay cone bears an M.K. signature in Arabic, indicating that it once was held in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. VK 6400:6 is a fragment of an octagonal prism of Sennacherib. Its text probably is a version of Sennacherib 17 with differing lineation, but other options remain possible. The object has been donated to the National Museum of Finland in 2004 after its re-discovery in the storerooms of the Finno-Ugrian Society. VK 6400:5 is a tablet fragment preserving text from a partially unknown royal inscription of Tiglath-pileser I. It has the same provenance as Sennacherib fragment VK 6400:6. The text on the obverse has its best parallel in the “Extended Five-Year-Annals” of Tiglath-pileser I (A.0.87.2). The reverse contains text that has its closest parallels in two inscriptions hitherto ascribed to Tiglath-pileser I’s son Aššur-bēl-kala. In 2020, Shibata proposed to rather attribute these two inscriptions to Tiglath-pileser I. The Helsinki fragment provides proof for this thesis, as the text on its reverse apparently also was part of at least some younger versions of the “Extended Five-Year-Annals”.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersChange in Neo-Assyrian Imperial Administration: Evolution and Revolution.

Noting that no detailed summary or analysis of the Egyptian presence in Assyria has yet appeared, and that the formation and status of the group had never been considered, the thesis provides an overview and analysis of the relevant data, drawn from state and private cuneiform documents. By comparing the evidence for deportation and resettlement furnished by these divergent information outlets, the thesis asks how, when, and to what extent Egyptians were incorporated into the Neo-Assyrian Empire. It also asks how far the testimony of state and private documents can be reconciled. In so doing, it provides the first synthesis of diachronic and synchronic evidence for the Egyptian diaspora in Assyria.Download Free PDFView PDF“Ulluba and Its Surroundings: Tiglath-pileser III’s province making facing the Urartian border reconsidered from royal inscriptions and letters,” S.

The volume provides reliable, up-to-date editions of seventy-three royal inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and of his son and immediate successor Shalmaneser V, eleven late Neo-Assyrian inscriptions which may be attributed to one of those two eighth-century rulers, and eight texts commissioned by Assyrian queens and high-ranking officials. Following the style of the now-defunct RIM series, each text edition (with its English translation) is supplied with a brief introduction containing general information, a catalogue containing basic information about all exemplars, a commentary containing further technical information and notes, and a comprehensive bibliography. RINAP 1 also includes: (1) a general introduction to the reigns of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V, the corpus of inscriptions, previous studies, and dating and chronology; (2) translations of the relevant passages of Mesopotamian king lists and chronicles; (3) several photographs of objects inscribed with texts of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V; (4) indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications; and (5) indices of proper names (Personal Names; Geographic, Ethnic, and Tribal Names; Divine Names; Gate, Palace, and Temple Names; and Object Names).Download Free PDFView PDFThe Royal Inscriptions of Sennacherib, King of Assyria (704–681 BC), Part 2The Royal Inscriptions of Sennacherib, King of Assyria (704–681 BC), Part 2.

The volume contains historical inscriptions on bull and lion colossi from Nineveh, rock reliefs, stone horizontal prisms, and clay cylinders and prisms from other cities under Sennacherib’s authority (especially Ashur and Tarbisu); epigraphs on reliefs; and inscriptions on bricks, threshold slabs, door sockets, wall panels, stone blocks, beads, metal plating (including door bands); and drafts and copies of historical and building inscriptions written on clay tablets.

RINAP 3/2 also includes: (1) a general introduction to the corpus of inscriptions and Sennacherib’s numerous building activities in Assyria (especially construction at Ashur); (2) several photographs of objects inscribed with texts of Sennacherib; (3) indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications; and (4) indices of proper names (Personal Names; Geographic, Ethnic, and Tribal Names; Divine, Planet, and Star Names; Gate, Palace, Temple, and Wall Names; and Object Names).Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
