Current opiate agonist treatments are an effective but limited intervention. Adjunctive interventions could improve and augment opiate agonist treatment outcomes, including drug abstinence, quality of life, and physical health. This article reviews exercise as an adjunctive intervention for opiate agonist treatment, especially in regards to improving mood and overall quality of life, while reducing other substance use. Poor adherence and dropout frequently prevent many individuals from garnering the many physical and mental health benefits of exercise. Strategies for implementing an exercise intervention, including safety considerations, are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaci VanHeest•  20  Psychology, Psychiatry, Mental Health, Patient SafetyThe role of disgust propensity and sensitivity on sexual excitation and inhibition in obsessive-compulsive disorderSexuality is understudied in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

According to the Dual Control Model, low sexual excitation (SE) and high sexual inhibition (SI) are indicative of a higher probability of experiencing a sexual dysfunction. The present study investigated SE and SI in OCD patients compared with controls. It was hypothesized that OCD patients report lower SE and higher SI than controls. Given their potential role as inhibitors of sexual response, it was hypothesized that in the OCD group higher disgust propensity/sensitivity, contamination/washing symptoms, unacceptable thoughts, and obsessive beliefs predicted lower SE, higher SI due to Threat of Performance Failure, and higher SI due to Threat of Performance Consequences.

Psychotherapeutic interventions also offer the opportunity for individuals with dementia and their families/caregivers to engage in psychological support for a wide range of presentations. However, little is known about how those within this demographic who receive these interventions perceive the experience. This study aimed to understand the experiences of individuals with dementia or caring for someone with dementia, before and after a 12-week relational counselling intervention delivered through a third sector organisation within England.

From a practical viewpoint, the axioms offer us elements that we can fall back on when in doubt about the way to proceed. These basic axioms support the way of thinking behind the solution-focused approach. They form the foundations on which we base our interventions. The basic axioms we are dealing with are: (1) resource orientation; (2) resilience; (3) the science of well-being; (4) working in a client-oriented way; (5) systemic approach and practice; (6) the four-leaf clover: cognition-emotion-behavior-interaction. When we intervene with our clients, the basic axioms help us see beyond mere solutionfocused techniques. They help us create a rich world of ideas from which to draw incisive interventions. Basic axioms Solution-focused therapy originally does not result from big theories but from daily practice. de Shazer and his team strived to make the clients suffer less by eliminating all unnecessary detours like delving in the past, searching for root causes, or applying the diagnosis-treatment chain. Bypassing these classical routes and going straight for the solution-focused approach that you will encounter in this book saves time and energy. Even if it is not the goal but a welcome side-effect, the solution-focused approach works faster and produces more robust outcomes. That's where the original name comes from: Brief Family Therapy. But SoFAP is not based on mere personal views and opinions. SoFAP is based on views from related scientific fields that we transform into axioms: unproven statements that are accepted as foundations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Louis Cauffman•Child abuse and youSave to LibraryDownloadby Jean Labbé•  3  Medicine, Paediatrics & Child Health, Paediatrics and reproductive medicineEarly intervention for incipient insanity: early notions from the 19(th) century English literatureEarly intervention programmes in mental illnesses started to bloom in the 1990s, and many programmes have been established worldwide during the past twenty years.

However, the concept of early intervention has emerged during the 19th century but it did not make much impact on practice. The aim of this review is to identify the difficulties appeared during that period of time which could provide insight into the modern development of early intervention initiatives. A narrative review which focused on English literature about early intervention for insanity during the 19th century was undertaken. Clinicians during the 19th century recognized that treatment would be the most effective at the early stage of the mental illness and they had emphasized the importance of early intervention. However, because of a number of factors, such as the limited roles of asylums, lack of knowledge about mental disorder and the lack of effective treatment, the idea of early intervention did not make imp...Save to LibraryDownloadby Hằng Châu•  11  Psychology, Psychiatry, Early Intervention, PsychotherapyEffective Delivery Styles and Content for Self-management Interventions for Chronic Musculoskeletal PainSave to LibraryDownloadby Anisur Rahman•  16  Psychotherapy, Chronic Pain, Self Care, MedicineExploring theOtherDark Continent: Parallels between Psi Phenomena and the Psychotherapeutic ProcessSave to LibraryDownloadby Ruth Rosenbaum•  13  Psychology, Parapsychology, Psychoanalysis, Psychotherapy0648 Retinal responsivity is associated with light and season-related cognitions in older adults with seasonal depressionIntroduction Maladaptive cognitions associated with lower light availability in winter and the changing of the seasons are elevated in winter depression and are treatment targets in psychotherapy.

Mechanisms underlying the development of SAD-specific cognitions may be related to seasonal variation in melanopsin-driven retinal responsivity to light. Prior work has shown reduced retinal responsivity to light during the winter in seasonal depression. We hypothesized maladaptive seasonal cognitions would be associated with reduced retinal responses to light. We also tested whether age moderated this relationship, hypothesizing that this learned association may only appear in older individuals who have experienced a greater number of seasonal depressive episodes. Methods Participants ages 19-65 (M=36.13, SD=12.81) with seasonal depression (n=37) and non-depressed controls (n=32) completed assessments in winter months (21st December to 21st March).

Heterogeneous findings may point to the role of influencing factors. The current questionnaire study investigates the relationship between genetic testing, psychological well-being, and surveillance behavior. The role of sex, age, SES, carrier status, time since testing, number of children, and coping is examined. The research sample consists of 119 presymptomatic BRCA mutation carriers and non-carriers (Mage=41.71,SD=11.05). Results indicated that genetic testing is related to psychological wellbeing over time. Women report more distress than men, carriers more than non-carriers. Coping at the moment of the genetic testing also influences psychological well-being over time. The more people used an emotion-oriented and problem-oriented coping style at the moment of testing, the lower their psychological wellbeing over time.

In addition to disease-specific knowledge, self-care and adequate responses to emotional needs seem to be vital for a sufficient glycemic control. Method: We examined the emotional impairments in 121 type I and type II diabetics by measuring their extent of alexithymic characteristics via the Toronto-Alexithymia-Scale (TAS-26). Results: Both diabetic patients (type I and type II) showed significant more difficulties in identifying and verbalizing emotions than the norm sample, but a lower external-oriented thinking style. In this context, we found no differences between type I and type II diabetics. The implications of these findings for the diabetes care are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Interventions in Obesity & Diabetes•  5  Nutrition and Dietetics, Psychotherapy, Glucose, Metabolic disorders[Quality of certificates of assault and battery on adults in Dakar and Diourbel, Senegal]Save to LibraryDownloadby mamadou baïlo sow•  8  Violence, Medicine, Senegal, HumansBehavioural activation therapy for anxiety disorders in adultsSave to LibraryDownloadby Maria Iqbal•  4  Psychology, Medicine, Anxiety, ANXIETYAbordaje psicoterapéutico en pacientes con cáncer de mamaSave to LibraryDownloadby Ivonne Rosario•  3  Breast Cancer, Psychotherapy Research, MedicineMANUAL IFSSave to LibraryDownloadby GORDILLO CHAVEZ ARTURO .ARTURO•Práticas psicológicas e dimensões de significação dos problemas de saúde mentalBuscou-se compreender como atuam os psicólogos e quais significados atribuem às práticas psicológicas desenvolvidas nos serviços públicos de saúde de Salvador.

Two groups receiving 8 sessions of FAP (n=26) or Interpersonal Skills training (n=24) where compared. T-test analyses found statistically significant (p<0.05) and large (Cohen's d≥0.80) improvements for FAP group participants at post-test compared to pre-test in BPD symptom severity, intimacy, experience of self and emotion regulation. Between groups analysis found statistically significant and large effects in favor of FAP, with the largest differences observed in intimacy. Regression analysis found a reduction in the relation between intimacy and BPD severity before (R 2 =0.324) and after FAP treatment (R 2 =0.11).
