HoekKim M CohenTALK - The impact of transient climate change, for example at glacial-interglacial transitions, on the alluvial valley of the lower reaches of larger river systems has become a classic topic of fluvial geomorphology and quaternary geological study. The process of contraction of Holocene river activity into a narrower channel belt than in LGM counterparts of the last cycle, links to terrace flight formation over multiple glacial cycles in inland reaches. Not only were valley reaches affected by the process: also the lower reaches traversing shelf areas were, at a critical time just before their transgression. It is important to get fluvial style change mapped and dated accurately, to contribute to Source-2-Sink style sediment budgeting studies and be able to quantify sediment routing over longer time scales ‘from the record’ rather than ‘from assumptions pasted in models’. In the Netherlands, in our current time, we are favoured by a very well resolved Late Pleistocene and Holocene geological record. This is due to favourable palaeogeographical circumstances and long research tradition from academia and applied fields. The sheer amount area mapped in detail, and sheer number of ‘to-be-integrated’ studies made it fruitful to set up and fill a GIS system for the reconstruction of valley evolution since the LGM (Cohen et al., 2012), expanding earlier such work for the Holocene Rhine delta (Berendsen et al., 2007). The reconstruction now covers the Valley evolution of the Rhine since the LGM, continuous in space and time from upstream reaches in the German Lower Rhine Embayment (Erkens et al., 2011), through the Dutch-German border area (e.g. Kasse et al., 2005; Janssens et al. 2012), the central delta (Busschers et al., 2007; Gouw & Erkens, 2007) to the present river mouth and beyond (Hijma et al. 2009; 2012). To produce the map, we filled a digital catalogue documenting each mapped element (paleomeanders, terrace-fragments) in the valley. Reconstruction of reworking as part of the valley evolution is an intrinsic part of the encoding in the GIS. The main finding in the Lower Rhine is that the studied transition appears to last longer and to be slower than in smaller rivers of NW Europe. From the LGM to after the transgression, the area was subsiding relatively fast owing to the near-field GIA circumstances on top of background tectonics. All the time the area was fed river water and sediment by the Rhine: a sizable mixed-load river system. During the period of interest, climatic amelioration made vegetation go through a distinct succession. Not only does this provide extra dating control beyond direct methods of 14C and OSL, but also does this provide opportunities to reconstruct local and regional hydrological changes and relate this to the changes in fluvial style and reworking (scour, incision, levee deposition, lateral migration, floodplain soil formation). Extensive areal palaeogeographical reconstruction (GIS map and catalogue) shows the Lower Rhine's valley evolution from LGM to Holocene in unprecedented detail. Extended Abstract - Cohen, K.M., W.Z.

This approach permits comparison of actual versus conceptual boundaries of the lowstand, transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The inland position of the highstand Rhine river mouth on a wide, low-gradient continental shelf meant that base-level changes were the dominant control on sedimentation for a relatively short period of the last glacial cycle. Systems in such inland positions predominantly record changes in the balance between river discharge and sediment load, and preserve excellent records of climatic changes or other catchment-induced forcing. It is shown here that the transgressive systems tract-part of the coastal prism formed in three stages: (i) the millennium before 8·45 ka bp, when the area was dominated by fluvial environments with extensive wetlands; (ii) the millennium after 8·45 ka, characterized by strong erosion, increasing tidal amplitudes and bay-head delta development; and (iii) the period between 7·5 and 6·3 ka bp when the Rhine avulsed multiple times and the maximum flooding surface formed. The diachroneity of the transgressive surface is strongly suppressed because of a pulse of accelerated sea-level rise at 8·45 ka bp. That event not only had a strong effect on preservation, but has circum-oceanic stratigraphical relevance as it divides the early and middle Holocene parts of coastal successions worldwide. The palaeogeographical reconstruction offers a unique full spatial–temporal view on the coastal and fluvial dynamics of a major river mouth under brief rapid forced transgression. This reconstruction is of relevance for Holocene and ancient transgressive systems worldwide, and for next-century natural coasts that are predicted to experience a 1 m sea-level rise.Download Free PDFView PDFEarth-Science ReviewsPreservation of Last Interglacial and Holocene transgressive systems tracts in the Netherlands and its applicability as a North Sea Basin reservoir analogue2019 • Jan PeetersUnderstanding of complex sedimentary records formed by transgressive systems is critical for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, and carbon capture and storage. This paper discusses the facies proportions and preservation of the Last Interglacial and Holocene transgressive systems tracts in the Netherlands and their applicability as a North Sea Basin analogue for the Early Jurassic Åre Formation in the Norwegian offshore. New and existing data from both (sub-)modern transgressive Rhine records were thoroughly reviewed from a sequence stratigraphic perspective, before volumetrics were calculated and longitudinal trends quantified at reservoir scale. Large differences between the Last Interglacial and Holocene transgressive systems were found: the volume of fluvial deposits is almost six times larger and the volume of organics nearly twenty times larger in the Holocene record than in the Last Interglacial record. In contrast, the volume of estuarine deposits in the Holocene record is only half of that of the Last Interglacial record. Remarkably, both records show similar averaged sediment-trapping rates of 8–9 km 3 /ka. Initial valley configuration and relative sea-level rise-rates during both transgressions were key controls on the volume and spatial arrangement of the transgressive deposits. Relative sea-level fall and river avulsion determined what amount of sediment was left preserved after completion of one interglacial-glacial cycle. Comparison of the Late Quaternary Rhine records with the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Åre Formation in the Heidrun Field off mid-Norway, showed the potential of the (sub-)modern Rhine records as analogues for ancient stratigraphic records. Especially the transgressive Rhine sequence from the Last Interglacial provided remarkable similarities in facies proportions, preservability, autogenic processes and controlling forcings, ranging from metre-scale vertical-successions to kilometre-scale field-wide events for parts of the Åre Formation. The side-by-side availability of the truncated Last Interglacial and (still) fully preserved Holocene transgressive system proved to be an excellent natural laboratory to study the stratigraphic architecture and assess depositional trends and preservability over longer time scales (> 100 ka). It nevertheless demonstrates that no 'one-size-fits-all' analogue exists, but that various other analogues are needed to solve the complex puzzle which the Åre Formation resembles.Download Free PDFView PDFThe 2011 edition of Utrecht University’s Rhine-Meuse delta geological – geomorphological map ( XXXL poster session )Kim M CohenThe Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta behind the Holland barrier coast (Southern North Sea Basin, The Netherlands) is very densely mapped and studied. Following the milestone publication of a palaeogeographical reconstruction and geological-geomorphological map in 2000/2001 by Berendsen and Stouthamer, Utrecht University’s Rhine-Meuse Delta Studies group, in our Delta Evolution umbrella research programme and combined with our MSc and BSc teaching, has expanded and improved the mapping. 20 PhD-thesis and postdoc projects in the period 2002-2011, from which contributions are found in various sessions at this congress, increased our genetic insights in the architectural build up and formative processes of the Rhine-Meuse delta. On this XXXL poster, we present the completely revised 2011 version of our delta mapping. The covered area is extended to the west, north and southeast, now including: the coastal-fluvial river mouth (Rotterdam subsurface), distributaries into the central Netherlands lagoon (Utrechtse Vecht and Gelderse IJssel), the delta apex and lower Rhine valley into Germany (Rhein, Lippe, Issel and Niers). It is more accurate thanks to Lidar elevation data (www.ahn.nl) and improved inter-institute geo-information management and exchange (1:5,000 delta wide!*) Co-operations with colleagues at TNO Geological Survey of the Netherlands, Deltares and VU Amsterdam were critical in studying Late Pleistocene and Holocene developments in continuum. We can now link last glacial valley evolution, post-glacial transgression and high stand delta evolution 1:1:1. The mapping is product and output of our GIS for channel-belt network reconstruction, maintained since 1999. It serves a wide range of academic research, and has found wide applied usage in archeological prospection, 3D subsurface mapping and shallow geohydrology. Updating of the mapping is an iterative process that profits from continuous feedback from these applications. * XXXL poster map scale is 1:60,000Download Free PDFView PDFAntiquityArchaeological resource modelling in temperate river valleys: a case study from the Trent Valley, UK2008 • Phillip S TomsDownload Free PDFView PDFQuaternary InternationalGeoarchaeological records in temperate European river valleys: Quantifying the resource, assessing its potential and managing its future2014 • S.

Quaternary climatic history, which importantly included glaciation, combined with tectonics gave rise to cyclic and non-cyclic changes of sedimentation and erosion patterns. Large-scale landscape reorganisations left strong imprints in the preserved record, and are important for the detail that palaeogeographical reconstructions for the North Sea area can achieve. In the spirit of the North Sea Prehistory Research and Management Framework (NSPRMF; Peeters et al., 2009), this paper provides background geological information regarding the North Sea. It summarises current stratigraphical and chronological frameworks and provides an overview of sedimentary environments. As we go back in time, the understanding of Quaternary palaeo-environmental evolution in the North Sea basin during the last 1 million years becomes decreasingly accurate, with degree of preservation and accuracy of age control equally important controls. Comparing palaeogeographical reconstructions for the Middle Pleistocene, the last interglacial-glacial cycle and the period following the Last Glacial Maximum illustrates this. More importantly, a series of palaeogeographical maps provide an account of basin-scale landscape change, which provides an overall framework for comparing landscape situations through time.
