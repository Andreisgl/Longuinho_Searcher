To do this, the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) methods were used. The geometry of model apparatus was similar to those applied in industry. The composition of suspensions and their physical properties were the same as in practical cases.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersChemical Engineering and Processing: Process IntensificationMultiphase CFD modeling: Fluid dynamics aspects in scale-up of a fluidized-bed crystallizer2013 • Piotr Synowiec, Janusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFContents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process IntensiﬁcationJanusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering ScienceFluid-dynamics scale-up problems in the DTM crystallizer2012 • Piotr Synowiec, Janusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFHydrodynamic modeling of fluidized-bed crystallizers with use of the multiphase CFD method2009 • Janusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFPolish Journal of Chemical TechnologyTwo-phase CFD simulation of the monodyspersed suspension hydraulic behaviour in the tank apparatus from a circulatory pipe2008 • Piotr Synowiec, Janusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering & TechnologyThe Influence of a Constructional Solution of the Crystallizer with a Jet Pump on Crystal Attrition2005 • Krzysztof PiotrowskiThe research results concerning attrition of sodium chloride crystals in two types of jet pump crystallizers are presented. It was demonstrated that in the crystallizer with a jet pump crystals undergo considerable smaller attrition compared to the one equipped with agitator and draft tube (circulation profile). The influence of the initial mean crystal size, crystal volumetric concentration in the suspension and the residence time of the suspension in the crystallizer on the degree of solid phase destruction was determined and quantified in the form of empirical equations. The DTM MSCPR construction demonstrates the least destruction capabilities.Download Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering & TechnologyReaction-Crystallization of Struvite in a Continuous Liquid Jet-Pump DTM MSMPR Crystallizer with Upward Circulation of Suspension in a Mixing Chamber – an SDG Kinetic Approach2007 • Krzysztof PiotrowskiThe experimental results concerning kinetic aspects of struvite precipitation in a continuous DTM-type crystallizer with internal circulation of suspension forced by a liquid jet-pump are presented and discussed. Nucleation and crystal growth rates of struvite during reaction-crystallization processes in diluted water solutions of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate ions were identified. Kinetic parameters were calculated on the basis of population density distributions adopting a simplified model of the mass crystallization process in a MSMPR crystallizer taking under consideration size-dependent growth (SDG) mechanism. The Rojkowski hyperbolic SDG model has proved to be the equation best statistically fitted to our own data set.Download Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering Research and DesignModelling of crystal growth of KDP in a 100dm3 suspension crystallizer using combination of CFD and multiblock model2010 • Juha Kallas, Maret LiiriABSTRACT In this study a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multiblock model is used for modelling crystal growth in a 100dm3 suspension crystallizer equipped with two turbine impellers. Local hydrodynamics and crystal suspension densities were modelled using CFD. Simulation results were compared with experimental results to verify flow profile and slip velocities (Hatakka et al., 2008, 2009), and classification of crystals. Results from CFD simulations were then translated to a proper form and used as input data for the multiblock model.The same multiblock model has previously been used successfully for modelling gas–liquid systems (Laakkonen, 2006). For this study a growth model for potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) was imported into the multiblock model. We used the power-law growth model including activity-based driving force. The growth model was developed based on single crystal experiments of KDP (Liiri et al., 2006). Growth of KDP crystals in the 100dm3 suspension crystallizer was simulated with the multiblock model. Verification was done by comparing the simulated results with results from crystal growth experiments.Download Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering Research and DesignFlow Visualization in Stirred Vessels2001 • Paul MavrosDownload Free PDFView PDFPowder TechnologyApplication of CFD simulation to suspension crystallization—factors affecting size-dependent classification2001 • Pekka  OinasDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
