The leadership process in Bolivia and especially Morales’ response to the country’s situation are examined with a focus on the president's charismatic relationship to his followers. I close by evaluating the outcomes of the Bolivian case by proving the consistency of the new administrations’ actions with initial aspirations.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInformal Institutions and Party Organization: Insights from the MASSantiago AnriaDownload Free PDFView PDFDemocracy Promotion & “Democratic Revolution”: Political Change in Bolivia, US and German Reactions and Some Normative Implications2010 • Jonas WolffMainstream thinking on democratization suggests that democracy promotion in post-transition countries includes the elimination of authoritarian legacies and other “defects” of democracy in order to help the respective “recipient” countries along the linear path towards “full-fledged” democracy. Correspondingly, the task of contributing to the “deepening” of democracy was seen as generally unproblematic: partial movements towards “more” democracy in different sectors would be mutually reinforcing and would, at the same time, strengthen existing democratic institutions. The recent and ongoing transformation of democracy in Bolivia clearly deviates from this linear and harmonious script. Here, the “deepening” of democracy in terms of more participation and representation proves a conflict-ridden process that goes hand in hand with an open challenge to the democratic “institutionality” as it had been established in the 1980s. The paper, first, summarizes main characteristics of the ongoing transformation of democracy in contemporary Bolivia. Second, the actual reactions and (non-) adjustments of US and German democracy promotion policies to this political change are traced. Third, the paper considers the normative implications of these experiences (with the democratic, but conflict-ridden transformation processes in Bolivia as well as with US and German contributions to and interventions in these processes) for the premises and conceptions of external democracy promotion policies.Download Free PDFView PDFPRIF Working Paper 5Self-Determination and Empowerment as Challenges to Democracy Promotion.

Insights into the nationalist revolution and pluri-national refoundation through demands for autonomy2019 • Britta K MatthesIn March 2018, the Institute of Latin American Studies and the Anglo-Bolivian Society hosted the conference “Revolutions in Bolivia”. The event aimed to explore the divergent perspectives on 12 years of Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) rule, inspired – or not – by the 1952 revolution that resulted in a similar period of political dominance: 12 continuous years by the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR), 1952-1964. Now we have the pleasure to present this EBook that contains the papers from the conference. CONTENT INTRODUCTION Winston Moore, Anglo-Bolivian Society 1.

However, the concrete implementation of the indigenous rights is partial and ambivalent, provoking the question about the real change of power relations between the state and indigenous peoples. Moreover, since the indigenous discourse became inherent part of state narratives and symbolic machinery, the state has gained monopoly about indigeneity and uses it to construct a new political-cultural community, based on plural ethnic identities merged into a broad, inclusive indianised state nation. This paper seeks to respond if the new Bolivian (pluri)national project is truly new or is it rather a renewed version of an old nation-state project?Download Free PDFView PDFRevolutions in Bolivia. Papers from the conference in March 2018 arranged by the Anglo-Bolivian Society and the Institute of Latin American Studies, University of LondonWhose autonomy is it anyway? Tensions between class and ethnicity in the formation of collective citizenship and self-determination in Plurinational Bolivia2019 • Jonathan AldermanIn December 2009, Charazani was one of eleven municipalities in Bolivia to vote in local referendums to begin a process of becoming in an indigenous autonomy or Autonomía Indígena Originario Campesina (AIOC). My research studied how the autonomy project arose in Charazani, and why it has still not come to fruition. Charazani’s autonomy project was derailed by conflicts between the local branches of the highland indigenous peoples’ federation, CONAMAQ, and the peasant union, the CSUTCB (Confederación Sindical Única de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia). I examine the conflict as between different ideals of nationalism and autonomy. The first vision, embodied by CONAMAQ (Consejo Nacional de Ayllus y Markas del Qullasuyu), is the nationalism of the plurinational constitution, which disconnects the nation from the state, and conflates it with ethnicity. The second vision, of the peasant union, inherited from the National Revolution, is a nationalism of the Bolivian state, defining autonomy as the autonomy of the Bolivian state from foreign interference. Through Charazani’s autonomy project I discuss how class, ethnicity and different visions of autonomy and the nation clash within the plurinational state.Download Free PDFView PDFFrom “Parliamentarized” to “Pure” Presidentialism: Bolivia after October 20032008 • Miguel  CentellasAmong the many shifts in Bolivian politics since October 2003 is a subtle, yet significant change in the country's presidential system. Bolivia has recently transitioned from a "parliamentarized" to a "pure" presidentialism. In the previous system (1985-2002), Bolivian presidents were chosen by the legislature and led multiparty coalition governments. Since October 2003, Bolivia has instead been governed by two independent chief executives. This paper discusses the shift in presidential behavior by analyzing the similarities between Carlos Mesa and Evo Morales—who also fit the description of "delegative democrats" or "populists"—and their consequences for democratic stability (the lack of a constitutional "crisis"). It also considers potential reforms recently approved by the country's Constitutional Assembly and suggests that many of the benefits of "parliamentarized" presidentialism are still relevant for constitutional engineers.Download Free PDFView PDFDemocracy on stilts: Bolivia's democracy from stability to crisis2007 • Miguel  CentellasDownload Free PDFView PDFBolivia's Party System after October 2003: Where Did all the Politicians Go?2007 • Miguel  CentellasBolivia’s political system has recently undergone a dramatic transformation after nearly two decades dominated by three “systemic” parties (MNR, ADN, MIR). Despite resisting challenges from “outsiders” (whether populists, leftists, or indigenous movements) for nearly two decades, the party system was quickly swept away after the “gas war” of October 2003. In its place, the new political landscape appears polarized into two distinct camps: Evo Morales’s MAS and an opposition led by PODEMOS. This paper offers a preliminary exploratory look at Bolivia’s most recent political transformation, looking particularly at the migration patterns of Bolivian career politicians between the 2002 and 2005 general elections.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
