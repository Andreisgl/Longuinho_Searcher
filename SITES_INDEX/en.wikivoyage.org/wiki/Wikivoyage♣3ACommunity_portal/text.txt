Policies and guidelines
The traveller comes first
The core underlying principle of Wikivoyage is that it is written for the benefit of travellers. The question "what is best for the traveller" should always guide decision making.
Goals and non-goals
Our goal is to create a free, complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide. This policy page gives you important information on what we are, and what we are not.
Consensus
In Wikivoyage, almost all decisions are made by achieving consensus rather than voting — so state your arguments and build consensus for debatable matters.
Plunge forward
Don't worry about being perfect or making mistakes. If something needs to be done, do it. Jump in and make useful edits to articles.
Manual of style
Our Manual of style is a collection of rules of thumb and guidelines for giving Wikivoyage articles a consistent look and feel.

Help and tutorials
Quick contribution guide
This guide provides suggestions for making your first contribution to this wiki. In general it is best to start out by contributing a listing for your favorite attraction, restaurant, or bar rather than trying to create a new article or make formatting changes to an existing article.
Tips for new contributors
This page gives a set of tips and tricks that might help you get up to speed working on Wikivoyage articles and participating in the Wikivoyage community.
Arrivals lounge
Here is where new contributors can post questions to be answered by experienced contributors.
How to draw static maps and dynamic maps
In this age of satellites and GPS, you no longer need to be a professional cartographer to draw an accurate map. The static map tutorial gives instructions for creating standard Wikivoyage maps using Inkscape, while dynamic maps are generated from (lat, long) co-ordinates on OpenStreetMap base maps. Complete amateurs have created some of our best maps following this guide.
How to re-use Wikivoyage guides
Wikivoyage articles and images are available under a copyleft license. This means you can redistribute and modify them in any medium, as long as you follow a few simple rules. This page gives an overview on how to re-use Wikivoyage content by third parties.
