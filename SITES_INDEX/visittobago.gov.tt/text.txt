      Fun Facts
  
Bacolet bay Beach was the location for the 1960 movie, Swiss Family Robinson and a favorite frolicking spot for the Beatles in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Bloody Bay, on the Leeward coast, is named after a bloody naval battle that is reputed to have turned the blue waters red with blood. However, some claim that the beach was stained by red earth deposits.
