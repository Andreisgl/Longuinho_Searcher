An alchemical wedding that defines the fixed place, where boundaries are actively transgressed. In many ways, this point of intersection—this crossroads—is where the role of the magician, mystic and artist collide. Where each can play a role in revealing the neoteric and the numinous, while making ruinous the antiquated and the corrupt. Revelation and revolution are often intimately linked; the sudden and violent unveiling of the truly novel, utterly alien, and ineffably Other, brings with it the upheaval of our very foundations—that of the individual, and of the societies we build. The art of revelation, is the art of cataclysm and catharsis. The first Trans- States conference, The Art of Crossing Over, themed itself upon the Major Arcana card, The Hanged Man, and focused solely on boundary crossing, liminality and the queering of normativity. This upcoming Trans- States conference, The Art of Revelation, themes itself upon The Tower. As such, it seeks to broaden its scope to include the shock and awe of revelatory and paradigm-shifting occultural experiences; the impact and implications of anti-structure, of alterations in consciousness and of the revolutionary aspects of paranormality. This is a transdisciplinary conference that will explore the complex interrelationships between contemporary occulture, revelation, non-ordinary states of consciousness, power, structure, textuality and deconstruction.Download Free PDFView PDFTrans- States: The Art of Crossing Over (2016 conference)Cavan McLaughlintrans- prefix meaning: across, beyond, through, on the other side of, to go beyond state: a condition or way of being that exists at a particular time An unabashed play on words, a Trans- State is, among other things, a coincidentia oppositorum. An alchemical wedding that defines the fixed place, where boundaries are actively transgressed. In many ways, this very undertaking is where the role of the magician, mystic and artist collide. Down at the crossroads, where possibilities are collapsed into actualities, by the wondrous act of a conscious decision: there lies the place of suffering and surrender; of realisation and redemption. This is a transdisciplinary conference that will explore representations in contemporary visual culture of boundary crossing, liminality and queerification with specific relation to occultism, mysticism, shamanism and other esoteric and spiritual practices. http://www.trans-states.orgDownload Free PDFView PDFESSWE newsletter interviewBernd-Christian OttoTogether with Carole Cusack, I have been interviewed for the ESSWE newsletter 9/1 (2018).Download Free PDFView PDFESSWE Newsletter"Scholar Interviews" en ESSWE Newsletter, Winter 2021, Vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 8-92021 • Juan Pablo BubelloDownload Free PDFView PDFPhD Presentation : ESSWE Newsletter, Autumn 2011Simon MagusDownload Free PDFView PDFESSWE Newsletter Vol. 2.
