As such, Whose Lives… is able to address the questions that pertain to the emergence of "independent cinema" over the past 30-40 years. Indeed, the book outlines the full gamut of historical periods associated with different kinds of biopic subjects: the classical, celebratory form (melodrama); warts-and-all (melodrama/realism); transition from producer's genre to auteur's genre; critical investigation and atomisation of the subject; parody; culture based on consumerism and celebrity; minority appropriation (queer, feminist, African American, Third World, etc.); and neoclassical biopic, which integrates all of the above. Thus, although he does not use the ubiquitous term "postmodernism" very often, Bingham is able to bring biopic history and aesthetics up to date by historicising the stylistic paradigm in terms of his chosen films' artistic and national/international contexts. This is perhaps the chief methodological...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers"Introduction: The Biopic and its Critical Contexts", in THE BIOPIC IN CONTEMPORARY FILM CULTURE, pp 1-32. Eds. Tom Brown and Belén Vidal. Routledge 2014.2014 • Belén Vidal"The biographical film or biopic is a staple of film production in all major film industries and yet, within film studies, its generic, aesthetic, and cultural significance has remained underexplored. The Biopic in Contemporary Film Culture fills this gap, conceptualizing the biopic with a particular eye toward the "life" of the genre internationally. New theoretical approaches combine with specially commissioned chapters on contemporary biographical film production in India, Italy, South Korea, France, Russia, Great Britain, and the US, in order to present a selective but well-rounded portrait of the biopic’s place in film culture. From Marie Antoinette to The Social Network, the pieces in this volume critically examine the place of the biopic within ongoing debates about how cinema can and should represent history and "real lives." Contributors discuss the biopic’s grounding in the conventions of the historical film, and explore the genre’s defining traits as well as its potential for innovation. The Biopic in Contemporary Film Culture expands the critical boundaries of this evolving, versatile genre."Download Free PDFView PDFWhose lives are they anyway?: the biopic as contemporary film genre2010 • Dennis  BinghamDownload Free PDFView PDFFlirting with Controversy: Making Biopics about Truman CapoteDelphine LetortDownload Free PDFView PDF"Woody Guthrie, Warts-and-All: The Biopic in the New American Cinema of the 1970s" Dennis  BinghamDownload Free PDFView PDFBook Review: Adaptation, Intermediality and the British Celebrity Biopic.

Disembodied Voices in The King's Speech and The Theory of Everything." A Companion to the Biopic, ed. Deborah Cartmell and Ashley D. Polasek (Chichester, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2020), 269-2822020 • Alexa Alice  Joubin“Can you hear me?” asks Stephen Hawking towards the end of The Theory of Everything. Slumping in a motorized wheelchair, theoretical physicist Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) poses the question in a monotonic, computer-generated voice with staccato quality to an eager audience through his speech synthesizer. Even though he is physically present, his disembodied voice fills the auditorium in ways that suggest both his earth-bound reality and transcendental status. The question “can you hear me” is a profound moment that invites various levels of interpretation. On a literal level it is a quotidian question about legibility and whether the speaker is audible, but it bears symbolic significance at the end of this film, which generates consensual pleasure. On a philosophical level, it asks both the audiences within and outside the film’s universe whether they understand him after following the biopic subject around in his wheelchair through his tribulations and triumphs. On a metacinematic level, it asks whether the biopic as a redemptive genre merely speaks for its subject or allows Hawking to speak for himself. Perhaps a more urgent question for adaptation studies is whether the biopic subject can speak and be truly heard. Two recent biopics, The King's Speech (dir. Tom Hooper, 2010) and The Theory of Everything (dir. James Marsh, 2015), seek to give a voice to their historical and contemporary subjects who could only speak in disembodied voices. The films navigate the fine lines between public disgust of voice disability and the craving for what might be called “supercrip” figures—figures who are defined by their physical limitations but who, because of their disability, are perceived as possessing extraordinary talents and abilities. The adaptations of King George VI's and Stephen Hawking's life stories show their uneasy relationship to the "troubled-white-male-genius" genre and to the vocal embodiment of their subjects who lose and gain a voice through therapy, technology, and their will to live a full life. The films carefully skirt the edges of public disgust and pity of differently abled bodies: how the stuttering King George VI struggles to find his voice and adapt to the then emerging and increasingly important radio broadcasting technology; and how the physicist Stephen Hawking speaks through a speech synthesizer.Download Free PDFView PDFFilm directors biopics in HollywoodFátima ChinitaIn the Hollywood metafilm, from the Studio System period to the present day, only a few film directors have been tackled on screen. Also, whereas the biopic of Hollywood stars is usually simply a " rags to riches " tale and/or vice-versa, the film director biopic is foremost the evidence of an authorial discourse, although presented with some sentiment. In other words, what moves some filmmakers (especially directors) to approach the life and art of their famous peers is a wish to reflect on the nature of their common medium and on the quality of their own output. This article focuses on two films: " Chaplin " (1992, directed by Richard Attenborough) and " Ed Wood " (1994, directed by Tim Burton). From very early in his cinematic career, Charlie Chaplin was as famous as he was infamous, whereas Ed Wood was never famous and barely infamous. Still, the best and the worst film directors are portrayed in a style not entirely dissimilar to one another in their respective biopics, and in compliance with the rules advocated by Aristotle for tragedy in the " Poetics. " These two films manage to portray, from beginning to end, the essence of the charismatic celebrities they depict. With that aim, they de-mythicize both the men and the medium they worked for, but only in order to re-mythicize the directors and cinema in a new splendour.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
