Of the rites of passage rituals, the coming of agerituals and the death rituals stand out as a community’s most significant. The religious views held by the Celtic peoples support this view of the importance of death rituals. This short paper will provide an overview of the Celtic religious views and then provide details to explain what can be known about their death rituals.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, reading the Tain shows us a great deal about the role of women in ancient Ireland.

Known variously as Virtue Ethics, Consequentialism, or Ethics of Caring, these theories hold that the female perspectives on morality are the more positive approach for ethics1. Three of this arena’s main players are Elizabeth Anscombe, Nel Noddings, and Carol Gilliagan. These women are professional philosophers generating scholarly works on morality, but they are also producing their studies with a common voice. This common voice is one which centers on the ideas of relationships, intention, needs, subjectivity and similar concepts. The purpose of this essay is to review published works from each of the three philosophers to show evidence of that common voice. For Elizabeth Anscombe, I will discuss her seminal work “Modern Moral Philosophy” which was originally published in 1958. Nel Noddings’s voice will be explored by reviewing a section of her text Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education. Carol Gilligan’s discussion “Is There a Characteristically Feminine Voice Defining Morality” provides us with the third work to review. Despite arriving at their theories from different realms of scholarship, these philosophers’ works show that there is indeed a common philosophical voice among them that is distinctly female.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the surface, the Hebrew book of Isaiah is simply another book prophesying the end of Judaism as a result of Jews failing to worship their god.  However, by taking an exegetic look, it becomes possible to understand the book in much greater detail.  Literary Criticism, Historical Criticism, and Structural Criticism each add pieces to the puzzle of Isaiah.  By using these approaches not only is it possible to see how much of a cultural product the book of Isaiah is, but the exegetical process also shows the underlying legal structure, the Covenant, that becomes the heart of Judaism.  The increased detail reveals not the typical duty-based view of Judaism but rather an emphasis on social justice that aims for positive community change; a philosophical goal in allegiance with both feminist hermeneutics and the feminine ethic of caring.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to show the connectivity between Asherah and asherah it will be shown that the term asherah as used in the Torah represented a sacred post or tree.  Next it will be shown that the goddess Asherah was connected with trees.  By reviewing archaeological finds it will be demonstrated that the early form of Judaism, the religion of the ancient Israelites, was in actuality a polytheistic religion, complete with tree veneration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
