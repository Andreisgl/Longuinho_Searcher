Sub committees[edit]
In the past the Wikimania COT's relied on the support of subcommittees to help assess Scholarships, Programming, and Trust & Safety. For 2023 we intend to return to this format and expand it to include new features as part of enabling hybrid components building on the successes of 2021 and 2022. We ask that if you are interested, please add yourself below and identify the specific area(s) or committee(s) you'd like to help with. The COT lead for each will contact you from this page first, these roles are not location-dependent and are open to everyone in the community. Please ensure that your user account preferences on this wiki have your email address enabled so that organizers would reach back to you for the result of your submitted expression of interest.
Volunteers[edit]
The Wikimania 2023 Core Organizing Team and ESEAP thank you for offering your support, and there will still be more opportunities if you haven't already signed up.

Updates[edit]
Updates as the Core Organizing Team (COT) and Steering Committee (SC) progress with Wikimania 2023 planning. Now over on wikimania.wikimedia.org
September 20, 2022[edit]
Call for volunteers has concluded for Phase 1. Thanks to all who have generously signed up! There will be additional opportunities to volunteer, as we will need more help as Wikimania approaches. You can visit wikimania:2023:Volunteer to find out more.
The Wikimania 2023 Core Organizing Team and ESEAP thank you for offering your support, and there will still be more opportunities if you haven't already signed up.
What happens next: The COT will review the offers on what areas volunteers have indicated. Some of the immediate roles will require volunteers to undergo a Wikimedia Foundation Trust & Safety review as signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) due to having access to private information. Once this is completed, we will send invitations to join a subcommittee.
Don't despair, this phase will take some time, and our focus will be on the areas that the COT need to get underway early, like the Scholarship teams. As a hybrid event, Wikimania will be merging two events (in-person and online) so there will be many opportunities coming up.
As the COT starts testing options, we will also call on you to participate in those discussions, using various tools that will be available.
If you have missed this call, there still is an ongoing call for volunteers as we are still imagining what is possible. Please go over to the volunteer page on wikimania:2023:Volunteer for more information.
