The aim of the present study was to identify prognostic factors by means of univariate and multivariate analysis in a consecutive series of 96 patients. Mortality was 30%. Inability to clear the abdominal infection or to control the septic source, older age, and unconsciousness were significant factors related to mortality in the multivariate analysis. Failure to control the peritoneal infection (15%) was always fatal and correlated with failed septic source control, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and male gender. Failure to control the septic source (8%) also was always fatal and correlated with high APACHE II score and therapeutic delay. In patients with immediate source control, residual peritonitis occurred in 9% after purulent or biliary peritonitis and in 41% after fecal peritonitis (p = 0.002). In patients without immediate control of the septic source,...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersINTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTION AND ACUTE ABDOMEN-EPIDEMIOLOGY, DIAGNOSIS AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL MANAGEMENTProf. A. Karamarkovic MD. PhD. FACS, Sanamed  Medical journalIntra-abdominal infections are multifactorial and present an complex inflammatory response of the peritoneum to microorganisms followed by exudation in the abdominal cavity and systemic response Despite advances in management and critical care of patients with acute generalized peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation, prognosis is still very poor, with high mortality rate. Early detection and adequate treatment is essential to minimize complications in the patient with acute abdomen. Prognostic evaluation of complicated IAI by modern scoring systems is important to assess the severity and the prognosis of the disease. Control of the septic source can be achieved either by nonoperative or operative means. Nonoperative interventional procedures include percutaneous drainages of abscesses. The management of primary peritonitis is non-surgical and antibiotic- treatment. The management of secondary peritonitis include surgery to control the source of infection, removal of toxins, bacteria, and necrotic tissue, antibiotic therapy, supportive therapy and nutrition. “Source control” is sine qua non of success and adequate surgical procedure involves closure or resection of any openings into the gastrointestinal tract, resection of inflamed tissue and drainage of all abdominal and pelivic collections. Key words: Intra-abdominal infection, secondary peritonitis, source control, surgery.Download Free PDFView PDFA focus on intra-abdominal infections2010 • Massimo SartelliDownload Free PDFView PDFCroatian medical journalComparison of on-demand vs planned relaparotomy for treatment of severe intra-abdominal infections2005 • Mladen RakicTo compare morbidity and mortality of patients with severe intra-abdominal infections after two types of surgical treatment, on-demand (&quot;wait and see&quot;) relaparotomy and modified planned relaparotomy. We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 65 patients with severe peritonitis surgically treated in two Croatian hospitals. In one hospital, 34 patients were treated on-demand, and in another hospital 31 patients were treated by planned relaparotomy. We compared severe postoperative complications, mortality, and length of hospital stay in the two groups of patients. Severity of patient&#39;s disease, as measured from preoperative group-average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, was comparable in both on-demand and planned relaparotomy groups. The mortality rate was higher in patients operated on-demand (59% vs 29%, P=0.024). In nonadjusted model, the relative risk of dying was 2.5-fold higher for patients treated by on-demand operation in compar...Download Free PDFView PDFManagement of intra-abdominal infections. Guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infectionsPhilippe  Montravers, Hervé DupontIntra-abdominal infections are one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies and a leading cause of septic shock. A consensus conference on the management of community-acquired peritonitis was published in 2000. A new consensus as well as new guidelines for less common situations such as peritonitis in paediatrics and healthcare-associated infections had become necessary. The objectives of these Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) were therefore to define the medical and surgical management of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, define the specificities of intra-abdominal infections in children and describe the management of healthcare-associated infections. The literature review was divided into six main themes: diagnostic approach, infection source control, microbiological data, paediatric specificities, medical treatment of peritonitis, and management of complications. The GRADE(®) methodology was applied to determine the level of evidence and the strength of rec...Download Free PDFView PDFReviewsPlanned relaparotomy versus relaparotomy on demand for treatment of secondary peritonitis1996 • Roberto CirocchiDownload Free PDFView PDFJAMAComparison of On-Demand vs Planned Relaparotomy Strategy in Patients With Severe Peritonitis2007 • Johannes ReitsmaDownload Free PDFView PDFLangenbeck's Archives of SurgeryRisk factors associated with intraabdominal infections: a prospective multicenter study1999 • Christian OhmannDownload Free PDFView PDFHealth and Quality of Life OutcomesHealth related quality of life six months following surgical treatment for secondary peritonitis – using the EQ-5D questionnaire2007 • Ajm VaDownload Free PDFView PDFEvaluation of prosthetic mesh closure in semiopen-abdomen patients2002 • AHMET ÇOKER, Koray AtilaDownload Free PDFView PDFCritical CareDynamic changes of microbial flora and therapeutic consequences in persistent peritonitis2015 • Pascal Augustin, H.
