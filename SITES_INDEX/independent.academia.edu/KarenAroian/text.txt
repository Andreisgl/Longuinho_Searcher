Three hundred and five older persons completed a daily symptom diary, a retrospective symptom questionnaire, and a measure of health status. The number of symptoms endorsed each day on the diary declined, F(6, 214) = 13.51, p&amp;amp;amp;lt; .0001. New symptoms were endorsed 15%, and previous symptoms were no longer endorsed 1.9% of the time. More symptoms were endorsed on retrospective reports than on daily diaries, t(304) = 8.48, p &amp;amp;amp;lt; .0001. Symptoms from both methods were significantly correlated with health status (p &amp;amp;amp;lt;.0001) and differences in the correlations were not statistically significant, t(304) = 1.62, p = ns . Because of comparable criterion validity, less burdensome retrospective reports should be used, unless the focus is new symptoms or how symptoms unfold over time.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A sample of 537 Arab immigrants completed the POMS and a battery of other measures. Data analyses included confirmatory factor analyses and tests of reliability and concurrent validity. The fit of the proposed factor structure was acceptable if 14 pairs of error terms were allowed to correlate, but a better fit was obtained by creating a short form. The short form demonstrated good reliability and concurrent validity, but some factors were highly correlated. High factor correlations were not explainable by group differences in education or level of distress.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Longitudinal Family-Level Model of Arab Muslim Adolescent Behavior Problemsby Karen Aroian and Anne KatzJournal of Youth and Adolescence,  2011Arab-American Muslim adolescents in immigrant families face a number of challenges that put them ... more Arab-American Muslim adolescents in immigrant families face a number of challenges that put them at risk for behavior problems. This study of Arab-American Muslim Adolescents and their relatively recent immigrant mothers tested a longitudinal family-level model of adolescent behavior problems. Mother-adolescent dyads (N = 530) completed measures of maternal and adolescent stressors, active and avoidance coping, and social support; maternal distress; quality of mother-child relationship; and adolescent behavior problems at Time 1 and approximately 18 months later. The youth were between the ages of 11 and 15 years at Time 1 and 48.7% were girls. Longitudinal analyses were conducted using latent change modeling with change scores from Time 1 and Time 2 data. Social support facilitated active coping for both mothers and adolescents. Although maternal avoidance coping mediated maternal stressors and its effect on maternal distress, maternal stressors and maternal distress were not related to adolescent behavior problems. The only factor mitigating the effects of adolescent stressors on adolescent behavior problems was the quality of the mother-child relationship. These findings suggest that adolescents are insulated from maternal stress and distress as long as there is a good mother-child relationship.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A qualitative, case-oriented study design was used and 17 elderly Russian immigrants, 8 adult caregiving children, and 15 health professionals were interviewed in the Boston area in 1998. Perceptions about the patterns of and reasons for Russian elders&amp;#39; health and social service use were summarized through content analysis of the interview data. Participants across groups perceived extensive service use by elderly Russian immigrants. Life circumstances associated with immigration, cultural norms and beliefs, and structural characteristics of the local Russian immigrant community accounted for service use. Findings indicate that providing support for depression and loneliness associated with immigration, educating immigrants about the role of primary care providers in the US as well as realistic expectations for American medicine, and managing care to decrease the use of unnecessary services would facilitate appropriate service use among elderly Russian immigrants.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although previous studies with clinical samples of Southeast Asian refugees have found gender differences in the degree of psychological distress, the few community-based studies have been inconclusive. This community study found that there were gender differences in the predictors of distress and that refugee women reported significantly higher levels of psychological distress than their male counterparts. Implications of the findings are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Multiple regression analysis indicated that the combined model of demographic and demand of immigration variables was significant. Results indicated that women, older immigrants, those with less than a college education, and those with greater immigration demands related to novelty, language, discrimination, loss, and not feeling at home were most distressed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Depression was determined based on depression scores at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Forty-three percent of the sample remained depressed, 26% became depressed, and 30% had their depression lift over the course of 2 years. The three groups did not differ with regard to demographic characteristics or loss of employment or a negative change in marital status over the 2-year study period. They did differ with respect to the presence of local family and immigration demands (P &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;.05). Those who remained depressed were less likely to have family in the area and had the highest immigration demand score at both time points. However, the effect for presence of local family was not significant when immigration demands were included in the analysis (P =.32). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures revealed that the group whose depression lifted experienced the greatest change in immigration demand scores over the 2-year study period. Our findings argue that clinicians should not expect immigrants&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; depression to always decrease over time and should assess depression by asking about immigration demands, even if depression was not present during an earlier clinical encounter.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Study aims were to: (1) investigate change in depression scores and (2) determine the relative contribution of initial depression scores, select demographic and migration characteristics and common demands of immigration to depression at 2-year follow-up. Data were collected at two time points from 468 former Soviet immigrants who had been in the US 5 years or less at the time of the first data collection appointment. Linear regression was used to predict depression at 2-year follow-up. There was little improvement in depression for the sample as a whole over time. Baseline depression, unemployment, novelty, and not having relatives in the local resettlement area were significant predictors of depression at 2-year follow-up. Initial depression in relatively recent immigrants should be treated aggressively and not assumed to be a transient problem. Immigrants should be assisted to find early employment and overcome novel aspects of their new environment. Immigrants without local families will likely need additional support.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Adaptation and Psychometric Evaluation of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support for Arab American AdolescentsAmerican Journal of Community Psychology,  2009The multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) was revised for Arab American adol... more The multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) was revised for Arab American adolescents (MSPSS-AA). Items measuring social support from significant others were omitted and items measuring support from school personnel were added based on advice from cultural experts. The sample consisted of 635 Arab American young adolescents in metropolitan Detroit. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the proposed three-factor solution (family, friends, and school personnel). Internal consistency coefficients for the three subscales of family (alpha = 0.63), friends (alpha = 0.75), school personnel (alpha = 0.72) were good. As predicted, perceived support from family, friends, and school personnel were inversely related to self reports of daily hassles and internalizing behavior and positively related to assistance seeking coping, which provides evidence for construct validity. Support for discriminant validity was also demonstrated with significantly larger correlations between the MSPSS-AA Family subscale and daily hassles specific to parents and the MSPSS-AA Friend subscale and daily hassles specific to peers. These finding suggest that the MSPSS-AA is reliable and valid for use with Arab-American adolescents.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
