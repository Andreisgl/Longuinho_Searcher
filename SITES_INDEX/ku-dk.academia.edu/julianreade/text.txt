Much ink has already been spilled on account of this cube, most usefully by Hallo (1983), but certain points require emphasis or clarification.The object, pūru, is a “lot”, not a “die”.

The Accession of SinsharishkunJournal of Cuneiform Studies,  1970There are serious obJections to all the current reconstructions of Assyrian history during the 62... more There are serious obJections to all the current reconstructions of Assyrian history during the 620s. They demand that some of the endence should be reJected, and that there should be regular double-dating or an extraordinary number of coups in several Babylonian cities. The purpose of this article is to show that, even if we accept that scribes normally dated contracts by the regnal year of the king or pretender controlling their district, a simpler solution is available. It is compatible with all the texts, and accounts for the recognized anomalies in two of them; it only requires some mild speculation, and the abandonment of some unnecessary preconceptions. I have borrowed ideas freely from other scholars an(l there is no need here to criticize individually the chronological schemes they have suggested; all but one of them are considered impllcitly below, and the exception, Borger&#39;s, has been adequately refuted elsewhere.2 AWy debt to Borger may best be demonstrated by omitting references to many of the relevant c3ntracts and other texts; he collected nearly all of them in 1965, and disoussed them where necessary; his remarks will have to be consulted anyway, and it would be expensive and futile to repeat every detail.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Palace of Tiglath-Pileser IIIIraq,  1968Tiglath-Pileser III&#39;s palace at Nimrud is the only building, among those discovered by Layard... more Tiglath-Pileser III&#39;s palace at Nimrud is the only building, among those discovered by Layard in the last century, so far to have received the thorough treatment by modern scholars which they all deserve. Barnett and Falkner&#39;s handsome publication brings together almost all the information now available, and the supplementary remarks which follow could hardly have been made without it. It does not seem to be generally known that the legs of two figures from the vicinity of the palace are still visible in position at Nimrud. One set belonged to a bull facing west (Plate XVIII a ), and the other to a lion facing east (Plate XVIII b ); both are inscribed with the remains of Ashurnaṣirpal II&#39;s standard inscription. The figures were probably winged and human-headed; like the bulls and lions outside Ashurnaṣirpal&#39;s throneroom, they clearly stood back to back on a facade buttress, to one side of a central door. There is, however, a narrow space between them, and this must have been occupied, as in the palaces of Sargon and Sennacherib, by the figure of a genie: obviously the one found, in just such a position, by Rassam. As Rassam&#39;s genie faces left, towards the west, the other buttress of the facade, with a genie facing right, should also have been situated in that direction. This supposition would at least make sense of the way in which the three free-standing monuments in the area were arranged: Ashurnaṣirpal&#39;s fragmentary “obelisk” will have been placed directly in front of the central door of the facade, Shalmaneser&#39;s “Black Obelisk” will have been added outside the eastern side-door, and the statue of a courtier found to the east will have been in a less imposing position further along the wall.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Th... more Over three hundred glazed bricks were last year discovered in Courtyard T of Fort Shalmaneser. They were lying between the buttresses that flanked the entrance to T 3 and must originally have formed a panel set into the wall above. Though most of them had been broken into several separate fragments, few had fallen clear and the most important of these was in fact discovered from the fill of a nineteenth-century trench on top of the mound. The bricks were taken to Baghdad where it eventually proved possible to reconstruct their entire design. An inscription dates the bricks to the reign of Shalmaneser III; they were found resting on a confused mass of mud-brick and charcoal, and had clearly collapsed during one of the sacks of Calah, when the wooden fittings of the door below were set on fire and its east jamb demolished. The bricks, whose total weight must have exceeded three tons, fell immediately, but since only mud mortar can have bound them to the wall behind, brought down at the same time very little mud-brick. When the main body of the wall did fall shortly afterwards, it sealed them in what was still an extremely loose heap. This process of destruction, while serving its purpose at the time, saved the bricks from the dangers of exposure, and even the fire only damaged those which came to rest face down on the smouldering wood. Two of them, however, which carried a representation of the god Assur, were split into an unusually large number of fragments and must have been cracked before the panel fell.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rassam's Excavations at Borsippa and Kutha, 1879-82Iraq,  1986This paper makes available some of the main results of Hormuzd Rassam&#39;s excavations at Borsip... more This paper makes available some of the main results of Hormuzd Rassam&#39;s excavations at Borsippa (Birs Nimrud and Ibrahim al-Khalil) and Kutha (Tell Ibrahim), supplementing the broad accounts in his own book Asshur and the Land of Nimrod and in his other publications. Further technical information on Rassam&#39;s expeditions, with full references to records that I have consulted in the British Museum central archive, may be found in my introduction to Erie Leichty&#39;s Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum , Volume VI, pages xii–xxxiv. In compiling the account given here, I have had the benefit of advice from several scholars including, especially, Donald Bailey, John Curtis, and Irving Finkel. The drawings are by Ann Searight. There is a list of the objects illustrated, with additional discussion, at the end. Hormuzd Rassam was born in Mosul in 1826. During much of 1845–54 he worked on the British excavations in Assyria and Babylonia, first as Henry Layard&#39;s assistant and then as agent of the British Museum under the nominal supervision of the consul, Henry Rawlinson, in Baghdad. He later continued to serve the British crown, and eventually settled in England. In 1878 he recommenced excavations in Mesopotamia on behalf of the British Museum. He worked under a permit which allowed him to export everything he found except duplicate objects, which were to be surrendered to the Ottomans; most of his finds are now therefore in the British Museum.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
