NayarThis article argues that the graphic novel of BR Ambedkar’s life, Bhimayana, generates a postcolonial critical literacy. Critical literacy forces the reader to link personal experiences with socio-historical and institutional power relations, and alerts us to reflect on issues of otherness in the text. In the first section, the article argues that Bhimayana’s innovations of form and content, and its extensive metaphorization and multiple registers serve to combine a personal story with the history of a condition – of caste-based discrimination. In the second section of the article, I focus on the critical literacy the text initiates and demands of its readers. I suggest that the work fits into an already existing interocular (where the visual intersects with images from other visual media, such as television) field, and draws upon a popular register. It is this everyday register of comics – commonplace in the form of the comic strips in newspapers and periodicals but also as comic books – that enables Bhimayana to debate social issues in a medium that is far removed from other forms and genres such as newspaper reportage, commentaries and Amnesty reports where human rights issues are mostly addressed. The text is therefore significant in that it situates debates about caste and human rights in the popular cultural realm. A postcolonial critical literacy is the demand made on the reader to recognize, in this supposedly non-serious medium, a social problem.Download Free PDFView PDF‘Radical Graphics: Martin Luther King., Jr., BR Ambedkar and Comics Auto/biography’2016 • Pramod K.

Ambedkar’s experi- ences of being discriminated against. Using a graphic form inspired by Pardhan Gond art, Bhimayana breaks popular conventions of graphic narratives published in the West. The narrative of Bhimayana is inter- laced with contemporary events and brings to life Ambedkar’s story in a compelling way while retaining its subtleties. In this interview, S. Anand reveals that although the book was not planned for children, it has poten- tial as a pedagogical tool for exploring questions about caste-based dis- crimination. Anand talks about the book, its relevance in contemporary times, Dr Ambedkar and his journey in engaging with the issue of caste- based discrimination.Download Free PDFView PDFREADING HISTORY IN  COMICS - A CASE OF AMAR CHITRA KATHA VISIONARIES (Dissertation Report)Gaurav PuriDownload Free PDFView PDFSub-version(s).docxSahana  MukherjeeGraphic novels in India and the subversive art of storytelling.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Comic Art Vol. 15, No. 1A Creator's History of the Comics Medium in India2013 • Jeremy StollDespite a diverse and long history of the comics medium in India, much scholarship has tended to focus on just a small sampling. As the most widely published and read Indian comics, books from the Amar Chitra Katha series are the ones that most scholars have focused upon, to the detriment of understanding the wider context of India’s comics, storytelling, and visual cultures. While Amar Chitra Katha would eventually transcend earlier comics and visual narratives in popularity, such works are important for their ability to engage local or regional arts and international comics culture. More importantly, few scholars have addressed the work of contemporary comics creators or the graphic novels and comics currently coming out of Delhi and the rest of India. This article provides a historical account of the path from comic books to the later rise of graphic novels grounded in one creator, Amitabh Kumar’s, experiences as an author and researcher on Indian comics and culture. As a comics creator and researcher, he celebrates the importance of other publishers and creators in maintaining comics as a narrative medium. Based on Kumar’s perspective, as he works to establish a historical narrative himself while engaging with that precedent in crafting his own comics, this article traces the roots of the comics medium in India, from political cartoons to superhero comics and graphic novels.Download Free PDFView PDFClosureOf Superheroes in Ordinary Clothing: Reinventing Biography, History and the Comics Form in A Gardener in the Wasteland2019 • Amrita SinghIn the opening pages of A Gardener in the Wasteland, the authors of the book, writer Srividya Natarajan and artist Aparajita Ninan, appear on the page discussing their plan to ‘adapt’ the 1873 work of Jotiba Phule Gulamgiri (Slavery). As the authors walk through a New Delhi neighbourhood, they witness a group of children being beaten and abused using references to the ‘untouchable’ caste for inadvertently kicking a football into the house of a (supposedly) pious upper-caste man. Walking past this incident, they halt at a poster of the film Batman Begins, and Ninan exclaims why she understands the need for superheroes: “to swoop down out of the sky and kick the baddies to bits” (p. 9). This two-page verbal-visual montage is able to narrativize oppression as an ongoing process, and sets the tone for the rest of the narrative, where Natarajan and Ninan re-inscribe Gulamgiri through foregrounding Jotiba and Savitribai Phule’s struggles against caste oppression and their contribution to social reform in India in the 19th century, and represent the challenges continuing to the present. Graphic narratives demand a critical literacy that extends intertextually and intermedially to other cross-discursive practices. This paper will argue that the graphic narrative is the medium contemporary times need to draw attention to the follies and lacunae of dominant cultural practices. It will focus on how this text establishes the link between the historical past and the contemporary present, by compelling the authors and readers to negotiate their perspectives within the narrative and outside in the socio-political realm. It will particularly examine how the representative modes of the comic form are employed in this narrative, but also re-identified via the popular Indian comic series Amar Chitra Katha (a series that tells stories of important personages in India’s history) to radically alter modes of story telling and history writing.Download Free PDFView PDFGNOSIS:  Special  Issue-3 Prospects of Comics Studies in India2019 • Diptarup Ghosh DastidarAlthough the prehistory of comics in India can be traced all the way back to the 1850’s Delhi Sketchbook or the Indian Punch, the proper Indian comics scene can be said to have started from the 1960’s with the publication of Amar Chitra Katha Comics and thriving publishing houses like Raj Comics and Indrajal Comics. Since then, for the past five decades there has been a steady rise not only in the publication of comics in India, but also in its reception and appreciation. The appropriation of the term ‘graphic novel’, coined by Will Eisner, into the Indian scenario has uplifted the importance given to the comics form. Post-1980’s comics artists in India like Sarnath Banerjee, Vishwajyoti Ghosh, Sarbjit Sen, Orijit Sen, Amruta Patil, Appuppen and many others have started their own endeavors instead of working for publishing houses. This along with numerous graphic anthologies in the recent years like Gaysi Zine, This Side: That Side, Longform, and many others have enlarged the scope and directions of studying comics in India. Having discussed the comics scenario, this paper talks about various ways in which the Indian comics industry is affected by the conceptual notions generated in the western world. It also raises questions about the future of comics as a genre in the Indian context and what its place may be in the upcoming researches of the Humanities departments in India.Download Free PDFView PDFIndian Graphic Novel and how it emergedisha jainGraphic novel is a type of text combining words and images—essentially a comic, although the term most commonly refers to a complete story presented as a book rather than a periodical (Encyclopedia Britannica). Graphic novel is a fast emerging area of study in the twenty first century. Although the word 'Novel' normally refers to long fictional works, the term " Graphic Novel " is applied in a broader sense and includes fictional and non-fictional work. Graphic Novels are books in which the story is conveyed with sequential art (multiple images along with the text arranged in sequence next to each other in time and space to form a story). The length of a Graphic Novel allows it to present stories of greater intricacy and profundity. In 1993 famous American cartoonist and critic Scott McCloud defined Graphic Novels in his book Understanding Comics as " juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or produce an aesthetic response. " The readers usually take Graphic Novels and Comics as identical due to the use of illustrations and speech bubbles for the narration of a story, but they are not similar. Graphic Novels tend to deal with serious issues or serious themes and also they have a self-contained plot. Graphic Novel can be said to be a blend of the elements of comics and novel. Comics are generally periodicals and are usually action oriented. On the other hand Graphic Novels have the pattern of a novel. The focus of Graphic Novels is not just on action but they probe deep into historical contexts of the theme and psychology of characters. A Graphic Novel usually consists of a well-defined plot, set of characters, dialogues and a setting. They have their own very unique style of representation. These novels make use of speech and thought balloons to express character's thoughts and words. Sound effects are made with visual sounds in the thought/speech balloon, for instance, Boom! Bam! Fwooosh! etc. The page of a Graphic Novel is generally referred to as a panel which is further divided intoDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
