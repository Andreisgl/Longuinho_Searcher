A. Yasur-Landau, J. R. Ebeling and L. B. Mazow. Culture and History of the Ancient Near East 50. Leiden: Brill.Religious activities in Israel were enacted in real time and space and required the use of both ritual and commonplace artifacts. Elements of such activities must be re!ected in the archaeological record, but scholars are challenged to identify sacral acts that did not take place within buildings speci"cally designated for religious purposes. While there is overall consensus concerning ritual in the Jerusalem Temple, and even in the major sanctuaries throughout the land, less is known about the practice of religion in the domestic setting. Recent studies have identi"ed small cultic areas within Israelite houses at Tell el-Far!ah (N), Tell Halif and !Ai, among others. #is paper suggests that family elders of both sexes oversaw religious practice at these household shrines, but these elders held no monopoly over expressions of domestic piety. Additional rituals were enacted in mixed-use or multifunction spaces, that is, in areas throughout the house in which a variety of activities took place. Given the space limitations of the typical Israelite house and the myriad tasks to be accomplished within it, this is hardly surprising.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersDefining the Sacred: Approaches to the Archaeology of Religion in the Near East, ed.

Leiden and Boston.(viii+452 pages) Assaf Yasur-LandauDespite the large number of well-preserved domestic contexts in Bronze and Iron Age sites, household archaeology has not been a common approach to studying the material culture of Ancient Israel. Until recently, the dictates of “Biblical Archaeology” led to a narrow set of questions that ignored issues such as gender, status and production within the household. The present volume, which grew out of a session at the 2008 Annual Meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research, attempts to redress this issue. The seventeen papers herein reflect innovative viewpoints on the theory and praxis of household archaeology in this region. The next step in household research is presented here, with the use of tailor-made data collection strategies designed to answer specific questions posed by household archaeology.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Archaeology of the Extended Family: A Household Compound from Iron II Tell En-NasbehAaron BrodyDownload Free PDFView PDFReligionsWomen in Israelite Religion: The State of Research Is All New Research2019 • Beth Alpert NakhaiHistorically, those studying Israelite religion have ignored the existence of women in Iron Age Israel (1200–587 BCE). They have, therefore, accounted neither for the religious beliefs of half of ancient Israel’s population nor for the responsibilities that women assumed for maintaining religious rituals and traditions. Such reconstructions of Israelite religion are seriously flawed. Only in the last four decades have scholars, primarily women, begun to explore women’s essential roles in Israel’s religious culture. This article utilizes evidence from the Hebrew Bible and from archaeological sites throughout Israel. It demonstrates that some women had roles within the Jerusalem Temple. Most women, however, resided in towns and villages throughout the Land. There, they undertook responsibility for clan-based and community-based religious rituals and rites, including pilgrimage, seasonal festivals, rites of military victory, and rites of mourning. They fulfilled, as well, essential roles within the sphere of domestic or household religion. At home, they provided medico-magical healing for all family members, as well as care for women and babies throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and beyond. They, and the men in their communities, worshipped Yahweh, Israel’s primary deity, and the goddess Asherah, as well; for most people, these two divinities were inextricably linked.Download Free PDFView PDFHousehold Archaeology in Ancient Israel and BeyondA Tale Of Two Houses: The Role Of Pottery In Reconstructing Household Wealth And Composition2011 • Nava Panitz-CohenDownload Free PDFView PDFYasur-Landau, A., Ebeling, J.and Mazow, L.

In the rural sector, most households were part of a communal, lineage system that paid taxes to the monarchy and was pressed by it, but, generally speaking, maintained their autonomy throughout the period (for the relations between the various components, see Faust 2005, forthcoming b). The lineage economy mediated between the households and the royal economy. In the urban sector there was a private system that was operated by the many nuclear (the majority of urban households) and extended families. It is likely that most families were pressed by the royal system, while some of them (mainly those that maintained the form of the extended family) were part of it. However, whether part of it or not, the urban families interacted directly with the royal system that collected part of their surpluses as tax, and, at least during part of the time, also took charge of (some of) the production (e.g., at Gibeon, Hazor, and Ekron). In the end, however, it must be stressed that these systems—the private family, the lineage, and the royal—coexisted, sometimes in the very same settlements.Download Free PDFView PDFHerrmann, V.

In Household Archaeology in Ancient Israel and Beyond.2011 • Virginia HerrmannThe expansion of the Neo-Assyrian Empire throughout a large part of the Near Eastern world in the ninth to seventh centuries bce is widely considered to have been a transformative epoch in the history of the region, profoundly altering its political and cultural landscape and ushering in an “Age of Empires.” The contrasting images of the pax Assyriaca, providing stability and enabling exchange, and of the destructions, deaths, and deportations vividly portrayed in Assyrian royal inscriptions and in the Hebrew Bible both contribute to this picture of sweeping change. In the past few decades, studies of regional settlement patterns in imperial provinces have succeeded in documenting the major demographic shifts brought about by the Assyrian Empire, and the excavation of Assyrian period sites throughout the region has increased dramatically. From the extant archaeological evidence, however, one would still be hard pressed to answer the question of whether and in what ways incorporation into the Assyrian Empire was transformative on the level of provincial subjects’ daily social and economic lives, and whether such transformations were imposed from above or emerged from below, despite the fact that this is a crucial element of the prevailing macromodels of imperial rule. Progress toward the resolution of this question will require the contextual and chronological detail offered by household archaeology, as has been demonstrated by several investigations of New World empires. This paper thus advocates a new emphasis on the careful investigation and analysis of ordinary domestic structures in Assyrian imperial provinces, aiming to identify changes and continuities in the domestic economies and social organization of its subjects. Such a program of household archaeology is planned for the new excavations of the University of Chicago at Sam'al (Zincirli Höyük), the capital of a small Syro-Hittite Kingdom that became an Assyrian province in the late eighth century bce.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
