It questions his historical frame and his narrowing of the sublime to classical (Virgilian) and Christian (sermo humilis.) "Camilla" analyses three grand entrance scenes: Virgil's Camilla2, the corresponding scene in the OF Roman d'Eneas, and the arrival of the heavenly messenger in Dante, Inferno Bk. 9. These scenes map, for Auerbach, a clear historical trajectory: classical sublime-medieval decline-Dantean rebirth.Download Free PDFView PDFMimesisGabi NituDownload Free PDFView PDFTime, Literature, and History: Collected Essays of Erich Auerbach (Princeton 2013)--IntroductionJames I.

Philosophising in Exile, p. 51-86Erich Auerbach’s “European Philology”?2008 • Angel  Valentinov AngelovRésumé I try to answer the question pertinent to the subject of this study is: Did Auerbach and the other great Romance philologists work from the very beginning with a consciousness of Europe and presuppose a common European horizon for their literary and linguistic studies? Or was this “European” consciousness formed gradually and later as the result of personal and social cataclysms? I was led to the conclusion that in addition to the First World War, the threat of another military conflict in the 1920s, foremost between France and Germany, also influenced the way part of the German Romance philologists rethought their academic pursuits. My purpose here is to find the main motive why Auerbach chose to use the non-disciplinary term “European philologists” and what he meant by that. I argue that Auerbach’s consciousness of Europe as a historical entity was formed in the 1920s, but his exile turned this consciousness into a position. The second question, I try to answer is about the symbolic geography of European culture in the works of Auerbach. The synonymous use of Europe and Abendland distinctly reveals Auerbach’s dual, unifying/divisive understanding of the identity and symbolic geography of European culture. If we accept the opinion that the European has been represented for centuries by the Romance, then the tasks of Romance philology as European philology will become clearer and the cultural geography of Europe narrower. The cultural-historical identification of Europe and Abendland after the Second World War solidified the anyway existing division of Europe into two blocs. Literary history and philology divided Europe in the way this was done by the relevant political doctrines too. The human sciences also contributed significantly to the creation of value-attitudes, and an investigation of the former from this perspective gives us additional reason to assume that the agreement on the division of Europe after the Allied victory was not based solely on strategic interests.Download Free PDFView PDFBerlin: de GruyterVariants of Rhetorical Ventriloquism: sermocinatio, ethopoeia, prosopopoeia (& Affine Terms) in the ad Herennium, Cicero, Dionysius, Quintilian, Augustine.
