Hello everyone,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.22.3, 1.21.6 and 1.19.12.
These releases fix a number of security related bugs that could affect users 
of MediaWiki. In addition, MediaWiki 1.22.3 is a maintenance release. It fixes 
several bugs. You can consult the RELEASE-NOTES-1.22 file for the full list of 
changes in this version. Download links are given at the end of this email.
== Security fixes ==
* (bug 60771) SECURITY: Disallow uploading SVG files using non-whitelisted
  namespaces. Also disallow iframe elements. User will get an error
  including the namespace name if they use a non- whitelisted namespace.
* (bug 61346) SECURITY: Make token comparison use constant time. It seems like
  our token comparison would be vulnerable to timing attacks. This will take
  constant time.
* (bug 61362) SECURITY: API: Don't find links in the middle of api.php links.
== Bug fixes in 1.22.3 ==
* (bug 53710) Add sequence support for upsert in DatabaseOracle in the same 
way
  as in selectInsert
* (bug 60231, 58719) Various fixes to job running code in Wiki.php: Make it
  async on Windows. Fixed possible "invalid filename" errors on Windows.
  Redirect output to dev/null to avoid hanging PHP.
* (bug 60083) Correct sequence name for fresh Postgres installation. Spotted
  by gebhkla
* (bug 60531) Avoid variable naming conflicts in
  DatabasePostgres::selectSQLText. Spotted by gebhkla
* (bug 60094) Fix rebuildall.php fatal error with PostgreSQL. The fix for
  47055 introduced a fatal error when running rebuildall.php. This is a
  workaround suggested by gebhkla on Bugzilla. It just checks to make sure
  $options is actually an array before calling array_search on it.
* (bug 43817c12) Add error handling if descriptionmsg isn't defined for
  extension.
* (bug 60543) Special:PrefixIndex omits stripprefix=1 for "Next page" link.
