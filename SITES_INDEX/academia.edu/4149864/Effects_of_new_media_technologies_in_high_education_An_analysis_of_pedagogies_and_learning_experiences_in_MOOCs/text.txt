Mainly created by prestigious Universities in United States and Europe, and provided by start-ups such as Udacity and Coursera, MOOCs are free and available for anyone interested in learning. Aiming to foster digital learning and facilitate access to open academic knowledge, initiatives are attracting thousands of students worldwide, which represent a new and diverse audience for institutions. Regarding this phenomenon, this thesis intends to answer the following research question: to what extent are new media technologies creating innovative pedagogies and learning practices online, and impacting higher education? To answer this question, this work will mainly consider applications of the theory of connectivism in MOOCs, which was explored by the first open online course...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersExamining Value Change in MOOCs in the Scope of Connectivism and Open Educational Resources MovementHayriye Tugba OzturkMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) came to prominence with Open Educational Resources Movement (OERM). It was based upon the idea of libre in removal of some permission barriers and gratis in removing the price barrier (Suber, 2008) in learning resources. In line with the theoretical underpinnings of OERM, MOOCs embody primary characteristics of connectivist pedagogy which are autonomy, diversity, openness, and community participation. However, in time, moving away from its original philosophical and pedagogical values, new variations of MOOCs have emerged and new MOOCs have become more market oriented and are aligned with instructivist, cognitive, and behaviourist pedagogy. In an attempt to empirically examine the change in underlying values of the MOOCs, a survey method was employed by using a Connectivist Learning Environment Assessment Tool which was developed in the scope of this research. The tool could be useful for formulating and justifying a conceptual framework that enables us to reify the connectivist pedagogy and assess connectivist underpinnings of a learning environment including MOOCs. This research aims to contribute to MOOC studies against the background of previous knowledge from the Open Education and Connectivist fields.

MOOCs swept the landscape of educational technology in no time. However, through all this enthusiasm , it is difficult to see the contribution of MOOCs to computer-based education. Even though there is a surge in MOOCs as well as in MOOC-research, it is unclear how an effective MOOC-pedagogy can be developed. What is this MOOC-phe-nomenon? And how can we, as educators, teachers, pedagogues, educational researchers, develop MOOC-pedagogy? In the first part of this paper, we'll start with an overview of the MOOC-phenomenon. In the second part, we'll discuss the implicit philosophical attitudes towards educational technology that underlies much of the MOOC-debates. We then argue that, rather than a theoretically grounded approach to educational technology, common sense attitudes of essentialism and instrumentalism prevail. In the last part of the paper, we suggest to concentrate on the educational design of technology and on the development of practices of study necessary to deal with technology, in order to develop a meaningful educational practice.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Intercultural ManagementMOOCs: the New Educational Frontier of the 21st CenturyELISABETTA CALVOObjective: Over and above being widespread in various sectors of the economy and fi-nance, the uncontrollable expansion of digital technology is also conquering areas reserved for education and training, going beyond the traditional models of demand / supply, frontal and long distance lectures. The article aims to analyse the phenomenon of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and how, together with new trends in the context of digital teaching, they can represent an incentive for universities to reflect on the changes that are taking place in educational policies and in academic culture, possibly re-evaluating their mission with the aim of improving the quality of content and learning experiences. Methodology: Through the study of various experiences and publications. Findings: Since their appearance, MOOCs have generated a huge interest in the field of higher education, establishing themselves more and more worldwide as an important online training system, aimed at a large number of...Download Free PDFView PDFDeveloping a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) at a College of Education: Narrative of Disruptive Innovation?2015 • Sarah SchrireThe data for this case study was gathered during 2012, hand in hand with the growing media hype about MOOCs in higher education (Watters, 2012). The college of education in which the case study took place prepares educators in the spirit of humanism, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability, offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs in education and teaching. When rooted in the Connectivist origins, MOOCs are seen by the authors as representing an approach to learning that should be of interest to educators preparing their learners - the teachers of tomorrow - for life and work in a knowledge society. Connectivism is based on the idea that knowledge is distributed across a network of connections (Downes, 2007), and therefore that learning consists of the ability to construct and traverse those networks (Siemens, 2005). Connective knowledge is the knowledge that results from connections among properties of different entities.

Their connectivist genesis provided a provocative expectation regarding the potential of collaboration, sharing, reuse, and free access, as factors of a possible transformation of the current educational system, which has been characterized by being rigid and reluctant to change. Given the relevance and growing participation of MOOC in education, there is a strong interest in understanding both their functioning and structure so that they can be considered as relevant educational options for a networked society. In this sense, a multi-method, exploratory and mixed study was conducted on 225 MOOCs based on the four categories that make up their denomination: Massive, Open, Online and Course. The study was developed through three stages: enlistment, fieldwork and report. The results of the study show that the contributions of MOOCs as generators of shared and collaborative learning experiences as proposed in their origins are not reflected in the reality of their current offering.Download Free PDFView PDFThe MOOC Revolution – massive open online courses: the answer to problems facing education or an experiment that could destroy centuries of traditionKatharine  JewittA radical rethink is going on about what it means to go to an educational institution, asking profound questions about what the classroom of the future should look like and the way we should learn. Given the emerging nature of massive open online courses (MOOCs), this paper is a synthesis of critical reflections, commentaries and cautionary tales from a variety of perspectives, looking at the issues facing education and considering whether traditional teaching methods have outlived their usefulness. In times when educational institutions are facing financial cuts and student debt is increasing, some argue that free university online courses will be the saviour of education, (Koller et al, 2013). Others argue that they could destroy centuries of tradition and threaten some of the world's greatest universities (Vardi, 2012). Much research focuses on the design and categorisation of MOOCs (Clark, 2013, Downes, 2010 and Reich, 2013) and the role of the educator (Ferguson and Whitelock, 2014). This paper builds on the research by examining some of the phenomenal changes to technology-enhanced learning being brought about by new technologies and business. It summarises some of the key discourses about MOOCs, which continue to generate heated debates and divide opinions about their credibility, value and importance. I argue that any form of technology that drives engaging education, tailored precisely to the needs of individuals, and opens up education to those who cannot afford it, must be a viable alternative and challenge traditional academic institutions both to question what they offer and respond accordingly.Download Free PDFView PDFThe International Review of Research in Open and Distributed LearningExamining MOOCs: A Comparative Study among Educational Technology Experts in Traditional and Open UniversitiesNati CabreraDownload Free PDFView PDFMERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, Vol. 10, No. 1Challenges to Research in MOOCs2014 • Helene FournierOver the past five years, the emergence of interactive social media has influenced the development of learning environments. Learning management systems have come to maturity, but because they are controlled by educational institutions and are subsequently used to support institutional learning, have been seen by learning technologists as not capturing the spirit and possibilities that new media have to offer for learning. Academics and researchers are currently investigating a different learning environment, more open and networked, while the underpinning learning theory is moving from social constructivism towards connectivism. Research in open learning environments is only in its infancy and researchers have only started to become interested in massive open online courses (MOOCs) as a topic of investigation. Recent research and development efforts have focused on generating technologies that might facilitate learning within a self-directed information and communication stream. In this paper, the authors report on an exploratory case study of PLENK, a connectivist-style MOOC, and highlight some of the challenges in the research and analysis process, especially as significant amounts of both quantitative and qualitative data were involved. Important findings related to activity levels and important dimensions of self-directed learning in an open learning environment are presented.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
