Phenotypic flexibility, such as reversible acclimatization, permits organisms to achieve high performance over a wide range of environmental conditions, without the costly allocation or acquisition tradeoffs associated with behavioral thermoregulation, which may expedite range expansion in introduced species. The northern curly-tailed lizard, Leiocephalus carinatus, was introduced to the USA in the 1940s and is now established in southern Florida. We measured bite force and the thermal sensitivity of sprinting of L. carinatus during the winter and spring to determine how morphology and performance varied seasonally. We found evidence of seasonal variation in several aspects of physiological performance. Lizards sampled in spring sprinted faster and tolerated higher temperatures, while lizards sampled in winter had high performance over a wider range of temperatures. Furthermore, seasonal differences in physiology were only detected after generating thermal reaction norms. Both sprint and bite force performance did not differ seasonally when solely comparing performance at a common temperature. No seasonal relationships between morphology and performance were detected. Our results suggest that L. carinatus may use reversible acclimatization to maintain high levels of performance across seasons not typically experienced within their native range. Thermal physiology plasticity may ameliorate the impacts of sub-optimal temperatures on performance without the cost of behavioral thermoregulation. Our work highlights the importance of utilizing reaction norms when evaluating performance and the potential ecological impacts of introduced species.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe American NaturalistRapid Change in the Thermal Tolerance of a Tropical Lizard2012 • Alex GundersonDownload Free PDFView PDFDoes acclimation at higher temperatures affect the locomotor performance of one of the southernmost reptiles in the world?2012 • Nora IbargüengoytíaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Thermal BiologyInteractions between thermoregulatory behavior and physiological acclimatization in a wild lizard population2018 • Norma L .

Thus, we know comparatively little about how they interact to shape physiological variation in natural populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral thermoregulation and thermal acclimatization interact to shape physiological phenotypes in a natural population of the diurnal lizard, Sceloporus torquatus. Every month for one year we examined thermoregulatory effectiveness and changes in the population mean in three physiological parameters: cold tolerance (Ct min), heat tolerance (Ct max), and the preferred body temperature (T pref), to indirectly assess thermal acclimatization in population means. We discovered that S. torquatus is an active thermoregulator throughout the year, with body temperature varying little despite strong seasonal temperature shifts. Although we did not observe a strong signal of acclimatization in Ct max , we did find that Ct min shifts in parallel with nighttime temperatures throughout the year. This likely occurs, at least in part, because thermoregulation is substantially less effective at buffering organisms from selection on lower physiological limits than upper physiological limits. Active thermoregulation is effective at limiting exposure to extreme temperatures during the day, but is less effective at night, potentially contributing to greater plasticity in Ct min than Ct max. Importantly, however, T pref tracked seasonal changes in temperature, which is one the factors contributing to highly effective thermoregulation throughout the year. Thus, behavior and physiological plasticity do not always operate independently, which could impact how organisms can respond to rising temperatures.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Animal EcologyIntraspecific variation in lizard heat tolerance alters estimates of climate impact2019 • Salvador Herrando-Perez1. Research addressing the effects of global warming on the distribution and persistence of species generally assumes that population variation in thermal tolerance is spatially constant or overridden by interspecific variation. Typically, this rationale is implicit in sourcing one critical thermal maximum (CTmax) population estimate per species to model spatiotemporal cross-taxa variation in heat tolerance. Theory suggests that such an approach could result in biased or imprecise estimates and forecasts of impact from climate warming, but limited empirical evidence in support of those expectations exists. 2. We experimentally quantify the magnitude of intraspecific variation in CTmax among lizard populations, and the extent to which incorporating such variability can alter estimates of climate impact through a biophysical model. To do so, we measured CTmax from 59 populations of 15 Iberian lizard species (304 individuals). 3. The overall median CTmax across all individuals from all species was 42.8°C and ranged from 40.5 to 48.3°C, with species medians decreasing through xeric, climate- generalist and mesic taxa. We found strong statistical support for intraspecific differentiation in CTmax by up to a median of 3°C among populations. We show that annual restricted activity (operative temperature > CTmax) over the Iberian distribution of our study species differs by a median of >80 hr per 25-km2 grid cell based on different population-level CTmax estimates. This discrepancy leads to predictions of spatial variation in annual restricted activity to change by more than 20 days for six of the study species. 4. Considering that during restriction periods, reptiles should be unable to feed and reproduce, current projections of climate-change impacts on the fitness of ectotherm fauna could be under- or over-estimated depending on which population is chosen to represent the physiological spectra of the species in question. Mapping heat tolerance over the full geographical ranges of single species is thus critical to address cross-taxa patterns and drivers of heat tolerance in a biologically comprehensive way.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Comparative Physiology A-neuroethology Sensory Neural and Behavioral PhysiologyThermal dependence of locomotor performance in two cool-temperate lizardsMya GabyTemperate-zone ectotherms experience varying or very low ambient temperatures and may have difficulty in attaining preferred body temperatures. Thus, adaptations to reduce the thermal dependence of physiological processes may be present. We measured the optimal temperature range for sprint speed and compared it with the selected body temperatures (T sel) of two sympatric, cool-temperate lizards: the diurnal skink Oligosoma maccanni and the primarily nocturnal gecko Woodworthia (previously Hoplodactylus) “Otago/Southland”. We also investigated whether time-of-day influenced sprint speed. Contrary to results for other reptiles, we found that time-of-day did not influence speed in either species. For each species, the optimal temperature range for sprinting and T sel overlapped, supporting the ‘thermal coadaptation’ hypothesis. However, the optimal range of temperatures for speed is not always attainable during activity by either species, which have limited opportunities to attain T sel in the field. The thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in these two species does not appear to have evolved to fully match their current thermal environment. More data on cold-adapted species are needed to fully understand physiological adaptation in ectotherms.Download Free PDFView PDFThermal physiology responds to interannual temperature shifts in a montane horned lizard, Phrynosoma orbiculareDavid R . Aguillón-GutiérrezAs climate change marches on, rapidly rising temperatures shatter records every year, presenting ever-growing physiological challenges to organisms worldwide. Ectotherms rely on behavioral and physiological plasticity to contend with environmental fluctuations. Nonetheless, our understanding of thermal plasticity has been largely limited to laboratory settings. Here, we test whether aspects of thermal physiology respond to interannual shifts in thermal environment in a natural population of Phrynosoma orbiculare, a montane horned lizard, from Hidalgo, Mexico. At our field site, 2019 was markedly warmer than the year that preceded it. We detected population-level increases in three key thermal physiological traits: preferred temperature, the critical thermal minimum, and the critical thermal maximum. Thus, thermal phenotypes appear to shift in tandem in response to environmental fluctuations. A subset of individuals were resampled across years, allowing insight into plastic shifts within an organism's lifetime. We detected parallel increases in these lizards for the preferred temperature and the critical thermal minimum, but not for the critical thermal maximum. Our results support a growing body of literature indicating that preferred conditions and cold tolerance can be highly labile over the course of an organism's lifetime, whereas hardening over shorter time periods is more common for heat tolerance. Given that heat tolerance increased at the population-level, but not in resampled individuals, it is possible that rapid evolution occurred due to temperature increases. In short, physiological shifts can be observed in natural populations over relatively short timespans, and these shifts might reflect a combination of evolutionary and acclimatory responses.

Adjustment to novel thermal habitats may occur either through behavioural adjustments, physiological adaptation or both. Here, we test whether rates of evolution differ among physiological traits in the cybotoids, a clade of tropical Anolis lizards distributed in markedly different thermal environments on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. We find that cold tolerance evolves considerably faster than heat tolerance, a difference that results because behavioural thermoregulation more effectively shields these organisms from selection on upper than lower temperature tolerances. Specifically, because lizards in very different environments behaviourally thermoregulate during the day to similar body temperatures, divergent selection on body temperature and heat tolerance is precluded, whereas night-time temperatures can...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
