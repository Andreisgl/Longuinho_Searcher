Through the use of detailed records from a sediment core collected off the Magdalena Margin of Baja California, Mexico, we demonstrate that this teleconnection predominantly arose from changes in marine productivity, rather than changes in ventilation of the North Pacific, as was originally proposed. One possible interpretation is that the modern balance of El Niño–La Niña conditions that favors a shallow nutricline and high productivity today and during warm climate intervals of the past 52 k.y. was altered toward more frequent, deep nutricline, low productivity, El Niño–like conditions during cool climate intervals.Download Free PDFView PDFContinental Shelf ResearchTemporal variations of C, N, δ13C, and δ15N in organic matter collected by a sediment trap at Cuenca Alfonso, Bahía de La Paz, SW Gulf of California2010 • Alberto SanchezDownload Free PDFView PDFNitrogen isotope variations in Santa Barbara Basin sediments: Implications for denitrification in the eastern tropical North Pacific during the last 50,000 yearsRobert ThunellNitrogen isotope variations preserved in Santa Barbara Basin sediments are used to evaluate changes in denitrification in the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) during the last 50,000 years. A significant component of the subsurface waters (-• 100-400 m) that presently fill the Santa Barbara Basin is derived from the low-oxygen,j denitrifying zone in the ETNP, and the nitrate in these waters has a • SN value of 8-9%0. During the last glacial, the • SN values of Santa Barbara Basin sediments were typically 6-7%0, indicating decreased denitrification in the ETNP and a better oxygenated intermediate water mass in the Santa Barbara Basin at this time. This reduced denitrification during the last glacial would have increased the pool of fixed nitrogen and may have contributed to the higher productivity previously reported for various regions of the global ocean during this period. At the onset of deglaciation, sediment • SN values increase by more than 2%0, indicating increased denitrification in the ETNP. During Younger Dryas time, • SN values decreased by 3%0 and record a brief return to better ventilated conditions in the subsurface waters of the ETNP. This is followed by an increase in • SN to over 99/oo at-• 10,000 years ago, indicating intense denitrification at the beginning of the Holocene.Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal Biogeochemical CyclesGlacial-Holocene δ 15 N record from the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico: Implications for denitrification in the eastern equatorial Pacific and changes in atmospheric N 2 O2004 • Robert ThunellDownload Free PDFView PDFNatureIncreasing subtropical North Pacific Ocean nitrogen fixation since the Little Ice Age2013 • Fabian BatistaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
