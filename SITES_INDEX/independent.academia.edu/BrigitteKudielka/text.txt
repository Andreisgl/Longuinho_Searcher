The main focus will be on basal diurnal free cortisol regulation and cortisol responses to acute psychological stress. First, we describe normal HPA axis regulation as well as dysfunction which manifests in hyper- or hypoactivity. We also briefly illustrate three established methods to assess HPA axis activity, reactivity, and feedback functioning, namely the cortisol awakening rise (CAR), Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and low-dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST). Then, an up-to-date summary of empirical findings on the relationship between burnout, respectively vital exhaustion, and cortisol is provided including field as well as laboratory studies.

However, the contribution of different facets of psychopathy (boldness, meanness, disinhibition) in explaining externalising and internalising behaviours across genders are inconsistent. In this study, we explored gender differences in the assessment of, and relationships between, psychopathic personality traits, trait anxiety, social anxiety, depression, mental health, and aggressive behaviour in 822 students from a German University (586 women, 236 men; Mage = 22.27). Using a structural equation model, we found a positive relationship between aggressive behaviour and all three facets of psychopathy, a positive relationship between internalising behaviours and disinhibition, and a significant negative relationship between internalising behaviours and boldness. Despite gender differences in absolute levels of these variables, the overall pattern of the relationships between variables was consistent across genders. This indicates that symptom level differences across gender cannot be accounted for by variation in early developing personality traits like psychopathy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Methods: Professional musicians (n = 429) from nine opera and/or concert orchestras were surveyed with the Short Form-12 general health questionnaire (SF-12). Data were compared with a reference sample (n = 2805) with a sample of physicians (n = 549) and aircraft manufacturers (n = 822). Results: Compared to the reference sample and the two other professional groups, the musicians had a higher physical health score: 53.07 (SD 5.89) vs 49.03 (SD 9.35) reference, 51.26 (SD 7.53) physicians, and 49.31 (SD 7.99) aircraft manufacturers.

This article starts with a brief description of the origin of the term stress. Then the comprehensive definition of stress proposed by Levine and Ursin (1991) is presented. Stress leads to numerous responses of the endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune system in an attempt to adapt to internal or external challenges. The main endocrine stress systems of the body are the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary (SAM) axis and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which trigger the release of the catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla and glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) from the adrenal cortex, respectively. The release of stress-related hormones support the adaptation process of the organism to changes and can protect the body in the short run. In contrast, the bodily responses to stress can cause damage in the long run and can finally promote development of several stress-related diseases. The biological ‘costs’ of short-term adaptation to stress are described as allostatic load following a model introduced by McEwen and Stellar (1993).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Theoretically, we draw on the Demand-Induced Strain Compensation (DISC) model that proposes that demands, resources, and strains are multidimensional and comprise emotional, cognitive, and physical components. We first tested whether resources compensate aversive effects of demands. Second, as proposed by the triple-match principle, we tested whether interaction effects between job demands and resources are most likely if demands, resources, and outcomes relate to the same dimension. We retrieved data from 177 school teachers; a subsample was re-examined after a time lag of about 21 month (N = 56). Linear regression analyses reveal concurrent and longitudinal main and interaction effects of teacher-specific emotional and cognitive job demands and resources on EE.

Während das ZNS elektrische Impulse generiert um Informationen innerhalb des ZNS zu verarbeiten und von Neuronen an nachgeordnete Körperzellen weiterzuleiten, produziert das endokrine System Hormone, welche als Botenstoff e des Körpers agieren. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem ZNS steuert das endokrine System nicht nur die offensichtlichen phänotypischen Entwicklungen des Menschen über die Lebensspanne, sondern es ist auch maßgeblich an der Veränderung funktioneller Eigenschaft en beteiligt. Das Immunsystem muss parallel mit sowohl zellulären und humoralen Abwehrprozessen dafür sorgen, dass die Integrität des Organismus in der Auseinandersetzung mit potenziell schädigenden Fremdkörpern (Antigenen) im sich entwickelnden bzw. alternden Menschen aufrechterhalten wird.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Emotional exhaustion and overcommitment to work are differentially associated with hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis responses to a low-dose ACTH1–24(Synacthen) and dexamethasone–CRH test in healthy school teachersStress,  2012Evidence for a detrimental impact of chronic work stress on health has accumulated in epidemiolog... more Evidence for a detrimental impact of chronic work stress on health has accumulated in epidemiological research. Recent studies indicate altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation as a possible biological pathway underlying the link between stress and disease. However, the direction of dysregulation remains unclear, with reported HPA hyper- or hyporeactivity. To disentangle potential effects on different functional levels in the HPA axis, we examined responses using two pharmacological stimulation tests in 53 healthy teachers (31 females, 22 males; mean age: 49.3 years; age range: 30-64 years): a low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH(1-24), Synacthen) test was used to assess adrenal cortex sensitivity and the combined dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test to examine pituitary and adrenal cortex reactivity. Blood and saliva samples were collected at - 1,+15,+30,+45,+60,+90,+120 min. Emotional exhaustion (EE), the core dimension of burnout, was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Overcommitment (OC) was assessed according to Siegrist&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s effort-reward-imbalance model. We found a significant association between EE and higher plasma cortisol profiles after Synacthen (p = 0.045). By contrast, OC was significantly associated with attenuated ACTH (p = 0.045), plasma cortisol (p = 0.005), and salivary cortisol (p = 0.023) concentrations following DEX-CRH. Results support the notion of altered HPA axis regulation in chronically work-stressed teachers, with differential patterns of hyper- and hyporeactivity depending on individual stress condition and the tested functional level of the HPA axis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Data on the relationship between these two systems under real-life conditions are sparse. We, therefore, sought to examine the association between HRV and salivary cortisol, which were recorded simultaneously in a stress-exposed, prospective, occupational cohort. The study population comprised 88 nurses. We recorded heart rate (HR) and HRV during 301 working shifts. Participants provided salivary cortisol samples at the beginning of their work shift and every 2 hours thereafter. Samples were collected during three investigation periods spread over 9 months. Change scores for cortisol were calculated as deviations from the expected circadian baseline. Change scores from the grand diurnal mean in the time domain-based root mean square of successive differences served to index alterations in HRV. To account for the temporal delay between changes in HR/HRV and changes in salivary cortisol, the latter were compared with the changes in HR/HRV observed 15 minutes to 45 minutes before the cortisol sampling. During periods of high stress as indexed by high cortisol levels, we found significant associations between cortisol levels and HR (r = .48, p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; .001) and HRV (r = -.28, p = .05). However, during low stress periods, these associations were attenuated and became nonsignificant. These data suggest a relative independence in the regulation of the HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system in response to everyday stressors but synchrony of both systems in highly stressful situations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Salivary cortisol sampling compliance: comparison of patients and healthy volunteersPsychoneuroendocrinology,  2004Problems of compliance with in vivo data collection and treatment protocols have been identified.... more Problems of compliance with in vivo data collection and treatment protocols have been identified. This study investigated compliance with salivary cortisol sampling in a 7-day protocol. Impact of non-compliance on cortisol data was evaluated. Female fibromyalgia patients were matched with healthy female volunteers and randomized to Aware or Unaware conditions regarding objective monitoring of their sampling compliance. The protocol entailed collecting five saliva samples at prescribed times on each of 7 consecutive days. Participants self-reported time of each sample, and electronic monitor caps provided an objective date and time stamp of each sample. Objective compliance among participants unaware of monitoring was 71%, though their self-reported compliance was 93%. Aware participants&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; objective compliance was 90% which was consistent with self-reported compliance of 93%. Within-subject comparison of early morning rise and day slope of cortisol for compliant and non-compliant samples found significant differences with non-compliant samples resulting in flatter slopes. Patients were somewhat more compliant than healthy volunteers. Slight decrements in compliance were found for the afternoon sample (1600 h) and for the last 3 days of sampling. Compliance did not differ on weekdays versus weekends. Self-report of compliance in a salivary cortisol sampling protocol substantially overestimates actual compliance in the absence of objective monitoring. Non-compliance with the sampling protocol results in cortisol data that significantly differs from compliant data. Awareness of electronic monitoring of sampling results in satisfactory compliance.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
