 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Archive Team
 Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures. 
Collection: ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler
  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at http://www.archivebot.com.
ArchiveBot's source code can be found at https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot.

PRESS STATEMENT: Malaysia a secular State
Wednesday, 18 July 2007 07:19pm

Groups: We are 
secular
 MCA: We are a 
secular nation
The statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister in 
this 50th year of Merdeka that Malaysia has never been a secular state is 
startling as it ignores the undisputed constitutional history of the country as 
well as the social contract by which the multi-racial and multi-religious people 
of this nation came together.
The Federal Constitution was a carefully thought out, 
carefully negotiated document that evolved after much debate and discussion. 
Some historical context is necessary. In 1956, Tunku Abdul Rahman had headed a 
Merdeka Mission to London to negotiate for independence. The negotiations were 
conducted by 4 representatives of the Malay Rulers, 4 representatives of the 
then Alliance Government and representatives of the British Government. The Reid 
Commission was then appointed to draft a constitution for independent Malaya. 
The Reid Commission held 118 meetings in Malaya. It met a wide cross-section of 
people and organisations and received 131 memoranda.
One of the striking features of the Reid Commission report 
and the Federal Constitution is the inter-communal compromises. These 
compromises were essentially the result of proposals set out in a memorandum by 
the then Alliance party which had in turn been vigorously debated over many 
months by a core group from UMNO, MCA, and MIC under Tunkus chairmanship. The 
Alliance Memorandum referred to the issue of religion as follows:
The religion of Malaya shall be Islam. The observance of 
this principle shall not impose any disability on non-Muslim nationals 
professing and practising their own religion, and shall not imply that the State 
is not a secular State. (Emphasis added)
Subsequent to the issuance of the Reid Report, further reviews were carried out 
by a Working Party that again consisted of representatives from the Malay 
rulers, the Alliance party and the British Government. The Alliance party set up 
its own sub-committee chaired by its then deputy president, Datuk Abdul Razak. 
Again the Alliance maintained its position that they had no intention of 
creating a Muslim theocracy and that Malaya would be a secular State. A white 
paper subsequently issued by the British Government in June 1957 confirmed this 
by stating This will in no way affect the present position of the Federation as 
a secular State.
Since then Tunku himself, respected Academics, and our own Supreme Court in 1988 
have reiterated in one way or another that we are a secular State and not an 
Islamic State. Thus for more than 40 years (until 2001), no-one had suggested 
that Malaysia is an Islamic State.
One has to only look at the Articles in the Federal Constitution, our system of 
government and the administration of justice to know that we are not an Islamic 
State. The Civil Courts set up under the Constitution dispense secular justice 
on a daily basis to all the citizens of this country. Secular law governs 
contracts, commerce, international relations and trade and every aspect of the 
lives of a citizen. Islamic law governs specific matters set out in the Federal 
Constitution in relation to persons professing Islam. 
In the context of our history and the Constitution itself that proclaims its 
supremacy, it is the Bar Councils view that there is no doubt whatsoever that 
Malaysia is a secular state and not an Islamic state. It is noteworthy that the 
Prime Minister in his speech delivered at the conference yesterday and in his 
propagating Islam Hadhari has never referred to Malaysia as an Islamic State.
It is time that the proposition that Malaysia is not secular, 
(which is a rewriting of the Constitution), be put to rest once and for all and 
that there is due recognition and reaffirmation of the clear legal and 
constitutional position that Malaysia is, and has always been, a secular State.

STILL A SECULAR STATE!
written by Stephen Tan Ban Cheng, 
Wednesday, July 18 2007 08:33 pm
Ours is a parliamentary democracy, warts and all notwithstanding. And there are many warts to speak of, one of which is the consistent gerrymandering of parliamentary and state-level constituencies that has taken place since Merdeka nearly fifty years ago.  If a mere declaration of a serving prime minister or a deputy prime minister - all Members of Parliament are sworn to uphold the Constitution, mind you - can turn our State into an Islamic State, then let us dismantle our Parliament. Let us be done with the charade.  Right now, absent Parliament's amendment of the Constitution, ours is a secular State.  As a lawyer friend, since dead, once said rightly, "Without the Tunku, there would not have been a Federation of Malaya."  Pray hard that in the interests of all citizens and their children and grandhicldren, our blessed country will not descend into a failed State.  Stephen Tan Ban Cheng
Time to come clean.
written by Andrew Khoo, 
Wednesday, July 18 2007 09:20 pm
Sometime after that fateful day when the then Prime Minister Dato' Seri Dr. Mahathir declared that Malaysia was an Islamic State, I am given to understand that there was a meeting between him and certain leaders of the non-Muslim religions, who were of course alarmed by the declaration. Certain matters were discussed, and the then PM gave certain explanations/reasons for his declaration. If indeed such a meeting did take place, and because of this on-going controversy as to whether Malaysia is an Islamic State (which she is not), I believe the time has come for (now) Tun Dr. Mahathir or someone else who was present at the meeting to come clean and disclose to the Malaysian public what exactly was said by Tun Dr. Mahathir to assure the leaders of the non-Muslim religions who attended the meeting. Only then can this issue be put to rest once and for all.   Andrew Khoo
WHAT DR M HAS TO SAY IS 'IRRELEVANT'
written by Stephen Tan Ban Cheng, 
Wednesday, July 18 2007 10:42 pm
My dear Andrew Khoo  What former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir is going to say is, to borrow a famous phrase "irrelevant." He was the one who first made the declaration.  As an experienced parliamentarian and as a prime minister, he should have known better. He never saw it fit to operate within the bounds of moderation.  I am still wondering why the DAP did not propose a motion to cut his salary by RM10. I recall the DAP trying to make political capital out of the declaration when the leaders, being lawyers, know better than to lay politics on something as fundamental as this. The DAP went on a street campaign instead.  Stephen Tan Ban Cheng
Perception!
written by Cheah Choo Kheng, 
Thursday, July 19 2007 01:45 pm
My dear Ban Cheng,  It is a question of perception. One at times need to perceive according to the audience and  one's survival value.   Cheah Choo Kheng
