Debunking the myth of detachment and other popular New Age ideologies, she emphasizes that there's no escapism in emotional healing. Rather, the process is about putting the personal pieces of your heart, mind, and soul back together again. The Fearless Path offers a radical approach that will heal trauma, fear, heartache, and mental and physical health.Overcoming anxiety, sexual abuse, eating disorders, and addiction using the principles in this book, Leah has spent her life helping others find relief and freedom from personal afflictions.In The Fearless Path, you will learn:Why "letting go" is the worst advice for healing, and how to really move on.How to understand the stories your energy system tells about your mind, body, and spirit--and how to rewrite the script.How to transform fear and anxiety into love and inner peace.Why the law of attraction isn't all it's cracked up to be.Find strength and serenity in the midst of a personal storm.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextPersonal GrowthLanguageEnglishPublisherOpen Road Integrated MediaRelease dateMay 15, 2017ISBN9781632659163Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to The Fearless PathRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextAlchemy of the Phoenix: From the Ashes of Trauma to the Light of LoveEbookAlchemy of the Phoenix: From the Ashes of Trauma to the Light of LovebyKelly BramblettRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Alchemy of the Phoenix: From the Ashes of Trauma to the Light of Love for laterThe Divine Intertwines: A Light-Worker's Spiritual Adventure in Silicon ValleyEbookThe Divine Intertwines: A Light-Worker's Spiritual Adventure in Silicon ValleybyJeanne CorsickRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Divine Intertwines: A Light-Worker's Spiritual Adventure in Silicon Valley for laterNo More Shame: A Survivor's Guide to Letting Go of the Past and Discovering Your Inner StrengthEbookNo More Shame: A Survivor's Guide to Letting Go of the Past and Discovering Your Inner StrengthbyLaTasha CarterRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave No More Shame: A Survivor's Guide to Letting Go of the Past and Discovering Your Inner Strength for laterMidnights with the Mystic: A Little Guide to Freedom and BlissEbookMidnights with the Mystic: A Little Guide to Freedom and BlissbyCheryl SimoneRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Midnights with the Mystic: A Little Guide to Freedom and Bliss for laterI Used to Have a Handle on Life But It Broke: Six Power Solutions for Women With Too Much To DoEbookI Used to Have a Handle on Life But It Broke: Six Power Solutions for Women With Too Much To DobyMary LoVerdeRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave I Used to Have a Handle on Life But It Broke: Six Power Solutions for Women With Too Much To Do for laterThe Power of Archetypes: How to Use Universal Symbols to Understand Your Behavior and Reprogram Your SubconsciousEbookThe Power of Archetypes: How to Use Universal Symbols to Understand Your Behavior and Reprogram Your SubconsciousbyMarie D.

It’s the one that takes you to the edge—the one that threatens the solid ground beneath you. There may be more than one life-altering event, but typically one will be the most memorable, the most terrifying, the moment when your Soul calls you to choose life or death. Yes or no. Your response to the call will lay the foundation of how you experience life thereafter. When I walked into the Birmingham police station 23 years ago I was in shock. Filthy, exhausted, and emotionally paralyzed. I was a shell of a person with only my body in motion. The rest of me was comatose. I remember sitting down in a phone booth to call my parents and tell them what happened. I felt like an actor in a movie. I never believed this could be my life. I never imagined I would make this call. Two nights earlier, I had been raped. Within 48 hours I changed from being a well-functioning college student with a great part-time job and a rock-star boyfriend to an anxiety-ridden, angry, and depressed individual who felt hopeless and distraught. My world had turned upside down. Growing up offers plenty of dramatic and difficult life experiences. Mine included anxiety, my parents’ divorce, an aunt that was murdered, and later, an eating disorder. Sometimes we put negative life experiences on the back burner so we don’t have to deal with our feelings. It may work for a while, but at some point an event will set everything ablaze. The shame, guilt, and fear raging through my body dominated my sensibilities following the rape. I no longer recognized my young and precious self. Was this my fault? Did I do something wrong? What happens now? This was my first traumatic event and it brought me to the edge. It took many years and a lot of Soul searching to find my terra firma once again. I had to face the reality of the assault. It was Halloween. I remember running back to the house where the party was held. I screamed for help. I told whoever was listening that Allen, a manager at my workplace, had forced me into the woods and raped me. The proof was the condition of my devil costume: torn stockings with one leg inside out, a mangled tail, and the wetness of his semen caught in the webbing of my stockings. My hair was matted with dried leaves, and my ribs and groin were bruised. I was taken to a friend’s apartment where I slept for two days. When I finally woke up I had to move forward. I pressed charges with the police. Due to various factors, I didn’t get far in court. The court process was severely difficult and I barely had the energy to keep my head up, much less fight a toxic judicial system. I was afraid and unable to function. I quit school, quit my job, and broke up with my boyfriend. Scared and desperate, I was tormented every day with anxiety and humiliation as I tried to make sense of it all and find my way through the ordeal. With my dignity lost, I packed up my life and went home to Kentucky. I suppose there was a part of me still locked in an evidence box in Alabama. Thank God I still had my Soul. As awful as this was, it was the event that forced me to choose whether to wither or blossom. It would be a defining time that catapulted me into the healer I am today. Emotional healing is similar to physical healing. Healing needs a safe resting place, few distractions, and a lot of love. When I moved home, my dad checked on me every hour, and in the evenings when he came home from work he would sit next to me on the bed and caress my head. He assured me I would be all right, but we both knew I was in deep turmoil. A part of me wanted out of this life. At first I followed the conventional means of healing. I tried antidepressants and talk therapy. I read self-help books and created distractions in my mind. I secretly hoped to be saved by something outside of myself like a prince charming. When it came to love, I had no discernment. I became promiscuous, seeking approval from anyone who could make me feel better. I married a wonderful man only to crush our bond with my emotional wounds. He wasn’t enough to heal my pain. Nothing was enough. I was in a tug of war. It was a war of my Soul versus my humanness. My Soul wanted me to respond to my feelings; my humanness fought for a way out of this pain, out of the world. What could I do to relieve the agony without reliving it time and again? As I slowly paid more attention to what I was feeling versus what I was thinking, I understood the emotional distractions. The raucous nights were attempts to avoid my pain, loneliness, and shame. Each morning I woke up knowing that I was on the wrong path, but the resolve of my spirit was stronger. I no longer cared about the person who accosted me; I just wanted my life back. The road to healing began with research and exploration of energy healers, shamans, ancient spiritual traditions, and body-mind therapies. Tending to my feelings was a difficult and scary process, but I began to see positive results. Meditation and developing my intuition were aspects of regaining my mental stability and I also began to understand the concept of energy medicine. As the healing transpired, trust and faith reasserted themselves and I was able to listen to the desires of my heart. My healing talents were discovered through the process of being healed. I started connecting to Leah again, and life was beginning to make sense in a beautiful new way. My journey to wellness began more than 22 years ago, and I continue to incorporate the principles in this book—emotional healing, bodywork, yoga, breath work, organic nutrition, and meditation—into my life and in my healing work with others. As a healer, I’m afforded the opportunity to help people change and grow. Many people believe healers perform magic. That’s far from the truth. Healers, like me, are only the conduit of energy and counsel to help others reach greater heights. I think of it as helping others turn the transformational corner. As I discovered, when we commit to healing, we say yes to growth. We discover that life is actually working for us, not against us. What Is Emotional Healing? People are suffering and want to feel better. The suffering is not only from negative emotions, but from suppressing the positive ones as well. The Fearless Path is a process that allows your fullest potential of happiness and peace. At some level, being emotionally unhealthy gets in the way of most any interaction. It’s hard to excel in work, focus on a task, or have positive relationships when there is inner turmoil. Life becomes a constant juggling act, trying to balance the demands of our lives with the demands of our bodies, minds, and emotions. With the practice of emotional healing, you’ll manage your relationships better, be more focused and productive, have a more fulfilling work life, less drama, and the freedom of spirit to achieve your goals. Emotional wellness is just as important as physical wellness and leads to a more satisfying experience of life. Emotional healing is the connection of Self to Soul. A deep voice within may be alerting you that something is not right, not whole. It speaks in the language of shame, anxiety, fear, or depression and craves the experience of wholeness and connectivity to your Soul. The radical road to self-love is to integrate the past with the reality of your present life without shame or blame. Staying connected is empowering, and where there is power and love, there is action and fearlessness. Getting past the fear and moving toward healing is tricky because fear is the great emotional chameleon. It morphs into shapes or expressions, masking genuine feelings of excitement, loneliness, hope, sadness, exhilaration, grief, and shame. Regardless of how it presents itself, fear blocks your emotional freedom. You may be a quiet person by nature, or you may have developed the fear to speak because no one listened to you as a child and it crushed your self-confidence. It is fear that keeps you from breaking free of the cycle, fear of not being worthy, heard, or loved. There are only a few things that we can’t control in life, but those few things give us such fear that our whole lives operate in avoidance of them. These include fear of death, rejection, pain, and other people’s reactions. Some people also have little hope in their lives for redemption, and find themselves draped in an oppressive cloak of despair. When trying to deal with negative or difficult emotions in life, people often attempt to detach or break free from the pain. Detachment, however, breaks the connection of Self to Soul, which causes fragmentation in thought, behavior, and authentic emotions. Self is defined differently than Soul, at least for the purposes of this book. Self is your humanness, the grounded and present energy that contains body, mind, and spirit. Soul is the eternal part of who you are, the conductor of your life that inhabits your Self. As the Self detaches from emotions, it distances from the Soul. This is likely a form of self-preservation directed by our limited minds. Your Soul craves connection and feeling, as emotion is the very essence of its expression. Your Soul gauges and translates experiences through emotion, but we humans run from emotions, especially the bad ones, to avoid pain. The Fearless Path offers a better approach. The word healing means wholeness. To be whole, you mend the broken pieces of your Self back together, not tear them apart. It’s about connection rather than separation. The goal is to become fully functioning, whole, and heart-centered individuals who can continue to grow not in spite of the pain, but because of the pain. You must be willing to resist the urge to flee negative emotions or the memory of them and instead learn how to hold them tenderly, with care, compassion, and full acceptance. The process of healing provides a reconnection of your heart to your spirit, of Self to your Soul. You possess exactly what you need to become self-actualized. Your life story is unique, as will be your healing. But emotions are universal and relatable. No matter the specific affliction, one can identify a person’s struggle with varying degrees of accuracy. You can never totally escape suffering, as suffering is part of life. You can, however, become free from emotional entrapment brought on by disconnection, disassociation, displacement, or detachment. It’s not possible to enjoy freedom while resisting pain or denying experiences. There’s no easy escape ladder from your pain. There’s no back door for a quick exit. The way to healing is with love. Not possessiveness, but acceptance. Not resentment, but forgiveness. Not detachment, but attachment to Self and Soul. This includes all your experiences over your lifetime as well as the emotions that they provoked. This is the fearless path. This is where love resides. This is how you can attain the radical life of peace. This book offers more than information about fear or anxiety, but these are common symptoms of what is becoming an epidemic condition I call Post Traumatic Emotional Disorder (PTED). Whereas Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a result of severely shocking, dangerous, or scary situations and trauma, PTED can be the result of normal, but severely impactful, life experiences that cause negative or difficult emotions. Those with Post Traumatic Emotional Disorder continue to suffer long after emotional harm or pain is inflicted because they have not learned how to deal with their feelings appropriately. It is possible to learn how to welcome authentic feelings of the present and not react to dramatic triggers of the past through the process of emotional healing. A major aspect of emotional healing is taking responsibility for your feelings and your happiness. This is not to take responsibility for someone else’s issues, but to accept the difficult things in your life and own them as part of your being. It is having the maturity to acknowledge that certain events have shaped your life but don’t define your life. Don’t try to let go of your past, move forward with it. There’s no finish line to healing. It’s a process. In our quick-fix society it’s the process part that turns people off. The ing of healing makes it seem perpetual, and it is. Some people attempt to bypass the whole healing process by calling the doctor for a pill to ease their emotional or mental suffering. I invite you to a richer, more radical life. Healing requires bravery and a new direction. Step into the process of healing and watch your life transform. There is relief available in the midst of the heal(ing) if you learn how to access it. This book offers the tools, insight, and inspiration needed to travel the path to self-love and peace. I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become. —Carl Jung It may seem like a big undertaking, but The Fearless Path will identify and guide you through difficult emotions and help you deploy strategies to make you stronger, not weaker. How to Use This Book This book identifies the primary ways that we become imbalanced in our lives and provides strategies to restore and redeem your emotional health. As you work through the process, the integrity of your mind and spirit will be fortified. One of the ways I began healing and experienced change in my life was to understand the subtle energy system and the pragmatic way it relates to life. You may also benefit from a basic understanding of this age-old wisdom and have the desire to translate the information to your own healing. There is power in knowledge. Life experiences imprint energetic patterns into our chakras, which are centers within the body where spiritual power and energy flow. As we respond to different life experiences, our body and energy change according to the health of our emotions, our mind, and our habits. The energy of chakras fluctuates, as do the emotions and experiences in our lives. Usually, however, we can notice patterns. Each chakra, or energy center, governs different aspects of our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies as they work together to create a wholeness and balance in our overall health. Sometimes the energy contracts, stagnates, or is suppressed. Sometimes the energy is over-charged and misused. There are various physical and emotional effects from each of these different patterns. This book will help you to better understand the patterns that cause blocks, imbalances, and disease, and how patterns can shift to create freedom, self-love, and peace. To help you, each chapter corresponds to the seven major chakras in your body. This is your guide to healing in a more holistic way, through emotion, mind, and energy. You will also discover how issues such as OCD, eating disorders, obesity, and other maladies emerge due to unprocessed emotions and imbalanced energies. You will learn about healing antidotes for emotional and energetic imbalances including oils, practical exercises, meditations, and Emotional Workouts. There’s no magic wand, although I do love wands! If you do the work, you will make significant steps toward healing. The nature of healing requires action as well as inspiration. Utilizing the core principle of connection along with the exercises of Spiritual Mapping, meditation, and Emotional Workouts provides a powerful framework to help you. The Emotional Workouts help exercise your emotional body. Learn and incorporate them into your life on a daily or weekly basis. Just as we do physical workouts to keep our body and health in shape, the Emotional Workouts will keep your spirit and emotional body up to par. They are not all emotionally cathartic, however. Some are physical and fun, and others are challenging and thought-provoking, but all are worthwhile. As you work through the book, I recommend using a separate journal dedicated to your emotional and spiritual growth to record answers to the exercises and save your thoughts and insights. Be mindful as you participate in these or other healthy practices to connect your energy and focus on what you are doing in the moment. Positive intention goes a long way toward healing. Spiritual Mapping is a tool I created to help find healing and meaning between our suffering and the purity of our hearts. To experience radical self-love, you must discover the links between your current reality, including unwanted or distressing emotions, and the desires of your Soul. Somewhere between the two, there is a choice or action that was based in fear. When using this process, you will accept and apply compassion and love to your reality. Spiritual Mapping is not about judgment or blame, nor is it about the law of attraction or a type of magic trick. It’s a visible path to track your feelings, choices, and behaviors that have positioned you in a particular moment. Mapping should be applied to self-imposed suffering, not the suffering that is caused by other factors. Spiritual Mapping allows a new perspective on your life and it requires brutal honesty. Maps can reveal issues like guilt that lead to addiction, or indicate how loneliness is sparked by a deep fear of abandonment. You may be hiding behind a dissatisfying job or stuck in a bad relationship due to choices you made long ago about your worthiness. The map will help you discover that peace and freedom are available to you as you track back to your heart. At the end of each chapter you will find basic information on each chakra, as well as a meditation to help balance and fortify the corresponding energy center and the mind. Each area has colors, gemstones, and oils that can be used as supplemental tools for balancing and support. However, please note that these are not cures and they should not take the place of emotional and physical self-care. Color therapy can be used regularly by surrounding yourself with the colors that help correct the energy imbalance. Clothes, foods, and home décor are simple ways to achieve good results. Gemstones are gifts of nature that provide subtle and nurturing energy.
