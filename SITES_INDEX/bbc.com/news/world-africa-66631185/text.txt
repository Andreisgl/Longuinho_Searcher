A 2017 coup against veteran ruler Robert Mugabe put him in charge.Zimbabweans still face high inflation, poverty and a climate of fear.When he first became president, Mr Mnangagwa - known as "The Crocodile" for his ruthlessness - promised a new start for his country's people. But Zimbabwe had one of the highest inflation rates in the world last month - prices in July had rocketed by 101.3% since the previous year. Unemployment also remains rife, with only 25% of Zimbabweans holding formal jobs.Mr Mnangagwa's vow to guarantee human rights also appears hollow, with little changing in this regard since Mr Mugabe's departure.Image source, ReutersImage caption, His supporters still bring out a cuddly crocodile toy during Zanu-PF ralliesCritics say the 80-year-old silenced dissent and clamped down on the opposition in the run-up to the vote, which he had been widely-expected to win.The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said Mr Mnangagwa's main challenger, Citizens' Coalition for Change (CCC) candidate Nelson Chamisa, secured 44% of the vote.Mr Mnangagwa received more than 2.3m votes, while Mr Chamisa took 1.9m, according to the ZEC. Voter turnout in the country of almost 16m was 69%, the electoral body said.But Mr Chamisa said that the opposition had the "real results" and that there had been many irregularities."We have won this election. We are the leaders. We are even surprised why Mnangagwa has been declared a leader," he told journalists in Harare.Zimbabwe’s ‘crocodile’ who wants another biteZimbabwe country profileA spokesperson for the CCC posted on X - formerly known as Twitter - that the party rejected "any result hastily assembled without proper verification".Observer missions from the EU, Commonwealth and 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) said they had a number of concerns with the vote, including the banning of opposition rallies, issues with the electoral register, biased state media coverage and voter intimidation."The elections were fraught with irregularities and aggrieved the people of Zimbabwe," political analyst Rejoice Ngwenya told AFP.The run-up to the election was largely free of violence, but CCC members were convicted on what they describe as fabricated charges aimed at weakening the party. The party says the police have banned several of its meetings since July, and nearly 100 gatherings since it was formed in January last year.Earlier this month, 40 CCC members, including a parliamentary candidate, were arrested while campaigning in the capital Harare. The recent killing of a CCC backer, allegedly by supporters of Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF party, further raised concerns about rights.Critics continue to be arrested and taken to court for insulting the president - an offence punishable by one year in jail or a fine or both. A man in Harare was charged in April after allegedly being overheard by a police officer saying that Mr Mnangagwa would lose the next election."The Crocodile", as he is known, has a fearsome reputation that was cemented after independence during the civil war that broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, Mr Mnangagwa was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu.Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF.Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres. As president he has tried to broach reconciliation. Some have felt his comments glib given the deep wounds in Matabeleland, but an initiative to allow exhumations and reburials has been agreed.Voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections was meant to take place on Wednesday, but was extended into Thursday in some areas due to the late distribution of ballot papers.Mr Mnangagwa's election means Zanu-PF has ruled Zimbabwe for 43 years, since the country gained independence from British rule in 1980.The party was also declared the winner in the parliamentary race, securing 136 of 210 seats, with the CCC taking 73. A further 60 seats are reserved for women and are appointed through proportional representation.Related TopicsEmmerson MnangagwaZimbabweMore on this storyZimbabwe’s ‘crocodile’ who wants another bitePublished19 AugustIs Zimbabwe any better off without Mugabe?Published22 November 2022Zimbabwe country profilePublished1 day agoTop StoriesProud Boys leader gets 17 years for Capitol riotPublished6 hours agoRussia and Iran invited back to Nobel Prize banquetPublished3 hours agoEngland coach Wiegman dedicates award to SpainPublished6 hours agoloadingFeatures'Any story could be your last' - India's Kashmir press crackdownWhat a death in a lift reveals about Africa's debtWeekly quiz: Which politician lost a rap battle with Eminem?Success frees me to show my African roots - AkonPhilippines stands up to Beijing in South China seaThe firms hoping to cut down on wasted cosmeticsWhen a child is shot, doctors must heal more than bullet holes'No safe spaces to learn' - back to school in UkraineStriking images of life under the MafiaElsewhere on the BBCThe new Napoleon film stirring debateStunning photos of a new African wonderWhy electric crops may soon be on the menuMost Read1Jet ski tourists shot dead in Algerian waters2Proud Boys leader gets 17 years for Capitol riot3Oprah and The Rock pledge direct payments in Maui4Russia and Iran invited back to Nobel Prize banquet5Doctor clears Mitch McConnell after health scare6Covid fraudster used funds to buy alpaca farm7UK defence giant BAE Systems sets up Ukraine base8Philippines stands up to Beijing in South China sea9Antique statue seized in US looting inquiry10Brain fog after Covid linked to blood clots - studyBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with us© 2023 BBC.
