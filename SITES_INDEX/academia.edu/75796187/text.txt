Whereas it was not even considered to be a primary goal of treatment thirty years ago, it is the main focus of mental health policy today. These changes are partially the result of the work of sociologists who were studying mental health during the time of institutional treatment and the early stages of community-based care. Despite these early influences, the sociology of mental health has largely overlooked the explicit study of recovery. This is because sociologists began shifting their focus from the study of SMI to the study of less severe mental health problems beginning in 1970s. In this paper I (a) discuss the evolving history of mental health recovery; (b) how recovery is defined today in policy, practice, and research; and (c) present an argument for why sociological perspectives and methods can help shed light on the tensions between the definitions while assisting to develop better understan...Download Free PDFView PDFWorld PsychiatryThe vision of recovery today: what it is and what it means for services2007 • Marianne FarkasIn the past, practice in mental health was guided by the belief that individuals with serious mental illnesses do not recover. The course of their illness was either seen pessimistically, as deteriorative, or optimistically, as a maintenance course.

This framework moves from first level (personal) change to second level (community and society) change, with an emphasis on creating and accessing community resources and social relationships that are needed to develop and exercise the person-based capacity to recover. Recognizing and understanding the intersect of predominantly Western/Eurocentric understanding of recovery and native/ indigenous approaches to wellbeing is an emerging challenge and opportunity. Creating space for the application of Native Hawaiian and other indigenous ways of knowing, traditional wisdoms and ancestral and modern-day communal resilience in partnership with research-based Western recovery practice advances and validates worldviews of wellbeing. Such practice honours the first territory: integrity. Coercion undermines integrity and thus wellbeing. Going &quot;Force Free&quot; is the vision and challenge we need to embrace.

Horizons’ ‘‘recovery-oriented’’ initiatives unwit- tingly mobilized stressful North American discourses of valued citizenship. At times, efforts to ‘‘empower’’ people diagnosed with schizophrenia to become esteemed self- made citizens generated more stressful sociocultural conditions for people whose daily lives were typically remarkably stressful. A recovery-oriented mental health system must account for people diagnosed with schizophrenia’s sensitivity to stress and offer consumers contextually relevant coping mechanisms. Any attempt to export U.S. mental health care practices to the rest of the world must acknowledge that (1) sociocultural conditions affect schizophrenia outcomes; (2) schizophrenia outcomes are already better in the developing world than in the United States; and (3) much of what leads to ‘‘better’’ outcomes in the developing world may rely on the availability of locally relevant techniques to address stress.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Public Mental HealthComplete mental health recovery: bridging mental illness with positive mental health2011 • Basavaraj BiradarDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Review of PsychiatryRecovery in Hong Kong: Service user participation in mental health services2012 • Roger NgDownload Free PDFView PDFFamilies in Society: The Journal of Contemporary Social ServicesThe Looking-Glass Self: Looking at Relationship as the Mechanism of Change in Case Management of Persons With Severe Mental Illness2012 • David kondratDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
