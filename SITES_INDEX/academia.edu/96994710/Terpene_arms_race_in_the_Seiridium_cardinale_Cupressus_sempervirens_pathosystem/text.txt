We investigated the production of terpenes by canker-resistant and susceptible cypresses inoculated with S. cardinale, the effect of these terpenes on fungal growth and the defensive biotransformation of the terpenes conducted by the fungus. All infected trees produced de novo terpenes and strongly induced terpenic responses, but the responses were stronger in the canker-resistant than the susceptible trees. In vitro tests for the inhibition of fungal growth indicated that the terpene concentrations of resistant trees were more inhibitory than those of susceptible trees. The highly induced and de novo terpenes exhibited substantial inhibition (more than a fungicide reference) and had a high concentration-dependent inhibition, whereas the most abundant terpenes had a low concentration-dependent inhibition. S. cardinale biotransformed three terpenes and was capable of detoxifying the...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Chemical EcologyStrong Induction of Minor Terpenes in Italian Cypress, Cupressus sempervirens, in Response to Infection by the Fungus Seiridium cardinale2015 • Gianni Della RoccaDownload Free PDFView PDFForestsTerpenoid Accumulation Links Plant Health and Flammability in the Cypress-Bark Canker PathosystemGianni Della RoccaTo explore the possible relationship between diseased trees and wildfires, we assessed the flammability of canker-resistant and susceptible common cypress clones that were artificially infected with Seiridium cardinale compared to healthy trees. This study explored the effect of terpenoids produced by the host plant in response to infection and the presence of dead plant portions on flammability. Terpenoids were extracted and quantified in foliage and bark samples by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). A Mass Loss Calorimeter was used to determine the main flammability descriptors. The concentration of terpenoids in bark and leaf samples and the flammability parameters were compared using a generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) model. A partial least square (PLS) model was generated to predict flammability based on the content of terpenoid, clone response to bark canker and the disease status of the plants. The total terpenoid content drastically increased in the bark of ...Download Free PDFView PDFfiles.figshare.comChemical profiles based on terpene composition in Cupressus sempervirens L. show large diversity in Western CreteAristotelis C.

The time-course development of polyphenolic parenchyma (PP) cells and phloem axial resin duct (PARD)-like structures in the phloem was investigated in two C. sempervirens clones, one resistant and one susceptible to the disease, through anatomical and histological observations carried out by light microscope during a 19-day trial. PP cells were constitutively more abundant in the canker-resistant clone (R clone) compared with the susceptible clone (S clone), whereas PARD-like structures were not present in the bark of untreated plants of both clones. PP cells increased in both clones as a response to infection, but in the R clone, they were more abundant 5 and 12 days after inoculation. After inoculation, PARD-like structures app...Download Free PDFView PDFApplied SciencesThere Is Not Only Cupressus sempervirens L.: A Review on the Phytochemistry and Bioactivities of the Other Cupressus L. SpeciesClaudio FrezzaThis review article reports for the first time phytochemistry, ethnobotanical uses and pharmacological activities of all Cupressus L. species other than Cupressus sempervirens L. Indeed, the literature survey showed how many other Cupressus species are rich of important phytochemical compounds, widely used in the ethnobotanical field for several purposes and endowed with interesting biological activities, even if they are somehow neglected by the scientific community. This review aims to continue the study of these other Cupressus species and promote more research on them.Download Free PDFView PDFBiochemical Systematics and EcologyEffect of some leaf essential oil phenotypes in coastal redwood on the growth of several fungi with endophytic stages1991 • Francisco J Espinosa-García, Jean LangenheimDownload Free PDFView PDF2007 Acta Silv-Lign-Hung Seiridium PCR-select.PDFNicola  La PortaDownload Free PDFView PDFIdentification of gene involved in cypress canker by PCR-select subtractive hybridisation approach2007 • Nicola  La PortaDownload Free PDFView PDFSilvae Genetica 56, 6 GALLIS et al2007 • Athanassios GallisThe terpene composition of twigs in 106 trees from 6 provenances of Cupressus sempervirens L. grown in the island Crete of Greece was determined by GLC-MS analysis. The aim was to investigate the utility of cortex terpene composition to study the genetic variation between cypress provenances. Twenty nine compounds were detected in cortex resin of all trees, twenty one of which identified. The major constituents were cedrol, α-pinene, 3-δ-carene and α-terpinyl acetate. A cluster analysis based on the amounts of the four evaluated compounds classified all the trees in five chemotypes. The chemotype pattern for every provenance was determined. Based on distribution of chemotypes two main groups of provenances can be suggested.Download Free PDFView PDFPhytopathologia MediterraneaNewly-assessed fungicides for the control of cypress canker caused by Seiridium cardinale2011 • Della RoccaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
