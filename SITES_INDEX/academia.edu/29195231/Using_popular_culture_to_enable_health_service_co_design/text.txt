The design activities were related to two main themes, the transition from paediatrics to adult healthcare and patient-oriented social networking, and were implemented with a group of young patients who were members of the Youth Council, an advisory body to the hospital. We describe two design strategies, Design Stations and Continuous Participation Platform. Design Stations facilitate a design process that uses the time with the teens effectively and caters also to the teens' creativity and attention span. The Continuous Participation Platform contributes to maintaining consistency and continuity between the Design Station meetings. The process consisted of four design workshops, which took place in a hospital, and online activities in between these workshops. Nine small research projects were implemented, using a range of diverse participatory methods and tools. In the chapter we analyse and discuss the results using the SHARM framework, our Participatory Design methodology for designing with and for teenagers with chronic health challenges. SHARM focuses on situation-based action, having a say, adaptability, respect, and mutual learning. We found that our participants switch between their identity as a patient and as a teenager. Building and strengthening a third identity, namely that of a co-designer, may further improve the design efforts when designing with this particular group of participants.Download Free PDFView PDFParticipatory Design and Design for ValuesMaja van der Velden, Christina MörtbergParticipatory Design (PD) is a design methodology in which the future users of a design participate as co-designers in the design process. It is a value-centered design approach because of its commitment to the democratic and collective shaping of a better future. This chapter builds forth on the Scandinavian Participatory Design tradition. We discuss why the design process is as important as the final result, the product, or service. The creative application of Participatory Design methods facilitates a design process in which values emerge and become inscribed in a prototype. We present PD’s guiding principles: equalizing power relations, democratic practices, situation- based action, mutual learning, tools and techniques, and alternative visions about technology. In addition, we discuss some value practices and design methods informed by our PD projects in health care and the public sector. We maintain that Participatory Design increases the chance that the final result of a design process represents the values of the future users.Download Free PDFView PDFInfrastructuring interventions or intervening infrastructures?Pablo Calderón Salazar*Article presented at the 1st PARSE conference, which took place on November 2015 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Design as ‘infrastructuring’ approaches design as a long-term process of anticipation or envisioning of potential design (Björgvinsson, Ehn & Hillgren, 2012), often via the development of tools, techniques and processes that allow actors to deal with uncertainties that they encounter in participatory ways (DiSalvo, Clement & Pipek, 2013). Although ‘long-term participation’ and ‘intervention’ may appear to be contradictory, this article describes how interventions contribute to infrastructuring processes that address public space and public issues. Interventions in public space are often driven by a wish to reclaim the common right to it and regularly use a ‘hit-and-run tactic’ (Markussen, 2013). This article discusses the role that these (short-term and often disruptive) interventions can play in long-term participation (O’Neill & Doherty, 2010) and specifically their ways of making uncertainties tangible. We analyse an infrastructuring process defined by on-going participatory interventions in Genk (BE). We discuss three series of interventions that explicitly shaped our ways of working in the infrastructuring processes, being (1) ‘Hack-a-thing’, (2) ‘FanLab’ (see: Figure 1) and (3) ‘The Other Market’. Using Latour’s framing of uncertainties (Huybrechts, Dreessen & Schepers, 2015), we illustrate how the interventions made uncertainties related to actors, actions and objects/matters tangible and how (long-term) participation was enhanced or obstructed in the process (cfr. the above-mentioned approach). Our contribution takes on the form of an extended article and a live, participatory presentation of visualisations of the process, documenting how diverse constellations of actors, actions and matters of concern (Latour, 2005) take form and shift through the interventions over time. We specifically focus on the uncertainties that are associated with these constellations to gain an understanding of how interventions enhance or obstruct the infrastructuring process.Download Free PDFView PDFCHI’13, April 27 – May 2, 2013, Paris, France, Research Methods for Teenage and Young Adult (TYA)Bodymapping: A Way To Engage Young People With Long -Term  Conditions2013 • Helena SustarGrowing up is a sensitive period for any young person and especially for those with long-term health conditions. Research shows different levels of young peoples participation. This paper focuses on a Bodymapping activity conducted as a part of a 10-month study developing services and technologies for better self-management young people with type 1 diabetes. With this activity, they were able to engage with their condition, reflect on it and discuss it more openly.Download Free PDFView PDFParticipatory IT design and participatory development: a comparative review2008 • Haider RizviDownload Free PDFView PDFParticipatory Design: The Third Space in HCI2002 • Michael MullerDownload Free PDFView PDFHybridity and Participatory Design -1 - DRAFT: Publisher has final version Participatory Design: The Third Space in HCIMichael MullerThis chapter surveys methods, techniques, and practices in Participatory Design (PD) that can lead to hybrid experiences – that is, practices that take place neither in the users’ domain, nor in the technology developers’ domain, but in an “in-between” region that shares attributes of both spaces. Recent work in cultural theory claims that this “in-between” region, or “third space,” is a fertile environment in which participants can combine diverse knowledges into new insights and plans for action. This can include articulating, clarifying, and informing the needs of themselves as individuals, and of the people they are connected to or responsible for – e.g., depending on who the user is, their organizations, institutions, products, and services, or their classmates, playmates, families, and schools, or other people with similar situations, circumstances, challenges, or who face similar kinds of social stigma. Important attributes of third space experiences include challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many-voiced) discussions across and through differences. The chapter focuses on participatory practices that share these attributes, including: site-selection of PD work; workshops; story-collecting and story-telling through text, photography, and drama; games for analysis and design; and the co-creation of descriptive and functional prototypes.Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the 3rd conference on  …On the move with a magic thing: role playing in concept design of mobile services and devices2000 • Kari KuuttiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
