Divali in Trinidad and Tobago
 
Divali is the Festival of Lights that symbolizes the lifting of spiritual darkness and will be observed in Trinidad and Tobago on October 29, 2016. With one of the largest East Indian populations in the entire Caribbean region, Divali is the biggest and brightest of all Hindu festivals celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago, with the country boasting one of the largest sites for lighting of diyas outside of India!
At dusk, families and friends join together in the tradition of lighting diyas around the home, in yards, open spaces, staircases and on bamboo stalks bent into innovative shapes and fantastic designs. The hub of all Divali celebrations is held in central Trinidad which is home to the Divali Nagar, the first Hindu theme park in the world! So tremendous has been the impact of the Divali Nagar that it has inspired Hindu theme parks and other Nagars across the globe.
 
 
This sacred festival is known to bring about positive feelings in the community and is marked by unity, cleanliness, harmony, and festivity. It is observed and celebrated as a national holiday which unifies the nation in the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious Trinidadian society. 
As we at the British Council continue to strive for worldwide trust and understanding for ultimate human prosperity, may we use this Divali season to bring about a vibrant aura of peacefulness that will emerge in us all.  
Happy Divali.
