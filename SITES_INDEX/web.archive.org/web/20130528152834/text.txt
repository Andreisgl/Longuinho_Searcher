 Edinburgh, United KingdomUNESCO City of LiteratureIn October 2004, Edinburgh, became the first UNESCO City of Literature.
The city’s nomination has drawn attention to the literary activities and prestigious events that take place in Scotland, such as the international Man Booker prize for literature. Edinburgh now wants to capitalise on this honour and to provide true benefits for Scotland by promoting the country through literature, while making the city a model for the other cities of literature to come.© Valentino EtowarView of Princes Street Gardens in the direction of Sir Walter Scott monument on the left.Not only is Edinburgh the home of many world-famous contemporary authors, but it also boasts many historic literary legends such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Walter Scott, the author of Ivanhoe and Rob Roy and Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote Jekyll and Hyde and Treasure Island.
