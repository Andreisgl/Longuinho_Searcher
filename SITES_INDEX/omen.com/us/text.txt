Laptops Frames Per Second (FPS), calculations are benchmark scores tested by UL based on system specifications. Frames per second values will vary based on combinations of graphics card, processor and screen resolution selected in the configuration tool. Screen refresh speed is not factored into the calculation. The frames rate is an estimate rather than exact performance and is an average of in-game frame rates observed during testing. Actual FPS speeds are dependent on display refresh speeds. FPS speeds estimated at a higher speed than the hardware max speed will require an external display capable of reaching those speeds.
 
Benchmark scores are provided by UL based on the system specifications. UL has not tested every configuration explicitly. The precision of UL benchmark scores is usually better than 3%. Some systems may perform more consistently than others. In rare cases, a device may be unable to deliver consistent performance due to its design.
 
Game performance estimates are an average of in-game frame rates observed during testing conducted by UL. The frame rate is an estimate rather than an exact guarantee of performance.
 
Software changes such as Windows updates, driver updates, and game updates may affect performance.
