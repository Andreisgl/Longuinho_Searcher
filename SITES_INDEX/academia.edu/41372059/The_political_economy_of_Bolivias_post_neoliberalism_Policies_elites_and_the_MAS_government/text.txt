In order to better understand this surprising success story, this paper analyses the political economy of the post-neoliberal model that has taken shape under MAS rule. More specifically, it looks at the interaction between the strategic orientation and the specific features of economic policy-making in Bolivia, on the one hand, and the evolving relationship of the MAS government with the country's economic elites, on the other. The paper argues that Bolivia's specific version of post-neoliberalism has facilitated increasingly cooperative relations between the government and economic elites, while the latter have themselves contributed to the consolidation of the former. At the same time, the analysis of the political economy of Bolivian post-neoliberalism also reveals its inherent fragility. Resumen: La economía política del postneoliberalismo boliviano: Política y elites Con el flujo de la marea rosa, el gobierno del MAS en Bolivia sigue siendo uno de los go-biernos izquierdistas elegidos más exitosos de toda América Latina desde finales de los años noventa. Para comprender mejor esta sorprendente historia de éxito, este artículo analiza la economía política del modelo post-neoliberal que ha tomado forma bajo el gobierno del MAS. Más específicamente, analiza la interacción entre la orientación estratégica y las ca-racterísticas específicas de la formulación de políticas económicas en Bolivia, por un lado, y la relación en evolución del gobierno del MAS con las élites económicas del país, por otro. Se argumenta que la versión específica del post-neoliberalismo de Bolivia ha facilitado rela-ciones cada vez más cooperativas entre el gobierno y las élites económicas, quienes han contribuido a la consolidación de las primeras. Al mismo tiempo, el análisis de la economía política del posneoliberalismo boliviano también revela su fragilidad inherente.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSouth Atlantic QuarterlyWhat Neoliberalism Could Not Do, the MAS Can: Divergences and Compatibility between Political Forms and Capital Accumulation in Bolivia2016 • Huáscar Salazar LohmanRecently, the policies promoted by the government of the Movement to Socialism Party (Movimiento al Socialismo; MAS) have shown themselves to be increasingly and explicitly tied to the interests of old and new dominant elites. In contrast to the neoliberal era, when domination was confronted with broad popular resistance, the recent capitulation to old and new dominant elites has become feasible thanks to the new forms of organization of state control that were established with Evo Morales's presidency in 2006 and during subsequent political-economic transformations. This article examines how the political form on which Morales's government was founded instituted a narrative and practice that penetrated and disarticulated popular—mainly communitarian—forces that once resisted neoliberal politics, effectively making the Bolivian socio-economic structure more permeable to transnational capital.Download Free PDFView PDF"La oleada antidemocrática neoliberal en Bolivia (1985-2005)LA OLEADA ANTIDEMOCRÁTICA NEOLIBERAL EN BOLIVIA (1985-20052011 • Pedro González de Molina SolerArtículo publicado para el Congreso: "Jóvenes historiadores Atlánticos", en Gran Canaria.

This article seeks to trace the political economy of the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) from its neostructural and neoextractivist roots in the 2006 National Development Plan (NDP) through the economic strategy actually implemented by the MAS during its time in government. By examining macroeconomic indicators, the structure of the economy, industrialisation efforts and infrastructural projects this article advances a two-pronged argument. On the one hand, economic policy, as well as industrialisation and infrastructure projects, have focused on maximising economic surplus in the extractive sectors over cultivating the sectors that employ the majority of Bolivians. It has then redistributed part of the rents captured by the state into these labour-intensive sectors. This has consolidated Bolivia's insertion into the global market as a primary commodity producer. On the other hand, the neostructuralist tenets of the NDP have meant that the class character of these policies has been ignored by the government. As the commodities bonanza came to a close in 2013 the government increasingly sided with capital over labour in social struggles over economic development.Download Free PDFView PDFState Power and Political-Power-Balance in Bolivia: An Analysis through Laws and FinancesIsabella RadhuberDownload Free PDFView PDFSociological InquiryImpasse in Bolivia: Neoliberal Hegemony and Popular Resistance - by Benjamin Kohl and Linda C.

Indeed, the govern-ments led by Evo Morales and Rafael Correa have implemented processes of far-reaching political change which included the rewriting of the countries’ constitutions and the turning away from previous neoliberal recipes towards a much more state-centered development model. These political changes met with fierce resistance, in particular from the traditional political and economic elites. In the political arena, this polarization continues until today (further aggravated by increasing conflicts between the governments and former allies) – but below the level of official politics, remarkable changes have taken place that have yet to be studied systematically. These changes concern the relationship of the two governments with important business sectors. Most notably is the rapprochement between the Bolivian govern-ment and the economic elites from Santa Cruz, which had been fiercely oppositional during Morales’s first term in office. The turn from conflict to rapprochement is not that clear-cut in the Ecuadorian case, but also here recent years have seen some notable changes. The paper analyzes whether there has been, indeed, such a change from conflict to rapprochement in the relationship between the two governments and the respective business sectors. It aims at (1) empirically assessing and comparing the dynamics of conflict and rapprochement in the two countries, (2) identifying the causes that explain change, and (3) analyzing the implications for democracy and the overall processes of change. A revised version of this paper entitled "Business Power and the Politics of Post-Neoliberalism: Business-Government Relations in Bolivia and Ecuador" will be published in Latin American Politics & Society.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Review of Latin American and Caribbean StudiesThe political economy of post-neoliberalism in Bolivia: Policies, elites, and the MAS government2019 • Jonas WolffDownload Free PDFView PDFSimilar Critiques on Neoliberalism and Different Post-Neoliberal Responses in Bolivia and EcuadorCristina BastidasThis article aims to contribute to the understanding of recent democratization processes in Bolivia and Ecuador, two Andean countries that underwent similar processes of contestation to neoliberalism and implemented different strategies and policies to respond to it. In this article, I will focus on the similarities between the democratic processes of Bolivia and Ecuador in the context of neoliberalism and the divergent post-neoliberal responses implemented in the last decade.Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal Anti-neoliberalism Anti-neoliberalism or a new socialistic agenda?

It specifically traces the shift from confrontation to rapprochement to a fairly stable pattern of negotiation and dialogue that characterizes the two governments&#39; interaction with core business elites. Drawing on the structural and instrumental power framework developed by Tasha Fairfield, it proposes an explanation that accounts for this overall shift as well as for the main differences between the two countries. In a nutshell, the article argues that the business elites&#39; response to a severe loss of instrumental power and the governments&#39; response to the persistent structural power of business combined to cause the shift toward negotiation and dialogue. The article also probes the plausibility of this power-based explanation by briefly comparing the two cases with other left-of-center governments in the region.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
