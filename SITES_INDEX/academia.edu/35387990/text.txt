EkeThis article will be positioned on our previous work demonstrating the importance of adhering to a carefully selected set of criteria when choosing the suitable method from those available ensuring its adequate performance when applied to real temporal signals, such as fMRI BOLD, to evaluate one important facet of their behavior, fractality. Earlier, we have reviewed on a range of monofractal tools and evaluated their performance. Given the advance in the fractal field, in this article we will discuss the most widely used implementations of multifractal analyses, too. Our recommended flowchart for the fractal characterization of spontaneous, low frequency fluctuations in fMRI BOLD will be used as the framework for this article to make certain that it will provide a hands-on experience for the reader in handling the perplexed issues of fractal analysis. The reason why this particular signal modality and its fractal analysis has been chosen was due to its high impact on today&#39;s ne...Download Free PDFView PDFMultifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of Nonstationary Time SeriesEugene StanleyDownload Free PDFView PDFEncyclopedia of Complexity and Systems ScienceFractal and Multifractal Time Series2009 • Jan KantelhardtDownload Free PDFView PDFTectonophysicsMeasuring multifractality in seismic sequences2006 • Luciano  TelescaDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysica A: Statistical  …Statistical physics and physiology: monofractal and multifractal approaches1999 • Souad OudjemiaDownload Free PDFView PDFMultifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and local scale exponents of inter spike intervalsEmmanuel ProcykABSTRACT The study presents the analysis of detrended fluctuations (DFA) in inter spike intervals (ISI) of neuronal ensemble from cortex of awake behaving macaque monkeys. The original DFA method was applied to analyze fluctuation of variances from fitted trends of different order. The spectrum of local scale exponent was calculated to investigate the presence of different scaling regions. It was observed that the single scaling exponent is insufficient to describe the firing pattern dynamics, the better fit is achieved using both short-term a1 and long-term α2 scaling coefficients. The validation procedure using phase randomized surrogates provided more reliable local scale exponents&amp;#39; estimates. Generalized DFA analysis revealed the presence of multifractality in ISI time series. Results indicate that multifractality is partly due to the broad probability distribution function and partly due to the presence of long-range correlations. Isodistributional surrogate data were used to test the significance of generalized Hurst exponent spectrum and origin of multifractal behavior. In conclusion, both DFA and its multifractal expansion reveal the presence of long-range correlation in ISI time series indicating the presence of memory in the neuronal firing pattern.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysica A-statistical Mechanics and Its ApplicationsMultifractal fluctuations in seismic interspike series2005 • Luciano  TelescaDownload Free PDFView PDFMultifractality due to long-range correlation in the L-band ionospheric scintillation S4 index time series2013 • Kamlesh  PathakDownload Free PDFView PDFMultifractal parameters as an indication of different physiological and pathological states of the human brain2014 • Shukla SamantaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
