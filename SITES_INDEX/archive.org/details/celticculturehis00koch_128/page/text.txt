If only one multi-volume set on Celtic culture were to be considered for a collection, whether it be a high school, college or public library holding, it should be the outstanding John T. Koch gathering CELTIC CULTURE: A HISTORICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA. Entries hold far more than a paragraph or two of detail: they come packed with page after page of annotated articles referencing and using primary sources and exploring everything from early Celtic literature to early settlements, early arts, and key figures. With its depth and detail, CELTIC CULTURE does more than define: it provided plenty of information suitable for reports plus the references which lend to easy further research for those producing more in-depth research reports. A powerful, recommended reference acquisition for any collection needing to fill the gaps in Celtic history.Issue: 0Includes bibliographical references (p. [1825]-2040) and indexv. 1. Aberdeen breviary-Celticism -- v. 2. Celtomania-Fulup, Marc'harid -- v. 3. G-L -- v. 4. M-S -- v. 5. T-Z
