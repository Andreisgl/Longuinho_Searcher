By societal standards, I had everything that encompasses that fabled dream: money, cars and planes, and a successful career as a businessman. And like Alessandro Tronco, all the material possessions couldn’t fill the void inside me and the despair I felt. Decisions and missteps we make along our journey don’t have to determine our destination. We have resources and new choices to make at every step. That is why I find The Buddha Who Drove a Bentley to be such a powerful book. I love the story of an overcomer. When someone digs deep, exhibits the courage to face and heal their past, and exercises personal or professional leadership, it ignites my soul. I consider Alessandro to be an expert on transforming lives. Forget theory. He’s lived it, and thankfully, he’s converted this wisdom into a beautiful fable. Get ready to grow even more and overcome challenges you never thought possible. —Gerard Armond Powell, author of Sh*t the Moon Said: A Story of Sex, Drugs and Ayahuasca, and founder of Rythmia Life Advancement Center, the #1 rated Specialty Lodging in the world Chapter One What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? —Luke 9:25 The sun hadn’t risen yet as ten-year-old Vincent maneuvered in the dark around the small apartment he lived in with his parents and two older sisters in Sicily. It was his duty as the only son to contribute to the household that struggled daily to make ends meet. He felt his way along the wall that had chips of paint missing—it hadn’t been painted since the apartment was new decades prior—until he reached the antiquated light switch for the kitchen. The light flickered several times before settling into its dim, steady glow. It would probably need replacing soon, but most things in his home did. His mother’s efforts to make their modest apartment a nurturing home didn’t go unnoticed by Vincent. No matter their financial struggles, she worked hard to provide her children with a safe and loving environment and did her best to give them everything they needed. His mother set an example of strength and courage that Vincent would try to live up to in the years to come. Although Vincent’s father worked hard to provide for his family, the lingering pain of the hardships and sadness from his upbringing stayed with him and often manifested in excessive drinking and outbursts of anger. The internal walls his father built up made it difficult for Vincent to connect with him. Despite all this, he loved his father deeply and never stopped trying to bridge the gap between them. He hoped he could make things right one day and heal their broken bond. Vincent’s older brother, Massimo, was rarely around. It seemed like he intentionally kept his distance from the family. However, Massimo was always available to listen when Vincent needed someone to talk to and let him hang out with him and his friends, which made Vincent feel special. And he always stepped in to defend and protect Vincent when he got picked on by kids at school. Vincent wondered if his brother was burdened with secrets. While this made it difficult for him to connect with Massimo, there was love between the two brothers. Amid the chaos of working and going to school, Vincent found his only source of joy in his two sisters, Marilena and Cristina. Despite his difficult circumstances, their beauty, intelligence, and vibrant personalities filled their home with life. He cherished every moment spent laughing and conversing with them, for it temporarily distracted him from his struggles. He found comfort in their company, and whenever his worries weighed him down, their laughter lifted him up. Together they would stay up late, dreaming of what life could be like if things were different. Although they had to remain in the apartment more often than not, Vincent was grateful for his time with them. Their love was strong and brought light to a time of darkness—darkness that went deeper than anyone knew. When Marilena and Cristina weren’t around, Vincent found solace in daydreaming about how he could one day live a better life. He was determined to escape the confines of poverty and become rich and famous. And this was another reason he was leaving the house hours before school would start. Although his family needed the extra money, Vincent could have easily done jobs other children his age would do. Instead, he headed out into the streets of his hometown with a battered suitcase in one hand—filled with homemade delicacies, herbs, cheese, olives, cured meats, fish, and bread—and his father’s pocket watch gripped tightly in the other. Too many times, Vincent had gotten into trouble for being late to school, which resulted in his father feeling even more disappointed in his son. While the watch was a reminder to get to school on time, it also felt connected to an invisible chain around Vincent’s neck, weighing him down with his father’s expectations to make something of himself. The young entrepreneur sold the items door-to-door throughout the city, traveling whatever distance necessary to make sales happen. Every day brought new challenges and new opportunities to learn. Vincent taught himself to barter effectively against experienced traders and deal with customers who did not value honesty or quality. He grew to understand how to maximize profits while still providing a fair price. These streets also taught him how to navigate crowded marketplaces without getting lost and avoid dangerous areas. What started as merely a way for Vincent to pay for food for his family eventually turned into something bigger—a business venture that could potentially provide greater stability and security for them in years to come. Still, this was no easy feat for such a young boy. Many people underestimated or thought ill of him because of his age, but he slowly won them over through hard work and dedication. Even those who initially refused to buy from him changed their tune after they saw what he could do. The older vendors started to look upon the young boy with admiration. They couldn’t believe how much determination this little kid had. He worked harder than most adults twice his age and never complained about anything despite having so few hours in the day; nothing stopped him from pursuing what he wanted most out of life. As Vincent grew older, his desire to achieve more pushed him to follow one of his favorite daydreams: going to America. At sixteen, he booked passage to New York, leaving behind his family, friends, and possessions. It was a difficult decision to make, but he knew there were greater opportunities in America, and he wanted to take advantage of them. As much as he feared the unknown and dreaded leaving everything familiar behind him, Vincent found hope in the thought that one day he would be able to provide a better life for himself and his loved ones, which moved him forward with optimism in his heart. As soon as Vincent set foot on Ellis Island, he looked around in awe and confusion. He had no money or friends, and he didn’t know any English. How would he survive, let alone thrive? His heart raced because this was his chance for a better life, and he refused to let fear or doubt stop him from achieving greatness, even though the odds seemed to be stacked against him. With a deep breath, he took a step, pushing forward as if driven by an unseen force. He may have faced many struggles throughout his journey from Italy to America, but these experiences only made him stronger. Despite the language barrier and cultural differences, he proceeded with courage in his heart. Vincent’s optimism shifted to despair, fear, and loneliness as he trudged through each day, struggling to make ends meet with no friends or family around to support him. No matter how hard he worked, his mountain seemed insurmountable to climb. Unwilling to give up, his strength and resilience never wavered—he took each day as it came and prayed that his troubles eventually would be alleviated. He was a fighter, after all, and had been for as long as he could remember. Often, Vincent recalled the hard work he put in at home as a salesman. This memory helped him press on, one step at a time, never giving up despite all odds. He knew better days were ahead if he could just stay the course. With his head high and faith in his heart, he continued to fight for a better life—one filled with hope and joy. He seized every opportunity presented to him so that he could finally turn his dreams into reality. Vincent continued to search for jobs, no matter how arduous or thankless they may have been. And there were times when he felt embarrassed for what he Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksInspirationalFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
