But health experts say those who want to protect themselves from the coronavirus as cases rise again should continue to cover their faces — with the best possible mask.Travel better with news, tips and guides that make you feel like a local wherever you go. In your inbox, Thursdays.ArrowRight“You can quote me on this: I’m going to continue to wear an N95 mask,” said David Freedman, professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “No question. You have no idea who’s on a plane.”He added: “I think everyone should.”Have questions about wearing a mask while traveling? Ask The Post.Freedman and other experts stressed the importance of the coronavirus vaccine and boosters now that travelers will find themselves traveling amid unmasked crowds.A federal judge struck down the federal transportation mask mandate on April 18, but that doesn't mean masking doesn't still offer protection. (Video: John Farrell, Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)According to Washington Post data, new daily cases over the past week are on the rise while hospitalizations and deaths decline. Before the judge’s ruling, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended the mandate’s expiration date to May 3 to monitor the new wave. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said it will appeal the ruling.Advertisement“It’s not an ideal time right now,” said infectious-disease expert John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley’s School of Public Health.Do I still need to wear a mask on a plane? 5 questions, answered.He said that while early indications are that the current wave will be fairly mild, the new omicron subvariant, BA.2, is “extremely transmissible.”Swartzberg said he expected the mandate to be lifted on May 3, and he found the judge’s decision to lift it earlier “problematic.” He said he is not worried about his own flight next month because he is up to date on his vaccinations, plans to wear a well-fitting N95 the entire time and understands that treatment is available if he does get sick.“Wearing my hat as a physician and public health professor, I’m more chagrined that we’re putting people at risk while it’s unnecessary to do that,” he said.AdvertisementRobert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, said he was shocked by the judge’s decision, though he supported the mandate being dropped in May if a major surge did not materialize.Share this articleShare“I think the threshold for a mandate has to be fairly high, and I think the situation changed enough, so it was reasonable to at least consider removing the mandate,” he said. “To have it be done by a judge rather than public health authorities just strikes me as wrong and a very dangerous precedent.”Wachter said he believes people should wear masks on airplanes and on public transit, even if they’re not compelled by the government to do so. He said recent flights that he has taken have included maskless people who lingered over food and drinks for hours.We may not have to wear masks on planes forever. But should we?“My attitude is that the planes, as of tonight, are somewhat less safe than they were, but still relatively safe because of the level of ventilation,” Wachter said Monday.AdvertisementAccording to the International Air Transport Association, cabin air is refreshed 20 to 30 times an hour, with the air being half-fresh and half-filtered.Freedman, president-elect of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, said the airflow is most effective when the engines are fully running. But passengers are less protected while in the airport, boarding and sitting on the plane before takeoff, he said. He is in favor of mandatory masking “curb-to-curb” except when passengers are sitting on the airplane with the wheels up.For those who aren’t willing to wear a mask during an entire flight, he said: “At least wear it during the critical periods, which means before and after you’re in the air.”Why cloth masks are on some airlines’ no-fly listsLeonard Marcus, director of the Aviation Public Health Initiative at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said masks can lower the risks of transmitting disease by roughly 50 percent. A report by the initiative highlights the importance of multiple layers, including ventilation, social distancing and masks.Advertisement“On an airplane, we’re in very, very close proximity to one another,” he said. “So therefore, continuing to wear masks is something I’m going to do and I would recommend others to do, especially if they want to avoid getting the disease.”Freedman said adults who are immunocompromised should strongly consider getting a fourth dose of a vaccine when eligible and should be sure to wear a mask.Kids under five years old, who are too young to be vaccinated, should also mask to protect themselves, he said. But the CDC does not recommend kids who are younger than 2 to wear masks.“It really is the zero-to-2-year-olds that are in the toughest spot,” Wachter said. “Until there are vaccines, if I had a little baby, I would not fly.”More travel newsSafety: Bird strikes | No-fly list proposal | Could you land a plane? | Whale vs. sailboat | Turbulence risks | Future of TSA |  Mask advice |  Traveling while transAirlines: Medical emergencies | Bunk beds | Flight padding | Clean-up duty | Carbon offsets | Lap babies | Flying is terrible | Private jet pets | Ribs on a plane | Modern airplane food | Family seating |  Middle seat fans | Phone calls on flights | Airport glow-up |  First class seats | Confronting unruly passengers |  It’s physically impossible to open a plane door | Wheelchair damageDestinations: Bad tourists in Bali | Paris’ best baguette | Starbucks in Rome | New York dogs | Hawaii GPS mishap | Greece’s accessible beaches | Could Disney move? | Florida travel warning | Amsterdam says ‘stay away’ | Orlando hater’s guide |  Real-life White Lotus | Misbehavior at national parks |  Scariest places |   Disney pricesAirbnb: Is there an ‘Airbnbust?' | CEO is hosting | Fees and chores | ‘Slave cabin’ apology | No more parties |  Accidental break-in | Pet-friendly additionsOn the road: Weed tourism | Weird resort fees | Wienermobile life | A day at a truck stop | Tracing the Great Migration |  Hotel room lights | Greyhound road trip | Green hotels | How environmentalists travel | Road trips with pets | Road trips with babiesShare CommentsLoading...View moreTOP STORIESTravelLocal guides, travel tips and the latest industry newsPerspective|Pickle pizza and cookie buckets: Minnesota State Fair food, rankedAt agriculture Disneyland, butter princesses reign supreme What New York City’s new Airbnb rules mean for travelersRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesCompanyAbout The Post Newsroom Policies & Standards Diversity and Inclusion Careers Media & Community Relations WP Creative Group Accessibility Statement Get The PostGift Subscriptions Mobile & Apps Newsletters & Alerts Washington Post Live Reprints & Permissions Post Store Books & E-Books Newspaper in Education Print Archives (Subscribers Only) Today’s Paper Public Notices Coupons Contact UsContact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Contact the Opinions team Advertise Licensing & Syndication Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Terms of UseDigital Products Terms of Sale Print Products Terms of Sale Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices washingtonpost.com  © 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2023 The Washington PostAbout The Post Contact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Download the Washington Post App Policies & Standards Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Print Products Terms of Sale Digital Products Terms of Sale Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices Coupons
