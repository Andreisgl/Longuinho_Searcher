Key features
                      Key features
                        Simplified developer experience and increased developer
                        velocity
Cloud Functions has a simple and intuitive developer
                          experience. Just write your code and let Google Cloud
                          handle the operational infrastructure. Develop faster
                          by writing and running small code snippets that
                          respond to events. Streamline challenging
                          orchestration problems by connecting Google Cloud
                          products to one another or third party services using
                          events.
                        Pay only for what you use
You are only billed for your function’s execution
                          time, metered to the nearest 100 milliseconds. You pay
                          nothing when your function is idle. Cloud Functions
                          automatically spins up and backs down in response to
                          events.
                        Avoid lock-in with open technology
Use open source FaaS (function as a service)
                          framework to run functions across multiple
                          environments and prevent lock-in. Supported
                          environments include Cloud Functions, local
                          development environment, on-premises,
                          Cloud Run,
                          and other Knative-based serverless environments.

Integration
                    with third-party services and APIs
Use Cloud Functions to surface your own microservices via
                    HTTP APIs or integrate with third-party services that offer
                    webhook integrations to quickly extend your application with
                    powerful capabilities such as sending a confirmation email
                    after a successful Stripe payment or responding to Twilio
                    text message events.
 Use case 
                    Serverless mobile back ends
Use Cloud Functions directly from Firebase to extend your
                    application functionality without spinning up a server. Run
                    your code in response to user actions, analytics, and
                    authentication events to keep your users engaged with
                    event-based notifications and offload CPU- and
                    networking-intensive tasks to Google Cloud.
 Use case 
                    Serverless IoT back ends
Use Cloud Functions with
                    Cloud IoT Core
                    and other fully managed services to build back ends for
                    Internet of Things (IoT) device telemetry data collection,
                    real-time processing, and analysis. Cloud Functions allows
                    you to apply custom logic to each event as it arrives.
 Use case 
                    Real-time file processing
Execute your code in response to changes in data. Cloud
                    Functions can respond to events from Google Cloud services
                    such as
                    Cloud Storage,
                    Pub/Sub,
                    and
                    Cloud Firestore
                    to process files immediately after upload and generate
                    thumbnails from image uploads, process logs, validate
                    content, transcode videos, validate, aggregate, and filter
                    data in real time.
 Use case 
                    Real-time stream processing
Use Cloud Functions to respond to events from
                    Pub/Sub
                    to process, transform, and enrich streaming data in
                    transaction processing, click-stream analysis, application
                    activity tracking, IoT device telemetry, social media
                    analysis, and other types of applications.
 Use case 
                    Virtual assistants and conversational experiences

                            Connects and extends services to build complex
                            applications 
Cloud Functions lets
                            you treat all Google and third-party cloud services
                            as building blocks. Connect and extend them with
                            code, and rapidly move from concept to production
                            with end-to-end solutions and complex workflows.
                            Further, integrate with third-party services that
                            offer webhook integrations to quickly extend your
                            application with powerful capabilities.
                            End-to-end development and diagnosability 
Go from code to
                            deploy, with integrated monitoring. Get full
                            observability and diagnosability for your
                            application with
                            Cloud Trace.
                            Additionally, get support for local and disconnected
                            development/debugging using open sourced functions
                            framework.
                            Develop locally, scale globally 
Serve users from zero
                            to planet-scale without even thinking about any
                            infrastructure. Cloud Functions automatically
                            manages and scales underlying infrastructure with
                            the size of workload.
                            No server management 
Deploy your code and
                            let Google run and scale it for you. Cloud Functions
                            abstracts away all the underlying infrastructure, so
                            that you can focus on your code and build
                            applications faster than ever before.
                            Runs code in response to events 
Cloud Functions allows
                            you to trigger your code from Google Cloud,
                            Firebase, and
                            Google Assistant,
                            or call it directly from any web, mobile, or backend
                            application via HTTP.
                            Pay only for what you use 
You are only billed
                            for your function’s execution time, metered to the
                            nearest 100 milliseconds. You pay nothing when your
                            function is idle. Cloud Functions automatically
                            spins up and backs down in response to
                            events.
                            Avoid lock-in with open technology 
Use open source FaaS
                            (function as a service) framework to run functions
                            across multiple environments and prevent lock-in.
                            Supported environments include Cloud Functions,
                            local development environment, on-premises,
                            Cloud Run,
                            Cloud Run for Anthos,
                            and other Knative-based serverless
                            environments.
Pricing
 Pricing 
Cloud Functions is priced according to how long your
                    function runs, how many times it's invoked, and how many
                    resources you provision for the function.
