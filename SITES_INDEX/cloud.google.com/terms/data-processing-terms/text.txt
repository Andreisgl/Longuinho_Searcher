4.1 Roles of Parties. Google is a processor
                      and Customer is a controller or processor, as applicable,
                      of Customer Personal Data.
4.2 Processing Summary. The subject matter and
                      details of the processing of Customer Personal Data are
                      described in Appendix 1 (Subject Matter and Details of the
                      Processing). 
4.3 Compliance with Law. Each party will comply
                      with its obligations related to the processing of Customer
                      Personal Data under Applicable Privacy Law.
4.4 Additional Legal Terms. To the extent the
                      processing of Customer Personal Data is subject to an
                      Applicable Privacy Law described in Appendix 3 (Specific
                      Privacy Laws), the corresponding terms in Appendix 3 will
                      apply in addition to these General Terms and prevail as
                      described in Section 14.1 (Precedence).
                    5. Data Processing
5.1 Processor Customers. If Customer is a
                      processor:
a. Customer warrants on an
                      ongoing basis that the relevant controller has authorized:
                    
i. the Instructions;
ii. Customer’s engagement of
                      Google as another processor; and.
iii. Google’s engagement of
                      Subprocessors as described in Section 11 (Subprocessors);
                    
b. Customer will forward to
                      the relevant controller promptly and without undue delay
                      any notice provided by Google under Section 7.2.1
                      (Incident Notification), 9.2.1 (Responsibility for

                      Subprocessors); and
c. Customer may make
                      available to the relevant controller any other information
                      made available by Google under this Addendum about the
                      locations of Google data centers or the names, locations
                      and activities of Subprocessors.
5.2 Compliance with Customer’s Instructions.
                      Customer instructs Google to process Customer Data in
                      accordance with the applicable Agreement (including this
                      Addendum) and applicable law only as follows: 
a. to provide, secure, and
                      monitor the Services and TSS; and
b. as further specified via:
                    
i. Customer’s use of the
                      Services (including via the Admin Console) and TSS; and
                    
ii. any other written
                      instructions given by Customer and acknowledged by Google
                      as constituting instructions under this Addendum
                      (collectively, the “Instructions”).
Google will comply with the Instructions unless
                      prohibited by European Law, where European Data Protection
                      Law applies, or prohibited by applicable law, where any
                      other Applicable Privacy Law applies.
                    6. Data Deletion
6.1 Deletion by Customer. Google will enable
                      Customer to delete Customer Data during the Term in a
                      manner consistent with the functionality of the Services.
                      If Customer uses the Services to delete any Customer Data
                      during the Term and that Customer Data cannot be recovered
                      by Customer, this use will constitute an Instruction to
                      Google to delete the relevant Customer Data from Google’s
                      systems in accordance with applicable law. Google will
                      comply with this Instruction as soon as reasonably
                      practicable and within a maximum period of 180 days,
                      unless European Law requires storage, where European Data
                      Protection Law applies, or applicable law requires
                      storage, where any other Applicable Privacy Law applies.
                    
6.2 Return or Deletion When Term Ends. If Customer
                      wishes to retain any Customer Data after the end of the
                      Term, it may instruct Google in accordance with Section
                      9.1 (Access; Rectification; Restricted Processing;
                      Portability) to return that data during the Term. Subject
                      to Section 6.3 (Deferred Deletion Instruction), Customer
                      instructs Google to delete all remaining Customer Data
                      (including existing copies) from Google’s systems at the
                      end of the Term in accordance with applicable law. After a
                      recovery period of up to 30 days from that date, Google
                      will comply with this Instruction as soon as reasonably
                      practicable and within a maximum period of 180 days,
                      unless European Law requires storage, where European Data
                      Protection Law applies, or applicable law requires
                      storage, where any other Applicable Privacy Law applies.
                    
6.3. Deferred Deletion Instruction. To the extent
                      any Customer Data covered by the deletion instruction
                      described in Section 6.2 (Return or Deletion When Term
                      Ends) is also processed, when the applicable Term under
                      Section 6.2 expires, in relation to an Agreement with a
                      continuing Term, such deletion instruction will take
                      effect with respect to such Customer Data only when the
                      continuing Term expires. For clarity, this Addendum will
                      continue to apply to such Customer Data until its deletion
                      by Google.
                    7. Data Security
7.1
                      Google’s Security Measures, Controls and Assistance.
                    
7.1.1 Google’s Security Measures. Google will
                      implement and maintain technical, organizational, and
                      physical measures to protect Customer Data against
                      accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
                      unauthorized disclosure or access as described in Appendix
                      2 (Security Measures) (the
                        “Security Measures”). The Security Measures
                      include measures to encrypt Customer Data; to help ensure
                      ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and
                      resilience of Google’s systems and services; to help
                      restore timely access to Customer Data following an
                      incident; and for regular testing of effectiveness. Google
                      may update the Security Measures from time to time
                      provided that such updates do not result in a material
                      reduction of the security of the Services.
7.1.2 Access and Compliance. Google will:
a. authorize its employees,
                      contractors and Subprocessors to access Customer Data only
                      as strictly necessary to comply with Instructions;
b. take appropriate steps to
                      ensure compliance with the Security Measures by its
                      employees, contractors and Subprocessors to the extent
                      applicable to their scope of performance; and
c. ensure that all persons
                      authorized to process Customer Data are under an
                      obligation of confidentiality.
7.1.3 Additional Security Controls. Google will
                      make Additional Security Controls available to:
a. allow Customer to take
                      steps to secure Customer Data; and
b. provide Customer with
                      information about securing, accessing and using Customer
                      Data.
7.1.4 Google’s Security Assistance. Google will
                      (taking into account the nature of the processing of
                      Customer Personal Data and the information available to
                      Google) assist Customer in ensuring compliance with its
                      (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant
                      controller’s) obligations relating to security and
                      personal data breaches under Applicable Privacy Law, by:
                    
a. implementing and
                      maintaining the Security Measures in accordance with
                      Section 7.1.1 (Google’s Security Measures);
b. making Additional Security
                      Controls available in accordance with Section 7.1.3
                      (Additional Security Controls);
c. complying with the terms
                      of Section 7.2 (Data Incidents);
d. making the Security
                      Documentation available in accordance with Section 7.5.1
                      (Reviews of Security Documentation) and providing the
                      information contained in the applicable Agreement
                      (including this Addendum); and
e. if subsections (a)-(d)
                      above are insufficient for Customer (or the relevant
                      controller) to comply with such obligations, upon
                      Customer’s request, providing Customer with additional
                      reasonable cooperation and assistance.
7.2 Data Incidents.
7.2.1 Incident Notification. Google will notify
                      Customer promptly and without undue delay after becoming
                      aware of a Data Incident, and promptly take reasonable
                      steps to minimize harm and secure Customer Data.
7.2.2 Details of Data Incident. Google’s
                      notification of a Data Incident will describe: the nature
                      of the Data Incident including the Customer resources
                      impacted; the measures Google has taken, or plans to take,
                      to address the Data Incident and mitigate its potential
                      risk; the measures, if any, Google recommends that
                      Customer take to address the Data Incident; and details of
                      a contact point where more information can be obtained. If
                      it is not possible to provide all such information at the
                      same time, Google’s initial notification will contain the
                      information then available and further information will be
                      provided without undue delay as it becomes available.
7.2.3 No Assessment of Customer Data by Google.
                      Google has no obligation to assess Customer Data in order
                      to identify information subject to any specific legal
                      requirements.
7.2.4 No Acknowledgement of Fault by Google.
                      Google’s notification of or response to a Data Incident
                      under this Section 7.2 (Data Incidents) will not be
                      construed as an acknowledgement by Google of any fault or
                      liability with respect to the Data Incident.
                      7.3 Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
                    
7.3.1 Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
                      Without prejudice to Google’s obligations under Sections
                      7.1 (Google’s Security Measures, Controls and Assistance)
                      and 7.2 (Data Incidents), and elsewhere in the applicable
                      Agreement, Customer is responsible for its use of the
                      Services and its storage of any copies of Customer Data
                      outside Google’s or Google’s Subprocessors’ systems,
                      including:
a. using the Services and
                      Additional Security Controls to ensure a level of security
                      appropriate to the risk to the Customer Data;
b. securing the account
                      authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer
                      uses to access the Services; and
c. backing up or retaining
                      copies of its Customer Data as appropriate.
7.3.2 Customer’s Security Assessment. Customer
                      agrees that the Services, Security Measures, Additional
                      Security Controls, and Google’s commitments under this
                      Section 7 (Data Security) provide a level of security
                      appropriate to the risk to Customer Data (taking into
                      account the state of the art, the costs of implementation
                      and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
                      processing of Customer Data as well as the risks to
                      individuals).
7.4 Compliance Certifications and SOC Reports.
                      Google will maintain at least the following for the
                      Audited Services to verify the continued effectiveness of
                      the Security Measures:
a. certificates for ISO 27001
                      and any additional certifications described in Appendix 4
                      (Specific Products) (the
                      “Compliance Certifications”); and
b. SOC 2 and SOC 3 reports
                      produced by Google’s Third-Party Auditor and updated
                      annually based on an audit performed at least once every
                      12 months (the “SOC Reports”).
Google may add standards at any time. Google may replace
                      a Compliance Certification or SOC Report with an
                      equivalent or enhanced alternative.
7.5 Reviews and Audits of Compliance.
7.5.1 Reviews of Security Documentation. To
                      demonstrate compliance by Google with its obligations
                      under this Addendum, Google will make the Security
                      Documentation available for review by Customer and, if
                      Customer is a processor, allow Customer to request access
                      to the SOC Reports for the relevant controller in
                      accordance with Section 7.5.3 (Additional Business Terms
                      for Reviews and Audits).
7.5.2 Customer’s Audit Rights.
a.
                      Customer Audit. Google will, if required
                      under Applicable Privacy Law, allow Customer or an
                      independent auditor appointed by Customer to conduct
                      audits (including inspections) to verify Google’s
                      compliance with its obligations under this Addendum in
                      accordance with Section 7.5.3 (Additional Business Terms
                      for Reviews and Audits). During an audit, Google will
                      reasonably cooperate with Customer or its auditor as
                      described in this Section 7.5 (Reviews and Audits of
                      Compliance).

                      7.5.2(a) (Customer Audit).
b. Following a Customer
                      request under Section 7.5.3(a), Google and Customer will
                      discuss and agree in advance on: 
i. security and
                      confidentiality controls applicable to any access to the
                      SOC Reports by a relevant controller under Section 7.5.1
                      (Reviews of Security Documentation); and

                      date, scope and duration of and security and
                      confidentiality controls applicable to any audit under
                      Section 7.5.2(a) (Customer Audit).
c. Google may charge a fee
                      (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit under
                      Section 7.5.2(a) (Customer Audit). Google will provide
                      Customer with further details of any applicable fee, and
                      the basis of its calculation, in advance of any such
                      audit. Customer will be responsible for any fees charged
                      by any auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such
                      audit.
d. Google may object in
                      writing to an auditor appointed by Customer to conduct any
                      audit under Section 7.5.2(a) (Customer Audit) if the
                      auditor is, in Google’s reasonable opinion, not suitably
                      qualified or independent, a competitor of Google, or
                      otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by
                      Google will require Customer to appoint another auditor or
                      conduct the audit itself.
e. Any Customer requests

                    Appendix 2: Security Measures
As from the Addendum Effective Date, Google will
                      implement and maintain the Security Measures described in
                      this Appendix 2.
1. Data Center and Network Security
(a) Data Centers.
Infrastructure. Google maintains geographically
                      distributed data centers. Google stores all production
                      data in physically secure data centers.
Redundancy. Infrastructure systems have been
                      designed to eliminate single points of failure and
                      minimize the impact of anticipated environmental risks.
                      Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary
                      devices help provide this redundancy. The Services are
                      designed to allow Google to perform certain types of
                      preventative and corrective maintenance without
                      interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities
                      have documented preventative maintenance procedures that
                      detail the process for and frequency of performance in
                      accordance with the manufacturer’s or internal
                      specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of
                      the data center equipment is scheduled through a standard
                      change process according to documented procedures.
Power. The data center electrical power systems
                      are designed to be redundant and maintainable without
                      impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
                      week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate
                      power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for
                      critical infrastructure components in the data center.
                      Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as
                      uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) batteries, which
                      supply consistently reliable power protection during
                      utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage,
                      and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility
                      power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide
                      transitory power to the data center, at full capacity, for
                      up to 10 minutes until the backup generator systems take
                      over. The backup generators are capable of automatically
                      starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency
                      electrical power to run the data center at full capacity
                      typically for a period of days.
Server Operating Systems. Google servers use a
                      Linux based implementation customized for the application
                      environment. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms
                      to augment data security and redundancy.
Code Quality. Google employs a code review process
                      to increase the security of the code used to provide the
                      Services and enhance the security products in production
                      environments.
Businesses Continuity. Google has designed and
                      regularly plans and tests its business continuity
                      planning/disaster recovery programs.
(b) Networks and Transmission.
Data Transmission. Data centers are typically
                      connected via high-speed private links to provide secure
                      and fast data transfer between data centers. This is
                      designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered
                      or removed without authorization during electronic
                      transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data
                      storage media. Google transfers data via Internet standard
                      protocols.
External Attack Surface. Google employs multiple
                      layers of network devices and intrusion detection to
                      protect its external attack surface. Google considers
                      potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate
                      purpose built technologies into external facing systems.
                    
Intrusion Detection. Intrusion detection is
                      intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities
                      and provide adequate information to respond to incidents.
                      Google’s intrusion detection involves: (i) tightly
                      controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack
                      surface through preventative measures; (ii) employing
                      intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and
                      (iii) employing technologies that automatically remedy
                      certain dangerous situations.
Incident Response. Google monitors a variety of
                      communication channels for security incidents, and
                      Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known
                      incidents.
Encryption Technologies. Google makes HTTPS
                      encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS connection)
                      available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve
                      Diffie-Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA
                      and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods
                      help protect traffic and minimize the impact of a
                      compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.
2. Access and Site Controls
(a) Site Controls.
On-site Data Center Security Operation. Google’s
                      data centers maintain an on-site security operation
                      responsible for all physical data center security
                      functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site
                      security operation personnel monitor closed circuit TV
                      (CCTV) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security
                      operation personnel perform internal and external patrols
                      of the data center regularly.
Data Center Access Procedures. Google maintains
                      formal access procedures for allowing physical access to
                      the data centers. The data centers are housed in
                      facilities that require electronic card key access, with
                      alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation.
                      All entrants to the data center are required to identify
                      themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site
                      security operations. Only authorized employees,
                      contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data
                      centers. Only authorized employees and contractors are
                      permitted to request electronic card key access to these
                      facilities. Data center electronic card key access
                      requests must be made through e-mail, and require the
                      approval of the requestor’s manager and the data center
                      director. All other entrants requiring temporary data
                      center access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from
                      the data center managers for the specific data center and
                      internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site
                      security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data
                      center access record identifying the individual as
                      approved.
On-site Data Center Security Devices. Google’s
                      data centers employ a dual authentication access control
                      system that is linked to a system alarm. The access
                      control system monitors and records each individual’s
                      electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors,
                      shipping and receiving, and other critical areas.
                      Unauthorized activity and failed access attempts are
                      logged by the access control system and investigated, as
                      appropriate. Authorized access throughout the business
                      operations and data centers is restricted based on zones
                      and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors
                      at the data centers are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in
                      operation both inside and outside the data centers. The
                      positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover
                      strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter,
                      doors to the data center building, and shipping/receiving.
                      On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV
                      monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables
                      throughout the data centers connect the CCTV equipment.
                      Cameras record on site via digital video recorders 24
                      hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are
                      retained for up to 30 days based on activity.
(b) Access Control.
Infrastructure Security Personnel. Google has, and
                      maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and
                      requires security training as part of the training package
                      for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security
                      personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of
                      Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the
                      Services, and responding to security incidents.
Access Control and Privilege Management.
                      Customer’s Administrators and End Users must authenticate
                      themselves via a central authentication system or via a
                      single sign on system in order to use the Services.
Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy.
                      Google’s internal data access processes and policies are
                      designed to prevent unauthorized persons and systems from
                      gaining access to systems used to process Customer Data.
                      Google designs its systems to (i) only allow authorized
                      persons to access data they are authorized to access; and
                      (ii) ensure that Customer Data cannot be read, copied,
                      altered or removed without authorization during
                      processing, use and after recording. The systems are
                      designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google
                      employs a centralized access management system to control
                      personnel access to production servers, and only provides
                      access to a limited number of authorized personnel.
                      Google’s authentication and authorization systems utilize
                      SSH certificates and security keys, and are designed to
                      provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms.
                      These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved
                      access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration
                      information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs,
                      strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully
                      monitored access lists to minimize the potential for
                      unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of
                      access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job
                      responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to
                      perform authorized tasks; and a need to know basis. The
                      granting or modification of access rights must also be in
                      accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and
                      training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that
                      maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems
                      is logged to create an audit trail for accountability.
                      Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g.
                      login to workstations), password policies that follow at
                      least industry standard practices are implemented. These
                      standards include restrictions on password reuse and
                      sufficient password strength. For access to extremely
                      sensitive information (e.g. credit card data), Google uses
                      hardware tokens.
3. Data
(a) Data Storage, Isolation and Logging. Google
                      stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned
                      servers. Subject to any Instructions to the contrary (e.g.
                      in the form of a data location selection), Google
                      replicates Customer Data between multiple geographically
                      dispersed data centers. Google also logically isolates
                      Customer Data. Customer will be given control over
                      specific data sharing policies. Those policies, in
                      accordance with the functionality of the Services, will
                      enable Customer to determine the product sharing settings
                      applicable to its End Users for specific purposes.
                      Customer may choose to use logging functionality that
                      Google makes available via the Services.
                      (b) Decommissioned Disks and Disk Erase Policy.
                      Disks containing data may experience performance issues,
                      errors or hardware failure that lead them to be
                      decommissioned (“Decommissioned Disk”). Every
                      Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data
                      destruction processes (the “Disk Erase Policy”) before
                      leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction.
                      Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process
                      and verified complete by at least two independent
                      validators. The erase results are logged by the
                      Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally,
                      the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory
                      for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure,
                      the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely
                      stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited
                      regularly to monitor compliance with the Disk Erase
                      Policy.
4. Personnel Security
Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a
                      manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding
                      confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and
                      professional standards. Google conducts reasonably
                      appropriate background checks to the extent legally
                      permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor
                      law and statutory regulations.
Google personnel are required to execute a
                      confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of,
                      and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy
                      policies. Personnel are provided with security training.
                      Personnel handling Customer Data are required to complete
                      additional requirements appropriate to their role (e.g.
                      certifications). Google’s personnel will not process
                      Customer Data without authorization.
5. Subprocessor Security
Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit
                      of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to
                      ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and
                      privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope
                      of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google
                      has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor, then
                      subject to the requirements described in Section 11.3
                      (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement), the
                      Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate
                      security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.
                    Appendix 3: Specific Privacy Laws
The terms in each subsection of this Appendix 3 apply
                      only where the corresponding law applies to the processing
                      of Customer Personal Data.

2.
Instruction Notifications. Without prejudice to
                      Google’s obligations under Section 5.2 (Compliance with
                      Customer’s Instructions) or any other rights or
                      obligations of either party under the applicable
                      Agreement, Google will immediately notify Customer if, in
                      Google’s opinion:
a. European Law prohibits
                      Google from complying with an Instruction;
b. an Instruction does not
                      comply with European Data Protection Law; or
c. Google is otherwise unable
                      to comply with an Instruction, in each case unless such
                      notice is prohibited by European Law. If Customer is a
                      processor,
Customer will immediately forward to the relevant
                      controller any notice provided by Google under this
                      section.
3. Customer’s Audit Rights. Google will allow

                      section.
4. Data Transfers.
4.1 Restricted Transfers. The parties acknowledge
                      that European Data Protection Law does not require SCCs or
                      an Alternative Transfer Solution in order for Customer
                      Personal Data to be processed in or transferred to an
                      Adequate Country. If Customer Personal Data is transferred
                      to any other country and European Data Protection Law
                      applies to the transfers (as certified by Customer under
                      Section 4.2 (Certification by Non-EMEA Customers) of these
                      European Data Protection Law terms, if its billing address
                      is outside EMEA) (“Restricted Transfers”), then:
                    
a. if Google has adopted an
                      Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted
                      Transfers, Google will inform Customer of the relevant
                      solution and ensure that such Restricted Transfers are
                      made in accordance with it; or
b. if Google has not adopted,
                      or informs Customer that Google is no longer adopting, an
                      Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted
                      Transfers:
i. if Google’s address is in
                      an Adequate Country:
A. the SCCs
                      (Processor-to-Processor, Google Exporter) will apply with
                      respect to such Restricted Transfers from Google to
                      Subprocessors; and
B. in addition, if
                      Customer’s billing address is not in an Adequate Country,
                      the SCCs (Processor-to Controller) will apply (regardless
                      of whether Customer is a controller or processor) with
                      respect to such Restricted Transfers between Google and
                      Customer; or

                      between Google and Customer.
4.2 Certification by Non-EMEA Customers. If
                      Customer’s billing address is outside EMEA, and the
                      processing of Customer Personal Data is subject to
                      European Data Protection Law, then unless Appendix 4
                      (Specific Products) of this Addendum indicates otherwise,
                      Customer will certify as such and identify its competent

4.4 SCC Audits. If Customer SCCs apply as
                      described in Section 4.1 (Restricted Transfers) of these
                      European Data Protection Law terms, Google will allow
                      Customer (or an independent auditor appointed by Customer)
                      to conduct audits as described in those SCCs and, during
                      an audit, make available all information required by those
                      SCCs, both in accordance with Section 7.5.3 (Additional
                      Business Terms for Reviews and Audits).

                      Customer concludes, based on its current or intended use
                      of the Services, that appropriate safeguards are not
                      provided for transferred Customer Personal Data, then
                      Customer may immediately terminate the applicable
                      Agreement in accordance with that Agreement's termination
                      for convenience provision or, if there is no such

                      Protection Law.
4.8 Precedence of SCCs. To the extent of any
                      conflict or inconsistency between any Customer SCCs (which
                      are incorporated by reference into this Addendum) and the
                      remainder of the Agreement (including this Addendum), the

                      Linux based implementation customized for the application
                      environment. Google employs a code review process to
                      increase the security of the code used to provide GDCE and
                      enhance the security products in GDCE production
                      environments.
Encryption Technologies. Google makes HTTPS
                      encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS connection)
                      available and allows for encryption of data in transit.
                      Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve
                      Diffie-Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA
                      and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods
                      help protect traffic and minimize the impact of a
                      compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough. Google
                      also makes encryption of data at rest available, using at
                      least AES128 or similar. GDCE has a CMEK integration; more
                      information can be found at
                      https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/cmek.
                    
Connection to Cloud VPN. Google allows Customer to
                      enable and configure a strong, encrypted interconnection
                      between the Equipment and Customer's Virtual Private Cloud
                      using Cloud VPN through an IPSEC VPN connection.
Bound Storage.
                      Customer's data storage is bound to the server. Should a
                      disk be stolen or copied at rest, the contents of such
                      disk will be unrecoverable outside of the server.
Sections 2 (Access and Site Controls) and 3 (Data) of
                        Appendix 2 (Security Measures) are deleted.
2. Inapplicable Provisions. Any Google obligations
                      in the Agreement (including this Addendum) or statements
                      in associated security documentation (including
                      whitepapers) that depend on Google’s operation of a Google
                      data center do not apply to GDCE.
Google-Managed Multi-Cloud (Google Cloud Platform)
Google-Managed Multi-Cloud Services involve third-party
                      infrastructure and, by design, and have certain distinct
                      characteristics.

                      Google-Managed MCS Data Processing Amendment supplements
                      and amends this Addendum with respect to Google-Managed
                      Multi-Cloud Services for Google Cloud
                      Platform.  
Google Cloud VMware Engine (Google Cloud Platform)
Google may not have access to Customer's VMware
                      environment or be able to encrypt personal data in
                      Customer's VMware environment. 
NetApp Volumes (Google Cloud Platform)
1. Amendments. This Addendum is amended as follows
                      with respect to NetApp Volumes:
The definition of "Google's Third-Party Auditor" is
                        replaced with the following: 
"Google's Third Party Auditor” means a
                            qualified and independent third party auditor
                            appointed by Google or a NetApp Volumes
                            Subprocessor, whose then-current identity Google
                            will disclose to Customer on request.
Section 3(a) (Data Storage, Isolation and Logging) of
                        Appendix 2 (Security Measures) is replaced with the
                        following: 
(a) Data Storage, Isolation and Logging.
                            Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on
                            servers owned by NetApp, Inc. Subject to any
                            Instructions to the contrary (e.g. in the form of a
                            data location selection), Google replicates Customer
                            Data between multiple geographically dispersed data
                            centers. Google also logically isolates Customer
                            Data. Customer will be given control over specific
                            data sharing policies. Those policies, in accordance
                            with the functionality of the Services, will enable
                            Customer to determine the product sharing settings
                            applicable to its End Users for specific purposes.
                            Customer may choose to use logging functionality
                            that Google makes available via the Services.
2. Compliance Certifications and SOC Reports.
                      Google or its Subprocessor will obtain at least the
                      following (or an equivalent or enhanced alternative) for
                      NetApp Volumes:
a. a certificate for ISO
                      27001 and a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (the
                      "NetApp Compliance Certifications"); and
b. SOC 1 and SOC 2 Reports
                      updated annually based on an audit performed at least once
                      every 12 months (the "NetApp SOC Reports").
3. Reviews of Security Documentation. To
                      demonstrate compliance by Google with its obligations
                      under this Addendum, Google will make any NetApp
                      Compliance Certifications and NetApp SOC Reports available
                      for review by Customer and, if Customer is a processor,
                      allow Customer to request access for the relevant
                      controller to the NetApp SOC Reports in accordance with
                      Section 7.5.3 (Additional Business Terms for Reviews and

                      https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/dpo. 
                    
11. Google’s Processing Records.  To the
                      extent any Applicable Privacy Law requires Google to
                      collect and maintain records of certain information
                      relating to Customer, Customer will supply such
                      information to Google upon request, and notify Google of
                      any updates required to keep such information accurate and
                      up-to-date, unless Google requests that Customer supply
                      and update such information via another means.
12. Additional Application Security Measures. Google
                      will implement and maintain the additional Security
                      Measures described below for Looker (original):
a. Google follows at least
                      industry standard practices for security architecture.
                      Proxy servers used for Google’s applications help secure
                      access to Looker by providing a single point to filter
                      attacks through IP denylisting and connection rate
                      limiting.
b. Customer administrators
                      control access to applications by Google personnel to
                      provide technical support requested by Customer or End
                      Users.
