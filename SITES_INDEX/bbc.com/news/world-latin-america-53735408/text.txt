In a reference to the coronavirus pandemic, he told a small gathering of supporters that the PNM had prevailed "against all odds, in the most difficult situation".  Trinidad and Tobago has had a relatively low number of confirmed cases, 281, and only eight deaths, but the pandemic nevertheless changed the way the campaign was conducted. Campaigning was low-key with rallies cancelled and replaced by motorcades.Supporters were urged not to come to the PNM's headquarters but celebrate at home to avoid the spread of the virus.The governing party had been praised for its handling of the pandemic but in the two weeks before the polls, the number of infections rose compared to the previous weeks. The opposition has criticised Mr Rowley's government for not doing more to stem the flow of migrants from Venezuela.Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have arrived in Trinidad and Tobago fleeing the political and economic turmoil in their country.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, The Displaced: Venezuelans searching for peace in TrinidadIf the preliminary results are confirmed, Mr Rowley will face the challenge of tackling the economy which has been contracting for seven out of the last 10 years.
