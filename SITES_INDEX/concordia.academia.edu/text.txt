The Discrete Charm of Local Practices: Malegaon and the Politics of Locality (Bioscope: South Asian Screen Studies, Vol 6, No. 1)Filmmaking in the industrial township of Malegaon, affectionately referred to by the locals as Ma... more Filmmaking in the industrial township of Malegaon, affectionately referred to by the locals as Maliwood, is known for its spoofs of popular Hindi and Hollywood films. " Maliwood " has become an almost parallel film industry based on local creativity and minimal infrastructure deriving from informal and nonlegal media economies involving video cassette theaters and stores, and the circulation of video compact discs (VCDs) and digital videodiscs (DVDs). In this article, I track the formation of the Malegaon Film Industry as a localized filmmaking practice by charting the relay between the local industry, Hindi cinema, the various documentaries made on Malegaon, and the current TV series Malegaon Ka Chintu (2010–present) shot by people from Malegaon and produced by Sab TV in Bombay. Through the case study of Malegaon, the article attempts to track the journey of the town from an informal local industry to something that is being drawn into more formal industrialized patterns of production and distribution.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With a detailed analysis of the film text, this paper will traverse across public sphere discourses, critical and popular, generated around the film(s), to understand the representation of the erasure of violence through the moving image.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Special Issue "Home Video & Media Texts", Post Script 35.3 (Summer 2016).by Richard Nowell, Jindriska Blahova, Ishita Tiwary, and Blake AtwoodDespite exerting an almost unprecedented influence on audiovisual cultures across the globe, home... more Despite exerting an almost unprecedented influence on audiovisual cultures across the globe, home video has inspired a relatively narrow range of scholarly enquiry. On the one hand, media theorists and historians have tended to consider how this multifaceted phenomenon facilitated changes to the structure and organization of national film industries, especially that of the United States. On the other, they have examined the responses of stakeholders such as fans, moral watchdogs, and state institutions, especially in the United Kingdom. By contrast, apart perhaps from hardcore pornography, comparatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which home video shaped the texts the media industries crafted and disseminated; not only films but also movie marketing campaigns, companies’ brand identities, and works of professional criticism, to name but a few. As a consequence of these tendencies, home video has come to occupy something of an exceptional position in media historiography insofar as it has yet to provoke the type of sustained, multidirectional analyses rightly devoted to other technologies and means of delivery, such as television, widescreen, multiplexing, DVD, and new media like the internet and mobile telecommunications. By shifting attention from industrial structures and the dynamics of various forms of critical reception toward home video’s affect on texts produced by the culture industries, this issue of Post Script hopes to contribute to the larger task of deepening understandings of the economic, aesthetic, and social impact of arguably the most important change in content delivery and consumption of the late twentieth century.
