Drawing on a seven year long comparative and multi-sited ethnography of long-distance communication within Filipino transnational families I demonstrate that the recent convergence in new communication technologies has profound consequences not just for the migrants and their left-behind families but for the phenomenon of migration as a whole. Although new media cannot solve the fundamentally social problems of family separation, they are increasingly used as justifications for key decisions relating to migration or settlement in the host country. The chapter brings together research with migrants and institutional actors and shows that transnational communication through new media has become implicated in making female migration more socially acceptable while ultimately influencing patterns of migration. Technologically mediated communication remains a relatively unexplored aspect of transnational family life. Although new research has recently emerged, that it took so long for this issue to be placed on the agenda of migration research is surprising given the dependency of transnational families on communication technologies, especially in conditions of prolonged separation.

The study interrogates the diverse mobile practices through a mobilities lens emphasizing how the performance of a resource-based and mediated mobility is engendered and undermined by existing sociocultural and sociotechnical forces. The findings reveal that the performance of various types of transnational caregiving—emotional and practical—in cementing linkages is shaped by filial duty and the obligation to care. Importantly, this study unveils how obstacles and frustrations arise in caregiving at a distance as a static familial norm remains unchanged despite the configuration of familial organization. In this case, sustaining transnational relations warrants constant negotiation and performative adjustments. In sum, the study seeks to unravel the enactment, embodiment, and negotiation of caregiving across distances and borders in the age of ubiquitous digital media.Download Free PDFView PDFSecond International Handbook on Internet Reserch[Dis]connected households: Transnational Family Life in the Age of Mobile Internet2019 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoRapid technological innovations have revolutionized the ways in which Internet connectivity is utilized by individual users across diverse contexts. On a more specific note, the integration of the mobile Internet into a transnational household reproduces new textures and processes in sustaining familial linkages. This chapter illuminates how 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members use Internet-powered mobile devices and networked communications platforms in forging and maintaining family life at a distance. It deploys the theory of mediated mobilities (Keightley and Reading, Media Cult Soc 36:285–301, 2014) to examine how technologically mediated mobilities are engendered and undermined by structural and infrastructural forces. Drawing upon in-depth interviews, visual methods, and field note-taking, the study reveals how ubiquitous smartphones and online platforms mobilize the performance of gendered and familial roles, as well as affective surveillance. Furthermore, tactical connectivity is deployed through personalized strategies in overcoming structural and infrastructural barriers. Ultimately, the study approaches the domestication of the mobile Internet as part of a broader social context, such as the operations of a billion-dollar industry of Philippine migration. Paradoxically, Internet connectivity fuels transnational family life as well as legitimizes the retention of structural systems that produce family separation in a globalized economy. It is then by exposing the contradictory mobile experiences embodied and negotiated by transnational family members that this chapter offers a critical lens in critiquing the valorization of migration as a nationalist act in Philippine context.Download Free PDFView PDF    In book: Handbook of Migration and Globalisation, Chapter: 25, Publisher: Edward Elgar Publishing, Editors: Anna TriandafyllidouTransnational families in the era of global mobility2018 • Laura  Merla, Majella KilkeyAs a result of the dominance of highly individualised, economistic and gendered analyses of migration and globalisation processes, family life has often been relegated to the 'back stage' of research on globalisation and migration. However, a number of closely linked developments in both fields are raising awareness of the critical position that family occupies in the relationship between migration and globalisation, pushing analyses of family life to the 'front stage' of research. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between family, globalisation and migration through the lens of care, focusing specifically on the experiences of transnational families. We begin by examining how uneven globalisation processes produce 'crises of care', which migration can help alleviate. We move on to explore the transnational care strategies migrants and their kin members in the country of origin develop to maintain familyhood across borders, including when trapped in immobility. In such a context, the opportunities provided by ICTs to maintain connections and to care across distance have become especially important. We conclude by arguing that mobility and internet access are thus key features of globalisation that require careful policy attention at both national and transnational levels.Download Free PDFView PDFContinuum: Journal of media and cultural studiesElastic carework: The cost and contradictions of mobile caregiving in a transnational household2020 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoABSTRACT This paper examines the pivotal role of digital communication technologies in the provision of transnational caregiving among geographically separated family members. Particularly, it examines the consequences of mobile device use in facilitating the circulation and consumption of money and consumer goods among 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines. By deploying a mediated mobilities lens (Keightley & Reading, 2014) in analysing the data drawn upon in-depth interviews, photo elicitation, and field notetaking, I coin the term ‘elastic carework’ to articulate the contradictory outcomes of mobile caregiving at a distance as shaped by the entanglement of social structures and technological infrastructures. On the one hand, caregiving at a distance enable transnational family members to enact affective exchanges, fulfil obligations and cement intimate ties. On the other hand, it can also become a source of frustration and unsettling feelings, which are often dealt with personalised tactics. Ultimately, this paper provides a vantage point in re-thinking the performance, embodiment and negotiation of a family-based and networked caregiving at a distance in the age of global migration.Download Free PDFView PDFInformation, Communication & Society They could picture me, or I could picture them': 'Displaying' family life beyond borders through mobile photography2019 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoTaking photographs has been an integral part of family life. However, recent technological innovations in mobile communication have paved the way for diverse use of photographic images in a household. This paper investigates how 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines deploy mobile photography to perform and embody visual co-presence. By examining the data based on in-depth interviews, photo elicitation and field notes, the study uncovers the role of images in enabling the ‘display’ (Finch, J. 2007. Displaying families. Sociology, 41(1), 65–81) of familial roles, responsibilities, and values. Notably, by taking into account how socio-cultural and socio-technological forces inform photographic practices, this study identifies and proposes four dimensions of visual copresence, including casual, practical, curated, and strategic. Consequently, images are broadly understood as important tools in bridging and reclaiming family life as disrupted by the uneven consequences of a global economy in the Philippines. In sum, the study aims to unpack the paradoxical consequences of mobile photography in the maintenance of transnational domesticity.Download Free PDFView PDFTransnational families, care and wellbeingLaura  MerlaThe notion of ‘transnational families’ emerged at the beginning of the 21st century to designate in particular “families that live some or most of the time separated from each other, yet hold together and create something that can be seen as a feeling of collective welfare and unity, namely ‘familyhood’, even across national borders” (Bryceson and Vuorela, 2002: 18). Because of geographical distance, the maintenance of collective welfare and unity in transnational families largely relies on the ability of transnational family members to participate in the circulation of care across distance and national borders, an ability that represents a key feature of migrant wellbeing. The concept of care is indeed strongly related to issues surrounding welfare and wellbeing, both at an individual and collective level. As Daly (2011) points out, care relates not only to the servicing of the needs of those who cannot take care of themselves as well as those who are able-bodied, it also emphasises in a broader sense the relational foundations of all social life. In other words, ‘key elements of people’s welfare inhere in their relations with others and the reciprocity around responses to need and the receipt of recognition and value for who people are’ (Daly, 2011: 47-48). In this chapter, we define the circulation of care in transnational families as a ‘capability’ (Sen, 1987), and discuss how the ability to participate in care exchanges impacts on the well-being of transnational family members – in terms of the provision of their care needs, of reciprocal care obligations and practices, and of identity recognition. This also leads us to examine the ways in which new communication technologies transform the ways in which caring relationships are experienced and practiced, and to highlight how policy mediates families' capabilities to care across distance.Download Free PDFView PDFEasy access: new dynamics in long-distance African intimaciesDinah HannafordThis article examines how African transnational relationships in the twenty-first century differ from their manifestation in previous periods of mobility and long-distance intimacy. I argue that the possibilities for and expectations of imme- diate communication and co-presence facilitated by the current technological landscape distinguish this era from earlier ones and fundamentally alter the ways in which African migrants connect to those at home. Although time–space compression allows for the potential of new practices of virtual intimacy, it also creates an imperative of availability for migrants that is reinforced not only on micro- and meso-levels by families and communities but also on macro-levels by neoliberal state policies that target migrants as agents of development and providers of social services.Download Free PDFView PDFHome on the move: negotiating differential domesticity in family life at a distanceEarvin Charles CabalquintoThis article examines the ways in which 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile media to re-stage, experience and negotiate home. Based on deploying in-depth interviews and visual methods, the findings show the reconstruction of a sense of dwelling through mobile devices. This transformation is shaped by the performance of ritualistic practices, gender roles and socioeconomic conditions. The study also uncovers how mediated mobilities are undermined by social structures and uneven technological infrastructures, paving the way for unstable, exclusionary and ambivalent experiences. Hence, members of the transnational Filipino family often negotiate such challenges by deploying various tactics to ensure that ties are maintained. By unravelling the differential and constrained mobile practices of the transnational Filipino family in forging a sense of at-homeness, the article attends to a critical conception of domesticity in the age of smartphones and mobile phone applications.Download Free PDFView PDFMediatization of Communication, edited by Knut LundbyPolymedia communication and mediatized migration: an ethnographic approach2014 • Mirca MadianouThis chapter investigates the cumulative consequences of new communication technologies for the phenomenon of migration. Drawing on a five year long comparative and multi-sited ethnography of long-distance communication within Filipino transnational families I demonstrate that the recent convergence in new communication technologies has profound consequences not just for the migrants and their left-behind families but for the phenomenon of migration as a whole. Although new media cannot solve the fundamentally social problems of family separation, they have become integral to how these relationships are experienced and managed. Despite the transnational asymmetries in infrastructure and media literacy, the increasing availability of transnational communication is used as a justification for key decisions relating to migration or settlement in the host country. This discourse, which ultimately normalizes migration decisions, is also evident at an institutional level. The chapter brings together research with institutional actors as well as migrant families and shows that transnational communication through new media – understood as an environment of polymedia – has become implicated in making female migration more socially acceptable while ultimately influencing patterns of migration. By bringing together an analysis of interpersonal communication as mediation and social change as mediatization the chapter shows that media do not just add a new dimension to the phenomenon of migration – they transform it altogether. The chapter also outlines the distinct contribution of an ethnographic approach to mediatization.Download Free PDFView PDFFamily and Space Rethinking Family Theory and Empirical ApproachesHalatcheva-Trapp, Montanari, Schlinzig eds. 2019 Family and Space (preview)2019 • Friedemann Yi-NeumannWhile the 'spatial turn' within the social sciences has already nurtured a broad discussion of the relation between society and space, little attention has so far been paid to the question of what we can learn about families when exploring space in its different facets. This book brings together international authors from the fields of sociology, human geography, and anthropology to support the development of space-sensitive and de-territorialised perspectives on the family that reach beyond classical concepts such as the 'household' or the 'nuclear family'. With close attention to the implications of differing relations to space for the social fabric of families, it presents studies of theoretical, methodological, and empirical aspects of late-modern family life. Examining the meaning of absence and presence for parenting, the aesthetic, and sensual dimensions of everyday family life, and its digital and media-related features aspects, Family and Space considers the value of a range of approaches to researching the spatial elements of family life, including ethnographic accounts, interviews, group discussions, mobile methods, and network analyses.
