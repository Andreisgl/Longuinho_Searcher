I show that, while Dante devalues the philosophical authority associated with the traditional Aristotelian emphasis on the significance of contemplative activity, he does so in order to highlight philosophy’s ethico-political authority to guide human conduct toward its “earthly beatitude.” Moreover, I argue that, although Dante subordinates earthly beatitude to spiritual beatitude, he nonetheless maintains that philosophy’s authority to reveal a path to spiritual beatitude requires its fundamental independence from theology.Download Free PDFView PDFDante's Poets: Textuality and Truth in the Comedy.

Dante’s masterplot is the teleological trajectory by which the poet subordinates the past to the authority of a new experience. The book analyses the masterplot’s workings in Dante’s text and its role in the interpretation of the poem, and it documents its overwhelming success in influencing readings of the 'Commedia' over the centuries. The volume then explores three competing narrative models that resist and counter its monopoly which are enacted by paradoxes, alternative endings and parallel lives, and the future. By focusing on these non-linear modes of storytelling and testing the limits of linear narration, the book questions critical paradigms in the scholarship of the 'Commedia' that favour a single normative master truth, exposes their problematic authoritarian implications, and highlights the manifold poetic, theological, and ethical tensions that are often neglected due to the masterplot’s influence. The new picture of a vulnerable author and open-ended text that emerges from this study thus doubles as a metacritical reflection on the state of the field. The book’s impassioned argument is that, alongside established notions of his trademark plurality of linguistic registers and styles, Dante’s narrative pluralism can, and should, come to play a key role in contemporary and future readings of the 'Commedia'.Download Free PDFView PDFDante's Matelda: Queen, Saint, and Mother of EmperorsJo Ann Hoeppner Moran CruzDante’s Matelda, his guide through his Earthly Paradise, has been a source of perplexity for Dante scholars. This study summarizes discussions surrounding Matelda’s identity, concluding that the personage Dante most likely intended was Queen and Saint Matilda of Saxony, progenitor of the German line of Roman emperors, an identification that has never been fully explored. The contextual analysis supporting this identification examines Dante’s prefigurations of Matelda, his description of Matelda and her surroundings, and the many references to imperial, founding and ruling women and mothers in Dante’s writings. Further supporting this identification is Dante’s concern for worldly justice and a revived empire that integrates the final cantos of Purgatorio with concerns in his Monarchia. The paper then analyzes the manuscript traditions exalting Queen Matilda that Dante may have encountered; it concludes by arguing for consideration of the literal and figurative Matelda within the context of Dante’s imperial politics and dreams of justice.Download Free PDFView PDFSex and the City of GodOlivia  HolmesDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Erotics of  Consolation: Desire and Distance in the Middle Ages. Ed. C. Léglu and S. Milner. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.The Consolation of Beatrice and Dante’s Dream of the Siren as Vilification Cure (draft)2008 • Olivia  Holmes[This chapter explores Dante's use, in the Divina Commedia, of the Boethian pattern of a noble lady expelling meretricious rivals, and Beatrice's implicitly therapeutic role in the poem.] In book 2 of the Convivio (Banquet), an unfinished encyclopedic treatise by Dante Alighieri which preceded the Divina Commedia, Dante recounts that after Beatrice's death, when he was so overcome by sorrow that no comfort availed him, he set about reading "that little-known book by Boethius, in which, when wretched and forsaken, he found consolation." 1 He then imagined Philosophy as a noble and compassionate lady, whose sweetness so delighted him that in a short time his love for her had displaced and destroyed his every other thought. Thus the study of philosophy, he suggests, is the true referent of the erotic triumph of the Donna Gentile (Noble Lady) over Beatrice in the allegorical poems of the Convivio and in the corresponding episode of Dante's earlier autobiographical prosimetrum, the Vita nova (New Life), in which he falls in love with an attractive lady because she looks down on him compassionately. This lady's temporary expulsion of Dante's poetic muse Beatrice from the fortress of his mind is clearly based on the opening scene of the Consolation of Philosophy, in which Lady Philosophy drives out the Muses of poetry, who encouraged the sick protagonist's self-piteous wallowing with their poisonous blather.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
