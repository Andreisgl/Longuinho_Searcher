Sometimes weapon fire is not easily recognizable to an untrained ear. Rapid gunfire can sound like fireworks, vehicles backfiring, or noises from nearby construction sites. Given the time of year, many in the dense crowd thought that the artillery barrage might have been bottle rockets or other pyrotechnics, left over from a recent Fourth of July celebration. Others had little doubt about what they were hearing. Judge Avery Lassiter sat up in bed, bleary-eyed, watching the television news coverage that night. As the saying goes, if it bleeds, it leads. Thus, there was non-stop streaming of the horrific events as they unfolded. The news cameras kept panning to cops on the streets of downtown—just near Avery’s courthouse. Avery recognized no one so far. She kept noticing the same dazed look in all of the cops’ eyes—a look she had seen before—that so-called thousand-yard stare of detachment and numbness. She told herself that most of them who lived would eventually be okay. The extremity of the moment would be followed by the recognition of being alive in the moment. That’s how these things usually worked. The brothers and sisters in blue were nothing, if not resilient. However, the survivors would be forever haunted by those who didn’t live through this night. July 7, 2016 was a hot day in Dallas, Texas. It was a Thursday. Since the preceding Monday had been Independence Day, the streets of Downtown Dallas were less congested than usual. Many people had taken a week-long holiday. The only thing atypical about this sultry summer day was that, in the evening, a rally had been organized by a group known as the Next Generation Action Network to protest the recent killings of two Black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, by police officers in Louisiana and Minnesota, respectively. The rally that night in Dallas was one of several being held simultaneously across the United States. The starting time for the event was 7:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time—about an hour and a half before sunset. The location for the beginning of the rally would be the Belo Gardens, directly across from the Earle Cabell Federal Building. Around 800 protesters attended the rally, and around 100 police officers were assigned to work the event, providing contingent crowd control and traffic diversion in the surrounding areas. The protesters would march a short route, mostly along Main Street. The protest was peaceful—actually, a model of the way free expression and the right of assembly should ideally work in a democratic society. Some protesters brought their children with them—it was summertime after all. The law enforcement presence was deferential and affable with the crowd. There was no trouble of any sort at first. In fact, the rally was in some ways patriotic—partly because of the time of the year. There was a mood of mutual respect and calm in the atmosphere. The organizer of the demonstration was an ordained minister. Attendees were mostly friendly, dignified, and somber as they lit candles, uttered doleful chants, and sang hymns. The Dallas Police Department had, for many years, maintained a relatively positive rapport with the citizens in the community. Momentarily, things turned a little frightening, when approximately twenty to thirty open-carry gun-rights activists joined the protest, some wearing gas masks, bulletproof vests, and fatigues—in addition to carrying rifles. While this caused some tension, the activists caused no trouble. They were mostly ignored. They eventually went on their way, distancing themselves from the crowd. Just before 9:00 p.m., as the cloudless sky grew dark, graced with an incandescent crescent moon, shit turned real, as Officer Max Lassiter was prone to say. The demonstrators had walked from the Belo Gardens down Main Street, in a westerly direction, towards Dallas’s Romanesque-style sandstone Old Red Courthouse. A few in the crowd posed for pictures there. The burnt sienna and gray-trimmed courthouse, with its rusticated marble accents, was built in 1892. It stood majestically, in stark contrast to the modern glass and steel structures of the city, with its stunning clock tower, castle-like turrets, spires, arches, and terracotta winged, spiny-backed serpents perched on the top. Children sometimes remarked that the courthouse looked like a gingerbread castle with its puffy, whimsical features. Some children that night pointed toward the bell tower with its shimmering light, wondering if they saw two ghostly apparitions watching over the sea of people. They shouted, Look! It’s the ghosts of Bonnie and Clyde! These were children of a local criminal defense lawyer. The children had slightly confused the details of their father’s scary bedtime stories regarding the ghosts of Bonnie and Clyde—who were allegedly seen, from time to time, roaming Dallas landmarks. In 1934, the infamous Clyde Barrow’s corpse had been lain out for public viewing prior to his funeral at the nearby Belo Mansion (now the Dallas Lawyers’ headquarters, which was formerly a funeral home). He’d been shot and killed in an ambush in Louisiana. For years since, there had been folklore that Clyde Barrow’s spectral image stalked, back and forth, haunting that nearby facility—which was actually a few blocks northeast of the march. As the crowd of demonstrators U-turned easterly at Old Red, sauntering slowly up Main Street, twenty-five-year-old Micah Xavier Johnson, a former U.S. Army Reservist, dressed in a tan body armor vest and other tactical clothing, and equipped with two handguns, an assault rifle, and vast amounts of ammunition, parked his mother’s black sports utility vehicle that he had driven downtown. He parked it illegally, southbound on Lamar Street, between Main and Elm Streets, beside El Centro College. Johnson had been shadowing the march, driving from street to street, until this particular moment. The young man was approximately one block from the unsuspecting crowd. He left the hazard lights flashing on the vehicle and cautiously emerged from the car. Johnson took a few steps out of the darkness and onto the spongey asphalt of Lamar Street. He was somewhat of an imposing figure, with a tall, muscular physique, bristling black facial hair, and brown hollow eyes. He paused for a protracted moment, balefully gazing back and forth over the crowd, and then began a vicious ambush—rapidly firing a Izhmash-Saiga 5.45mm rifle (a variation on the AK 174 semi-automatic) into a parked police car and at a group of police officers who were strolling with the demonstrators. Johnson’s bullets were disturbingly accurate, hitting several officers and a civilian. It was initially difficult to discern how many police officers and citizens were down in the chaos. The scene was one of bedlam as most in the massive crowd of people frantically scattered in all directions. As the shots rang out, echoing like cannon fire through the canyons of Downtown Dallas, it had a disorienting effect. It was almost impossible to tell the direction from which the torrent of bullets was coming—much less whom was being targeted. Was the carnage random, or was it only the police who were under attack? Were there multiple perpetrators and, if so, were they perhaps those open-carry guns rights activists who had marched by earlier? Was it one or more high-positioned snipers? Perhaps the children of the defense lawyer had, in fact, truly seen figures up in Old Red’s bell tower after all. People in the crowd bolted for their lives as the shots continued. Parents crouched behind cars with children. Some in the crowd simply stood frozen in bewilderment, paralyzed by fear. Injured victims were thrown into parked police cars and were hurried to nearby hospitals. The shooter, Micah Johnson, was not finished with his ambush. With what was described as the fierce look of a predator, he swept around facing the opposite direction and ran northward up Lamar Street, wildly peppering shots into the glass doors of one of the entrances of El Centro College. Two campus police officers behind the glass doors were injured. More than four dozen students and instructors were still present on campus, just finishing up summer school classes at this late hour. The gunman continued working his way up Lamar Street, passing his own vehicle, eventually creeping up on a Dallas Transit police officer, fatally shooting him from behind, as the officer peered around a concrete pillar. Micah Johnson robotically continued to fire his gun as he shifted, turned, and zigzagged up the campus sidewalk—almost as though he were racing through an imaginary minefield. One of the injured El Centro campus police officers heroically managed to rise to his feet. The campus officer ran out onto Lamar Street, saw the fallen Transit officer, and attempted to help him. As he did, the shooter rounded the corner at Elm Street, continuing to blast shots into the glass windows of El Centro. Johnson eventually ducked inside the college, just as the instructors and frantic students were managing to evacuate from another end of campus. He then went into a stairwell to apparently hide or rest up for another phase of his murderous rampage. Johnson had a student access card that had allowed him entry onto the campus. He had seemingly planned every detail of his mission quite well. At some point in his spree, Johnson was injured and began spurting a stream of his own blood on the sidewalks outside of El Centro. About fifteen minutes after the first shooting spree had paused, the second of the two injured El Centro campus police officers saw Johnson’s blood trail and followed it to find Johnson, lying in a supine position, in an El Centro stairwell. Upon seeing the officer, Johnson vaulted to his feet—obviously not seriously injured, and apparently, feeling rested and reinvigorated enough to begin another phase of battle. A spectacular shootout ensued. At some point, the beleaguered campus police officer—fighting alone against a better armed, well-prepared executioner—was forced to retreat, and Johnson ran into a second-floor library. Then Johnson perched himself in a north-facing window and resumed his massacre, shooting at police officers down below on Elm Street. He struck and killed a fifty-five-year-old Dallas Police Sergeant at that point, who was climbing out of his patrol car by a 7-11 convenience store. He also struck and injured another DART police officer working at the West End rail station. Downtown Dallas was a horrific, turbulent crime scene for more than five hours—with an active shooter still at large. All Dallas Police Department officers were called to duty by 10:00 p.m. United States Marshal task force officers were brought to the scene as well and were roaming the streets in full tactical gear. All businesses and buildings were on lockdown, with innocents sheltering inside, as helicopters swirled around the bloody scene. Police investigators eventually determined that Micah Johnson had moved into an alcove toward the center of El Centro’s campus, away from all windows. But the police did not have a clear view of him. The next step was for SWAT officers to enter the building—it was believed, at this point, that Johnson was the only person inside. Subsequently, in the early hours of July 8, there ensued a lengthy standoff between the shooter and SWAT officers, during which at least 200 rounds of ammunition were fired. During the confrontation, Johnson was described as savoring every moment, showing a mixture of bravado, arrogance, and shamelessness as he laughed at police, sang songs, and asked how many people he had killed so far. The Dallas Police Chief eventually made a bold decision, to send in a remote-controlled robot with a pound of C-4 explosives attached to it. The robot was sent down a hallway inside the college toward Johnson where it was then detonated. Johnson was killed instantly. It was the first time that a robot had been used in U.S. law enforcement history to put down a perpetrator in this type of context. Later, in a dark hallway inside El Centro, police discovered that the shooter had scrawled RB in his own blood in two places on the wall. The meaning remains unknown to this day. Righteous blood? Some speculated that perhaps Johnson was attempting to write RBG—for the red, black, and green flag, also known as the Pan-African flag. The red, black, and green flag was later discovered on Johnson’s social media page. Or maybe, others speculated, Rosebud (a throwback to the dying words of a character in the Hollywood film Citizen Kane)? Various theories would later abound on Internet blogs—some plausible and some ridiculous. There were other cryptic markings on the wall that have never been identified. As far as investigators could determine, Johnson (who lived with his mother) was not affiliated with any group. He was a lone wolf. Another lone wolf who chose a path of violence. During negotiations, the shooter told police negotiators that he had placed explosives in various spots around Downtown Dallas. The shooter warned, The end is coming. Thus, the nightmare continued for hours after Micah Johnson’s death. No bombs were ever found, but a search for bombs was carried out throughout the night and into the next day, and the city was on edge until the threat was thoroughly investigated. Downtown Dallas was a blockaded crime scene, blanketed in a chilling, funereal atmosphere, for several days. In the end, twelve police officers were shot by Micah Johnson (eight Dallas Police Department Officers and four DART officers). Twelve were shot—was that merely a coincidence or by design, since twelve is a slang term for police? Five officers died. End of watch, as the police family says. The nightmare, of course, would never completely end for the friends and loved ones of the fallen. In addition to the officers, two innocent civilians were injured but recovered—one was a mother who was shot while shielding her terrified children. The fallen were sons, daughters, spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, friends. They were individuals positively impacting their communities—regularly accomplishing amazing but unnoticed personal feats. Those who knew them well described them as selfless heroes who had no desire to be acknowledged or recognized. One fallen officer had served three tours of duty in Iraq as a Naval officer and was awarded several medals for his valor. Another officer had served in the Army and was said to have frequently purchased meals for homeless people when he was out on patrol. Another had played semi-professional football and people described him as a big guy with a bigger heart. Yet another was active in his church, where he handed out stickers to children as they departed from Sunday School—he had postponed a family vacation by one day to work at the rally, grinning sheepishly when his colleagues teased him about his unfailing work ethic. Decent, quiet heroes, one and all. Inside Micah Johnson’s home, Dallas Police found metal piping, chemicals, and instructions for making a bomb. It appeared that he had been practicing explosive detonations, and they were large enough to create mass devastation. Also found in his home were ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics—including a tactic called shoot and move, designed to confuse police. Johnson had no criminal history. He had served in the U.S. Army Reserve for six years (achieving the rank of private first class) and had completed an eight-month tour in Afghanistan. Police were convinced that he had bigger plans. Was he mentally ill, with perhaps post-traumatic stress disorder, or just an angry, evil soul? A lunatic or a hater? Horrible events demand answers. But does it really matter? Johnson managed, in one night, to forever alter the lives of a dozen innocent victims and their loved ones. Like November 1963, Dallas’s happy, positive image was again besmirched by the acts of a killer. Avery’s beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Baxter, was by her side snoring loudly. He was her constant companion—they had been through so much together. Usually, his slobbery snores had a soporific effect on her, but not on this night. Avery’s phone did not stop beeping with texts and calls. All of her colleagues at the courthouse wanted to know what was really happening. Did Max know? Was Max involved? Avery stayed awake, afraid of going to sleep. Afraid for the kids. She had to be ready. She had to practice in her mind how she would handle things—just in case. That’s what one must do when you are married to a cop. You practice in your mind. Everything is for the greater good. If a cop dies in the line of work, so be it. They die for the greater good. Chapter One Three Years Later (July 2019)— Pseudocide is Painless. Faked deaths. Also known as staged deaths. Evanescing without a trace. Yes, feigning one’s own death is a ‘thing,’ Avery was explaining to Julia one Saturday afternoon while the two of them rinsed and diced vegetables for a salad. Avery was apprising Julia as to why her father would be away from home for an indeterminate length of time, while next coaching Julia through preparation of Baba Jo’s favorite recipe for meaty, cheesy manicotti. No, silly, your dad is not faking his own death! Oh my gosh, Julia! Julia looked back at her mother with a kittenish half smile. Max Lassiter was taking an extended trip down to Mexico to investigate what was believed to be a pretend death of a man named Cade Graham, a well-known wealthy playboy and high-flying, Dallas hedge fund manager. Graham was the founder and CEO of Dallas-based Ranger Capital, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate, which managed not just hedge funds but private equity funds, CDOs, CLOs, REITs, life settlements, and all manner of complicated financial products. This investigation was part of Max’s new post-retirement gig—working as an investigator for Premier Mutual Life Insurance Company. Max had escaped the confinement of the police department and retired a couple of years ago—not long after the July 2016 police massacre. He had started this strange new endeavor, as Avery called it, last January. He now referred to himself as a professional finder. And he was referring to this Mexico assignment of his as Operation Hedge Hog. His investigative assignments always had some catchy code name. Just like with the corporate transactional lawyers Avery used to work with at her old law firm. It appears one could not ever use actual names for their projects—whether there were legitimate confidentiality concerns or not. Project Orion, Juno, Calypso—there was never any rhyme or reason to them. At least Operation Hedge Hog had a meaningful tie to Cade Graham’s profession. Why do people fake their own deaths, Mom? Well, it happens often enough that there is even an official term for it: ‘pseudocide.’ I have never heard of that word. "I hadn’t either until your dad started this. Anyway, why, you ask, would a person execute such a hoax? Honey, I could spend all day answering that question. There have been plenty of reasons people have orchestrated their own deaths throughout history. People who engage in this come from all walks of life—from ordinary, everyday people, to egomaniacs, eccentrics, to well-known authors, to women escaping domestic abuse (a donna fugata, as they say in Italian), to corporate titans, to hedge fund managers, to former Nazis. Most often, though, they are middle class, middle aged, heterosexual white males with families." You’ve just described Dad! Yes, I suppose I have. But why, Mom? Why do people do something so weird? It’s usually about escaping some undesirable situation, sweetie. But I would say it is most often about money—such as someone falling into financial distress and trying to escape the consequences. Conversely, sometimes someone has had the good fortune of coming into a lot of money—like an inheritance or winning the lottery—and is trying to escape a spouse or family or friends seeking a share. This is sad, but I have even heard of young people with significant amounts of student loan debt faking their deaths to get out of the burden of having to pay it.¹ You mean like if Heath did it, because he chose to attend such an expensive private college and has such huge student loans now, Mom? Not funny, Julia! Can you get arrested for faking your own death? Well, faking your death—just basically going missing off the grid—is not by itself a crime. Technically, a person can go missing if he or she chooses. You know, just check out of life, so to speak. But most of the time, a fraud is going to be committed somehow in the process, or the person is going to end up committing some other crime as part of faking his death. Like how? Well, a ‘pseudocide’ usually starts with a person leaving random evidence to mislead people into thinking that he or she is dead, but there is usually no corpse (for obvious reasons). Sometimes, the evidence that they leave to mislead people ends up being fraudulently created and so that fraudulent evidence can be a crime. Sometimes, the death-faker will next assume the identity of an actual dead person with similar vital statistics and age. That would also be a crime. Oh yeah, I’ve seen that in a TV show before. Ha! I bet you have. And insurance fraud is very high on the list of reasons that people are known to fake their deaths—that is, as part of an attempt to fraudulently collect life insurance policy proceeds. And that’s why your father is getting involved in the alleged death of this fellow, Cade Graham. I’m not sure I get what you mean, Mom. Let’s see. I assume you know what life insurance is, or no? Julia raised her right eyebrow and shrugged her shoulders. Julia had never been very childlike—always an old soul—so much so that sometimes Avery forgot that she was a child and didn’t already know some basic things that adults know. Okay, I’ll explain. I pay premiums every month for a life insurance policy, so that if I die before you are grown up, a pot of money will be paid out by the insurance company that will support you, since if I am dead, I am not around making money anymore to support you. Just like car insurance is for the situation when you are in a car wreck, life insurance is for when someone dies—there will be money to pay out to people who depended upon that person. You’re being so morbid, Mom. No, not really. The concept of life insurance came into existence a couple of hundred years ago. It’s generally quite a good thing that can give parents peace of mind for their families. But, like any other commercial enterprise in life, there are always going to be dishonest people who figure out a way to exploit the system. There are many documented cases, from the very beginning of the industry, of schemes where people have faked their deaths, or the deaths of friends and loved ones, to receive life insurance money. How do people do it usually? Well people are sometimes good at it and people are often terrible at it. According to your father, people most often fake a water accident—a drowning or falling off a boat far out in the ocean from the shore. Presumably, the perpetrators believe that drowning out at sea provides a plausible reason for the absence of a body. These cases are almost always suspicious, especially if the person has been in legal or financial trouble. In a drowning, a body will typically wash up, usually in the first few days. So, if there’s a drowning and no corpse ever appears, it’s very suspicious in the eyes of law enforcement. Of course, sometimes people just leave a suicide note and disappear—causing suspicion about whether foul play was involved. "The character Juliet from Romeo and Juliet faked her death, Mom!" Yes, Julia. At least, initially. That didn’t work out very well, did it? And some people think Elvis and Michael Jackson might have faked their own deaths. Huh? Oh, never mind. Before your time, sweetie. Anyway, it is really very hard to get away with faking your death. People think they are geniuses at staying hidden, but they leave breadcrumbs everywhere. Digital footprints. Technology has been an absolute gamechanger when it comes to ferreting out missing people—well, at least missing adults. A person really must completely do away with all technology and go completely off the grid. That’s why the U.S. Marshals almost always find their fugitives because people can’t stay off their phones or computers or avoid ATMs or credit cards or video cameras. I bet I could disappear, Mom. Oh please. You can’t stay off your phone for five minutes. In fact, Julia had just put down her vegetable peeler and was doing internet searches on her phone. She had just Googled Cade Graham’s name and saw plenty of pictures of him—mostly standing with beautiful and extremely young women in exotic locations. He looked fifty-something and had slicked back, collar-length, silver hair, a tanned complexion, sparkling green eyes, and fluorescently glowing white teeth. I found pictures of Cade Graham, Mom. He apparently wears nothing but black turtlenecks. And only hangs out with girls who look barely older than me. Lovely. Anyway, there is a creepy, underground market out there with resources to help a person orchestrate a fake death. For example, you can obtain a fake death certificate through these underground markets. Mexico is one place where people have been known to easily get a fake death certificate. It’s usually accomplished through people who work for the government providing the documents that people need. It might cost you $150 to get a fake death certificate.
