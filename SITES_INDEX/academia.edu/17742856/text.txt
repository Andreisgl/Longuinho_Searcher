Multiculturalism as a policy recognizes that multicultural heterogeneity constitutes a productive force, one that is highly influential on the socio-political dynamics of a country. As David Theo Goldberg explains, Multicultural heterogeneity politicizes explicitly what is otherwise political only silently and in the absence of acknowledgment (that is, what gets denied as political in the name of universal value). It renders explicit the contestation over values and entitlements making overtly political what in any case is implicitly so and, thus, reduces the possibility of manipulation and control as well as maintenance of the status quo. Finally, multicultural heterogeneity multiplies in number and quality the available nature and range of knowledge and practical wisdom. And given that heterogeneity applies equally within and between groups, it likewise...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersFrom Indian to Indo-Creole: Tassa Drumming, Creolization, and Indo-Caribbean Nationalism in Trinidad & TobagoChristopher L BallengeeTassa is an Indo-Caribbean musical genre popular in Trinidad and Tobago characterized by a four-part ensemble comprising four instruments: two small kettledrums called “tassa,” a double-headed bass drum called dhol or simply “bass,” and jhal, a set of hand cymbals. In this study, I engage tassa on two interrelated levels. First, I provide a description of the ensemble and a musical analysis of common repertoire. Second, I use this musical analysis to discuss ways in which tassa is evoked as a symbol of Indo-Trinidadian identity. In the process, I situate tassa performance as one among a variety of diasporic practices that reverberate through layers of individual alignments—religious, gendered, economic, and otherwise—to construct an ostensibly unified Indo-Trinidadian identity that references India as a place of origin and the Caribbean as home. With divergent though ultimately complementary referents, Indo-Trinidadian identity is in this way rooted in a pronounced multilocality.Download Free PDFView PDFAudible EntanglementsJocelyne GuilbaultDownload Free PDFView PDFSouth Asian DiasporaMusic Competitions, Public Pedagogy, and Decolonisation in Trinidad and Tobago2019 • Christopher L BallengeeThis article examines music’s role in decolonising processes in Trinidad and Tobago, focusing on postcolonial national identity politics with reference to the country’s two largest ethnic groups: those descended from enslaved Africans and those from indentured labourers from India. First, the article traces the nationalisation of Creole culture – defined in terms of African- European syncretism – from the 1950s onwards, and it describes the state’s use of music competitions and educational programmes to institutionalise Carnival, calypso, and steel pan, all associated largely with African Trinidadian culture. This impacted on Indian Trinidadians by excluding them from inscriptions of national identity. The article concludes with a discussion of Indian Trinidadian cultural resurgence, tassa competitions, and the growth of public pedagogy from the 1970s that established tassa as an icon of Indianness; and all illustrating how music was used in a complex decolonisation process (relating to colonial rule and the Creole mainstream).Download Free PDFView PDFSteel Pan's Heart2012 • Chioma OzuzuDownload Free PDFView PDFNavigating the Cultural Marketplace: Negotiating the Folk in Trinidadian PerformanceMeida McNealDownload Free PDFView PDF"Why Must All Girls Want to be Flag Women"Samantha PintoDownload Free PDFView PDFCaribbean Review of Gender StudiesHyphenated identities: Negotiating ‘Indianness’ and being Indo-Trinidadian2012 • Kavyta K RThe nature of identities in terms of gender, ethnicity, culture and nation has been the subject of significant academic debate, particularly in postcolonial and feminist studies. In order to address the ways in which the contemporary generation of Trinidadian women of Indian descent negotiate issues surrounding identity, it is necessary to interrogate the terms of this debate and redefine key concepts in ways, it is hoped, that may help to expand its scope, as social categories such as “race” and ethnicity, among others, are continually negotiated and contested under new theoretical shifts in postcolonial theory and poststructuralist theory which emphasise fluidity rather than fixity. This paper reviews ways of understanding the female Indian experience in terms of “diaspora", “ethnicity”,“hybridity”and “hyphenated identities”. It seeks to show that essentialist conceptions of gendered and ethnicised identity are non-productive and that ultimately, the identification of oneself as female, Trinidadian, Indian, or Indo-Trinidadian can be read as discursively constructed.Download Free PDFView PDFJep Sting Radica with Rum and Roti: Trinidadian Social Dynamics in Chutney Music2014 • Darrell G BakshThis paper focuses on chutney, a form of popular music in Trinidad with roots in prepartitioned North India, as an intriguing genre through which, culturally, to analyze Trinidadian social dynamics. It concentrates on developments during the Trinidad Carnival of 2009 to illustrate how chutney interrogates and confronts a variety of interrelated struggles over multiple identities—musical, socio-cultural and racial—in a bid to reinscribe broader definitions of Trinidadianness and challenge traditional notions of Indianness. Through lyrical, timbral, thematic, and performative analyses, the paper explores three popular chutney recordings of 2009—“Rum & Roti,” “Radica,” and “Jep Sting Naina”—to uncover the discursive and often discrepant complexities of Trinidadian culture.Download Free PDFView PDFPopular MusicChutney and Indo-Trinidadian cultural identity1998 • Peter ManuelSince the early 1980s Indian diasporic communities have attained sufficient size, affluence, self-awareness and generational distance from South Asia to have created a set of popular music styles that are autonomous and distinctive rather than strictly derivative of Indian models. While the bhangra music of British Punjabis has attracted some scholarly and journalistic attention, chutney, a syncretic Indo-Caribbean popular music and dance idiom, is little known outside its own milieu. This article constitutes a preliminary socio-musical study of chutney.Download Free PDFView PDFQuestioning the Complexity of Carnival- Is it an Afro-Trinidadian or National Event2008 • Amanda ZavitzDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
