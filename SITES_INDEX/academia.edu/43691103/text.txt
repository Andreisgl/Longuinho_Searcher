The town is further mentioned in Micah I: I and again in Jer. 26:18, and may be the toponym meant by 'Gath' in 2 Chr. 11:8 and by 'Mareshah' in 2 Chr. 14:9. The town if 'Mu'rasti' is mentioned in el-Amarna 335. The testimony of Eusebius and other ancient authorities has led many scholars to identify Moresheth-gath with the modern Tell el-]udeida or with other sites in the southern Shephelah. In all if the above-cited sources, however, the site is mentioned in connection with Gath, presumably the well-known Philistine city. The recently excavated site if Tel Harassim, approximately five kilometres to the northwest if Tell es-Safi/Gath, would seem to be the best candidate to date for identification with Moresheth-gath.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersA Historical Geography of the Administrative Division of Judah, Bar Ilan University (Dissertation)2017 • Chris McKinnyIn this study, I have endeavored to provide a date for the town lists of Judah and Benjamin, which are recorded in Joshua 15:21-62 and 18:21-28. In connection with this, I have examined and offered a possible candidate for each of the sites mentioned in the town lists. I have attempted to include all of the available, relevant archaeological data for each of the toponyms and regions under discussion with the purpose of determining the overall date of the presumed town register list/administrative division that lies behind the town lists. From a historical perspective and following Alt’s original suggestion (1925), it would seem logical to conclude that these town lists are reflective of an administrative division of the kingdom of Judah dating to a period later than the Solomonic administrative division in the 10th century BCE/early Iron IIA (1 Kgs 4:8-19). Likewise, the available archaeological material of Judah would seem to make it very clear that the extant town lists for Judah and Benjamin should be dated to the Iron II, as less than half of the sites mentioned in the detailed town lists possess remains from the Late Bronze and/or Iron I. Since Alt, the dating of the town lists of Judah and Benjamin has been heavily debated with opinions ranging throughout the Iron II and Persian periods, including the 9th century BCE/Jehoshaphat (e.g., Cross and Wright), 8th century BCE/Uzziah (Aharoni), early 7th century BCE/Manasseh (Barkay), late 7th century BCE/Josiah (Alt and Na’aman), and late 6th-5th century/Persian period (de Vos). The question of the overall date of the list is also related to the current form of the division as reflected in Joshua 15:21-62 and 18:21-28 and the presumed underlying administrative source from which this text seems to have been derived. This form or system clearly included a separation of distinct regions (i.e., Negeb, Shephelah, hill country, Wilderness, and Benjamin) and districts or sub-districts within these regions. The purpose of the administrative division seems to have been related to both taxation, as reflected especially in the Arad Ostraca, and perhaps military organization, as has been suggested in the presumed four- fold division of the LMLK seal impressions. Barkay has suggested that there is a connection the administrative division and a series of early 7th century BCE fiscal bulla that include a number of towns appearing in the town lists (2011). This evidence would seem to establish the terminus post quem of the administrative division. In light of this and the numerous compelling arguments of Na’aman (e.g., 1991, 2005), I acknowledge the possibility that the town lists of Judah and Benjamin may be reflective of the 7th century BCE. Despite this, in incorporating archaeological studies that were unavailable to past researchers, I conclude that the settlement pattern of 9th century BCE Judah largely matches the settlement pattern in the town lists, as noted especially in the regions of the Negeb (including the Negeb Highlands), Shephelah and southern hill country. Subsequently, and while it cannot be stated with certainty, the 9th century BCE may also be the period of the original compilation of the administrative town register list behind the Judah and Benjamin town lists of Joshua 15:21-62 and 18:21-28.Download Free PDFView PDFTell it in Gath Essays in Honor of Aren M.

The latter motif is not well understood due to the obscurity of the place names found in vv. 10a-12b. A careful study of the oracle’s geographical context, however, will lead to a more precise understanding of the topography of vv. 10-12b andserve as the basis for the identification of one of the more enigmatic place names, Bethle-aphrah (v. 10b), with the archaeological site of Tell el-‘Areini.Download Free PDFView PDFNear Eastern Archaeology Gath of the Philistines in the Bible and on the Ground: The Historical Geography of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath2017 • Yigal LevinIn: Near Eastern Archaeology 80/4 (2017), 232-240, which is the first of two issues that focus on the Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath archaeological project, guest edited by Aren M.

Archaeologically, the site is of noteworthy importance in the study of the Bronze and Iron Age of the Levant, and in particular in relationship to the Canaanite, Philistine and Israelite cultures. Since 1996, a long-term international project has been studying the cultural and environmental history of the site and its surroundings. The volume, edited by Aren Maeir, is the first of a planned series of final reports on the project and deals primarily with the results of the 1996 through 2005 seasons. Discussions include a general overview of the project up to 2010, and studies on the geography and the environment, the written sources relating to the differ- ent periods, the history of research, the architecture and stratigraphy of the various excavation areas, and assorted finds of various classes (such as pottery, stone and bone objects, glyptic, inscriptions, and ancient fauna and flora). In addition, there are studies on pottery provenience, the archaeological surface survey, ground penetrating radar results, data mining of pottery finds, and a general overview of the Early Bronze Age of the Judean Foothills (Shephelah). This chapter discusses the references to Gath in the biblical text, as seen in their hostorcal and archaeological context.Download Free PDFView PDFHezekiah's Fortified Cities and the LMLK Stamps, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 261 (1986), pp. 5-21.Nadav Na'amanDownload Free PDFView PDF"The Royal City of the Philistines" in the "Azekah Inscription" and the History of Gath in the Eighth Century BCE 2008 • Itzick ShaiDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Tabula Peutingeriana - Its Roadmap to Borderland Settlements in Iudaea-Palestina, with Special Reference to Tel Zayit in the Late Roman PeriodRon TappyDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Socioeconomic Impact of Hezekiah's Preparations for RebellionKyle KeimerDownload Free PDFView PDFSennacherib's Campaign to Judah and the Date of the LMLK Stamps, Vetus Testamentum 29 (1979), pp. 61-86.Nadav Na'amanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
