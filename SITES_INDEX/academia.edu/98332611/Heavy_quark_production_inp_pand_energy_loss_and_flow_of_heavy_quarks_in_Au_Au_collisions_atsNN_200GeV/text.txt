Contributions from photon conversions and from light hadron decays, mainly Dalitz decays of pi^0 and eta mesons, were removed. The resulting non-photonic electron spectra are primarily due to the semi-leptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy quarks. Nuclear modification factors were determined by comparison to non-photonic electrons in p+p collisions. A significant suppression of electrons at high p_T is observed in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review LettersEnergy Loss and Flow of Heavy Quarks in Au+Au Collisions at sNN=200  GeV2007 • vivek singhThe PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured electrons from heavy flavor (charm and bottom) decays for 0.3 < p_T < 9 GeV/c at midrapidity (|y| < 0.35) in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The nuclear modification factor R_AA relative to p+p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC. A large azimuthal anisotropy, v_2, with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5 < p_T < 5 GeV/c indicating non-zero heavy flavor elliptic flow. Both R_AA and v_2 show a p_T dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe R_AA(p_T) and v_2(p_T) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, i.e., near a perfect fluid.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review LettersNuclear Modification of Electron Spectra and Implications for Heavy Quark Energy Loss in Au+Au Collisions at sNN=200 GeV2006 • N.

We also report the nuclear modification factor calculation in &lt;em&gt;d+Au&lt;/em&gt; for heavy flavor using the heavy flavor single electron yield for &lt;em&gt;d+Au&lt;/em&gt; at √sNN = 200 GeV which is calculated from both converter analysis and cocktail subtraction method.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CSingle electron yields from semileptonic charm and bottom hadron decays inAu+Aucollisions atsNN=200GeV2016 • Tamás CsörgőDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review LettersEnergy Loss and Flow of Heavy Quarks in Au+ Au Collisions at sqrt [s_ {NN}]= 200 …T.
