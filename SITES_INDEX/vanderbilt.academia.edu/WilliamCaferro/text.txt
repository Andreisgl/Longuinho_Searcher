It traces the activities of public offfĳ icials whose stated jobs (bell-ringer, accountant) suggest that they had little to do with the administration of warfare, but who in fact played major roles that reveal surprising and hitherto unknown institutional continuities. Given the frequency of warfare during the period, the evidence makes clear the need for additional research and a reevaluation of the Florentine bureaucracy that takes greater and more nuanced account of the efffects of warfare.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper argues that rather than "failed proto-nationalistic" military associations, as they have long been understood, the leagues expose critical and otherwise unavailable evidence about the military, economic, and political organization of Florence and Italy. They provide insight into the comparative economic strength of Italian states during times of plague, for which data are otherwise scarce, and they reveal the "corporate" nature of Florentine diplomatic and military affairs-a "martial corporatism" that mirrors the well-known internal corporatism of the city long highlighted by scholars.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It traces the formation of the historical construct and the influence of Werner Sombart's Der moderne Kapitalismus, a work much neglected nowadays in the Anglophone academy. The article seeks to historicize and contextualize faith and economy, to stress their fundamentally intertwined nature and more specifically how notions of "negotiation" and diriturra (moral Christian rectitude) connect the seemingly antagonistic sides, and connect also Florentine finance and business history, which are too often studied independently. It argues that Christian rectitude and service to the church (a noncynical quid pro quo) were conjoined with a calculated, reasoned profit motive-evident especially among papal bankers, a key sector of the Florentine economy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Il presente volume raccoglie, su questa base documentaria, nove saggi di altrettanti studiosi del periodo bassomedievale chiamati a misurarsi con una così straordinaria fonte storica ognuno nel suo specifico ambito di competenze. In primo luogo si approfondisce la figura, l'attività professionale e la carriera politica del notaio fiesolano immigrato a Firenze, comparandole con quanto noto alla ricerca sui temi del notariato medievale e della diplomazia in età comunale. Inoltre i rapporti professionali intessuti da ser Matteo con una variegata clientela cittadina offrono prezioso materiale per aprire una finestra sul mondo del lavoro: vengono così alla ribalta l'azione internazionale delle grandi compagnie mercantili, l'operosità delle botteghe artigiane e le problematiche dell'apprendistato, l'estrazione della pietra serena alle cave fiesolane, infine l'ambiente dei pittori fiorentini anche meno noti dell'età di Dante. € 20,00 LA FIRENZE DI DANTE NEGLI ATTI DI UN NOTAIO editpressSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
