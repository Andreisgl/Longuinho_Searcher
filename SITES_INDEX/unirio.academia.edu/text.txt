The study aimed to improve knowledge about the biodiversity and ecology of foraminifera in confined hypersaline environments and to assess the quality status of this ecosystem. The results revealed that foraminiferal assemblages were dominated by miliolids, mainly Quinqueloculina seminula, and Ammonia tepida (Rotalioidea). This assemblage was different from those usually reported in hypersaline lagoons with bottoms consisting of carbonate sand–rich sediments. Salt production in this lagoon produces hypertrophic conditions in the sediment, which has a severe impact on the foraminiferal community. The distribution of miliolid species is related to organic matter mainly associated to higher concentrations of carbohydrates. The rotaliids Haynesina concentrica, Bolivina variabilis, and Rosalina floridana were positively related to protein and lipid concentrations. The species Massilina protea, A. tepida, and Bolivina striatula were related to high salinity, while Miliolinella subrotunda presents a negative relationship to this variable. Based on the distribution of foraminiferal species and their responses to the analyzed environmental variables, five regions with different ecological characteristics and sediment trophic states were identified. Among these, the central pond can be considered the most favorable environment. The western pond and the vicinity area of stromatolite field in the eastern pond, with a high concentration of lipids and proteins, were the least favorable region due to eutrophication status.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Can benthic foraminifera be used as bio-indicators of pollution in areas with a wide range of physicochemical variability?Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science,  2016Abstract The Ria de Aveiro, a lagoon located in the NW coast of Portugal, presents a wide range o... more Abstract The Ria de Aveiro, a lagoon located in the NW coast of Portugal, presents a wide range of changes to the natural hydrodynamical and physicochemical conditions induced for instance by works of port engineering and pollution. In order to evaluate the response of living benthic foraminifera to the fluctuations in physicochemical parameters and pollution (metals and TOC), eight sediment samples were collected from canals and salt pans within the Aveiro City, in four different sampling events. During the sampling events, salinity showed the most significant fluctuations among the physicochemical parameters with the maximum range of variation at Troncalhada and Santiago salt pans. Species such as Haynesina germanica, Trochammina inflata and Entzia macrescens were found inhabiting these hypersaline environments with the widest fluctuations of physicochemical parameters. In contrast, Ammonia tepida dominated zones with high concentrations of metals and organic matter and in lower salinity waters. Parameters related to benthic foraminiferal assemblages (i.e., diversity and evenness) were found to significantly decline in stations polluted by metals and characterized by higher TOC content. Foraminiferal density reduced significantly in locations with a wide range of physicochemical temporal variability. This work shows that, even under extreme conditions caused by highly variable physicochemical parameters, benthic foraminiferal assemblages might be used as valuable bioindicators of environmental stress.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Benthic prey exceeded the planktonic ones as expected and Foraminifera constituted the most frequent prey taxa, comprising about 99.5% of the scaphopod diet; the remaining components included a few molluscs (gastropods, bivalves and scaphopods), a nematode, an ostracod crustacean, fish otoliths, unknown partial organisms and inorganic material (e.g. sediment grains and polymetallic nodules). Amongst the species previously studied, F. candidum stood out by presenting the highest dietary diversity (H = 3.35) and species richness (N = 118).

Benthic Foraminiferal Response to Trace Elements in a Tropical Mesotidal Brazilian EstuaryLiving benthic foraminifera have been widely used as ecological indicators in coastal ecosystems.... more Living benthic foraminifera have been widely used as ecological indicators in coastal ecosystems. There is, however, a lack of studies on their response to trace element pollution in tropical estuarine systems. Here we analyze the living assemblages of benthic foraminifera, collected in 2016, in the Cachoeira River Estuary (CRE) in northeastern Brazil, to understand their response to natural and anthropogenic stressors, including trace element pollution. Some species were good bioindicators of specific environmental conditions, such as the agglutinant Paratrochammina clossi which preferred mangrove areas and anoxic conditions. In addition, the calcareous Ammonia tepida and Cribroelphidium excavatum, dominant within the whole system disregarding organic or trace element pollution, seem to resist even in the areas most polluted by trace elements. Interestingly, C. excavatum showed a particular positive relationship with trace element pollution (specifically by Cu and Pb), outnumbering the opportunistic A. tepida in the areas with higher pollution of these metals. However, for other species, it is still difficult to constrain to which parameters they respond (i.e., Haynesina germanica and Elphidium gunteri, which in the present study seem to respond to natural conditions, whereas in the literature they are regarded as indicators of trace element and organic pollution, respectively). Therefore, our findings shed light on the response of benthic foraminiferal species in a highly polluted and highly mixed tropical estuarine system and highlight the need to understand the complexity of these environments when applying foraminiferal biological indexes to avoid imprecise conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We analyzed 116 samples of bottom sediments collected along the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro. The sediments were subjected to grain-size, geochemical and mineralogical analyses. Furthermore, some environmental parameters were measured in water and sediment at each site. The elemental concentrations (analysed by ICP-MS) were assessed by total digestion of the sediments (with four acids) and by sequential chemical extraction for the Hg. This research highlighted that hydrodynamism controls the grain size and the composition of sediments. As consequence, in areas where the currents activity is low, fine sediments enriched in organic matter and phyllosilicates are deposited and many chemical elements are retained. The enrichment factor (EF) of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn and the pollution load index (PLI) allowed the identification of “hot spots” of contamination in this system. These are located mainly in the inner zone of Murtosa Channel, the Port of Salreu, at the northern end of the Ovar Channel, the canals of Aveiro town, in Espinheiro Channel and also in harbor areas located near the mouth of the lagoon. This enrichment is associated to anthropogenic activity around the lagoon and is introduced essentially through the contribution of rivers and water courses. The comparison of our data with the established Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), developed by the NOAA, U.S., for evaluating the quality of the sediment allowed the identification of locals where concentrations of metals may have toxic effects on benthic organisms. This is the case for example of the internal zone of the Murtosa Channel, namely Laranjo Bay and adjacent small channels, in which the levels of contaminants (Zn, Pb, As, Hg, Cu, Cd and Ni) can cause toxic effects on living organisms with the possibility of bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food chains including man, with risks of public health.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The geochemical analyses included stable isotopes in sedimentary bulk organic matter (orgδ13C), total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS) and Rock Eval pyrolysis parameters, such as free hydrocarbons (S1), generating source potential (S2), production index (PI), oxygen and hydrogen indices (OI, HI) and the maturation index of organic matter (Tmax). The analyzed data were statistically treated to ﬁnd main factors that are influencing the sedimentary composition. The low activity of the bottom currents favors the deposition of fine-grained sediments, rich in organic matter, in most of the studied area. The organic matter present in the sediments is being supplied by local and allochthonous sources and can be considered a good source of type III kerogen, and therefore has the potential to gene...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify diatom assemblages from Vermelha Lagoon associated with environmental parameters in order to establish environmental quality bioindicators for hypersaline environments. Species distribution displayed a weak relationship with environmental parameters analyzed in DCA analyses. The cluster analyses evidenced the presence of four diatom groups in the lagoon: Group I - located on the south margin of the lagoon, represented by N. arenaria; Group II - located in the north, the central sector and near the communication channel with Araruama Lagoon, dominated by F. interposita. The Group III - distributed in the shallowest regions, where primary productivity is high. Species H. acutiuscula and C. placentula in this group reached high relative abundance values. Group IV is characterized by increased salinity and lipids values, characterizing hypertrophic sediment conditions. These stations were located in the Saltpan water catchment and were characterized by a decreased number of species and the dominance of A. robusta.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The core chronology is based upon the data attributes for 210Pb, 137Cs and a 14C dating from a level near the core base. Geochemical, granulometric, microfaunal (benthic foraminifera) and compositional data suggest the occurrence of precipitation changes which may have been, at least partially, influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), that contributes to the regulation of the ocean–atmosphere dynamics in the North Atlantic.Southwesterly Atlantic storm track is associated with the negative phases of the NAO, when the Azores High is anomalously weak, higher oceanographic hydrodynamism, downwelling events and increased rainfall generally occurs. Prevalence of these characteristics during the LIA left a record that corresponds to phases of major floods. During these phases the DMP received a higher contribution of relatively coarse-grained terrigenous sediments, enriched in quartz particles, which diluted the contribution of other minerals, as indicated by reduced concentrations of several lithogenic chemical elements such as: Al, As, Ba, Ce, Co, Cu, Fe, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Rb, Sc, Sn, Th, V and Y. The presence of biogenic carbonate particles also underwent dilution, as revealed by the smaller abundance of foraminifera and correlative lower concentrations of Ca and Sr. During this period, the DMP also received an increased contribution of organic matter, indicated by higher values of lignin remains and a benthic foraminifera high productivity index, or BFHP, which gave rise to early diagenetic changes with pyrite formation. Since the beginning of the 20th century this contribution diminished, probably due to several drier periods and the impact of human activities in the river basins, e.g. construction of dams, or, on the littoral areas, construction of hard-engineering structures and sand extraction activities.During the first half of the 20th century mainly positive phases of the NAO prevailed, caused by the above normal strengthening of the subtropical high pressure centre of the Azores and the deepening of the low pressure centre in Iceland. These phases may have contributed to the reduction in the supply of both terrigenous sediments and organic matter from shallow water to the DMP. During the positive phases of the NAO, sedimentation became finer.The development of mining and industrial activities during the 20th century is marked, in this core, by higher concentrations of Pb. Furthermore, the erosion of heaps resulting from wolfram exploitation leaves its signature as a peak of W concentrations recorded in the sediments of the DMP deposited between the 1960s and the 1990s. Wolfram exploitation was an important activity in the middle part of the 20th century, particularly during the period of the Second World War.► Sedimentary Processes on the NW Iberian Continental Shelf. ► Occurrence of precipitation changes linked with North Atlantic Oscillation since Little Ice Age. ► Anthropic influence since the Industrial Revolution. ► Early diagenetic changes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
