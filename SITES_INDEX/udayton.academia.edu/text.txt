The culture&#39;s contemporary horizons of opportunity grew out of the massive, early-19 th century shift from peasant to proletarian economies and lifestyles. Later on, during the Progressive Era, opportunity became wedded to the ethic of consumerism, as well as the meritocratic hierarchies of the corporation, by then the pre-eminent institution of the land. However, another brand of opportunity, deep within our cultural history, entailed the democratization of intelligence and the achievement of a classless society. This alternative vision suggests forms of resistance and reconstruction, perhaps already going on amongst us, that might strengthen the democratic character of our schools and larger modes of associated living.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Such notions grew out of the massive, early-19th century shift from peasant to proletarian economies and lifestyles, meanwhile assuming distinctly bourgeois-whiggish horizons under the guidance of reformers such as Horace Mann. During the Progressive Era, &quot;opportunity&quot; became wedded to the &quot;meritocratic&quot; hierarchies of the corporation, by then the pre-eminent institution of the land. The paper next looks at the sorts of character and performance criteria rewarded and cultivated by our institutions, and ends by suggesting forms of resistance and reconstruction that might strengthen the democratic character of our schools and larger modes of associated living.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
