This unorthodox representation is achieved through Mansfield's use of modernist literary techniques such as the epiphanic moment and free indirect discourse in the short story form. Marginal figures live on the sidelines, decentred and 'othered'. Nicola Allen explains the margins from which they originate thus: '"the margin" refers to a space occupied and peopled by communities who live on the fringes of society and describes those who are not permitted for some reason to express their authentic voice within mainstream discourse'. Taking this definition further, the marginal can be aligned with any persons perceived to be in an oppositional position to mainstream culture (in the West this would be patriarchal culture). Thus women, and in particular middle-aged women, fit into the definition of the marginal as they are not fully represented...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Concept of Bergsonian Time in Mansfield's 'Miss Brill'UFUK OZEN BAYKENTKatherine Mansfield is a well-known writer in short fiction genre in English. Miss Brill is one of her most widely discussed stories which explores the concepts of alienation, loneliness, isolation and consciousness through the characterization of the protagonist. Like those of many modernist writers, Mansfield's literary style was influenced by Henri Bergson whose philosophy is grounded on the concept of time. Both the form and content of her stories are reflections of Bergsonian time. Specifically, this study deals with Mansfield's story entitled Miss Brill and analyses it in terms of the concept of duration as proposed by Bergson.Download Free PDFView PDFAffect in Katherine Mansfield Short FictionsAnne BesnaultDownload Free PDFView PDFVeiling and Unveiling: Mansfield’s modernist aestheticsJanet M WilsonVeiling and unveiling: Mansfield’s modernist aesthetics of impersonality The wearing of a veil like other items of external apparel in Mansfield fiction-- parasols, hats and gloves, hair ribbons -- usually serves more than mere decoration, protection or fashion. Such accoutrements function symbolically to represent an intangible emotion or feeling, but can also be read as a form of disguise. More generally veils that create a filmic layer between the viewer and the external world, hint a disturbance in the field of vision and a different mode of seeing. Often this signals the necessary artifice that belongs to the craft of fiction-making and is associated with illusion, deceit and story-telling. In stories and sketches like ‘Dark Hollow’, ‘The Escape’ and the late, incomplete story ‘Taking the Veil’, Mansfield reworks the veil motif as an emblem of self impersonation and impersonality. Yet the act of metaphorically lifting the veil or curtain to reveal a greater reality or truth also became central to the aesthetic principle of ‘the glimpse’ and the author’s power to veil and unveil, as in Murry’s view of her art as offering ‘those glimpses of reality that in themselves possess a peculiar vividness’, and as stated in her own wish ‘to lift that mist from my people and let them be seen and then hide them again’. This paper examines how the veil imagery in several of Mansfield’s stories becomes a significant motif in her modernist aesthetics with which she registers problems of sight and vision in relation to representation. As before, sight and vision can here be seen to call on temporality, (even if/especially if it is evanescent) for their effect, just as length of ‘exposure’ in film effects the final quality of the reproduction.Download Free PDFView PDFWhat it’s like to be Miss Brill?2017 • Karam NayebpourKatherine Mansfield’s “Miss Brill” is an exploration of the central character’s mental functioning. In other words, Mansfield presents the impact of narrative events and situations on Miss Brill’s mind by focalising the narrative through her perspective. Accordingly, readers can immediately follow the operation of Miss Brill’s experiencing mind, and hence get closely engaged in the unfolding process of her narrative. When it is read by the terminology of cognitive narratology, “Miss Brill” shows some narrative qualities which are considered as the constituent elements of narrativity or what makes a narrative (interpretable as) narrative. Cognitive narartologist David Herman’s concept ‘what it’s like’, or ‘qualia’ aspect as a basic narrative element, helps us to analyse both the constructive and disruptive impact of external events and situations on Miss Brill’s mind. Herman’s concept can also help us to explain our sympathetic concern for Miss Brill. As a result of its textual qualities, Mansfield’s narrative creates a sympathetic bond between the emotions of its protagonist and those of the narrative reader.Download Free PDFView PDF‘A cycle of dislocation: Katherine Mansfield, modernism, and proto-postcolonialism’, in Constructing Coherence in the Contemporary British Short Story Cycle, eds Florian Kläger and Patrick Gill (London: Routledge, 2018), pp. 104-24. ISBN 9781138503885Gerri  KimberMy chapter examines the New Zealand-born modernist Katherine Mansfield’s early short stories, which demonstrate a strong colonial bias. In particular, her stories for the avant-garde little magazine Rhythm, display a marked leaning towards an exposé of the harsh realities of colonial life. Overlooked until recently, these stories represent a markedly different cycle from her later work. It was only with the publication of the Edinburgh edition of Mansfield’s complete fiction in 2012, that it was possible to see just how much her early work also reveals a strong Māori influence, both in characterization and theme. In such stories, Mansfield’s sense of place, of her roots in her native New Zealand, is striking, revealing her search for the authentic, in a European world where she increasingly felt herself isolated and ‘false’. Thus, this chapter will examine Mansfield’s early short stories, not only in relation to modernism, but, more importantly, in the context of proto-postcolonialism, where cosmopolitanism takes second place to the underdeveloped periphery. Mansfield’s stories in this category can thus be read as a hitherto overlooked important and groundbreaking cycle within her overall oeuvre.Download Free PDFView PDFThe unresolved, open form and its females: an exploration of the short stories of Katherine Mansfield.Eleri Anona WatsonHighly Commended at Undergraduate Awards 2013. Second year undergraduate essay. Tutor: Prof Timothy Clarke. In her modernist short fiction, Katherine Mansfield explores Virginia Woolf’s notion that “women and fiction remain, so far as I am concerned, unsolved problems” . Formulating a general world-view of the female, Mansfield reveals the suffering of the female’s unresolved issues of division between the rational and the physical. They do not engage in subjective experience and seem to have ‘forgotten themselves’ . Their inner thoughts are dictated by an external figure through the author’s free indirect discourse. These women, their outer selves in conflict with their inner desires, seem to perform the role of the female whilst an external narrator dictates their movements in directorial fashion. Mansfield’s women seek to both overthrow and become independent from the male. Such desire is manifested in intersexual symbolism expressing female desire to possess both male and female reproductive organs. However, not possessing the traditional male capacity of active knowledge and action, such individuals dwell submissively in the constrained space of the distilled form of the short story. They passively accept the world, its injustices and its symbols. Their condition remains unchanged and the female reaches no epiphanic conclusion.Download Free PDFView PDFLANGUAGE LITERATURE AND CULTURE ABSTRACTS & PROCEEDINGSMustafa Zeki CirakliDownload Free PDFView PDFBloomsbury: Inspirations and Influences‘To Hell with the Blooms Berries’:  Katherine Mansfield in Mansfield and the poetry of C. K. Stead2014 • Gerri  KimberThis essay considers the character of Katherine Mansfield as portrayed in the novel Mansfield by C. K. Stead (2004), together with her influence on Stead’s poetry. In 1972, Stead was the third recipient of the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Fellowship at Menton, which enabled him to spend eight months in the South of France, working at the Villa Isola Bella, once the home of Mansfield. During this visit, Stead took the opportunity of re-reading all of the Mansfield primary texts published at that time, which led directly to the publication some years later of his Letters and Journals of Katherine Mansfield: A Selection (1977). This immersion in ‘all things Mansfield’ initiated Stead’s fascination with KM, which would ultimately lead to the writing of Mansfield. Stead set Mansfield during three years from 1915-1918, a fascinating period in Mansfield’s life when she found her true voice as an author, was still in “reasonably good health”, and which was, as he points out, was “the time of her most intense engagement with an extraordinary cast of characters on the English literary scene”, including the Lawrences and the Bloomsbury group. It was also the period of the Great War, which would profoundly affect and influence the lives of Mansfield and her contemporaries. The essay also considers two poems by Stead, ‘Jealousy 1’ and ‘Jealousy 2’, based on two real life incidents between Mansfield, T. S. and Vivienne Eliot, and Virginia Woolf.Download Free PDFView PDF‘A child of the sun’: Katherine Mansfield, Orientalism and GurdjieffGerri  KimberThere was a particular strand to her spirituality which manifested itself both in Katherine Mansfield’s personal life as well as her creative endeavours, and that was her deep fascination with the Orient and its traditions, and especially the tea ceremony. I shall show how this eventually linked up with her attraction to P. D. Ouspensky and Gurdjieff and the theosophical philosophies expounded in the book Cosmic Anatomy, which would go on to have such a deep effect on her at a critical time in her life. Thus, this essay will explore Mansfield’s spiritual development, culminating in her decision to enter Gurdjieff’s ‘Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man’ near Paris in the autumn of 1922, together with her desire as she expressed it at the end of her life: ‘I want to be all that I am capable of becoming so that I may be – [...] a child of the sun’Download Free PDFView PDF‘Major to Minor: Critical (Mis)Interpretation in the Fiction of Katherine Mansfield’, 2001 Group: Essays in French Studies, 3, (September 2007), ISSN 1749–3307.Gerri  KimberThe 'Decadent Era' in France, spanning the period between the Commune of 1871 and the Great War, has come to represent a specific literary period, out of whose complexities was to emerge much of twentieth century European Modernism. Literary turmoil and innovation were intertwined with political and social upheaval. The term fin-de-siècle can claim a looser time scale than one would imagine; for Bernard Bergonzi it, 'clearly points to the preoccupations of the last years of the nineteenth century, without being limited to a single decade, and which can cover such particular manifestations as 'aestheticism' and 'decadence'. He goes on to state: In so far as fin de siècle refers to a serious and consistent cultural attitude, it has two essential characteristics: the conviction that all established forms of intellectual and moral and social certainty were vanishing, and that the new situation required new attitudes in life and art (p. 19). This literary climate of innovation allowed experimental writers like Katherine Mansfield, one of the main innovators of the Modernist short story, to flourish. Yet Mansfield's own unique form of Modernism was not derivative of other contemporary writers. This paper demonstrates how her Modernism was, in fact, partly a product of her early symbiosis of specifically French late-nineteenth-century techniques and themes.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
