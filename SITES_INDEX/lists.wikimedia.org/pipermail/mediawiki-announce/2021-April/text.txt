[MediaWiki-announce] Maintenance release: 1.31.14

The 1.31.14 version fixes an issue with the backports in the 1.31.13
release.
The patches linked here need applying on top of the previous patches for
1.31.12. See the previous email for those patches. The full downloads here
contain all the previous fixes from the security and maintenance release.
Once again, I apologise for the inconvenience of the issues with the
previous release. Going forward, we're going to be looking to run more
testing on the tarballs (in this case, static analysis via Phan) to
hopefully prevent these issues in future.
