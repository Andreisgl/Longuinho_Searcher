She's not the experienced Irish maid who was hired to work in one of Pittsburgh's grandest households. She's a poor farmer's daughter with nowhere to go and nothing in her pockets. But the woman who shares her name has vanished, and assuming her identity just might get Clara some money to send back home.Clara must rely on resolve as strong as the steel Pittsburgh is becoming famous for and an uncanny understanding of business, attributes that quickly gain her Carnegie's trust. But she still can't let her guard down, not even when Andrew becomes something more than an employer. Revealing her past might ruin her future—and her family's.With captivating insight and heart, Carnegie's Maid is a book of fascinating 19th century historical fiction. Discover the story of one brilliant woman who may have spurred Andrew Carnegie's transformation from ruthless industrialist to the world's first true philanthropist.Other Bestselling Historical

Clara needs a job as soon as her feet hit the pavement in this strange land called America. Leaving her poor Irish family, she is responsible for finding a position and sending money home. By accident, she finds a job as the personal maid to Andrew's Mother.Much of the story focuses on the new rich who want to succeed and know all the social mores of those who made much money before them, and the class system of the new rich and the poor who scramble to find decent employment. Many who arrived in the mid-late 1800's were poverty stricken, looking for a new opportunity, only to find hard labor that paid barely enough to eek out a living.Clara is intelligent and Andrew Carnegie is draw to her. Theirs is a forbidden friendship.Read morePetrus Alexander SmithRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I was addicted to this book and is a favouriteRead moreRachel MundyRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Dissatisfied with the ending is an understatement, but it was a good read to pass the time  Read moreKathryn F ZachartziRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Very enjoyable reading in a most credible story that was skillfully created between fact and fiction.Read moresmits_52Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5This novel explores the idea that Andrew Carnegie’s philanthropy was inspired by his relationship with his mother’s ladies maid. Clara immigrated from Ireland to Pittsburg as the hope for her families future. She fakes her way into the job of ladies maid to Carnegie’s mother. An interesting part of this novel is the detail of what a ladies maid did. Very interesting. Clara learns business from Carnegie and soon begins to give business advice.

As she learns to be a ladies' maid, she also becomes close to Mr. Carnegie and slowly begins to have feelings for him and he for her. When her secret is discovered, she must leave without saying goodbye and forever leave Andre behind. This is another wonderful book by Benedict. While she normally chooses women forgotten to history this was not the case rather the setting was the story. Marie Benedict said her love of libraries and all they offer that helped her come up with the premise of this novel. I have yet to come across a Marie Benedict novel in that I do not find myself fully immersed in the story and walked away satisfied.Read moreknittinkittiesRating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5This book felt incredibly unrealistic and poorly written. It was as if the author wanted to prove to readers that she did her research--she would have the story move along and then insert historic facts and stories that didn't feel genuine to the story and would separate the reader from it. The author kept referring to the Civil War as that very name when it wasn't called that till the beginning of the twentieth century. The author had characters talk about historic events as if they were reading from a contemporary history book and I found that so very jarring.Read morekaulsuRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Enjoyable historic fiction. Benedict wrote such a plausible tale, I had to stop 3/4 of the way through to look up Carnegie in Wikipanion. In these days of massive numbers of immigrants walking up from South America, through Central America, and then through North American Mexico, this book reminds us that Immigrants have always had to brave untold horrors. Some lived in squalor, some found a way to excel.Read morejenniferelizabeth2Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Excellent storytelling and a great story...but the language felt overly simplistic and unengaging.

Not the typical historical fiction I have read in the past.  The maid, Clara, is the personal maid to the mother of Andrew Carnegie.  She is the fiction.  Andrew is the historical part.  The book tells of his rise through the eyes of Clara, who falls in love with him.  Andrew, likewise, loves her and because of her intelligence and sensibility, he changes from a man determined to reach the highest rungs of society, to a man who realized the importance of raising up those who have less then he attained.  Carnegie was born poor and became a self-made man who himself needed a helping hand.  Clara didn't let him forget that and it was she who inspired his philanthropy through the years, especially the free libraries that he established all over the world.  In the novel, Andrew's mother casts Clara out of her house and warns her to stay away from Andrew so that's where their story ended.  Benedict did a lovely job of flushing out the personalities and it made me wish it were a true story.Read more1 person found this helpfulbell7_1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Clara Kelley arrives in America from Galway, hoping to secure a job and help her family back in Ireland who has so far managed to keep a large tenancy and not be decimated by the Irish potato famine. When a chance encounter gives her the opportunity, she takes a position as ladies' maid to the mother of Andrew Carnegie.Told in diary format, this historical novel uses a fictional maid to explore what might have made Andrew Carnegie, himself a recent immigrant and self-made man, not just a ruthless businessman but also a philanthropist. Diary format is tough to pull off, and I didn't think it worked well for the story, often skipping several months or ending an entry with a question or cliffhanger that wouldn't at all be how one would write an account in a diary. A good readalike for fans of The Daring Ladies of Lowell, but like that title Carnegie's Maid was a bit too light on historical fiction and heavy on relationships for me, personally.Read morehemlokgangRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5This might be called fantasy fiction.  It is the untrue story of Andrew Carnegie's transition from obsessed capitalist to morality driven philanthropist.  Set aside any desire for truth, and it is a sweet love story, the classic master and servant, with a twist.  An enjoyable read.Read moreamillion-863749Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5I admire Andrew Carnegie's dedication to creating public libraries around the country. These are some of the most beautiful buildings in even small town America. This was a fun, though fictional, easily readable account of why Carnegie may have developed the dedication to making knowledge and books accessible to everyone - rather than just the wealthy. I'd like to know if more of the business manipulations that are described are true... guess there's more reading to be done. It also has an interesting backstory of the Irish immigrant experience in mid-1800s America.Read moreteachlzRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5My Review of “Carnegie’s Maid” by Marie BenedictI enjoyed reading “Carnegie’s Maid” by Marie Benedict. The Genres for this story are Historical Fiction and Fiction. I appreciate the way that Marie Benedict weaves the fictional and historical components of this story together, as in a marriage. The timeline for this story takes place in the 1860’s. The contrast between the have and have-nots, and the rich and poor is evident. The hardships on Immigrants as they entered the United States is shown, as well as the newly freed slaves and their problems.The author describes her characters as complicated and complex. Some are ambitious for power, and wealth. Others are ambitious to survive.  Clara Kelly, a young Irish immigrant arrives after a long dangerous voyage, where other immigrants died. A woman calls her name, and Clara Kelly answers, finally realizing that  it is another Clara Kelly the woman is seeking. Clara goes with her and finds herself in the employment of the prominent Carnegie family, and becomes Mrs. Carnegie’s personal maid. Clara sends whatever funds she has home to Ireland to her desperate family.Clara is fascinated by books, and meets Andrew Carnegie, who appreciates her literary tastes.  Andrew gets to look forward to discussing literature with Clara. The two are attracted to one another, but being from different classes, Clara is very cautious. As Clara sees how ruthless and successful Andrew can be in business, she becomes  aware of the people who have lost their jobs because of his financial dealings.Somehow, the author describes that Andrew Carnegie becoming a famous Philanthropist, paving the way for free libraries, and education,  from possibly Clara’s influence. I would recommend this novel  to readers of Historical Fiction. I received an Advanced Reading Copy for my honest review.Read more1 person found this helpfulwhitreidtanRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5If someone is rich, especially rich beyond all imagining, those of us who live on a budget often have many ideas about how they should spend their money. We condemn them for what we view as frivolous or extravagant spending, especially if it is noteworthy enough to be reported on publicly, and often pair that condemnation with a belief that that money could have been better spent on charity. Underlying that assumption is a value judgement that the wealthy person may or may not have earned. Some wealthy people give a lot to the charities of their choice. Some give little to nothing. Some give right from the moment they earn their first penny, while others amass a fortune before they start to give. Andrew Carnegie was one of the latter type. Known for his intelligence and sometimes ruthless business practices, he was fabulously wealthy before he started using his fortune philanthropically and no one knows what inspired his sudden generosity. In Marie Benedict's historical fiction novel Carnegie's Maid, Benedict has imagined the catalyst for this beneficence on Carnegie's part to be his love for the invented person of Irish immigrant and lady's maid Clara Kelley.Clara Kelley was sent to the US by her family in search of a job that would allow her to send money home to them, money that might help them save the family farm. She lands in Philadelphia and hopes to make her way to Pittsburgh, where she has family and will look for a job, when she impossibly hears a driver calling her name. He's actually calling for another Clara Kelley, who our Clara Kelley realizes quickly must have died on the boat over and so, without thinking, she assumes the dead woman's identity, lucking into a ride to Pittsburgh and a job as a lady's maid to Andrew Carnegie's mother, a job the farmer's daughter could never have hoped for in the regular scheme of things. As a lady's maid, she is immersed in the opulent house and furnishings, living amidst wealth unimagined. But when she visits her own family near the factories, she sees an entirely different side of the city, the struggle for survival, the grinding poverty unnoticed and unacknowledged by those in the upper echelons of society, the echelons the immigrant Carnegies are so interested in joining. She is bothered by the obvious disparity and the myriad social injustices but she cannot say anything, dependent as her family back in Ireland is on the money she sends home so she keeps her head down, learning her role as lady's maid, keeping track of Carnegie's vast holdings in an effort to understand how he gained his wealth, and using the library in the house to continue the education her quick brain demands. As she encounters Andrew Carnegie more and more often, he cannot miss her intelligence and a proper romance blooms. Will Clara allow her feelings for Carnegie to jeopardize her position and the support her family needs? Or will her loyalty to her family and the impossibility of the class differences win out?The novel opens with Carnegie drafting a document detailing his goals for using his wealth for the benefit of others rather than for himself as a way to honor the love and beliefs of his Clara before moving back in time to the story of Clara arriving in the US and going to work for the Carnegies. The entire plot here is predicated on something incredibly improbable: not only was there a dead woman with the heroine's same name who was headed to the same city Clara needs to go to but despite Clara's upbringing on a small farm with a mother who was once a lowly scullery maid, she's convincing enough to pretend to be a competent lady's maid until she learns how to actually perform her duties, so the story takes a pretty big suspension of disbelief from the reader right from the get go.  Clara also has a pretty immediate and unlikely understanding of certain legal business matters that she shouldn't have, no matter how smart she is. In spite of these coincidences and anomalies, it is interesting to see this lady's maid from the bottom of society spar with Andrew Carnegie, titan of industry, and their conversations serve to draw a fuller picture of his contradictory character. The strong emphasis on libraries and the advantage of having access to books for learning, the way Carnegie himself rose above his working class origins, was definitely interesting. There weren't many characters in the novel, and certainly few that were more than simply mentioned briefly, allowing the focus beyond Clara to be on Andrew Carnegie and his social climbing mother but also likely being historically accurate since lady's maids inhabited a lonely rung in the household structure. Carnegie was an intriguing character here; surprisingly Clara was less so, perhaps because she was rather less believable. Over all, this novel of ideas, a guess at the origin of Carnegie's philanthropy, was a fast, easy, and generally enjoyable read.Read moresiri51Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Plausible fiction about Andrew Carnegie developing a philanthropic attitude after amassing millions - all due to falling for his mother's maid ("it always ends badly for the servant").Read morebeckyhaaseRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5CARNEGIE”S MAID  by Marie BenedictAndrew Carnegie made an about face at some point in his life from a wealth and power obsessed businessman to one of the world’s biggest philanthropists. This book attempts to answer why and how that happened.  Although this is a light romance book, it also sheds light on one of the most important businessmen in this country’s early industrial age.  The glittering world of the VERY wealthy Carnegie’s is contrasted with the plight of the downtrodden working man slaving at hard labor for minimal wages as well as the equally hard working and often ignored servants who made the Cargenie’s life style possible. This is a quick read that offers food for thought in how people with power exert that power. Book groups can have a discussion that centers on the romance of upstairs/downstairs as well as on the power of wealth and social standing.4 of 5 starsRead morebirdo82Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5The added fictional character highlights rather than detracts from the book's historical accuracy, and this earnest work of historical romance benefits greatly from its lack of romance.Read moresetnahktRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Due to a mixup, impoverished Irish immigrant Clara Kelly is mistaken for another Clara Kelly and becomes the lady’s maid to Andrew Carnegie’s mother. (No spoilers here; it’s on the back cover). We’re expected to believe that Carnegie gradually falls in love with Clara, and that it was her influence that prompted his establishment of Carnegie libraries. Not really a romance novel; might influence someone to read more of the history of The Gilded Age in the US. A quick and easy read.Read morefoggidawnRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5When a case of mistaken identity leads Irish immigrant Clara Kelley to take a position as a lady's maid in the Carnegie household, she finds herself falling in love with the bachelor son of her employer -- none other than the famous businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.I find that I have problems with historical fiction that takes actual historical figures and makes up parts of their lives. It's strange: something like Hamilton is okay with me, though certainly Lin-Manuel Miranda took plenty of liberties with the historical facts there. And something like the Bloody Jack series is okay with me, because Jacky's encounters with actual historical figures are meant to be over-the-top, and Jacky herself is fictional. But this book irked me a bit. In addition to my issues with the historical shenanigans, I also thought that the writing was poor. The author did a lot of that trick where she shoehorns her research into the text, so that characters are telling each other things they already know in order to impart knowledge to the reader. I also thought it highly unlikely that Clara would be able to fake it 'till she made it as a lady's maid, having had no training. I mean, I'm pretty sure I couldn't accomplish the duties of an 1860's lady's maid if I were suddenly thrown back in time, and it's not like Clara's scullery maid mother could have trained her for the job. I grant that she found a book in the family library that helped her, but she seemed to be doing okay even before then, and I just don't buy it.That's not to say that the book wasn't enjoyable -- I did make it through the whole thing -- but I probably won't seek out other books by this author. I read this for book club, and I think most of us were pretty ambivalent on it.Read moreacargile-1Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I loved this novel, however, I was disappointed at the end to learn that the maid didn't really exist in real life.  I thought it was researched and true historical fiction.

She winds up as a lady’s maid to Mrs Carnegie, Andrew Carnegie’s mother, in the family’s Pittsburgh mansion.  Mrs Carnegie has a reputation for being an exacting mistress, and for showing dissatisfaction by firing her previous lady’s maids nearly on a whim.  Clara has to use her wits and education to keep this job in order to save her family from starvation, while trying her best to learn all she can so that she can better herself.  I was intrigued by the story and quickly caught up in the tale of this intelligent, resourceful, determined and diligent young lady.  I saw the potential relationship with Andrew Carnegie coming a mile off; no surprise, really as it’s pretty much revealed in the prologue.  But watching it unfold was still interesting to me, as was the resolution.  The Author’s Note at the end was very interesting as well, giving some clue as to the facts that sparked the idea behind the novel.  On the other hand, I did think it was rather repetitious.  How many times must Clara comment on her duty to her family?  On her need to “keep this job”?  On the lack of support / companionship / friendship between herself and the other house staff?   Alana Kerr Collins does a fine job narrating the audiobook.  She sets a good pace and I had no difficulty keeping the many characters straight.Read moreriofriotexRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Speculative historical fiction on why the 19th century multimillionaire Andrew Carnegie may have become a philanthropist.  Author Marie Benedict's Irish ancestors worked as domestics and used the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, and a similar mistaken identity story supposedly happened to one of her ancestors.  In research, Benedict used newspaper ads of immigrants searching for lost family who came before them, and was able to access materials and see areas where domestics lived and worked in the Frick Pittsburgh, "a perfectly preserved late nineteenth-century house museum of Andrew Carnegie's colleague Henry Clay Frick" (p. 280).  The book ranges from November 4, 1863 - the completely fictional Clara Kelley's arrival at the port in Philadelphia - to the prologue of December 23, 1868, when "at the age of thirty-three, he [Carnegie] wrote a letter to himself pledging to focus on the education and 'improvement of the poorer classes'" (p. 273), which supposedly his love and interactions with Clara inspired, according to this story.  The epilogue takes place October 14, 1900, when Clara, who has become a nurse, takes a young relative to the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh.Read morethewanderingjew_1Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Carnegie’s Maid, Marie Benedict, author; Alana Kerr Collins, narratorThis is the fictional story of Andrew Carnegie and Clara Kelley. When Clara disembarked from the ship taking her to America, as a stranger, with no one to meet her, she was shocked to hear her name called. She was further astounded to discover that there was an opportunity awaiting her as a lady’s maid, to Mrs. Margaret Carnegie, if she assumed the identity of another Clara Kelley, who had also been on board her ship. That poor young woman had died in an accident during the crossing. She shrewdly assumed the identity of that young woman, and although she had no experience or knowledge of the job being offered, and although she had no possessions except for her rucksack, she approached the well dressed stranger who was calling out her name. When he enquired about her luggage, she was quick witted and said it had been lost at sea. First and foremost, our Clara was loyal to her family and getting a job was paramount. She was in America to ensure their survival. So, from the outset, she was embroiled in a lie she had to perpetuate. It would eventually be her undoing, but her family’s salvation. The Carnegies, almost destitute, had come from Scotland to America. Andrew, a quick study, educated himself and had managed to keep his family’s heads above water with hard work and dedication. Eventually, their wealth grew, and they entered the upper class. In the magnificent Carnegie home, Clara and Andrew became good friends, and she seemed to become his muse, after a fashion, inspiring and encouraging his business ventures with her own brilliant ideas. Although their relationship grew deeper, it was kept secret to preserve her position with his mother so she could continue to support her family. Her first responsibility remained her family, and she would not jeopardize her livelihood which was so necessary for their day to day existence.The historic story of Carnegie’s rise in the world of business, his great philanthropy and his enormous wealth is non-fiction and was very interesting, but I found the romance between Andrew and Clara lacking in credibility.  The entire relationship between Clara and Andrew took place over approximately four years. Her behavior and his, stretched beyond the realm of believability for me.  She seemed out of character for a young lady without formal education, who was from the servant class. In spite of her meager background, she was somehow able to insert herself into the Carnegie home, educate herself, practically overnight, about her responsibilities as a maid, care for Mrs. Carnegie as no other lady’s maid had been able to prior, and then was also the genius behind Andrew Carnegie’s business ventures, future success and acts of kindness. Although Andrew married rather late in life, probably became the richest man in the world, even when compared to the rich of today, although he was a philanthropist of the highest order, I could not imagine such an unrequited romance being the reason. However, the factual information about Carnegie’s rise in the business world and the tales illuminating the dire conditions that had existed in Ireland coupled with the extreme poverty of the immigrants when they arrived in America, only to be subjected to further hardship, was very informative.The narrator did a wonderful job reading the novel, interpreting each character with authenticity. The author’s prose was outstanding and put the reader into the time and place of the novel. Although the fictional tale was unsatisfactory for me, the history was very interesting and the author’s ability to put magic into the words on the page made it a very good read.Read morejanjanfreemanRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Carnegie's Maid is a romantic approach to the tale of the iconic Carnegie family and offers an idea of perhaps why the family turned to philanthropy once they built their wealth.  This story also includes a focus on the struggles of immigrants as well as how the Civil War and President Lincoln's assassination impacted people of all classes.I really liked the juxtaposition of the subservient side of Clara when she is Mrs. Carnegie's maid with her bold businesswoman side when she is sneaking in secret moments with Andrew Carnegie.  Furthermore, I liked the innocence of their romance despite the imbalance of power as well as both of their loyalties to their respective families.My favorite character in this book was Mr. Ford.  I would go on further, however, I do not wish to spoil anything.  Therefore, I will simply state that his character seemed to be the most generous in that he was generous with his good attitude and generous in doing small good deeds for others.  One of the reasons why I did not give this book 5 stars is because it kind of dragged on at certain points as if length was the goal rather than depth.  Another reason is because the antagonist was weak, however, I am not even sure if it is the character that I am thinking of or if the antagonist is supposed to be a group of people.  Lastly, I did not care for how Andrew Carnegie conveniently appeared (and appeared quite often) when Clara was alone. For those who may be triggered or offended: the only things that I could find within the book were poverty, pollution, religious themes, and death.Please note: an electronic copy of this book was generously provided for free from the publisher via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review. Read moreleopolds-1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Clara Kelley leaves for America seeking employment to help her family in Ireland.

Both this novel and "The Other Einstein" deal with strong women dealing with the problems of being a woman in a man's world in the late 19th century. I found the depiction of life in Pittsburgh in 1863-68 very interesting and educational. Benedict does a good job of showing how difficult the world was for immigrants and the large gap between the rich and the poor. Although the story of Clara Kellely an Irish immigrant who assumes the role of a lady's maid to Margaret Carnegie(Andrews mother) through a case of mistaken identity was a leap of faith to accept, the overall depiction of life in that time seemed accurate and kept my interest. The story is fictional but it does give us insight into what may have driven Andrew Carnegie to become  one of the greatest philanthropists in our countries history. This was an uplifting story and a good way to to explore history.Read morethequietreaderRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Irish immigrant, Clara Kelley, takes the place of another immigrant who died on the journey across the sea and thus becomes made to Mrs. Carnegie. As Clara finds her footing, she strives to avoid the attention of the oldest Carnegie son. Clara was a fascinating character to follow. She is aware of how much her family back in Ireland is depending on her and for awhile she does make a good effort to avoid Andrew's attention. The way she takes on the role of lady's maid without any experience was a little improbable, but life can be stranger than fiction sometimes so maybe its possible something like this could happen.I don't feel like there was a clear view of Andrew Carnegie. At least, I didn't feel I came to know him at all by the end of the book. His willingness to discuss business with Clara also came a cross as improbable, but I tried to keep in mind this is fiction. Anything is possible in fiction, right?Plot-wise, the story moves along at a nice pace. The end seemed a bit abrupt and jarring. Overall, I found it an interesting read and I would recommend it to readers who enjoy a unique look at a historical figure.I received a copy from NetGally for reviewing purposes.Read more1 person found this helpfulsraellingRating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5As the kitchen cook said, "It never ends well for the servant."This is an idealized story about Andrew Carnegie and his purported love interest, Clara Kelley (Carnegie's mother's maid.) If it was a woman who encouraged him to become the philanthropist who created an opportunity to everyone to improve their lot in life, OK. But it is a bit far-fetched.Including: Going to the opera? Her education in Ireland? Free time that allowed her to meet often with Andrew? Her innate business acuity? Her luck!The story did highlight the differences between the "haves" and the "have-nots," those who were able to live in healthy surroundings and those who lived in squalor, the relationships between the servants (all positions of servitude are not created equal), even the upper class have their ways of keeping the "wannabes" out.While Clara's marriage to Andrew didn't work out, she still had a better future than Mrs. Carnegie thought she deserved.Read moreBook previewCarnegie's Maid - Marie BenedictPrologue December 23, 1868 New York, New York The gentle melody of a Christmas song lifted into the air of his study from the street below. The music did nothing to change his mood or his actions. Ensconced behind the black walnut desk in his luxuriously appointed St. Nicholas Hotel suite, fountain pen in hand, Andrew Carnegie wrote like a madman. He paused, searching for the correct word. Glancing around the study lit by the very latest in gaslights, he saw it as if anew. The walls were hung with a heavy, yellow brocade wallpaper, and dark-green velvet curtains framed the windows, tied back by heavy, gold cords, affording him a fine view of Broadway. He knew this suite was superior to any found in America or even Europe. Yet this fact, which had so pleased him during his earlier visits to New York, now repulsed him. The curtain’s gold cords seemed like binding ropes, and he felt trapped inside a rarified prison. He had argued with his mother that they should stay elsewhere, somewhere less ostentatious. He longed to reside somewhere that was not haunted by memories of Clara, although he did not say that aloud. It no longer seemed right to stay at the St. Nicholas, not without her. He had spent the better part of a year searching for her, with no success. Not even the detectives, his top security men, or bounty hunters—the best in the business—could locate a hint of her trail. But his mother would have none of it. Andra, she called him in her inimitable brogue, the trappings of wealth are the Carnegies’ right and due, and by God, we will secure our place. He acquiesced, depleted of the energy to argue. But on their arrival at the St. Nicholas Hotel earlier that day, Andrew had taken the extraordinary step of banishing his mother to her adjoining suite of rooms and ignoring her pleas that they attend a holiday dinner at the Vanderbilts, an invitation to the near-highest echelon of New York City society that had been hard-won. He needed to be alone with his thoughts of Clara. Clara. He whispered her name, letting it roll over his tongue like a fine cordial. In the privacy of his study, he let his very first memory of her wash over him. Clara had trailed behind his mother into the parlor of Fairfield, their Pittsburgh home, with a step so light that he barely noticed the tap of her shoes or the swish of her skirts as she crossed the room. Her demure manner and averted gaze did nothing to draw his attention until his mother had barked out some order in Clara’s direction. Only then, when Clara lifted her eyes and met his square on, did her presence register. In that fleeting moment, before she quickly lowered her eyes again, he witnessed the sharp intelligence that lay beneath the placid demeanor required for a lady’s maid. Other, more intimate memories of Clara began to take hold, along with a longing so intense, it caused him physical pain. But then a roar of laughter and the clink of crystal glasses from the Grand Dining Room below his study interrupted his reverie. He wondered who might be celebrating in that gilded room. Could it be one of his business colleagues visiting from out of town, or perhaps one of the elusive upper ten families deigning to leave their cosseted, insular world of brownstone dinners to peer into the latest in sumptuous New York City dining establishments? Should he go downstairs to see? Stop, he chastised himself. This is precisely the sort of status-seeking, greedy thinking that Clara would have loathed. He had vowed to her that he would carve out a different path from those materialistic industrialists and society folk, and he would keep that vow, even though she was gone. He returned to his mission of honoring her, one he’d attempted countless times as he drafted and redrafted this document. Pressing the tip of the fountain pen so hard that the ink bled through the fragile paper, he wrote: Thirty-three and an income of $50,000 per annum! By this time two years I can so arrange all my business as to secure at least $50,000 per annum. Beyond this never earn—make no effort to increase fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes. Cast aside business forever, except for others. Settle in Oxford and get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men—this will take three years’ active work—pay especial attention to speaking in public. Settle then in London and purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking a part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have an idol—the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry—no idol more debasing than the worship of money. Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I will resign business at thirty-five, but during the ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically. Lifting the pen from the paper, Andrew read. The words were rough and imperfectly formed, but he was satisfied. Although God had willed that he could not have Clara, he would brandish her beliefs like a sword. He would worship the idols of status and money—for their own sake—no longer. Instead, he would amass and utilize reputation and money for one higher purpose only: the betterment of others, particularly the creation of ladders for the immigrants of his adopted land to climb. Through the heavy fog of his despair, Andrew permitted himself the smallest of smiles, the tiniest of appeasements. The letter would have pleased his Clara. Chapter One November 4, 1863 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania I shouldn’t be here. Cecelia or Eliza could have been swaying on this stinking vessel instead of me. It was their right—Eliza’s duty anyway, as the eldest daughter—to make the voyage and take the chance on a new land. But Mum and Dad offered a litany of excuses for my sisters—the twenty-one-year-old Eliza was on the brink of a marriage that would allow the family to keep our farm tenancy intact, a status that had eluded me due to my overcleverness, Dad said, and Cecelia was too young for the voyage at fifteen and too weak-spirited in any event—and so, knowing my parents were right, I boarded the Envoy in their place. Forty-two days later, I regretted the preening and arrogance to which I subjected my sisters when I’d learned of my parents’ decision. I knew now that being considered my parents’ síofra—their changeling capable of transmuting into whatever America required—was no prize. And I desperately missed my sisters. Light snuck through the hatch into the steerage cabin, blinding me for a moment. My eyes closed spontaneously. Even as the light faded a bit, I chose to keep my eyes shut, surrendering to the remnants of the sun’s heat. I wanted the fading rays to burn me clean. I wanted them to burn away the sour smell of the long Atlantic passage and the recurrent tears of leave-taking. The steward clanged the ship’s bell to signal our disembarking. I opened my eyes and reluctantly glanced around the cabin. Mothers with listless infants in their arms pushed themselves to standing, while their older, hollow-eyed children clung to their skirts, scared by the relentless ringing of the bell. Fathers and old men struggled to smooth their filthy, rumpled suits into some sad approximation of dignity. Only the few young men, the fir òga, were strong enough—and eager enough—to readily form a queue. The journey had been rough, taking its toll on even the fir òga. Nearly three weeks prior, after an already tumultuous crossing, a storm hit the Envoy, tumbling those of us in steerage out of our beds into a hold with two feet of water. As the crew and my fellow passengers began working the pump in the pitch-dark of the moonless night, the ship began rolling from side to side like the heavy log it was, causing one Dublin girl of about sixteen, traveling alone like myself, to crash into one of the wooden posts keeping the ceiling firm above our heads. Moaning as she fell with a splash onto the still-flooded floor, she never regained consciousness. When she died the next morning, the captain sent the first mate and a sailor to steerage to sew her up in a sheet, with some rocks at her feet to weigh her down, and throw her overboard without a single word or prayer. This loss and her treatment bore heavily upon me, upon all of us really, as it seemed a portent of the treatment we might expect in the new land. Footsteps clapped on the wooden deck above our heads, followed by the thud and drag of trunks. My cabinmates rushed to assemble their meager belongings: rucksacks, wicker baskets, tools, treasured pictures, and Bibles, even the odd battered trunk. But I knew we needn’t hurry. We would bide our time until all the other classes had left the ship. Steerage always waited: for the dry biscuits, putrid water, and rancid oatmeal that serve as sustenance; for sleep uninterrupted by hacking coughs and crying babies; for air uncontaminated with the stink of vomit and full chamber pots; for storms to break and the hatch to be unlocked to grant us a few blissful moments above deck; for privacy that never came. I was tired of waiting, but we had no choice but to stand in the queue, immobile but for the rocking of the ship in the harbor. I glanced at the young mother beside me, her tattered brown dress stained with the evidence of her baby’s constant seasickness. At seventeen or so, she was a couple of years younger than my nineteen years, but her eyes looked older. There, lines had given way to furrows. All alone throughout this terrible voyage, she bore the weight not only of her own worries and suffering, but also those of her child. I felt ashamed at wallowing in my own discomfort and longing for home. "Ádh mór," I said, having nothing to offer her and her baby but luck. No worries here that we’d receive tallies on our bata scóir for speaking Irish instead of English and then receive the corresponding punishment, as teachers at the hedge schools for the Irish were instructed to do. Not that this poor mother had ever been beaten for speaking Irish in school, as it wasn’t likely that she’d attended school of any sort. She looked surprised at my words. I’d maintained my distance from fellow passengers, at Mum’s request, and this young mother and I had never spoken. This separation kept me healthy if unpopular among my gregarious countrymen, who resented my standoffishness. Too weary to speak, she nodded her thanks. The hatch flew open, and crisp, salty air filled the cabin. I inhaled deeply, and for a long minute, the fresh breeze was enough. The air smelled of home, and I gulped it down hungrily. Line up, people! The steward yelled at us. His pinched, sallow face had terrorized steerage for forty-two days, withholding food, water, and deck time if he deemed us not compliant enough. If he didn’t hold the power to deny us admission to our new land, I would have shared with him my thoughts on his cruelty. I’d refuse to still my tongue as Mum and Dad often chided me to do. We tidied the queue and waited again. Some silent signal finally reached the steward, and he motioned for us to climb the stairs and mount the deck. Single file, we left the stinking pit of steerage for the last time and walked into the muted light of the Philadelphia harbor. The gangway leading to shore felt unsteady underfoot, as did the rocky ground once I reached land. It felt almost as if the earth was rocking rather than the ship. My legs seemed to have grown more accustomed to the swaying of sea than the constancy of land. Black-uniformed officials guided us into a building labeled Lazaretto. In the long, dark nights, my shipmates had spoken with fear of Lazaretto, a quarantine station. From relatives’ earlier crossings, they had learned that any sign of illness in the ship’s passengers could mean weeks or months at Lazaretto, a place where people often entered well and left sick. Or worse. I didn’t worry that I harbored some disease. Mum’s instructions kept me safe. Even so, I’d heard too much coughing to think the rest of the passengers were brimming with health, and our fates rose and fell with one another. If the inspector found one contagion in one steerage passenger, it was in his discretion to hold all of us at Lazaretto until every last person in steerage recovered. One by one, we moved up in line toward the health inspectors. I winced as the officials inspected my cabinmates like they were Dad’s farm animals, lifting up their gums and eyelids for signs of disease, sifting through their hair for evidence of lice or other vermin, examining their skin and fingernails for yellow fever or cholera, and pawing through their belongings. Any infraction could be enough to condemn us all to Lazaretto, and I said a silent Hail Mary that the toddler prone to coughing all night managed to keep quiet. The line shifted forward, and it was my turn. I took off my crumpled bonnet and heather-gray outer coat, extended my arms, and submitted my body for examination. You look well enough, a heavily bearded inspector said in my ear as he unpinned my heavy, dark-red hair. The gesture and the whisper felt strangely intimate and wholly inappropriate. But I couldn’t object. It could ruin everything for which Mum and Dad sent me here. It could render useless all the sacrifices made to pay for my ticket. I nodded in acknowledgment, as if his remark were perfectly fine. Just a simple statement on my health. But my hands shook as I repinned my hair, and he continued his review of my skin. Only when he turned his attention to my rucksack did my shallow, fast breathing slow. With the shadow of a smile, he waved me forward. It seemed I’d passed the test, but what of my shipmates? With the rest of steerage, I was herded into a large, dingy waiting room that reeked of unwashed bodies and urine. Once again, we waited. I promised myself that, if I ever made it through Lazaretto and onto American soil, I would not wait anymore. After another long hour, during which passengers trickled in and anxiety mounted, a bell rang. Old men and tired mothers and young children looked at one another quizzically. Should we know what it meant? Finally, a door slammed open, and a thick shaft of light entered the room. Welcome to America, a bespectacled official announced. Even though no one spoke, the relief in the room was audible, like a collective exhalation. We assembled into the last line we would ever form together and walked outside into the American daylight. I breathed in hope. All around me, I heard cries of reunion as my fellow passengers fell into the arms of their waiting relatives. But I walked on. No one was waiting for me. Chapter Two November 4, 1863 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania I walked with purpose. I hadn’t a clue where I was headed, but I couldn’t afford any hesitation that marked me as weak. Even in our small Galway village outside of Tuam, we heard rumors of immigrants who, upon landing in America, had been victimized by sharpers, unscrupulous men engaged in all manner of trials, plots, and chicanery. I’d talked a brash game to my family and friends when Mum and Dad decided I’d be the one to emigrate, but now, I wondered how I would fare in this strange land. Except for the cry of seagulls and the clop of horses, this harbor didn’t sound anything like the harbors in Galway. The fishmongers called out their wares in a language I knew was English but sounded like gibberish, and news peddlers cried out the day’s news with the same inflection. Except for the salty air and scent of horse droppings and fish, the smell was unlike home as well. Arriving passengers stumbled around me as they regained their land legs, and the air was thick with the stench of their bodies. Unwashed for weeks in turbulent seas, even the sea air couldn’t freshen them. Even the beggars recoiled from the stink of my fellow passengers. For the first time, in this mass of humanity, I really understood how alone I was in the vast land. A voice drifted through the din. Clara Kelley? The name was unmistakable. It was my own. I listened hard, but I didn’t hear it again. I wondered if, in my loneliness, I had imagined it. I decided that I must have. No one expected me here. Clara Kelley? I’m looking for a Miss Clara Kelley from Galway, the voice bellowed louder. I followed the voice. It belonged to a tall, clean-shaven man wearing a bowler hat and a houndstooth topcoat finer than I’d seen in some time. Before I got too close, before I identified myself, I stopped and watched him. Was he one of those runners we had heard about from our farming neighbors, the O’Donnells? A fellow Irishman had approached their nephew Anthony at the New York City docks, promising him a pleasant room at a reasonable rate, only to settle him in a rat-infested tenement room in the Lower East Side of the city that was already inhabited by nine other immigrants, at a rate many times more than what he had been told. When Anthony couldn’t meet the exorbitant payment, the runner tossed Anthony out onto the street, keeping his stored trunk—his only belonging in the New World—as final payment. The O’Donnells and Anthony’s poor parents had not heard from him since his last letter describing the machinations of this evil runner. This terrible fate wasn’t the worst an immigrant could expect. I overheard the O’Donnells whispering to my parents about a girl from a neighboring village traveling alone to Boston who encountered a runner who exacted a far worse penance from her than the confiscation of her luggage. This man didn’t look the part. In fact, my little sister, Cecilia, would have called him posh, especially as he was leaning against a highly polished black livery coach with two dappled gray horses attached. And anyway, how would a runner know my name? The man caught me watching him and asked, You wouldn’t be Miss Clara Kelley, would you? His American accent was thick and flat, but I made sense of him. Yes, sir. He stared long and hard at my face, clothes, and rucksack. "A Miss Clara Kelley who was on board the Envoy?" Yes, sir, I answered with a half curtsy. He looked surprised. You’re not what I expected, he said with a shake of his head. But Mrs. Seeley knows her business. It’s not my job to judge. I was about to ask him why he was looking for me and who was this Mrs. Seeley when he said, Come on, miss. Climb into the carriage. We’ve been waiting for you for well over an hour. Long after the rest of second class exited from Lazaretto. God alone knows what sort of dawdling you were up to. Now we’re well behind schedule to Pittsburgh. And Mrs. Seeley does not like us to be late, particularly since she’s paying extra fare to get you to Pittsburgh safely by coach. I knew there were confusing assertions imbedded in the man’s words, but all I heard was Pittsburgh. Was he truly offering to take me to Pittsburgh? The industrial city over three hundred miles from Philadelphia was my planned destination. Back home, we’d heard the city had work aplenty, and it was the one place in this boundless country where my family had relatives. Not close kin, mind, but a second cousin close enough to reach out to once I found employment in a textile mill or in one of the big homes that needed domestics. I’d squirreled away the rest of the pounds and pence Mum and Dad had given me to secure the passage to Pittsburgh. I’d assumed I would have to cobble together the cheapest route I could find, some combination of rail and canal rides and wagon, since the train route didn’t extend all the way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. But now a complete stranger was offering me a continuous horse-drawn carriage ride across the Allegheny Mountains and seemingly not asking for payment. Would I be a fool to decline? Or would I be a fool to accept? I had a choice. I could tell this man the truth. That I was not the Clara Kelley for whom he was looking. That Clara Kelley was a common enough name. That the second-class passenger Clara Kelley for whom he was waiting probably never made it off the ship ferrying her here from Ireland if he had not yet come across her. Cholera and typhoid took many of us from all classes of travel. Illness did not discriminate. It was perhaps the one thing that did not. Or I could become that other Clara Kelley. At least until I got to Pittsburgh. I stared at the black carriage, trying to decide. On board the Envoy, I had promised myself that I wouldn’t wait any longer, that I would take my future in my own hands when I could. The man opened the door to the carriage for me. Come on, miss. I glanced up at him and said, My apologies for the delay, sir. It won’t happen again. And then I climbed up the steps into the carriage. Chapter Three November 4, 1863 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The carriage was not empty. Once my eyes adjusted to the dim interior, I saw that there were two other girls inside. Both were near my age, with the reddish hair of my people, but there, the similarities stopped. Wearing dresses with crinoline underskirts peeking out at the hem, thick silk sashes, high necklines with lace collars, and wide pagoda sleeves, the girls had clothes finer and more fashionable than anything I’d ever owned. Finer than anything I’d ever seen, in fact, except the two occasions I served as a temporary kitchen maid for a holiday meal at Castle Martyn, the medieval citadel owned by the Martyn family, who served as landlord to all the farmers in our region. Who in the name of Mary was this Clara Kelley I’d become? From their gawking, I saw that the girls found me as alien as I found them. But I could not let on, or I risked losing my place in the carriage. How could I best ensure that I stepped into the mysterious shoes that the other Clara left me to fill? Not by speaking in my usual manner, that was for certain. These girls didn’t look as though their accents would match my farmer’s daughter’s West Ireland lilt, no matter how posh our fellow neighbors found it compared to their own, thanks to Dad’s education of us girls. And I guessed the other Clara Kelley spoke like them. Not me. Mrs. Seeley’s man poked his head into the carriage. Miss Kelley, I need to load your trunk onto the carriage. Where is it? How could I answer that the rucksack slung over my shoulder contained the entirety of my worldly possessions? The real Clara Kelley undoubtedly had traveled with trunks large enough to carry the kind of dresses these girls wore, and my bag was so small that it wouldn’t hold even a single one of my treasured volumes of history and poetry, only my necessaries. No matter my efforts, Dad’s battered copy of Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America, which he had used as inspiration for his earlier political involvement with the Fenians and I used as a primer to understand American life before my departure, would not fit. Leaving behind those books, from which Dad had educated all his daughters (much to the outcry of our farming neighbors), was nearly as hard as leaving behind my family. I answered, My apologies, sir. I should have told you that my trunk was lost en route. I prayed that these words bore a good approximation of an Anglo-Irish accent, with which I assumed my carriage-mates spoke. My model was the Martyn family. The Martyns. It pained me to conjure them up in any form, even as a reference point. Their actions were the cause of my departure. When rumors surfaced again about Dad’s years-earlier alignment with the Fenians—an Irish-led movement that maintained Ireland should be its own state, that farmers should Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksBiographical/AutoFictionFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
