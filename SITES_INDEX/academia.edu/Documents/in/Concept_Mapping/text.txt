It has been done intentionally to enter into the category of texts dealing with Augmented Reality, in that it reflects its principles and objectives.To date this book is the first text that collects in an organic and comprehensive way all the necessary steps so that the reader, even if inexperienced, can approach video mapping. The topics have, in fact, been dealt with in the light of the increasing difficulty in using the various types of software.The web offers the chance to see many tutorials on the subject, but none of them explain comprehensively how to achieve a performance: from the choice of location to the survey, from the choice of the projector up to the techniques to capture architecture.There is currently no single software that allows the complete management of a performance of video mapping, as this discipline encompasses very different skills ranging from sound design to the generation of video clips, through to 3D modeling. Multimedia planning is characterised by cross-disciplinary skills that the contemporary performer must necessarily possess; he must be able to manage different disciplines and software which is increasingly complex and powerful.Video mapping, with the ability to use open source software, has had a strong initial push that has allowed its progress and dissemination. It can be used in any context in which you want to transform an object into a dynamic display.In this volume all the topics covered in the various workshops that the gloWArp studio has held on the subject are addressed in a gradual and complete way, providing advice and guidance on practical problems encountered in the course of the professional activity. The experience gained during the application of such techniques in situations of all kinds, from the simplest to the most complex, such as archaeological excavations or organic systems, is the strong point of the book which intends to provide a solid methodological basis for addressing both simple systems described here and more complex systems, which will be developed in Volume 2.Therefore it represents a teaching aid that allows everyone to learn the technique of video mapping, using it and enhancing it, and later, creating an interactive and comprehensive performance through the use of kinect® or software nodes. The decision to apply the theoretical tools on a real structure which is readily available, allows you to immediately apply the knowledge you have gained and test your level of preparedness for more complex architectural mapping.Finally, a lot of attention has been paid to the selection of software, in such a way that all readers that intend to approach video mapping – whether they are PC or Mac users – can find in this volume the right training guide for this discipline.to buy:https://www.amazon.co.uk/Donato-Maniello/e/B083RHCCLB?fbclid=IwAR3xgI3gkbXdmN0MuKobpq-Gt1OGuP1-ghOFCHRAlmDgVozS-Z5b57vx_poinfo vol.I: http://www.glowarp.com/video-mapping-book_eng.htmlSave to LibraryDownloadby Edizioni Le Penseur and +1Donato  Maniello•  8  Computer Engineering, Virtual Reality (Computer Graphics), Augmented Reality, Concept MappingMapping long-term coral reef ecosystems regime shifts: A small island developing state case studyCoral reefs are among the most fragile ecosystems that provide essential services to local Small Island Developing States (SIDS) communities.

As such, exploring the characteristics and interactions shaping regime shifts of coral reefs is of paramount importance in managing system pressures; enhancing resilience; aiding their regeneration and recovery process; and restoring habitat complexity. However, understanding the dynamics of coral reef ecosystems regime shift requires employing an approach capable of dealing with systems being affected by multiple climatic and socio-economic non-climatic pressures as well as an effective treatment of systemic embedded uncertainties. This study applies Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) in a participatory stepwise and systematic procedure to reflect dynamic casualties and temporal changes of coral reef ecosystem regime change over a long-time perspective. This mapping technique allows conceptualising dynamic models to represent causalities and modelling input values to simulate fluctuations within a complex temporal system. Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu was selected as the case study region representative of Pacific-SIDS geography and human communities. As an initial outcome and an indicator of multidisciplinary of this study, twenty-seven principal influential factors and their corresponding causal relationships were identified. Subsequently, the coral reef regime shift was analysed under four main plausible scenarios representing major climatic and non-climatic trajectories. The results indicate that climate change factors play pivotal roles in the regime shift of the coral reef ecosystem globally. At the focal scale of this study, the tourism industry and coral fisheries are the most vulnerable services provided by coral reefs. As such, coupled local management interventions and global efforts in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change is likely to yield better coral reef ecosystem services at a local community level.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alyssa L.

This has lead him to question the historical pattern of design whereby the methods and epistemologies of other disciplines are used without addressing the differences between them and design. Design is a complex activity enmeshed in many aspects of our lives. In his article in Design Issues (1992), ‘Prometheus of the Everyday: The Ecology of the Artificial and the Designer’s Responsibility’, Manzini foregrounds the relational nature of this complexity by conceiving design (the artificial) as having an ecology. Roxburgh has written about these matters but his critique has conformed to the conventions of academic publishing and he has found articulating aspects of such complexity constrained by the limits of written language. Increasingly, in design, visualization is used to map complex relationships between things, ideas and actions. In this essentially visual essay, Roxburgh is attempting to graphically identify and explore the relationships of some of these concepts in a manner that echoes these trends and his own research practice. He is aware that sketches of complex phenomena, through a process of interpretation and abstraction, become somewhat reductive. The moments he draws on in crafting the depictions of his views are presented episodically rather than chronologically.Roxburgh sketches out three key historical conceptions of design and the ramifications they have had on our perceptions and practice of it. He depicts these conceptions as being drawn from traditions outside of design and suggests that an alternative strategy may lie within design itself. This strategy calls for an engagement with what he calls the aesthetics of research. He suggests that it is imperative that design encompasses an aesthetic engagement with the world at all levels, and most importantly at the point of design research and conception, for our experience of design is fundamentally aesthetic. He is aware that there is an apparent irony in his use of non design theories to frame aspects of his view but this is a necessary strategy to critique the ontological assumptions inherent within the conceptions of design that he characterizes (one could even say ‘caricatures’). Roxburgh takes the position that there is nothing essentially given about design consciousness. Rather, the characterizations of design consciousness that he outlines all carry (usually implicit) ontological assumptions that may be inappropriate and/or limit design practice. The depiction of design that he offers is based instead on an alternative ontology. While this cannot be empirically verified (no ontology can), he proposes it as a way of extending and critiquing usual conceptions of design practice. No doubt this in turn will be found to have shortcomings of its own.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark Roxburgh•  23  Aesthetics, Design, Art, Design educationPemetaan Faktor Resiko (Keberadaan Jamban) Penularan Penyakit Di Kampus Kesehatan LingkunganSave to LibraryDownloadby Vio Ardilles  Brahmana•  11  Epidemiology, Public Health Ethics, Concept Mapping, Public HealthCurrent States: Mapping Relational Geographies in Service DesignAs Service Design navigates unchartered territory, maps of all kinds are becoming essential tools for the design process.

Maps document the service offering in its current form, celebrating what works and identify challenges. They leverage the agency of visualisation and storytelling to educate, engage and guide internal and external stakeholders along the journey to service innovation. Maps as artefacts are becoming a disruptor for organisations that are accustomed to traditional ways of communicating and allow the voice of the customer to sing in the creation of future strategy and opportunities. Mapping, as a process, is an ideal way to foster co-design and collaboration across hierarchies and institutional sectors. In this way, it operates as a type of ontological design designing back on the organisation that creates it.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sasha Abram•  6  Design Methods, Service Design, Design Research, Concept MappingEnhancing students' HOTS in laboratory educational activity by using concept map as an alternative assessment toolEducational transformation in the 21st century demands in-depth knowledge and understanding in order to promote the development of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS).

However, the most commonly reported problem with respect to developing a knowledge of chemistry is poor mastery of basic concepts. Chemistry laboratory educational activities are shown to be less effective in developing an optimum conceptual understanding and HOTS among students. One factor is a lack of effective assessment and evaluation tools. Therefore, the primary focus of this study is to explore concept maps as an assessment tool in order to move students' thinking skills to a higher level during laboratory learning activities. An embedded mixed method design is used in this study, which has also employed a pre-experimental research design. This design triangulates quantitative and qualitative data, which are combined to strengthen the findings. A low-directed concept mapping technique, convergence scoring method, and pre-post laboratory concept map were used in this study. An electrolysis HOTS test was used as the research instrument in order to measure the level of student achievement with respect to high-level questions. In addition, the thought process that is involved when students construct concept maps has been explored and studied in detail by utilising a think-aloud protocol. Results showed a positive development towards understanding and higher level thinking skills in students with respect to electrolysis concepts learned through chemistry laboratory activities. An investigation of the students' thinking processes showed that high-achieving students were more capable of giving a content-based explanation of electrolysis and engaged in monitoring activities more often while building a concept map. Nonetheless, all categories of students managed to show a positive increase in the activities of explanation and monitoring during the construction of concept maps after they were exposed to the assessment tool in the laboratory learning activities. In conclusion, the assessment activity using concept maps in laboratory learning activities has a positive impact on students' understanding and stimulates students to increase their HOTS.Save to LibraryDownloadby INTAN B A I Z U R A A.

Cette proposition rend compte de l'expérience d'usages de différents artefacts dans une activité collaborative de cartes conceptuelles proposée en cours d'histoire en classe de seconde. Le point fort de ce travail est l'expérimentation réalisée avec un premier prototype de dispositif numérique de collaboration qui permet aux élèves de différencier l'espace de travail individuel de l'espace collectif. L'objectif de cette étude est d'évaluer si le recours aux artefacts numériques lors de l'édition collective de cartes conceptuelles favorise les processus de confrontation cognitive constitutifs de la collaboration. L'analyse présentée dans cet article est centrée sur la nature des interventions des élèves ainsi que sur le rôle des caractéristiques du dispositif techno-pédagogique. Abstract. The use of digital artifacts for learning activities remains most often individual because of the lack of suitable environments, from the material point of view, available applications and pedagogical practices. This proposal summarizes the experience of uses of different artifacts in a collaborative activity of concept mapping proposed in a tenth-grade history class. The key point of this work is the experimentation carried out with a first prototype of a digital collaborative device that allows students to differentiate the individual workspace from collective space. The aim of this research is to assess whether the use of digital artifacts during the collective edition of concept mapping promotes the processes of cognitive confrontation found in collaboration. The analysis presented in this article focuses on the nature of the students' interventions and on the role of the characteristics of the techno-pedagogical device.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carolina  Gracia Moreno•  3  Cognitive Psychology, Collaboration, Concept MappingLa rationalité cartographique de l'histoire de l'art: tableaux synoptiques, atlas, diagrammesThis article examines the relation between Art History as a discipline and maps, charts and diagrams, i.e. graphic representations that contribute to a spatial understanding of things, concepts, conditions, processes, or events.... moreThis article examines the relation between Art History as a discipline and maps, charts and diagrams, i.e. graphic representations that contribute to a spatial understanding of things, concepts, conditions, processes, or events. Throughout the analysis of three very different examples – the maps and comparative views in H. W. Janson’s History of Art; Aby Warburg’s Mnemosyne project; and George Maciunas’ charts and diagrams – our essay hopes to demonstrate how “mapping” has played an essential role in the configuration of the discipline’s discursive practices, namely with regards to the visualisation and spatialisation of temporal schemes. We suggest that far from being a recent phenomenon, the influence of this “cartographic reason” can be traced to Art History’s disciplinary origins; recent discursive changes, have only come to make it more evident.Save to LibraryDownloadby Teresa Castro•  4  Art History, Concept Mapping, Aby Warburg.

Concept maps are one of the graphical learning tools for organising and representing knowledge hierarchically. The idea of concept mapping was based on Ausubel’s assimilation theory of cognitive learning. This study explored the attitudes and perceptions of students about the use of concept maps as a learning tool in physical chemistry. Fifty seven students in Perak Matriculation College participated in this study. A mixed mode of quantitative and qualitative approaches was adopted. Findings revealed that the majority of the students enjoyed using concept mapping in learning and perceived that it was greatly helpful in integrating and clarifying the interrelationships between concepts. They indicated that concept mapping encouraged independent learning and critical thinking. Some deterring factors about the concept mapping include the issue of time, difficulties in making explicit links between concepts and its applicability in other subjects.Save to LibraryDownloadby Wai Foong Lok•  3  Teaching and Learning, Learning and Teaching, Concept MappingRatne metafore u izveštavanju medija o fudbaluU kognitivno-lingvističkom pristupu metafora ima mnogo šire značenje od njenog tradicionalnog razumevanja kao književnog sredstva.

Konceptualne metafore oblikuju ne samo naš način komunikacije, već i način na koji razmišljamo i reagujemo. Metafora igra veoma važnu ulogu u ljudskom razmišljanju, razumevanju, pa čak i stvaranju društvene, kulturne i psihološke stvarnosti jer je obični ljudi svakodnevno koriste bez mnogo truda. Lejkof i Džonson su 1980. godine predstavili konceptualne metafore kao kognitivne procese koji su uobičajeni, neizbežni i duboko ukorenjeni u nesvesnom delu našeg kognitivnog aparata (Lakoff i Johnson 1980). Ne bi trebalo da čudi što se domen rata primenjuje u metaforama za sve tipove ljudske borbe i sukoba, jer nam metafora, kao osnovna kognitivna struktura, pomaže da razumemo relativno apstraktan pojam pomoću konkretnijeg koncepta. Cilj ovog rada je da pokaže da postoji značajan nivo konceptualnog preklapanja između domena sporta, konkretno fudbala, i domena rata, kao i da je ova metafora veoma prisutna u medijskim izveštajima sa fudbalskih mečeva, što pokazuje opravdanost glavne metafore FUDBAL JE RAT, varijacije na glavnu metaforu TAKMIČENJE JE RAT (Lakoff 1991). Ovaj cilj će se ostvariti kvalitativnim istraživanjem mapiranja između izvornog domena RAT i ciljnog domena FUDBAL u korpusu koji je sastavljen od medijskih izveštaja o fudbalu sa najpoznatijih srpskih internet medijskih portala. Iako se često koristi da bi se apstraktni pojmovi objasnili paralelama sa jednostavnijim konceptima koji su ljudima poznati, u ovom slučaju je primetno korišćenje ove metafore u cilju stvaranja napetije atmosfere prilikom izveštavanja.

Typically, the tools are used to help impart critical and analytical skills to students, to enable students to see rela- tionships between concepts, and also as a method of assessment. The common feature of all these tools is the use of diagrammatic relationships of various kinds in preference to written or verbal descriptions. Pictures and structured diagrams are thought to be more comprehensible than just words, and a clearer way to illustrate understanding of complex topics. Variants of these tools are available under different names: ‘‘concept mapping’’, ‘‘mind mapping’’ and ‘‘argument mapping’’. Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. However, as this paper will demonstrate, there are clear differences in each of these mapping tools. This paper offers an outline of the various types of tool available and their advantages and disadvantages. It argues that the choice of mapping tool largely depends on the purpose or aim for which the tool is used and that the tools may well be converging to offer educators as yet unrealised and potentially comple- mentary functions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Martin Davies•  10  Teaching and Learning, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Learning and Teaching, Teaching Thinking SkillsCartografía Ambiental.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on the principles stated by Nonaka and Takeuchi about knowledge creation and conversion and on the work by Novak and Gowin on concept maps, the core idea is to present the use of concept maps as a technique that facilitates, in some cases, and supports, in others, the realization of the following knowledge conversion operations: socialization, exteriorization, combination and internalization. These are the operations that, according to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1999), allow for the transformation of individual knowledge into collective knowledge and vice versa. Furthermore, it aims to answer the question of how to support the process of knowledge management in an organization through the use of a software application like CmapTools. Findings – This paper shows that knowledge evolves through various stages, with particular characteristics that need to be acknowledged in order to be managed properly. Originality/value – The technique of employing concept maps is appropriate to sponsor and facilitate the transitions among these stages of knowledge. It even allows for the preservation of the valuable knowledge of a person through the management of individual knowledge or the knowledge of a group of persons in an organization. This, in turn, promotes knowledge management in the enterprise itself.Save to Libraryby Monica Henao-Calad and +1Maria Arango•  10  Information Systems, Knowledge Management, Concept Map, Concept MappingSIMPLIFICATION OF COM COURSE TEACHING USINGThe students of undergraduate expect simple, teaching.

Such a map may serve as a personal tool for assembling and organizing knowledge and ideas, with the aim of leading to an innovative project. In the field of design, a rhizomatic mind map enables the designer to synchronize visual information, material and formal characteristics, measurements, concepts, ideas, associations and more - in order to formulate an innovative question in design research.

The concept was originally proposed as an alternative to the 'green economy' and as a way of thinking innovation and sustainability. Over the years it has evolved into a concept that is primarily about the economic potential of the sea. The developing blue economy agenda aims at providing new direction for ocean governance, maritime trade, ocean resource exploration and ocean health. Increasingly it is also linked to concerns over maritime security. The chapter investigates the twist and turns that the concept of blue economy has been taking. It draws on a practice theoretical framework that argues that we should appreciate the way in which concepts are responses to concrete problematic situations. A range of such problematic situations are investigated. The chapter offers both, a rich empirical case from one of the least studied areas of global governance, as well as a new way of thinking about conceptual change in practice. Concepts are one of the basic linguistic material of international politics. Yet, the study of concepts is often reduced to a concern of historians of international thought. This misunderstanding is gradually corrected, 1 the awareness is growing that concepts are also a productive entry point for understanding contemporary international politics and how it changes. This new recognition is linked to the re-evaluation of linguistic structures as part of the introduction of discourse-theoretical and post-structuralist thoughts to the discipline of international relations (IR). These textualist perspectives have well advanced our understanding of why and how language matters in international politics. They, however, tend to focus on larger systems of meaning and do not scrutinize single concepts, their evolution, and career. In this chapter, I argue for basing the study of concepts on a practice theoretical perspective. 2 I draw on a contemporary and recently emerged concept: the Blue Economy. The concept of Blue Economy emerged over the last decade as a new way of thinking about and governing the oceans. I use the case of this concept to develop three interrelated claims for practice-based concept analysis: Firstly, following the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and John Dewey I suggest that the meaning of a concept lies in its use. Concepts have no inherent meaning outside of their use. For Wittgenstein concepts are part of what he called " language games ". For Dewey, making a similar argument decades earlier, concepts had to be seen as part of " conjunct activities " of a community of functional language use. Rather than " language games " or " conjunct activities " I suggest the more established term of " practice " , to refer to the sets of activities within which concepts are used. In consequence, the study of concepts implies to study the practices of which concepts are part, the collectives that carry and enact the practice and the situations they are part (practical configurations).Save to LibraryDownloadby Christian  Bueger•  18  African Studies, Oceanography, Practice theory, Conceptual changeMind Maps as Facilitative Tools in Science EducationThis study explored the perceptions, attitudes, and willingness of pre-service science teachers in the College of Education at Kuwait University about using concept/mind maps and its related application software as facilitative tools, for... moreThis study explored the perceptions, attitudes, and willingness of pre-service science teachers in the College of Education at Kuwait University about using concept/mind maps and its related application software as facilitative tools, for teaching and learning, in science education. The first level (i.e., reaction) of Kirkpatrick's/Phillips' classic 5-level evaluation research model was exploited to assess and validate the reaction-based satisfaction level of pre-service science teachers. Although the findings disclose that 74.2 percent of participants asserted being aware about concept/mind maps beforehand. However, the vast majority, 96.8 percent, affirmed that they are not aware about concept/mind mapping application software. The results indicate that all participants were highly satisfied with utilizing concept/mind mapping and its related applications in education, accordingly, their reaction based satisfaction level was extremely positive and significantly high among all subgroups. The participants favored utilizing such tools for constructing their concept/mind maps over hand-drawing or regular desktop productivity applications. Also, all participants do consider that concept/mind maps and its related application software as being appropriate, valuable, and useful facilitative and enhancement tools in education. They also do believe that these tools are important constituents for promoting thrive and success in science education.Save to LibraryDownloadby Prof. Ammar Safar and +1Dr. Yaqoub Jafer•  20  Science Education, Higher Education, Visual Learning, Concept MappingJourney Mapping: The Landscapes of Learning in a Conceptual AgeSave to LibraryDownloadby Christine Kingsley•  8  Education, Conceptual change, Learning Styles, PedagogySłownictwo religijne w gwarach Śląska Cieszyńskiego / Religious vocabulary in the sub-dialects of Cieszyn SilesiaW artykule przedstawiono leksykę religijną w gwarach Śląska Cieszyńskiego.

Two of them are discussed in detail. The first problem is that researchers ascribe political characteristics to any social behaviour, which is unsupported by proper arguments that would relate the proposed concepts to the subject matter of political science. The second one points to the strong presence of normative and crypto-normative elements, especially in studies of democratic societies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mateusz Wajzer•  43  Political Sociology, Political Behavior, Political Participation, Social Sciencesmata kuliah perpetaan tambang unhasgaris kontur... garis konturSave to LibraryDownloadby Mukti Triyanto•  3  Concept Mapping, Mineral Resources and Technology, Perpetaan ( mine surveying )Cultural landscape values of wetlands.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Emel Baylan•  4  Wetlands, Stakeholders, Concept Mapping, Cultural ecosystem servicesIntroduction to Subsurface MapsSave to LibraryDownloadby Abubakar Surajo Ibrahim Kirare•  16  Geology, Structural Geology, Economic Geology, Quaternary GeologyThe theory underlying concept maps and how to construct and use them...

Attempts at measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of policy prescriptions have been aided by the development of specifiic indicators that strive to capture a particular circumstance, situation or condition (i.e., GDP). The current shift in thinking and action towards a more people-centred, human development pradigm has necessitated a concurrent re-orientation of the policies and programmes pursued by development agencies, CSOs and governments. Evaluating these efforts has meant looking conventional quantitative indicators to more qualitative ones (i.e. governance). This has been, by no means, an easy task. Qualitative processes such as empowerment, for example, do not easily lend themselves to being objectively measured.Save to LibraryDownloadby Parakh  Hoon•  6  Poverty, Sustainable Development, Risk and Vulnerability, Concept MappingOpen Historical Maps of IrelandThis paper explores open access platforms and tools for sharing and reusing cultural, historical, and archaeological open data.

Over the past decades, it has been greatly reconceptualised through various posthuman, ecosystemic, new materialist, material-discursive approaches, which explored the socio-spatial, technological, cognitive, relational, and affective relations that material arrangements, such as architectural ones, shape. As technē, architecture is intricately intertwined not only with processes of easing and facilitating (human) life, but also the management of dynamic processes involving both living and non-living matters. In view of the latter, architecture is ‘life by means other than life’ (Stiegler), shaping living matters by means of non-living matters. The chapter respectively surveys several streams of recent theoretical discourse that developed from Deleuze and Guattari’s as well as Foucault’s thoroughgoing reframing of the agency of matter on life-constituting processes. In the aim of reconsidering and repositioning architecture as a posthuman technique of existence, this cartography charts – with the help of a central navigational diagram – these co-evolving discursive streams in their differing topical-conceptual starting points, and their various converging and bifurcating lines of thinking, in the aim to elaborate on the novel conceptions they have helped distil in the pursuit of a fuller understanding of those material-discursive practices within the relational ecologies of architecture.

This qualitative study is conducted with 26 preservice mathematics teachers. Documents are obtained through concept map technique such as “design a map” which has low guidance. With this technique preservice teachers were asked to draw concept map on quadrilaterals and each student made his/her own map. The preservice teachers’ drawings and highlighted concept definitions related to quadrilaterals were analyzed descriptively on the basis of their correctness or incorrectness. The findings showed that most of them used geometric figures in forming their own maps and they made generally partition classifications. Also the participants drew squares, parallelograms and rectangles most, and rhombuses and trapezoids least. Besides, the explanations of the participants with wrong drawings showed that they had the necessary knowledge of quadrilaterals but they ignored this knowledge in their drawings. As the last remark, it was determined that the participants knew trapezoid as a ‘quadrilateral with only two parallel sides’Save to LibraryDownloadby Tuğba HORZUM•  3  Concept Mapping, Preservice Teacher Education, Perception of QuadrilateralTeknik PemetaanSave to LibraryDownloadby Dedy  Ludiarna•Concept MappingYABANCI DİL OLARAK TÜRKÇE ÖĞRETİMİNDE OKUDUĞUNU ANLAMA BECERİSİNİN KAVRAM HARİTASI ARACILIĞIYLA GELİŞTİRİLMESİ: BİR EYLEM ARAŞTIRMASIBu çalışmanın amacı, yabancı dil olarak Türkçe öğrenen C1 düzeyi öğrencilerinin kavram haritaları aracılığıyla okuduğunu anlama becerilerinin geliştirilmesidir.

Araştırma kavram haritalama tekniğinin uygulanma sürecini ortaya koymayı amaçladığı için eylem araştırması olarak düzenlenmiştir.Araştırma, 20.05.2014-10.07.2014 tarihleri arasında olmak üzere toplam 8 hafta sürmüş ve Fatih Üniversitesi TÖMER’de 11 öğrenci ile gerçekleştirilmiştir. Araştırmada okuduğunu anlama stratejilerinden tahmin etme, soru üretme ve özetlemenin öğretimi kavram haritaları yardımıyla yapılmıştır. Araştırma verileri video ve ses kayıtları, yansıtıcı günlük, öğrenci günlüğü, öğrenci çalışmaları, gözlem, strateji değerlendirme yaprakları ve okuduğunu anlama başarı testi olmak üzere çeşitli nitel ve nicel veri toplama araçlarıyla elde edilmiştir.Araştırma sekiz hafta boyunca, haftada iki gün dörder saat olacak şekilde planlanıp uygulanmıştır. Araştırmacı, stratejilerin öğretimini model olma yoluyla gerçekleştirmiş, ardından öğrencilerin bağımsız kullanıcılar olabilmeleri için ortam sağlamıştır. İki kez düzenlenen grup çalışması etkinlikleri ile öğrencilerin öğrenilen stratejileri kavram haritalarıile kullanmaları ve akran dayanışması-değerlendirmesi ile anlamlı öğrenmenin gerçekleştirilmesi hedeflenmiştir. Etkileşimli öğrenme ortamının, öğrencilerin öğrenmelerine olumlu katkıda bulunduğu görülmüştür.Nicel verilerin analizi SPSS for Windows programıyla, nitel verilerin analizi ise içerik analiziyle yapılmıştır. Nitel verilerin analizinde MAXQDA for Windows programından dayararlanılmıştır. Araştırmanın nicel analizleri sonucunda öğrencilerin okuduğunu anlama becerilerinin geliştiği görülmüştür. Nitel verilerden elde edilen bulgular ise okuduğunu anlama stratejilerinin kavram haritalama tekniğinden yararlanılarak öğretimi sonucundaöğrencilerin tahmin etme, soru üretme ve özetleme becerilerinde gelişim gösterdiklerini ortaya koymuştur.Araştırmada ürün ve süreç temelli değerlendirmelerin yapılmasının etkili olduğu gözlenmiştir. Strateji değerlendirme yapraklarının kullanımı, grup çalışmalarının düzenlenmesi, öğrenci çalışmalarının incelenmesi ve bunlarla ilgili öğrencilere dönütler verilmesi, öğrenci yanlışlarının azalmasına yardımcı olmuştur. Kavram haritalama tekniğinin öğrencilerin derse katılımlarını olumlu etkilediği ve anlamlı öğrenme sağladığı görülmüştür.Uygulama boyunca her dersle ilgili toplanan öğrenci günlükleri ve uygulama sonunda gerçekleştirilen öğrenci görüşlerinden elde edilen bulgulara göre öğrencilerin kavram haritalama tekniği ile işlenen dersleri çok etkileyici ve eğlenceli buldukları, uygulama boyunca kullanılan strateji ve teknikleri beğendikleri, eğitim hayatları boyunca bu strateji ve tekniklerden yararlanmak istedikleri tespit edilmiştir.Anahtar Kelimeler: Yabancı dil olarak Türkçe, okuduğunu anlama, kavram haritalama tekniği.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ferdi Bülbül•  29  Reading, Concept Map, Teaching of Foreign Languages, Concept MappingMapping biological ideas: Concept maps as knowledge integration tools for evolution educationSave to LibraryDownloadby Beat A Schwendimann•  6  Human Evolution, Science Education, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), Concept MappingNextLast »Related TopicsConcept MapFollowFollowingConcept Mapping, Mind MappingFollowFollowingMappingFollowFollowingMind MappingFollowFollowingConceptual ModellingFollowFollowingConceptsFollowFollowingConcept MapsFollowFollowingConceptual changeFollowFollowingSociotechnical Systems ModelingFollowFollowingHUMAN ERRORFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
