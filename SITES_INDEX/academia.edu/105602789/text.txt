This article looks at the history of the Chinese Esperanto movement after the repatriation of anarchism to China in the 1910s. It examines Esperanto’s political connections in the Chinese setting and the arguments used by its supporters to promote the language. In exploring the role played by Esperanto in interwar Chinese culture and politics, it helps to throw light on the complex relationship between language and politics in China in the first half of the twentieth century.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLanguage Problems and Language PlanningEsperanto and Chinese anarchism 1907–1920: The translation from diaspora to homeland2006 • Gregor BentonThe history of Esperanto in China was for long periods closely linked with anarchism. This article surveys the connection in the years up to 1920, and sets out to show which groups used which arguments to agitate for Esperanto, in order to throw light on the complexity of the relationship between language and politics in China, especially in the first half of the twentieth century.Download Free PDFView PDFTwentieth-Century ChinaFeminism, Women’s Agency, and Communication in Early Twentieth-Century China: The Case of the Huang-Lu Elopement by Qiliang He2021 • Qiliang HeDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Universality of the Concept of Modern Literature—Wang Guowei, Zhou Zuoren, and Other May Fourth Writers’ Conception of WenxueCarlos Yu-Kai LinWenxue is the modern Chinese term for literature. However, it is an ancient term that originated from the Confucian classics where it did not bear the same meaning as it does now. While some scholars have pointed out that wenxue was reintroduced as the modern Chinese term for “literature” during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, what qualified this term to serve as the modern referent for “literature” is a question that remains underexplored. In this paper, I analyze the works of Wang Guowei, Hu Shi, Chen Duxiu, Liu Bannong, Luo Jia Lun, and Zhou Zuoren, among others, to show how wenxue articulates a set of cosmopolitan values such as the idea of individual life and the call for a reflection on the humanity as a whole.Download Free PDFView PDFCodes of Modernity: Infrastructures of Language and Chinese Scripts in an Age of Global Information Revolution2018 • Ulug KuzuogluDownload Free PDFView PDFSound, Meaning, Shape: The Phonologist Wei Jiangong (1901–1980) between Language Study and Language PlanningSound, Meaning, Shape: The Phonologist Wei Jiangong (1901–1980) between Language Study and Language Planning2022 • Mariana MuenningOne of the leading proponents of the radical linguistic reforms in 20th century China, Wei Jiangong remains hardly known in the West. This book describes how Wei, who was rooted in traditional philology and conceptualizing language as a tool, helped to promulgate a standard language, led the compilation of the world’s most popular dictionary, and helped to drive script reform. While these measures were characterized as violent intervention in the Chinese language sphere, Wei’s careful negotiating of linguistic description and political prescription illustrates how they also may have been steps that helped to achieve linguistic self-determination. https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/catalog/book/939Download Free PDFView PDF“Cultural Identity, Education, and Language Politics in China and Japan, 1870–1920“, in: David Hoyt, Karen Oslund (ed.).

The Western-educated philosopher Fu Tong influenced and contributed to the discourse on science and religion in the early 1920s, and his philosophy of religion served as a conduit for the introduction of Bertrand Russell's ideas about religion into Chinese public and intellectual discourses. This article establishes a connection between Fu and the lectures on religious belief that Russell delivered in Peking in January 1921 and documents the transfer of ideas from Russell to Fu's philosophical writings on religion between 1921 and 1922. In its central analysis, the article focuses on Fu's philosophy of religion and his theory of scientific secularism, which he developed as a critique of the Marxist-led non-religious movement from 1922 onward. The discussion also sheds light on the network of intellectual connections underlying the emergence of the notion of scientific secularism in 1920s China.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
