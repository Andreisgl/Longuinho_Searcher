The teacher then records what students say.  I strongly recommended that you use this activity with each intervention session for two reasons: First on an interpersonal level, language experience activities enable you to make personal connections with your students.  You can find out what is going on in their lives as well as what they find interesting or significant.  It also creates conversation around these events.  This enhances your ability to relate to your students.  Relationships are important in any kind of teaching, but especially so when dealing with struggling readers, as self-efficacy and motivation are often low with.Second on an instructional level, language experience activities enable students to practice reading using words that are in their lexicon as well as their experiences and ideas.  This makes learning to read easier.  Analytic phonics (modeled below) can then be used to develop letter-sound relationships with these familiar words and experiences.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, it quickly moved away from being a conversational platform to becoming a teaching recipe. Schools and teacher preparation programs began to use the seven elements described in Hunter's model of instruction to observe and evaluate teachers.

Thus is created a false sense of reality, the grand façade that you see before you today.  This article examines all four ways of knowing and shows how these can be used to make good decisions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Each of us has a vast network of belief systems that act as a scaffold to help us make sense of the world around us. As we encounter new data we use this network to perceive, interpret, analyze, and organize this data. Our belief systems also act as filters to eliminate data that does not correlated with our existing constructs. In this sense, our beliefs can limit thinking and learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

First-draft.  This is the first attempt to get ideas on the page.  4. Revise.  This is the heart of the writing process.  Here the writer re-reads, reshapes, gets feedback, and revises many times.5. Editing.  Editing should occur only after a piece has been revised several times.  Here the writer looks for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors.  6.
