However, little research has explored whether they have different information and support needs from adults. We have previously described the experiences of young people (YP) undergoing predictive testing using rigorous qualitative methodology. Aim To identify key aspects of good counselling practice required to meet young people’s specific information and support needs. Methods Thematic analysis of interviews with 12 young people (aged 17–26) undergoing predictive testing for HD in Scotland. Results Key points for practice were: (1) Provide clear and engaging written and verbal information about the PT protocol, especially number of pre-test appointments and time span between each - signpost to resources such as HDYO www.hdyo.org; (2) YP may also be seeking support to deal with anger, intrusive thoughts or grief and loss - refer elsewhere if necessary; (3) Explore potential impact of results on family dynamics and family communication; (4) YP may have strong beliefs about their genetic status, discuss potential impact upon self-esteem and self-identity, especially of an unexpected result; (5) Encourage use of available family support before and after testing – this may not be through the direct family line; (6) Be clear about whose responsibility it is to make further appointments and (7) YP may require additional support or intervention between venepuncture and result. Conclusion Attention to these issues in genetic counselling could improve YP’s experiences of predictive testing for HD.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

K11 How to help young people through the HD clinic: professionals’ views and experiences of facilitating parent/child communicationJournal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry,  2016Background UK guidelines advise genetics professionals to support and encourage family communicat... more Background UK guidelines advise genetics professionals to support and encourage family communication about genetic risk. However, parents can experience a lack of information and support from healthcare professionals about sharing information with children about serious genetic conditions. Aims The aim of our study was to explore genetics professionals’ experiences in clinical practice and to identify strategies that effectively foster communication with young people. Methods Clinic observations; interviews with young people, parents and professionals; collaborations with patient groups. We used two adult-onset inherited disorders as examples: Huntington’s disease (HD) and Familial Hypercholesterolaemia. Results All genetics professionals felt that facilitating family communication about serious genetic conditions was an important aspect of their role, although one third reported giving limited advice and lacked confidence in this area, supporting parent’s accounts. Nevertheless, we identified ‘successful’ strategies and frameworks which genetics professionals draw upon to facilitate parent/child communication, which included: (1) Initiating a discussion about how/when to tell children; (2) Offering to tell children directly (with or without parent present); (3) Offering access to a quick follow-up appointment e.g. after parental disclosure and (4) Accepting ambiguity as there maybe “no clear cut answers”. We helped patient groups, including HDYO, to develop evidence based materials for children and young people. Conclusions Healthcare professionals working with families affected by HD have the opportunity to raise the issue of young people’s needs and support parents with disclosure to children about HD. Tips for raising these issues and available resources will be outlined.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Impact of Teamwork Climate and Communication on Intention to Report Hospital Critical IncidentsAcademy of Management Proceedings,  2015Hospital critical incident reporting systems inform the continuous improvement of healthcare deli... more Hospital critical incident reporting systems inform the continuous improvement of healthcare delivery. Systematic collection, analysis, and investigation of critical incidents enhance the quality, safety, and cost effectiveness of hospitals. However, research has demonstrated that critical incident reporting systems are notoriously ineffective, in part, due to employees’ perceptions of an unsupportive hospital climate. As an extension of relational coordination theory, a model was proposed which predicted that employee perceptions of teamwork climate would mediate the relationship between inter-unit communication of staff and staff intention to report critical incidents. An online survey was administered to 254 staff members in a large public hospital in Ireland. Analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. The data were consistent with the proposed mediation model, such that staff perceptions of teamwork climate fully mediated the relationship between inter-unit communication and intentio...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We begin by briefly reviewing the relevant literature on change and general management in the NHS, and go on to outline the particular features of the research design. We then isolate some key emergent themes from a preliminary analysis of the data, highlighting two themes in greater depth. In our final section, we will attempt to reflect on some of the common factors associated with the achievement of strategic change. The project is funded by the NHSTA and a consortium of eight Regional Health Authorities.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We conducted a large research programme to examine culture and behaviour in the English National Health Service (NHS). Mixed-methods study involving collection and triangulation of data from multiple sources, including interviews, surveys, ethnographic case studies, board minutes and publicly available datasets. We narratively synthesised data across the studies to produce a holistic picture and in this paper present a high-level summary. We found an almost universal desire to provide the best quality of care. We identified many &#39;bright spots&#39; of excellent caring and practice and high-quality innovation across the NHS, but also considerable inconsistency. Consistent achievement of high-quality care was challenged by unclear goals, overlapping priorities that distracted attention, and compliance-oriented bureaucratised management.
