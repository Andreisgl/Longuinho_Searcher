Cultural Encounters in Late Antiquity and the Middle AgesThis series concentrates on cultural issues of interaction between East and West, North and South... more This series concentrates on cultural issues of interaction between East and West, North and South, challenges the perceived alienation of one from the other and shows that substantial borrowings, not to mention syncretism, took place. Indeed, the cultural history of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages is far more a part of the history of the Mediterranean and its neighbours than it is part of the history of the division of the Mediterranean and Europe itself between East and West, North and South. General Editor: Yitzhak HenPublisher: Brepols Publishers (Turnhout, Belgium) For titles in the series, see the link:http://www.brepols.net/Pages/BrowseBySeries.aspx?TreeSeries=CELAMASave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
