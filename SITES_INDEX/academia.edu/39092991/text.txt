Stavru (eds.), Visualizing the Invisible with the Human Body: Physiognomy and Ekphrasis in the Ancient World, de Gruyter, Berlin 2019, 143-160.Alessandro StavruIn Greek literature the words physiognomy and ekphrasis never occur together: the first occurrence of the noun physiognomonia is in the Hippocratic corpus, namely in Epidemics 2.5.1, a treatise dating back to the end of the fifth century BC; while for the first technical occurrence of ekphrasis as a description of “persons, animated and inanimated things, occasions and places” we have to wait until much later: it occurs only in the first century AD, in the preliminary exercises for the training of orators, the Progymnasmata of the Alexandrian sophist Aelius Theon. We have, for sure, plenty of texts dealing with physiognomy from the Homeric epoch onwards, and we have, also from Homer onwards, ecphrastic texts describing persons, animated and inanimated things, occasions and places. This means that both practices – that of physiognomy and that of ekphrasis – exist in Graeco-Roman literatures much earlier than, and independently from, their explicit theorization. One could even go further and say that physiognomic and ecphrastic passages occur throughout Greek and Latin literature, and that their importance lies in the rhetorical effect they produce on the audience, not in the theories that have been conceived in order to explain them. Still, we face a major problem: can we associate at all the two practices of physiognomy and ekphrasis? This is a tricky question, since we do not have texts that problematize physiognomy and ekphrasis in the same context, or that establish an explicit relationship between them. What we do have is a series of texts from Aristotle to the Second Sophistic in which physiognomical and ecphrastic matters are treated in a way that makes plausible, in not altogether likely, the existence of a reciprocal connection between the two issues. This chapter focuses on the first group of texts that deal with physiognomy and ekphrasis, written either by Aristotle or by his immediate pupils, and with texts roughly belonging to the philosophical and rhetoric movement of the Second Sophistic. We shall see that both groups of texts tackle on the one hand ecphrastic issues that square with the theoretical requirements of physiognomy, on the other physiognomical matters that seem to entail an ecphrastic mode of description. This entails that physiognomy is in itself an ecphrastic practice grounded in rhetorical theory, and that, conversely, the ecphrastic description of persons relies to a great extent on the empirical data of physiognomical analysis.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersVisualizing the Invisible with the Human Body: Physiognomy and Ekphrasis in the Ancient WorldPhysiognomy, ekphrasis, and the ethnographicising register in the Second Sophistic2019 • Antti LampinenThis chapter seeks to study ethnicised physiognomical descriptions or ekphraseis of both individuals and entire population groups, primarily during the High Empire. Traditionally, physiognomical ekphraseis have been examined through the three epistemological fields where physiognomic arguments are thought to be particularly naturalised: philosophy, medical writings, and rhetoric. There is, however, at least one broad literary and ideological register that extends over and beyond these domains, yet in which physiognomising gestures are frequent: ethnographical writing. Ekphrastic techniques, for their part, were embedded in the ways in which the Greek and Roman elites communicated about their world. From their early schooling onwards, they were trained in the verbal representation of objects and agents, with plausibility – however commonplace – and vividness as the declared aims. Ethnicised exemplars were commonly used as part of such rhetorical strategies, and they were often presented in common-sense, proverbial guise: as such, they did not aim to convey new information to the audience, but to trigger and evoke the 'already-known'. Thus, I choose to call such ethnically tagged but widely shared views as 'ethnographicising' instead of 'ethngoraphical'. I will seek to show in this article that the empirical claims of ancient physiognomical rhetoric, combined with the anecdotal and wholly stereotypical exempla used therein, produced jointly a powerfully essentialising discourse on the ethnic subjects of the empire.Download Free PDFView PDFAn Embodied Reading of Epiphanies in Aelius Aristides’ Sacred Tales, Ramus 45.2 (2016).Aldo TagliabueDownload Free PDFView PDFCRAFTING IMAGES: CRITICAL AND AESTHETIC DISCOURSE IN POST- CLASSICAL GREEK LITERATUREAmanda GregoryDownload Free PDFView PDF'Ekphrasis as oral performance: Kallistratos on Skopas' Maenad', in Skopas of Paros and his world, eds.

Sept. 182–183a S.), to the icastic visualization realized by the poet through a skillful use of lexis (Anon. Subl. 3.1, 15.3–6, schol. Eum. 246b S.), to the (supposedly) spectacular visual effects of the stage production (scholl. Eum. 64b, 94a S.). For these three meanings different backgrounds are suggested, each reflecting some significant moment of Aeschylus’ Nachleben from the Hellenistic age onwards.Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Academy in Rome Address on Philostratus' GymnasticusHeather ReidWhat does Philostratus' Gymnasticus have to offer modern students and scholars of sport? To find out, we need a reading that considers historical context, Hellenic paideia, and the relationship between nature and culture. To understand Philostratus’ Gymnasticus, we must get beyond surface appearances and attune ourselves to the symbols and meanings that underpin Greek athletics. If we do this, we will learn that gymnastics is not just a form of healthy recreation, but a meaningful activity that demands education and develops a kind of ethical aesthetic. We will discover that, beyond technical expertise, wisdom is needed to make the most of our experience with sport. And, most of all, we will come to understand that those who practice and appreciate athletics constitute a community with a particular identity informed by a glorious history.Download Free PDFView PDFFaventiaLos ríos de Homero: una mirada sofística de la paideía en las "Imágenes" de Filóstrato2015 • Ivana S . ChialvaResumen Las referencias explícitas e implícitas a Homero constituyen la influencia poética más importante en las "Imágenes" de Filóstrato el Viejo. Este trabajo ofrece un análisis del proceso creativo de la mímēsis épica en tres ekphráseis de la colección, cuyo tema central son ríos de los relatos míticos. El estudio de los intertextos en las graphaí permitirá revelar cómo la segunda sofística construye una revisión del poeta ciego a su imagen y semejanza: un Homero sofista. Abstract. Rivers of Homer. A sophistic view of paideia in the Philostratus' Imagines The explicit and implicit references to Homer are the most important poetic influence in the Imagines by Philostratus the Elder. This paper provides an analysis of creative process of epic mímēsis based on three ekphráseis of his collection, whose central subject are rivers of mythical stories. The study of textual references in the graphaí will reveal how the second sophistic offers a revision of the blind poet conformed to his image and likeness: a sophist Homer.Download Free PDFView PDFClassical QuarterlySerafim, Andreas. “Making the audience: ekphrasis and rhetorical strategy in Demosthenes 18 and 19”, Classical Quarterly 65 (2015) 96-1082015 • Andreas SerafimMore information: this article redefines the notion of ekphrasis as any account credited with the ability to bring images before one’s eyes, and shows that ekphrasis, when skillfully deployed as in Demosthenes 18 and 19, is a powerful weapon in the speaker’s arsenal.

This makes it especially at home in a number of specialized (ritual and other) scenarios, and helps explain its recurrent role in the ancient Greek aesthetics and literary theory, a role that illustrates the importance of the visual and the physical in ancient theories of audiences’ emotional responses to the portrayal of suffering in both dramatic performance and non-dramatic narrative.Download Free PDFView PDF1.Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 54 (2014) 192–219.Movement and Sound on the Shield of Achilles in Ancient Exegesis2014 • Eric A CullhedDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
