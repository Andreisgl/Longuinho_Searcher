Mujibur Rahman; Kumaran Palanisamy: Review paper Integration of Biodiesel and Bioethanol Processes: Convertion of Low Cost Waste Glycerol to Bioethanol ABSTRACT The once abundant petroleum reserves now dwindling and oil prices continue to rise; the search for alternative fuels becomes more vigorous. The paper reviews current growing attention focusing on ethanol as a renewable fuel to substitute and/or complement gasoline fuel. This trend is due to, among other aspects, the growth of oil prices in the international market, and the pressure to reduce atmospheric emissions of CO 2 to mitigate the problem of global climate changes. Glycerol-rich streams generated in large amounts by during the production of biodiesel, present an excellent opportunity to establish biorefineries.

Due to its auxiliary functions in areas such as carbon dioxide sequestration and wastewater treatment, the potential of microalgae as a feedstock for biodiesel production has attracted a lot of attention from researchers all over the world. Major improvements have been made from the upstream to the downstream aspects related to microalgae processing. One of the main concerns is the high cost associated with the production of biodiesel from microalgae, which includes drying of the biomass and the subsequent lipid extraction. These two processes can be circumvented by applying direct or in situ transesterification of the wet microalgae biomass, hence substantially reducing the cost. In situ transesterification is considered as a significant improvement to commercially produce biodiesel from microalgae.

This leads to global warming and climate change, increasing the occurrence of more severe weather around the world. One promising solution to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions is methanation. Many researchers and industries are interested in CO2 methanation as a power-to-gas technology and carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. Producing an energy carrier, methane (CH4), via CO2 methanation and water electrolysis is an exceptionally effective method of capturing energy generated by renewables. To enhance methanation efficiency, numerous researches have been conducted to develop catalysts with high activity, CH4 selectivity, and stability against the reaction heat. Therefore, in this mini-review, the characteristics and recent advances of metal-based catalysts in methanation of CO2 is discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The crops and fruits produced by such means should be utilized completely; however, there are still losses and under-exploitation of these produces which has resulted in wastes being mounted in landfills. These underutilized agricultural wastes including vegetables and fruits can serve as a potential source for biofuels and green diesel. This paper discusses the main routes (e.g., biological and thermochemical) for producing biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bio-oil and green diesel from underutilized crops by emphasizing recent technological innovations for improving biofuels and green diesel yields. The future prospects of a successful production of biofuels and green diesel by this source are also explained. Underutilized lignocelluloses including fruits and vegetables serve as a prospective biofuel and green diesel generation source for the future prosperity of the biofuel industry.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
