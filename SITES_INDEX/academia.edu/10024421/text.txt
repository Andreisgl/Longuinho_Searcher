Both texts exemplify Aristotle's ambivalence in parallel ways: the Rhetoric subordinates the arousal of emotion to demonstrative and ethical argument while the Poetics ranks plot and character above emotion. In both the Rhetoric and the Poetics, Aristotle is at pains to limit emotion to artful arousal in order to attain optimal cognitive and ethical effects. In both texts, he navigates a middle course between Platonic and Gorgianic concepts of rhetoric and poetics.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPATHE: THE LANGUAGE AND PHILOSOPHY OF EMOTIONS PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE HELD IN BELGRADE ON 16 AND 17 MARCH 2017Dragana Dimitrijević, Il AkkadDownload Free PDFView PDFWalzer, Arthur E.

Ancient historians can explore the historical contingency of analogous concepts in Greek and Latin both in the theories of the major philosophical schools and in a variety of ancient texts. But (ancient) emotion history is a burgeoning field in its own right, using a wider range of literary, non-literary, visual, and material evidence. Understanding emotion is an essential tool of the ancient historian’s art, just as emotion is a fundamental aspect of ancient historiography, both as a cause of historical events and as a fundamental aspect of the presentation and reception of historical narratives.Download Free PDFView PDFchapter in the book: PATHE: THE LANGUAGE AND PHILOSOPHY OF EMOTIONS, ed. by Ljiljana Radenović, Dragana Dimitrijević and Il AkkadWhy is Tragedy Good for the Soul? Aristotle on the Tragic Emotions and katharsisIrina  DereticIn this paper, I will endeavor to point out that according to Aristotle tragedies are beneficial for a soul to a great degree. In the first section of the paper, I will elucidate his central thoughts on emotion in general, and pity and fear in particular. Subsequently, I will critically discuss, compare and contrast both ordinary and tragic fear and pity, as well as their interrelations as the defining features of the tragic genre. Additionally, I will argue that the fundamental cognitive components of pity and fear have an important impact on both Aristotle's understanding of tragic experience in general, and on one of his most controversial concepts, that of katharsis in particular. By discussing the various interpretative models in understanding katharsis, I will attempt to demonstrate why a kind of ethical perspective, which includes both emotions and cognition, is the best standpoint in accounting for tragic experience.Download Free PDFView PDFPassion, Persecution and Epiphany in Early Jewish LiteraturePathos and Passions in Josephus' Judaean War: A Tragic Vision of History and Politics2019 • Steve MasonThis is the final typescript (AAM) of a chapter that will appear in Nicholas Allen, ed., Passion, Persecution and Epiphany in Early Jewish Literature. After surveying the range of senses of Greek pathos, from suffering to emotion, incidentally arguing that the pathe of 4 Maccabees are much more instances of suffering than emotions (as usually translated), this essay explores the senses of this key term in Josephus' Judaean War. It finds that, although Josephus fuses the two senses, suffering is primary; emotion (suffering of the mind) follows from that. Finally, this emphasis on suffering connects with a deeply tragic view of political relations, which today we would call 'realist'.Download Free PDFView PDFTransformative AestheticsAristotle's theory of katharsis in its historical and social contexts2017 • Edith M Hall2017 ‘Aristotle’s theory of katharsis in its historical and social contexts’, in Erika Fischer-Lichte and Benjamin Wihstutz (eds.)
