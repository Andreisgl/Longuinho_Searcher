Leonard CurchinUniversity of Waterloo,  Classical Studies,  EmeritusRoman History+50My primary field of interest is the social history of Roman Hispania. While researching my doctoral thesis “The creation of a romanized elite in Spain” in the late 1970s, I noticed that previous scholars had paid much attention to (a) the careers of senators and equites, but not of local magistrates, and (b) the romanization process on the highly urbanized south and east coasts, but not in the interior. These realizations led first to a book on The Local Magistrates of Roman Spain, and then to a series of articles and a monograph on The Romanization of Central Spain. At the same time, Routledge commissioned me to write a general history of Roman Spain, which was subsequently translated into Spanish. I have also published studies of Indo-European and Celtic toponyms in Lusitania and Tarraconensis, in an attempt to trace the linguistic origins of the pre-Roman population.  Since much of my work involves inscriptions, I have written several articles on Hispanic epigraphy, proposing corrections to the readings of some texts, and calling attention to two sets of “forgotten” inscriptions that had escaped inclusion in the Corpus. Highlights of my epigraphic work include (a) rediscovering a long-lost equestrian career inscription from Villaricos (Almería) in the storeroom of the Musée d’Aquitaine; (b) showing that the mysterious “ICR” on a bronze inscription from Paredes de Nava (Palencia) is actually the Celtiberian word “k(a)r”, denoting a tessera hospitalis; (c) demonstrating that the supposed mention of “veteres f(ecerunt)” on an inscription from Clunia actually reads “Veteris f(ilius)”, thereby demolishing the only evidence for a supposed Galban veteran settlement in this city.Address: Waterloo, Ontario, Canadaless550 Followers121 FollowingTotal Views ;FollowFollowingCVall5 Books90 Papers1 DraftsBooksA Supplement to The Local Magistrates of Roman Spain. e-book, 2015.This monograph surveys the advances in scholarship made in the quarter-century since the publicat... more This monograph surveys the advances in scholarship made in the quarter-century since the publication of the author's The Local Magistrates of Roman Spain (1990).

While some are conventional attributes expressing the innocence or piety of the child, others are more imaginative, original and even unique. The inscriptions record qualities such as smallness of the child; modesty; intelligence; devotion to God. They lament the child's premature death, but foresee its future in heaven. The inscriptions also reflect the grief and love of bereaved parents, suggesting genuine emotions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As in other provinces, nuclear relationships (93% of the total) predominate over those of the extended family (7%). Among nuclear family commemorations, 44% are dedicated by parents, 11% by children of the deceased, 30% by spouses and 15% by siblings. Compared with other provinces, Mauretania Tingitana has an unusually high proportion of descending (parent-child) and lateral (sibling) relations; this may reflect strong familial bonds that already existed in the pre-Roman culture. The inscriptions also allow observations about inheritance, identity, marital age, affection, and gender differences.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Seven naming patterns are identified and documented with epigraphic examples. These include names that are formed from the mother's cognomen, with or without a suffix, names formed from the mother's nomen gentilicium, and cognomina that are cognate with the mother's name.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With the aid of legal, epigraphic, papyrological and literary sources, the author re-examines the functions and chronology of both regular and quasi-magistrates, among them the curator, defensor and pater civitatis.  He finds that the expense of office-holding was only part of the reason for the extinction of regular magistracies. More critical was the failure of local magistrates to control finances and protect the plebeians.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
