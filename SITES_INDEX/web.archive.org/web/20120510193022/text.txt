Ben Nevis Weather
Your daily source for weather reports on Britian's highest mountain
Ben Nevis. The highest mountain on the British Isles at 4406 feet (1344m). The "Ben" is a mountain of vast contrasts of not only natural beauty and terrain but also of weather. One hundred years ago the former observatory recorded the weather patterns every day of the year, they noted that the annual average temperature at the summit was -0.5c (31.4f), with the July average at +5c (41.1f). Average rainfall was recorded at 4001mm per year and the summit is covered in mist much of the time, with sunshine only about one fifth of the possible total. Gales lashed the summit and snow covers it, frequently to depths of 2 metres for 8 months of the year and often well into June. Although with the greenhouse effect and global warming these weather pattern have changed since then, this just means that walkers and climbers need to be ever more vigilant about the weather conditions round them, the weather can be just as severe now as it was then, but with a lot less certainty, on a sunny day in June it can quickly turn, and you can have blizzards on the summit, so knowing what the weather is, and how might change could be the difference between life a death. This site is a dedicated weather forecast for Ben Nevis, it is updated daily at 9am, and with the expertise of Geoff Monk and “The Mountain Weather Information Service” it will aid in the safety of all who climb or walk on "The Ben".
