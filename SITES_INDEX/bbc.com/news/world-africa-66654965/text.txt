People were quick to take to the streets, appearing to be genuinely delighted. So far there is little sign of a pushback.The French government has condemned the takeover, with a spokesman calling for the election results to be respected. However, French influence in Africa has waned significantly in recent years, and a call for yet more years of Ali Bongo is unlikely to go down well.Indeed the military may have seen French power ebbing and felt empowered to step in as a result, with Paris less likely to act in support of Mr Bongo.Mr Bongo's use of English in his video, rather than French which is Gabon's official language, suggests he was addressing the Commonwealth rather than France.Russia and China are among the other countries that have expressed their concern.
