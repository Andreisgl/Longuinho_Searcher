Copyright
Indian copyright law is at parity with the international
standards as contained in TRIPS. The (Indian) Copyright Act, 1957,
pursuant to the amendments in 1999, 2002 and 2012, fully reflects
the Berne Convention for Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
1886 and the Universal Copyrights Convention, to which India is a
party. India is also a party to the Geneva Convention for the
Protection of Rights of Producers of Phonograms and is an active
member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO).
"Work" protected in India
Under the Copyright Act, 1957 the term "work" includes
an artistic work comprising of a painting, a sculpture, a drawing
(including a diagram, a map, a chart or plan), an engraving, a
photograph, a work of architecture or artistic craftsmanship,
dramatic work, literary work (including computer programmes,
tables, compilations and computer databases), musical work
(including music as well as graphical notations), sound recording
and cinematographic film.
In order to keep pace with the global requirement of
harmonization, the Copyright Act, 1957 has brought the copyright
law in India in line with the developments in the information
technology industry, whether it is in the field of satellite
broadcasting or computer software or digital technology. The
amended law has also made provisions to protect performer's
rights as envisaged in the Rome Convention.
Registration of Copyright
In India, the registration of copyright is not mandatory as the
registration is treated as mere recordal of a fact. The
registration does not create or confer any new right and is not a
prerequisite for initiating action against infringement. The view
has been upheld by the Indian courts in a catena of judgments.
Need for Registration of Copyright
The awareness of Intellectual Property (IP) Laws is considerably
low among the enforcement authorities in India, and most of the IP
litigation is confined to metropolitan cities. Despite the fact
that the registration of copyright is not mandatory in India and is
protectable through the International Copyright Order, 1999, it is
advisable to register the copyright as the copyright registration
certificate is accepted as a "proof of ownership" in
courts and by police authorities, and acted upon smoothly by
them.
Enforcement of Copyright in India
The law of copyright in India not only provides for civil
remedies in the form of permanent injunction, damages or accounts
of profits, delivery of the infringing material for destruction and
cost of the legal proceedings. etc. but also makes instances of
infringement of copyright, a cognizable offence punishable with
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but
which may extend to three years with a fine which shall not be less
than Rs 50,000 (approx. US$ 800) but may extend to Rs 2,00,000
(approx. US$ 3,000). For the second and subsequent offences, there
are provisions for enhanced fine and punishment under the Copyright
Act. The (Indian) Copyright Act, 1957 gives power to the police
authorities to register the Complaint (First Information Report,
ie, FIR) and act on its own to arrest the accused, search the
premises of the accused and seize the infringing material without
any intervention of the court.
Protection to Foreign Works in India
Copyright of "works" of foreign nationals, whose
countries are member of Convention Countries to which India is a
signatory, are protected against any infringement of their
"works" in India through the International Copyright
Order, 1999. The Indian courts have also been pro-active for the
protection of copyright of foreign authors/owners, which includes
software, motion pictures including screen play of motion pictures
and database.
The Government of India is also taking initiative to combat
piracy in the software industry, motion pictures and the music
industry along with players in the industry through their
associations and organizations like NASSCOM (National Association
of Software and Service Companies), NIAPC (National Initiative
Against Piracy and Counterfeiting) etc.
Licensing and Assignment of Copyright
Copyright in any work, present or future, can only be assigned
or licensed in writing by the copyright owner or his duly
authorised agent.
Duration/Term of Copyright
In the case of original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic
works, the duration of copyright is the lifetime of the author or
artist, and 60 years counted from the year following the death of
the author.
In the case of cinematograph films, sound recordings, posthumous
publications, anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of
government and works of international organisations are protected
for a period of 60 years which is counted from the year following
the date of publication.
