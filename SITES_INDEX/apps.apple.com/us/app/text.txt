    54 years old & having fun improving my brain functions
I decided to conquer my fears of inadequacy and stay open to this app, and even in one week I can see how it’s paying off.  About six months ago, I tried it but was quickly intimidated and even uninstalled the app. This time, however, I’m staying open and not judging myself when I get incorrect answers. (Although once I did judged the app developers for an “incorrect” answer of mine, but while writing a feedback to them for why their answer and explanation to their answer were incorrect, I realized why their answer was right and what I had missed in my own deductive training to have tracked the incorrect conclusion. LOL.)  I do get a nice little dopamine hit though when I see that “Correct!” after hitting “submit.” The program presents in a way that is really encouraging to just get in there and work my mind in new ways. I noticed I feel better and more organized in my thinking when I start my day with about 20+ minutes of these kinds of brain exercises in the morning. So I have my coffee and breakfast while working through some problems in a relaxed way. I’m looking forward to trying other courses/programs after I finish the Logic one.

    Great learning platform, limited variety of learning methods
I personally am more fond of listening to lectures than reading a lesson on my own, and because of this I sometimes can find myself mindlessly grazing over a lesson without truly learning it (yeah yeah, I’m in a minority I get it)... But unfortunately, for the week or so I’ve had the app I haven’t found a lesson which has an auditory option or something that fashion. I fully understand how insignificant this problem may seem, but with a $100 annual payment I would expect my money to be going to a learning platform which can cater to my specific learning style, perhaps with a 10 minute in-depth explanation on a topic or even a whole lesson if I my attention is divided (for example if I wanted to listen to a lesson on my way to work). Other than this minor problem I’ve experienced with the app, I have enjoyed the engaging lessons and in-depth explanations. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, especially if the visual examples and written lessons are the way you personally prefer to learn. Although for those of us who prefer an auditory method of learning it can be difficult to fully take in the information in an easily digestible way. 4/5, needs more lessons in my opinion (more are coming so it’s not a terrible problem) and a way to keep learners of all styles engaged in every lesson. Great app :)

    Totally different way of learning—fun, intuitive, challenging but not intimidating
I’ve only been using Brilliant a week, but it’s so much more interesting and engaging and fun than similar learning apps.  The experience is like a combination of doing mini- courses with puzzle and game apps.  I *never* learned math this way—it would have changed the whole experience for me!  (I’m almost sixty years old and doing this mostly for fun, though I’m hoping it might help me with some novice level coding I’m also learning.) The interface is also very attractive and clean.  My only suggestion: offer two levels of explanation.  There were a few questions where the explanation was so brief, it was kind of puzzle itself.  I understand you want to keep things brief—that’s good.  That’s why I suggest two levels of explanation: first button says “Show explanation.” But then another button appears at the bottom that says, maybe, “ Need more detailed explanation?” for us beginners.  But this is a minor critique.  I’m really enjoying it.  Highly recommend!
