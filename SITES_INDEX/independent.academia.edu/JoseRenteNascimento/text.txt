This article proposes a strategy for rural and agricultural development by creating islands of favorable investment conditions within these countries, specifically focusing on Angola as a case. By examining the potential of African Savannahs as valuable resources for food, fiber, and energy production, this article presents a framework for leveraging the country's agroecological resources to reduce poverty, enhance welfare, and improve rural areas. The article highlights the importance of a conducive business environment for profitable agricultural investments, drawing insights from the successful case of Cerrado agriculture development in Brazil. Despite the existing challenges in Angola's business environment, the article emphasizes the potential for positive change and recommends a two-fold strategy for promoting sustainable development. Firstly, improving the general business environment is crucial to lay the foundation for the second part of the strategy. Secondly, the establishment of Agriculture and Rural Development Economic Zones (ARDEZs) with favorable regulations, competitive services, and reduced costs is proposed. These ARDEZs aim to attract investments, enhance profitability, and improve the competitiveness of production on local, regional, and international scales in a country with a challenging business environment. The success of ARDEZs can serve as a model for effective policies, potentially leading to the extension of favorable business conditions throughout the country. Governments can attract investments and expedite rural and agricultural development by concentrating efforts in specific regions. Ultimately, this strategy seeks to converge the business environment across the country, benefiting stakeholders in the long term and facilitating a path to sustainable and prosperous rural development.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The... more Investments in agriculture are influenced by various factors that impact their profitability. These investments are crucial in increasing food, fiber, raw material, and energy production, improving food security, reducing poverty, and enhancing overall welfare. This article analyzes the different variables and factors that affect agricultural investments and presents a causal model based on prevailing hypotheses summarizing their influences. The success of agricultural projects relies on several factors, including land features, characteristics of landowners, costs, revenues, and public policies, among others. State interventions can significantly influence the profitability of a project by directly affecting its expenses and revenues. Factors such as tax burdens, risks, land tenure security and protection, economic stability, trade policies, and infrastructure all play a role in determining the feasibility of agriculture investments. To exemplify the impact of State interventions on investors, we can consider the case of the Brazilian economy. The "Brazil cost" concept illustrates the substantial expenses, reduced revenues, and other challenges faced by businesses operating in the country due to various State interventions. The consequences of these interventions can be categorized as either seen or unseen, as well as realized or unrealized. By understanding the factors and their causal relationships, as well as the State interventions and their consequences, stakeholders can navigate the complexities of agricultural investments more effectively and make better investment decisions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ellas reconocen que los bosques y las Tierras de Vocación Forestal (TVF) traen una importante contribución a la calidad de vida de las poblaciones por medio de bienes y servicios que éstas necesitan o desean. En ese proceso de provisión de bienes y servicios, el sector forestal crea renta y riquezas, así como oportunidades de empleos, lo que atrae inversiones domésticas y extranjeras. Así, el desafío de una política forestal es asegurar que los bosques contribuyan a maximizar el bienestar de la sociedad de forma sostenible. Las tierras de vocación forestal son aquellas que, por sus características físicas e inmutables en el corto plazo de topografía, erodabilidad del suelo, y precipitación llevan a que tales tierras estén bajo riesgo de erosión y escurrimiento superficial si no cuentan con una cobertura protectora. La directiva de la política TVF requiere sencillamente que las TVF sean cubiertas por vegetación forestal u otro tipo de cobertura / uso sostenible que no genere externalidades negativas asociadas al suelo y al agua. Para que el concepto propuesto sea implementado de forma eficaz, sin embargo, es necesaria la utilización de instrumentos operativos adecuados.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Extra-sectoral drivers are driving forces of forest change that originate from beyond the forest sector and that affect forests and their social, economic, and ecological functions. Recent increases in demand for raw materials, especially in emerging economies, increased commodity prices, and the increased scale and pace of extra-sectoral investments in the forest frontier, have contributed to extra-sectoral influences eclipsing sectoral developments as key drivers of forest landscape transformation. This chapter gives a brief overview of extra-sectoral pressures on forests and the effects these have had on forest-dependent communities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Causal models were developed and best practices on the protection of property, people, animals, and crops, and on the use of fire as a management tool were determined and described.Keywords: fire, forest fire, best practices, guidelines, rural extension, technical assistance, rural development, agribusiness, rural property management, risk management, Brazil, agriculture, forest, plantations, agricultural policy, economicsSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
