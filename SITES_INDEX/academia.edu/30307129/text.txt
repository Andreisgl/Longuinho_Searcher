Yet relevant knowledge is dispersed across disciplines, which makes it unclear what we currently understand about entrepreneurs' MWB. In this systematic review I integrate insights from 144 empirical studies. These studies show that research is focused on three research questions: (1) Do different types of entrepreneur differ in their MWB? What are the (2) antecedents and (3) consequences of entrepreneurs' MWB? The review systematizes evidence on known antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurs' MWB but also reveals overlooked and undertheorized sources and outcomes of entrepreneurs' MWB. The review provides a mapping and framework that advance research on entrepreneurs' MWB and help to position entrepreneurs' MWB more centrally in management and entrepreneurship research. It calls for researchers to go beyond applying models developed for employees to understand entrepreneurs' MWB. Instead, the findings point the way to developing a dedicated theory of entrepreneurial work and MWB that is dynamic, socialized, open to considering context, and acknowledges variability and fluidity across entrepreneurs' life domains, as well as the centrality of work for entrepreneurs' identity.Download Free PDFView PDFHuman Resource ManagementEnough is Enough: Cognitive Antecedents of Workaholism and Its Aftermath2014 • Maria PeetersDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF BURNOUT, WORK ENGAGEMENT AND WORKAHOLISMBaran MetinAbstract The present study explores the interrelationships between specific work attachment styles, work engagement, workaholism and burnout, as well as their antecedents such as job demands (e.g. workload), and job resources (e.g. colleague support). Moreover, the effects of work characteristics on work and non-work related outcomes (physical health, organizational commitment and work-family harmony) are investigated as well. Structural equation analysis of data from 266 hotel employees shows that high job demands are associated with burnout and workaholism, whereas the presence of job resources is strongly related to work engagement. Work engagement was also associated with better health, increased organizational commitment and more favorable work-family harmony. Workaholism was only linked to high levels of organizational commitment. Findings support the proposed employee well-being model. The results are discussed in terms of the basic assumptions of the Job Demands-Resources Model, and practical implications for managers and employers were suggested for desired person-job fit and related consequences.Download Free PDFView PDFCareer Development InternationalSelf-efficacy and workaholism as initiators of the job demands-resources model2012 • Marco DepoloDownload Free PDFView PDFStress and esfahan steel Employees, Iran, presented on OHP Vol9 2010 CD, pgae 222masoud lotfizadehDownload Free PDFView PDFA Meticulous Overview on Job Burnout and Its Effects on Health Dr Riaz A MangiDownload Free PDFView PDFFrom Burn-Out to Burn-Up - Useful Intervention Programs and Research [Working Title]Over Engagement, Protective or Risk Factor of Burnout?Paola OchoaDownload Free PDFView PDFBook of Procedings of the 10th Conference European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology.Well-being at the workplace: the need for a psychological counselling service – an exploratory case study2012 • Serviço de Psicologia  Universidade da Madeira, Carla Vale Lucas, Filipa OliveiraDownload Free PDFView PDFApplied PsychologyUnderstanding Workaholics' Motivations: A Self-Determination Perspective2011 • Hans De WitteDownload Free PDFView PDFResearch in Occupational Stress and Well-beingCrossover of stress and strain in the family and workplace2002 • Mina WestmanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
