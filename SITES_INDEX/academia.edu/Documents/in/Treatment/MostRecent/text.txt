Materials and Methods Two experimental eggshell toothpastes, based on natural ingredients, with or without titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNPs) were produced and coded “TNPs eggshell toothpaste [TNPsESTP]” or “eggshell toothpaste [ESTP],” respectively. Mid-coronal dentin discs, from 28 human extracted molar teeth, etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 60 seconds to simulate the hypersensitive dentin, were randomly divided into four groups—G1: no treatment (negative control), G2: ESTP treated, G3: TNPsESTP treated, and G4: Biorepair treated (positive control). All treated discs were brushed for 2 weeks and 1 month using a toothbrush simulator at 40 mm/s.

Grudna bol je odgovorna za 0,3% do 1% posjeta hitnim pedijatrijskim službama. Veliki broj pacijenata i njihovih roditelja grudna bol asocira na srčanu bol kod odraslih, prvenstveno infarkt s fatalnim posljedicama. Takav stav potpomognut je izrazitom medijskom pažnjom koja se pridaje iznenadnim smrtima u mladih sportaša kao i naporima zdravstvenih vlasti da upozore na potrebu prevenciju srčanih bolesti. U djece, za razliku od odraslih, grudna bol vrlo rijetko je izazvana ozbiljnim stanjem, poglavito bolestima srca. Procjenjuje se da je samo od 1-4% grudnih boli izazvano bolestima srca. Zbog straha od potencijalno smrtonosne bolesti obitelj i sam pacijent traže odgovor na to da li je djetetovo srce zdravo ili nije i skoro svako dijete iz hitne ambulante bude upućeno na daljnju kardiološku obradu što stvara nemale troškove cijelom zdravstvenom sustavu.

Methodology: This retrospective study was conducted in Bone Care trauma center Heerabad  Hospital Hyderabad Pakistan from March 2019 to March 2020. A total of 74 patients of age between  60 to 70 years were selected. All the selected patients were diagnosed with femoral neck fractures (Garden’s III and IV). Harris&#39;s hip score was used to evaluate the clinical status of patients with pain, whereas we used Palmer and Parker&#39;s mobility to access mobility. Implant breakage, screw cut, and nonunion were considered as parameters of osteosynthesis failure. At the same time, hemiarthroplasty failure was defined as two or more recurrent dislocation, aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture, and infection.

La medida internacionalmente aceptada es el índice de masa corporal (IMC) (peso sobre talla al cuadrado), tanto para los niños, adolescentes y adultos. Donde hay diferencias es en los patrones de referencia utilizados, y esto es necesario tomarlo muy en cuenta. Los estudios en mujeres gestantes y no gestantes, independientemente de la referencia que se use, reportan que el principal problema existente es el sobrepeso y la obesidad. En razón de este diagnóstico, el tratamiento es bajar de peso, reconociendo que alcanzar el objetivo es sumamente difícil dado el poco tiempo con que se cuenta y, por otro lado, la creencia que tiene la gestante que eso puede representar un riesgo para su gestación y su producto.

The structural features of muscle that predict function are termed &quot;muscle architecture&quot;. Although the architectural features of &quot;normal&quot; rotator cuff muscles are known, they are poorly understood in the context of cuff pathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of tear and repair on RC muscle architecture. To this end thirty cadaveric shoulders were grouped into one of four categories based on tear magnitude: Intact, Full-thickness tear (FTT), Massive tear (MT), or Intervention if sutures or hardware were present, and key parameters of muscle architecture were measured. We found that muscle mass and fiber length decreased proportionally with tear size, with significant differences between all groups.

We report a case of a 30 year old male Caucasian patient with accidental severe hypothermia who was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital after prolonged exposure in the urban city&#39;s night environment cold as a result of alcohol and drugs abuse. The patient was found unconscious in the first early hours from onlookers. The time that the patient remained unconscious is unknown. During the transfer to the hospital because of cardiac arrest cardiopulmonary resuscitation began. In the emergency department an extracorporeal life support system (ECLS) was implanted under cardiopulmonary resuscitation in order to achieve hemodynamic stabilization and rapid and safe rewarming. The patient&#39;s rewarming lasted 6 hours.

The design was a single-institution observational cohort study in an ICU of a tertiary university hospital. Our cohort included 248 oncology patients admitted to the ICU from 2005 to 2014 due to nonsurgical problems. Seventy-six (30.6%) patients had received CT in the month before admission (CT group) and 172 did not receive CT (control group). The main outcome measures were ICU, hospital, 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities. We performed survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, comparing both groups using the log-rank test, and multivariate analysis using Cox regression adjusted for gender, age, maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and delta maximum SOFA to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals.

To evaluate surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) and the average corneal power change in symmetric intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation. Methods. The study included 34 eyes of 34 keratoconus patients who underwent symmetric Intacs SK ICRS implantation. The corneal pocket incision meridian was the preoperative steep meridian. Corneal power data were obtained before and 3 months after Intacs SK ICRS implantation using scanning-slit topography. Polar value analysis was used to evaluate the SIA. Hotelling&#39;s trace test was used to compare intraindividual changes. Results. Three months postoperatively, the combined mean polar value for SIA changed significantly (Hotelling&#39;s T(2) = 0.375; P = 0.006). The SIA was 1.54 D at 99° and the average corneal power decreased significantly by 3.8 D. Conclusion.

Retinal complications can be sight-threatening, and diabetic patients often miss the suggested yearly clinical examination. METHODS Teleretinography can be easily performed in patients attending Diabetes Clinics: images are sent to a remote ophthalmologist, grading and instructions are received and forwarded to General Practitioners by a dedicated software. RESULTS We here report the results of teleretinography performed in our Diabetes Clinic in 362 patients missing the yearly fundus examination: 253 patients showed no diabetic retinopathy, 86 a mild form, and 23 needed referral to hospital settings. CONCLUSIONS Teleretinography is a user-friendly, time-saving and cost-effective technique, easily integrable into integrated care, allowing a better adherence to guidelines.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stefania Melena•  4  Medicine, Diabetes mellitus, Diabetic Retinopathy, ReferralTopical Paromomycin with or without Gentamicin for Cutaneous LeishmaniasisSave to LibraryDownloadby aicha boukthir•  20  Dermatology, Adolescent, Medicine, LeishmaniasisThe Power of Probiotics to Combat Urinary Tract Infections: A Comprehensive ReviewUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and can cause significant morbidity, particularly in women.

Recurrent UTIs are a significant clinical problem, and current prophylactic measures, such as antibiotics, are associated with side effects and the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host, have emerged as a potential alternative to traditional treatments for recurrent UTIs. Probiotics can act by modulating the host&#39;s immune system, competitively excluding uropathogens, and producing antibacterial substances, such as bacteriocins. Clinical evidence supports the use of probiotics as a safe and effective intervention for the prevention and treatment of recurrent UTIs. However, selecting appropriate probiotic strains for UTIs can be challenging, and the safety and efficacy of probiotics depend on the strain, dosage, and timing of administration.

Copolymeric nanocarriers were synthesized using a microemulsion polymerization method previously reported. These nanocarriers can show selective swellingâ€“collapse response under changes in local environments such a temperature, pH, solvent composition and electrical stimuli. The employ of these kinds of systems permits a controlled and selective delivery and release on specific human tissues. High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique was used to allow the detection of combinated mixtures of different active principles of antiâ€“TB drugs using an acetonitrile mobile phase at 0.5 mL/min of flow rate whit a Spherisorb ODS2, C18 column. The results obtained suggest that the employ of smart nanohydrogels is a novel method in several tuberculosis therapies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria Isabel Casiva Gaitán•  6  Chemistry, Rifampicin, Isoniazid, PyrazinamideNextLast »Related TopicsRole of MicroorganismsFollowFollowingWastewaterFollowFollowingMicroorganismsFollowFollowingEtiologyFollowFollowingTextile industryFollowFollowingEpidemiologyFollowFollowingSpecial Educational NeedsFollowFollowingWater and wastewater treatmentFollowFollowingSurgeryFollowFollowingTechniqueFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
