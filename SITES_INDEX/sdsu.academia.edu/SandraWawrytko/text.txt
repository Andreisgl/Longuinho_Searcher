The historical record for this period of several hundred years between the Han and Tang dynasties, which coincided with social, political, and cultural upheavals, is sparse. Two key sources for consideration are the Chinese monk Zhi Dun (314–366) and The Awakening of Faith in the Mahāyāna (Dasheng Qixin Lun) (550). Liu Yiqing (403–444)’s A New Account of Tales of the World (Shishou Xinyu) provides tantalizing glimpses of the philosophical reconfiguration, including mutations of Confucianism and the emergence of Xuanxue in Daoism.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Killers often identify themselves as outsiders, and many have been marginalized and bullied. Gun supporters perceive themselves as free and independent spirits, latter day Minuteman stalwartly defending the Constitution. Gun sellers, seemingly devoid of compassion, assume that like any savvy businessperson they are simply supplying what people demand. Buddhist epistemology exposes the delusory ātman at the core of our misidentifications as individuals and groups.

Wandering through the mountains of Tibet he encountered a wide range of human types, from shepherds, bandits, and logicians, to housewives, merchants, kings, and scholars, even a dying follower of the Bon religion that preceded Buddhism in Tibet. One encounter of special interest is Milarepa&#39;s meeting with two very different women, a bitter old housewife and an accomplished young aspirant of Buddhism. [41] What is remarkable about this encounter is the absence of sexist overtones one would generally expect given the historical period and cultural context. Nonetheless, Milarepa is not oblivious to the fact that he lived in a time and a culture that had very restrictive roles for women. It is not so much that Milarepa is a proto-feminist. Rather, as an awakened being, he had transcended the superficialities of human conditioning, including gender stereotypes.

I argue tha... more Much has been said about the relationship between Buddhism and Western psychotherapy. I argue that both the ends and the means of Buddhist practice far exceed the limitations of Western psychotherapy in its dominant forms. This claim is substantiated by examining the underlying views of human nature in the broader context of cosmic Nature, as these reflect the assumed nature of the therapeutic task. Special attention is given to the universal human encounter with death as the ultimate manifestation of dukkha. My conclusions may be summarized as follows: 1)Western psychotherapy, rooted in ancient Greek assumptions and represented by strains as diverse as Sigmund Freud and Abraham Maslow, essentially views human nature as internally weak and thus largely controlled by &quot;objective&quot; external forces. Consequently, it conceives of its task in terms of teaching patients to cope with existing conditions, that is, how to tread water in the samsaric sea. Its response to death, as exp...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Poetry offers possibilities of indirection and evocation far beyond those of any prose style.

In this way, ＂Artistic appreciation is...transformed into meditation.＂ This paper discusses the pivotal role played by poetry,as it evolved from the Sanskrit gatha found in Buddhist sutras, within the Ch&#39;an sect of Buddhism.

The non-discriminating mind encompasses both stereotypically “feminine” and “masculine” strengths, without privileging one over the other or consigning them to specific subsets of beings. The most obvious melding of these qualities is found in trans-gendered bodhisattva figures, for whom Wisdom (prajñā智慧; Mañjuśrī, Wenshu 文殊) naturally evolves into and aligns with Compassion (karuṇā 慈悲; Avalokiteśvara, Guanshiyin 觀世音), thus equipping one for complete Practice (ayana行; Samantabhadra, Puxian 普賢). This essay analyzes the philosophy of nondualism delineated in Buddhist texts to illuminate ways in which discussions of gender transcend the confines of feminist theory, while contributing to its ends.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
