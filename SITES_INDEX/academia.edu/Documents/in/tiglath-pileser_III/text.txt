This paper suggests a new approach to their dating. While scholars have generally maintained that Amoian corpus displays no knowledge of the Neo-Assyrian campaigns of the eighth century BCE,1 the analysis presented here shows a striking adherence—specifically to the annals of Tiglathpileser III—revealed through paronomasia, allegories and metaphors carefully crafted by the Amosian author(s).Save to LibraryDownloadby Gad Barnea•  11  Hebrew Bible, Metaphor, Akkadian Language, AkkadianThe Economics of Mass Deportation in the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Tiglath-Pileser IIISave to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Sarlo•  5  Economics, Assyrian Empire, Neo-Assyrian studies, tiglath-pileser IIICarl S.

Second, to offer a synthetic reconstruction of the course of Philistine history between 1000-730 BCE, employing the results of the textual study in conjunction with those of recent archaeological excavations in Philistia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carl S Ehrlich•  8  Hebrew Bible, Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East, Philistines, Ancient IsraelAssyrian and biblical chronologies are they reliable?Mainstream historians, without exception, consider that co-regencies never existed among Assyrian dynasties, because according to an ideological dogma “the king never shares power, even with his Crown Prince”, but at the same time,... moreMainstream historians, without exception, consider that co-regencies never existed among Assyrian dynasties, because according to an ideological dogma “the king never shares power, even with his Crown Prince”, but at the same time, paradoxically, the biblical chronology of Thiele with its 9 fanciful co- regencies is accepted with blind faith. It should be emphasized that this widespread belief is completely contradicted by an accurate chronological analysis. Thus Sennacherib and Tiglath-pileser III, two famous Assyrian kings quoted in the Bible, played a crucial role in Israel during their co-regencies. Sennacherib's campaign to Judah, with the siege of Lachish and Jerusalem and the Battle of Eltekeh, occurred in 712 BCE during the 10th campaign of Sargon II (722-705) and the 3rd campaign of Sennacherib his coregent (715-705), which agrees exactly with the biblical account states that all these events occurred during the 14th year of Judean King Hezekiah (726-697) also dated 712 BCE (2Ki 18:13-17, 19:9; 2Ch 32:9- 10; Is 20:1, 36:1, 37:9). Similarly the Israelite king Menahem (771-760) had to pay a tribute (in 765 BCE) to an Assyrian king Pul (2Ki 15:19-20). The Assyrian word “pulu” means “the heir (ie Crown Prince)”, which is found in the name of Tiglath-pil-eser (2Ki 15:29). King Pul(as) reigned 36 years according to Josephus (Jewish Antiquities IX: 283-287) that exactly matches the Assyrian king (coregent) known by his Aramaic name Bar-Ga’yah “Son of Majesty” who reigned from 782 to 746 BCE.https://www.amazon.com/Assyrian-biblical-chronologies-they-reliable/dp/1326521217/Save to LibraryDownloadby Gerard GERTOUX•  18  Assyriology, Relative-Absolute dating, Neo-Assyrian studies, ChronologyThe Royal Inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III (744–727 BC) and Shalmaneser V (726–722 BC), Kings of Assyria.

Dating the New Kingdom in Egypt a minimum of 243 years later than generally accepted implies the existence of contemporaneous kings in Assyria. In the Assyrian King List Enlil-kudur-usur appears as the last king of the lineage of Ashur-uballit I, then is mentioned Ninurta-apil-Ekur son of Ili-pada descendant of Eriba-Adad. We assume that Ili-pada is the grandson of Eriba-Adad I and Ninurta-apil-Ekur started a second royal branch. The consequence is that Ashur-dan II is the son of Tiglath-pileser I. The rearrangement of the Assyrian Kings results in a reduction of about 250 years.

Since 1987, the University-of-Helsinki-based Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project (NATCP), which was founded and directed by Simo Parpola, has published twenty-one of its twenty-two planned volumes, as well as over forty other books in its supplemental series State Archives of Assyria Studies (SAAS) and State Archives of Assyria Cuneiform Texts (SAACT). The 5056 Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian texts published in the SAA series, as well as in one volume of SAAS (volume 2), primarily originate from British excavations carried out in the citadel of Nineveh (modern Kuyunjik) between 1850 and 1905 and those conducted at Calah (modern Nimrud) in the early 1950s, and, therefore, most of them are now housed in the British Museum in London; some are presently in the Iraq Museum (Baghdad). In 2005, at a time when many of the SAA volumes were out of print or difficult to get hold of, longtime NATCP member Karen Radner (then UCL, now LMU Munich) sought out ways of making NATCP's rich and varied heritage data accessible to a wider audience. In collaboration with Eleanor Robson (then University of Cambridge, now UCL) and Steve Tinney (University of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), this led to the creation of State Archives of Assyria online (SAAo), with the first parts of the dataset available from 2007 and 2009 via the open-access web resources Knowledge and Power and Assyrian Empire Builders. The aim of SAAo, which has been part of the LMU-Munich-based Munich Open-access Cuneiform Corpus Initiative (MOCCI; directed by Karen Radner and Jamie Novotny) since August 2015, is to make the 5056 Neo-Assyrian texts published in the State Archives of Assyria Series available online for free in a fully searchable and richly annotated (lemmatised) format, as well as to widely disseminate, facilitate, and promote the active use of these important cuneiform sources in academia and beyond. SAAo and MOCCI's electronic text editions are implemented with and hosted on the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (ORACC; http://oracc.org). For further details, see the "About the Project" page.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamie Novotny and +4Nathan MorelloKaren RadnerMikko LuukkoMelanie Groß•  20  Ancient History, Digital Humanities, Near Eastern Studies, AssyriologyThe Brook of Egypt and Assyrian Policy on the Egyptian Border, Tel Aviv 6 (1979), pp. 68-90.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nadav Na'aman•  6  Esarhaddon, tiglath-pileser III, Gaza, Sinai Peninsula, EgyptThe Kingdom of Arpad (B i  t Ag  u si) and ‘All Aram': International Relations in Northern Syria in the Ninth and Eighth Centuries BCEIntroduction The purpose of this paper is to survey the role of Arpad in the politics of 9th–8th centuries BCE in Northern Syria.

Several stages in the development of the Kingdom of Arpad are identified. In stage 1 Arpad is a relatively independent state. Arame, its second king submitted to Assyria freely in 858 BCE and did not participate in subversive alliances. In stage 2 Arpad was subjugated to Assyria as was the rest of northern Syria and southern Anatolia. In stage 3 Arpad led the opposition to the Assyrian weakened hegemony and became independent from ca. 823 at the earliest. Stage 4 is characterized by the supremacy of Hazael, King of Aram-Damascus from 823 at the earliest and 805 at the latest. In Stage 5 (ca.800 BCE–754 BCE) the rise of the Kingdom of Hamath-and-Lu‘ash in the south and of Urartu in the North influenced the status of Arpad and the Assyrian ability to be involved in the Levant. After a few Assyrian campaigns against Hazrak (capital of Lu‘ash) its hegemony was broken. The Kingdom of Arpad could rise and thrive (stage 6: 754–744 BCE). Now Arpad could incorporate or be in close confederation with Hamath, creating a new entity, which was designated "all Aram". This can be inferred from the Sefîre treaty concluded between Bar-Ga’yah, king of KTK, and Mati‘-ilu, son of ‘Attaršumki, King of Arpad. In the final stage (stage 7) of the history of Arpad, Tiglath-Pileser III campaigned four years against Arpad, the capital of Arpad, (743–740 BCE) until it was conquered and was reduced into a province of the Assyrian empire.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan'el Kahn•  11  Assyrian Empire, Neo-Assyrian studies, Aramaic inscriptions, tiglath-pileser IIITiglath-pileser III's Aid to Ahaz: a New Look at the Problems of the Biblical Accounts in the Light of the Assyrian SourcesThis study examines the discrepancy in the biblical text’s account of Tiglath-pileser III’s aid to Ahaz during the Syro-Ephraimite crisis in light of the Assyrian sources.

II Kings 16:5-9 (and Isaiah 7) states that Tiglath-pileser helped Ahaz by repelling the attacks of the Syro-Ephraimite coalition, while II Chronicles 28:5-21 proclaims that Tiglath-pileser failed to help the Judean king. Previous studies have attempted to resolve the textual conflict by way of literary analysis or textual emendation. By undertaking an historical methodology of the biblical text and an examination of the Assyrian sources, the case is made that while the biblical accounts contradict each other in specific areas, there are key elements that are historically accurate in both accounts which are in complete accord with the Assyrian sources, and in turn clarify the biblical accounts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Luis Siddall•  9  Theology, Assyriology, Hebrew Bible, Biblical StudiesForced Participation in Alliances in the Course of the Assyrian Campaigns to the West, in M.

Despite a decrease in textual-pictorial sources, some Assyrian kings are better known and revitalized Assyria briefly, including Tiglath-pileser I (1114-1076 BCE).  The lecture proceeds next to cover the Neo-Assyrian period/empire, the advent of which is usually equated with King Ashur-dan II (ca. 934–912 BCE).  The remainder of the lecture provides a summary of the achievements of and events affiliated with a sequence of 18 Assyrian rulers --in relation to Babylonia, Elam, and other lands (e.g., the Levant): Adad-Nirari II (911–891 BC); Tukulti-Ninurta II (890–884 BC); Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC); Shalmaneser III (858-824 BC); Shamsi-Adad V (823-811 BC); Adad-nirari III (810-783 BC); Shalmaneser IV (782-773 BC); Ashur-Dan III (772-755 BC); Ashur-Nirari V (754-745 BC); Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 BC); Shalmaneser V (726-722 BC); Sargon II (721-705 BC); Sennacherib (704-681 BC); Esarhaddon (681/680-669 BC); Ashurbanipal (668-?627 BC); Ashur-Etelli-ilani (?627-?624 BC); Sin-Sharra-Ishkun (?623-612 BC); and Ashur-uballit II (612-610 BC). The lecture concludes with the last years in which an allied Egyptian (Saite) army and Assyrian force holdout in West Syria (610-605 BC) prior to the Neo-Babylonian's final defeat of this residual Neo-Assyrian-Egyptian alliance in 605 BC.

The Northern Kingdom rebelled against Assyrian domination circa 734 BCE – an event heralded by the murder of Pekahiah, the son of Menachem, and the accession of Pekah to the Israelite throne in 736 BCE.⁴ Tiglath-pileser responded to the general unrest in the region by conducting three campaigns⁵ to the west, including at least one against Israel, between the years 734 and 732 BCE.⁶ This resultedSave to LibraryDownloadby Norma Franklin•  7  Assyriology, Archaeology of Ancient Israel, Assyrian Empire, tiglath-pileser IIIAshkelon under the Assyrian Empire, in J.D.

Eight hundred and fifty to nine hundred such inscriptions are known today. The Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP) Project, under the direction of Professor Grant Frame of the University of Pennsylvania, will publish in print and online all of the known royal inscriptions that were composed during the reigns of the Assyrian kings Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 BC), Shalmaneser V (726-722 BC), Sargon II (721-705 BC), Sennacherib (704-681 BC), Esarhaddon (680-669 BC), Ashurbanipal (668-ca. 631 BC), Aššur-etel-ilāni (ca. 631-627/626 BC), Sîn-šumu-līšir (627/626 BC), Sîn-šarra-iškun (627/626-612 BC), and Aššur-uballiṭ II (611-609 BC), rulers whose deeds were also recorded in the Bible and in some classical sources. The individual texts range from short one-line labels to lengthy, detailed inscriptions with over 1200 lines (4000 words) of text. These Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions (744-609 BC) represent only a small, but important part of the vast Neo-Assyrian text corpus. They are written in the Standard Babylonian dialect of Akkadian and provide valuable insight into royal exploits, both on the battlefield and at home, royal ideology, and Assyrian religion. Most of our understanding of the political history of Assyria, and to some extent of Babylonia, comes from these sources. Because this large corpus of texts has not previously been published in one place, the RINAP Project will provide up-to-date editions (with English translations) of Assyrian royal inscriptions from the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 BC) to the reign of Aššur-uballiṭ II (611-609 BC) in seven print volumes and online, in a fully lemmatized and indexed format. The aim of the project is to make this vast text corpus easily accessible to scholars, students, and the general public.

These motifs include the unique motif of the establishment of a monument on the border with Egypt, and Assyrian attempts to dominate Egypt by controlling its trade. The essay also demonstrates the dependence of parts of Isaiah 19 on material in Exodus 1-15, integrating specific phrases from these Exodus chapters with motifs known to us from Assyrian royal inscriptions. This integration could only have taken place during the Assyrian period (late 8th-early 7th centuries), and this has obvious implications for the dating of the Exodus text.  The essay understands the prophecy as a re-envisioning of the Assyrian campaign of 734, part of which was directed at Egypt. In this re-envisioned campaign, YHWH Himself is directing the Assyrian attack (Isa. 19:1-4) on Egypt. The essay focuses on 19:19-25, which describe how the Egyptians suffer as a result of the Assyrian attack. In their despair, they acknowledge the sovereignty of YHWH. This recognition is based on the Assyrian model of recognizing the Assyrian king as universal sovereign, and the monument described in v. 22 is based on the monument established by the Assyrians on the Egyptian border. The behavior of the Egyptians in vv. 20-22 provokes the unique theological statements of vv. 23-25, in which Egypt and Assyria join Israel in a triad blessed by YHWH. This passage demonstrates Isaiah's use of a sort of "replacement theology" in which the universal sovereignty of YHWH is imagined and described based on Assyrian claims of universal dominion.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shawn Z Aster•  8  Book of Isaiah, Isaiah, tiglath-pileser III, Neo AssyriansBorders and Districts in Descriptions of the Conquest of the West in Tiglath-pileser III's Inscriptions and in Biblical Historiography, State Archives of Assyria Bulletin16 (2007), pp. 40-61.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nadav Na'aman•  5  tiglath-pileser III, Borders Delineation, Assyrian provinces, HatarikkaNew chronology using solar eclipses, Volume IIIPerhaps everyone interested in reading, for example, the history of Assyria, Babylon and Egypt, has at some point noticed some references to solar eclipses observed at that distant time.

Because there are significant discrepancies in extant primary sources, in particular between the Old Testament and Assyrian inscriptions, scholars have yet to satisfactorily answer the most important questions about this crucial period of history of the Levant. Assyrian sources, especially royal inscriptions, may provide some key pieces to the puzzle, but what can they tell us about the last twenty to thirty years of the kingdom of Israel, the fall of Samaria, and the fate of Hoshea?  This paper will examine the available inscriptions of the eighth- and seventh-century Assyrian kings in order to elucidate what information that genre of Akkadian text can and cannot provide with regard to the history of Israel. Special attention will be given to potential lost sources to determine if new Assyrian texts could really help scholars solve some of the mysteries of the Bible. This paper will serve as a general introduction to the more topic-specific papers given in Part I of this book. Nevertheless, I do hope to say a few things not covered in the other presentations. As a word of warning, at least one section of this paper will be purely speculative. However, these conjectures will be deeply rooted in the extant source material of Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamie Novotny•  20  Ancient History, Assyriology, Akkadian Language, AkkadianTwo notes on the History of Ashkelon and Ekron in the Late Eighth-Seventh Century B.C.E., Tel Aviv 25 (1998), pp. 219-227.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nadav Na'aman•  4  tiglath-pileser III, Ekron, Mitinti of Ashkelon, Dan's inheritance2020 - "Yeni Asur İmparatorluğu’nda Taht Mücadeleleri ve Darbeler (Throne Struggles and Coups in the Neo-Assyrian Empire)", Tarih Araştırmaları Dergisi (TAD), C.39/S.68, 2020, s.50-88The absence of a strictly determined inheritance system in Assyria caused the royal members, especially princes, to struggle on the throne.

In spite of the fact that the king was unable to gather all the power in themselves and establish a strong governance, some royal members made plans to seize the throne from the palace with the help of his supporters. When these people found sufficient support for them, they started a rebellion and tried to stage a coup the king. The subject of this study is Aššur-da‘in-apla‘s rebellion, rebellion of Kalhu, Sargon II‘s ascending, Urdu-Mulissu‘s rebellion and the Šamaš-šumu-ukīn‘s rebellion. In this study, the throne rebellions and the coups that took place in the Neo-Assyrian Empire Period will be discussed. The connection with the Assyrian inheritance system of these actions and the measures taken will be presented in the light of the documents.

Isaiah started to Prophesy during the last year of Uzziah. His last datable activity was recorded during Sennacherib's campaign against Judah in 701 BCE. However, it is clear that not all the material which is found in First Isaiah is to be dated to his time. It is possible to find additions of a later date in the text. No scholarly consensus exists today regarding the appropriate methods by which the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible, including the book of Isaiah, are to be analyzed. The diachronic classical methodology employed by the late nineteenth and early twentieth century critics sought to distinguish, by means of literary-historical considerations, between a given prophet's actual words and later additions to and revisions of that prophet's message added by scribes and exegetes, in order to reconstruct the different compositional stages of prophetic books. The study of the book of Isaiah has advanced immeasurably in the last decade within the 'traditional' literary-historical method. However, dating biblical texts based only on classical biblical research, such as intertextuality, the development of religious ideas or grammar, as is mostly done, is problematic. In contrast, one of the main tendencies in contemporary Biblical studies is to read prophetic books as uniform and homogeneous literary works which are all late, at least as late as the time of their final production. Biblical scholarship has shifted in the last decades towards an aestethic-literary synchronic analysis. Thus, there has been an increasing tendency in recent scholarship to question whether it is even possible to perform such a reconstruction of the compositional stages of Proto-Isaiah. According to contemporary trend in Biblical studies, the original core of the book of Isaiah remains concealed behind the long process of reshaping and reformulation within the book. Scholars are reluctant to attempt reconstructing its compositional stages. Naturally, this tendency disregards the stages in the formation of the prophetic literature and their original ‘Sitz im Leben’. Others, combine the synchronic approach with a diachronic approach.  As a consequence, there exists a growing trend in scholarship that views the prophetic books, including Isaiah, as a creation of the Persian and the Hellenistic periods. Such a viewpoint disregards the ancient origins of the prophetic literature, or views it as mere literature, without inquiring into the historical circumstances behind their composition.It is commonly accepted that much of the material in Proto-Isaiah is not original to the prophet. The oracles in the Book of Isaiah are commonly dated to a variety of periods: Conservative scholars date most of the work to the eighth century, the period of Isaiah himself;  others to a Josianic/"Assyrian redaction - end 7th century;  to the Exilic or postexilic Persian period, whether composed by Deutero or Trito Isaiah (6/5th and 5/4th c. BCE);  to the Hellenistic (4th-3rd centuries) or even late Hellenistic/ Maccabean period (ca. 150 BCE).  This clearly affects the question of composition and understanding of the book. Furthermore, setting certain oracles in the wrong historical context hampers the understanding of the original intent of the prophecies.In the following, I will survey various prophecies in the Book of First Isaiah and will date them chronologically according to historical events which they reflect. It seems that during the ministry of Isaiah, as well as during the decades after his death, there was a continuous and constant "Fortschreibung" i.e, updating, editing and composing of prophecies relevant to international relations, the fate of the exiles and God's intervention in these issues. On the other hand, the lack of major editing and additions dating to the Post Exilic Period (neither Persian nor Hellenistic) would point to the finalizing of the bulk of the Book of First Isaiah just a couple of decades before the earliest datable prophesies in Deutero-Isaiah mentioning Cyrus, King of Persia. This has ramifications on the editing process of the Book of Isaiah, a subject, which is highly debated in the past decades.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan'el Kahn•  17  Ashurbanipal, The Book of Isaiah, Taharqa, EsarhaddonФЕНОМЕН УЗУРПАЦИИ В НОВОАССИРИЙСКОЙ ИМПЕРИИ PHENOMENON OF USURPATION IN THE NEO-ASSYRIAN EMPIREИсследование посвящено рассмотрению проблем узурпаторства в Ассирийской империи и специфики легитимации власти, полученной путем ее захвата.
