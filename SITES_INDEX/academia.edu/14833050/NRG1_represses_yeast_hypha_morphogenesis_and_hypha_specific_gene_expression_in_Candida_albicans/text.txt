The major plant pathogens Ustilago maydis and Magnaporthe grisae form hyphae that penetrate their hosts in the early stages of infection . Transitions from avirulent ®lamentous forms to virulent unicellular forms are essential for the establishment of Histoplasma capsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infections in humans . The most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, undergoes reversible morphological transitions between unicellular yeast-like, pseudohyphal and hyphal growth forms, which contribute to disease establishment and progression . The yeast form is probably disseminated more effectively than ®lamentous forms, whereas the hyphal form seems better adapted to penetrate tissue and is thought to help the fungus evade host defences .See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMolecular MicrobiologyTranscript profiling in Candida albicans reveals new cellular functions for the transcriptional repressors CaTup1, CaMig1 and CaNrg12001 • Abdul Munir Abdul MuradDownload Free PDFView PDFEukaryotic CellDevelopmental Regulation of an Adhesin Gene during Cellular Morphogenesis in the Fungal Pathogen Candida albicans2007 • Richard WalmsleyDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biological ChemistryDNA Array Studies Demonstrate Convergent Regulation of Virulence Factors by Cph1, Cph2, and Efg1 in Candida albicans2001 • song zhouDownload Free PDFView PDFEukaryotic CellPseudohyphal Regulation by the Transcription Factor Rfg1p in Candida albicans2010 • Anna LazzellDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS ONEA Core Filamentation Response Network in Candida albicans Is Restricted to Eight Genes2013 • Sascha BrunkeDownload Free PDFView PDFthe hyphal-associated adhesin and invasin Als3 of Candida albicans mediates iron acquisition from host ferritin2008 • Sascha BrunkeDownload Free PDFView PDFMolecular Biology of the CellThe Yak1 Kinase Is Involved in the Initiation and Maintenance of Hyphal Growth in Candida albicans2008 • Jean-yves CoppéeDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS ONEThe Candida albicans-Specific Gene EED1 Encodes a Key Regulator of Hyphal Extension2011 • Derek SullivanDownload Free PDFView PDFEukaryotic CellMsn2- and Msn4-Like Transcription Factors Play No Obvious Roles in the Stress Responses of the Fungal Pathogen Candida albicans2004 • Malcolm WhitewayDownload Free PDFView PDFEukaryotic CellEctopic Expression of URA3 Can Influence the Virulence Phenotypes and Proteome of Candida albicans but Can Be Overcome by Targeted Reintegration of URA3 at the RPS10 Locus2004 • Alistair BrownDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
