I'm happy to announce the availability of MediaWiki 1.21.1 -- a
maintenance release in the 1.21 series.
== What's new? ==
* An incorrect version number was used for 1.21.0.  1.21.1 has the
correct number.
* A problem with the Oracle SQL table creation was fixed.
* (PdfHandler extension) Fix warning if pdfinfo fails but pdftext succeeds.

Imagination does not breed insanity. Exactly what does breed insanity
    is reason. Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do.
