The views of the two invited speakers, who raised concerns about the impact of post-modernism on political projects, are reported. The content of the general discussion around subjectivity, agency and structure are then set out. The group struggled with the possibilities and limitations of theory in these areas. In discussing how feminist theory might be taken forward, the group stressed the centrality and necessity of collectivities as enabling resistance and other expressions of agency. The group felt that further exploration and analysis of the notion of and feelings of selfhood are necessary to adequately conceptualize individual and collective agency, and the way in which structure inflects such agency and collectivities. Such work would also need to attend to issues of 'difference' such as social class and ethnicity, and to the emotional and/or psychic dimension involved in our construction of agency and selfhood.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We were attending an Economic and Social Research Council-funded seminar focusing on ‘new femininities’ in the light of post-feminism and their worth and currency within the new politics of consumption and lifestyle. The seminar contributions resonated for us in two ways. Firstly, we have an interest in femininities, female friendships and how current understandings of these social bonds are being reconceptualised. Secondly, and on a personal note, we were increasingly aware that the seminar discussions framed within the landscape and biographies of risk and hope chimed with the ways our own daughters were currently playing out and negotiating their futures. How do we view the apparent contra-trajectory taken by our daughters who, unlike us, less concerned about seeing education as a ladder to ‘getting on’, seemed intent on ‘down classing’ in their various and successive ‘choices’ of educational pathways and boyfriends? In making sense of shared anxieties, our concerns coalesced around the personal, the familial and, in particular, the maternal relations. It is these inter-generational tensions entangled with the emotional politics of class that are the focus of this paper.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The authors focus on the secrecy and the entrenched community and practitioner &amp;#39;fictions&amp;#39; that create obstacles for the victims seeking assistance. They recommend a more multi-disciplinary and nuanced response that needs to vary depending upon the particular concerns and barriers faced by different sub groups of IPSV survivors.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We, however, argue that Reality TV is both a pervasive and important cultural form, and as such it is vital that researchers and teachers engage with it. We return to the controversial UK Big Brother 2007 arguments involving Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty. We explore how the dynamics of class, gender and race played out in this case. Using this example, we look at how celebrity culture, ideas of truth and dominant discourses of White working-class culture position both the housemates and their audiences. We further argue that the coverage of the event foreclosed any discussions of White middle-class racism by drawing on discourses that denigrate the White working-class.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
