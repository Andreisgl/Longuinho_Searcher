Praise and the Presentation of the Past in Oration 59Libanius the Historian? Praise and the Presentation of the Past in Oration 59Alan J Ross2016, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine StudiesThis article explores the relationship between historiography and panegyric in Late Antiquity. It argues that in his Oration 59, a panegyric addressed to Constantius II and Constans in the late 340s, Libanius of Antioch adopts and deploys several authoritating topoi developed by historians. The article's conclusions address Libanius’ political objectives in the composition of this speech, and his relationship with the emperor Constantius II.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersVan Hoof L.

TorresThis contribution deals with the presentation of the emperor Constantine as a bilingual character in Eusebius’ Vita Constantini. The article evaluates the extension and limits of his knowledge of Greek according to Eusebius’ works, bilingual and probably trilingual himself. The textual evidence suggests that Constantine’s bilingualism was intended to be another of the positive features included in Eusebius’ encomiastic image of the emperor. A contrast is also established with another Augustus, Julian, and his own historiographer, Ammianus Marcellinus, both of whom had Greek as their first language. The possibility that Ammianus may have known the Vita Constantini is finally taken into account.Download Free PDFView PDF‘How perilous was it to write political history in late antiquity?’ Studies in Late Antiquity 1 (2017) 38-64.Anthony KaldellisScholars often assume that historians in late antiquity ended their narratives with the previous regime because it was too dangerous for them to write candidly about the current imperial reign. While this was generally true, there are some notable exceptions to the pattern which, when studied together, show that this rule was not iron-clad and cannot safely be relied on to date the composition of texts and the scope of their coverage (in the case of lost works). Both the rule and the exceptions illuminate the nuanced play of " truth " and " power " in late antiquity. In assessing our evidence we must often read between the lines, but not all historians were as timid as we might assume. The Roman em-pire's " secret history " could sometimes be aired.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Roman StudiesPanegyric and the Discourse of Praise in Late Antiquity2019 • Catherine WareDownload Free PDFView PDFImagining Emperors in the Later Roman EmpireUncovering Constans' Image2018 • George WoudhuysenA chapter on the emperor Constans and his image, in D.P.W.

D.Catherine Schneider, Valérie PageauLatin literature of the 4th century A. D. is defined, amongst other things, by the production of compendiums of Roman history (breviarium, epitoma or periochae). These are often commissioned works, written by court historians, sometimes at the request of the emperor himself. These short histories were written by former teachers, grammarians or rhetoricians who reached the highest ranks of the imperial administration, as did Eutropius and Aurelius Victor. These works observe new and particular rules, imposed by their famous dedicatees. Their purpose is usually practical and didactic : they present the imperial deeds of times passed in a concise and chronological manner. Three of them – Eutropius’ Breviarium, Aurelius Victor’s Liber de Caesaribus and the Pseudo-Aurelius Victor’s Epitome de Caesaribus – focus on the emperor’s culture and education as the cornerstones of any civilised governance : they present recurring observations on the paideia of the princes. In these portraits, emperors are men of letters and/or men of war, athletic and/or intellectual, bilingual or not, educated or ignorant. While they are rulers, they can also be orators, philosophers, poets, jurists, and sometimes even artists. In the literary works, the imperial imagery is reflected in a series of pictures presented to the emperors in charge. These « mirrors for the princes » make us wonder about the mentality and the ideology lying behind the texts. The present communication proposes to determine if the concepts developed by the modern theories of imagology can be used to study the culture of the emperors and its representations in the 4th century. Can the paideia of the princes be examined based on the terms of psychology, sociology, ethnicity and geography (Roman vs Spanish, African, Illyrian, etc.), and even, dynasty (Constantinians, Valentinians, Theodosians vs Julio-Claudians, Flavians, Antonines, etc.) ? In other words, can the stereotypes that define the culture of the Greco-Roman man be applied in the same way to the emperor, or does holding the power erase these clichés and prerequisites ?Download Free PDFView PDF PhD dissertation University of Queensland May 2012The Soldier's Life: Martial Virtues and Hegemonic Masculinity in the Early Byzantine Empire2013 • Michael E StewartThis dissertation argues that martial virtues and images of the soldier’s life represented an essential aspect of early Byzantine masculine ideology. It contends that in many of the visual and literary sources from the fourth to the seventh centuries CE, conceptualisations of the soldier’s life and the ideal manly life were often the same. By taking this stance, the dissertation challenges the view found in many recent studies on Late Roman masculinity that a Christian ideal of manliness based on extreme ascetic virtues and pacifism had superseded militarism and courage as the dominant component of hegemonic masculine ideology.Download Free PDFView PDF2011.
