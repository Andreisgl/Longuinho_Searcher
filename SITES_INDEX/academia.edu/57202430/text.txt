As a system, it works in concert across institutions to propagate racial injustice. Thus, efforts to address structural racism and its implications for health inequity require transdisciplinary collaboration. In this article, we begin by describing the process through which we have leveraged our discipline-specific training -- spanning edu­cation, epidemiology, social work, sociology, and urban planning -- to co-construct a transdisciplinary analysis of the determinants of racial health inequity. Specifically, we introduce the underlying theories that guide our framework development and dem­onstrate the application of our integrated framework through a case example. We conclude with potential research and policy implications.

To understand and transform the insidious ways in which race operates, the authors examine its impact in marketplaces and how these effects are shaped by intersecting forms of systemic oppression. They introduce critical race theory (CRT) to the marketing community as a useful framework for understanding consumers, consumption, and contemporary marketplaces. They outline critical theory traditions as utilized in marketing and specify the particular role of CRT as a lens through which scholars can understand marketplace dynamics. The authors delineate key CRT tenets and how they may shape the way scholars conduct research, teach, and influence practice in the marketing discipline. To clearly highlight CRT's overall potential as a robust analytical tool in marketplace studies, the authors elaborate on the application of artificial intelligence to consumption markets. This analysis demonstrates how CRT can support an enhanced understanding of the role of race in markets and lead to a more equitable version of the marketplace than what currently exists. Beyond mere procedural modifications, applying CRT to marketplace studies mandates a paradigm shift in how marketplace equity is understood and practiced. From leveraging Black culture as a marketing strategy (Crockett 2008) to the ways in which hidden racial biases shape the sharing economy (Rhue 2019), race plays a large part in consumer experiences and outcomes in global marketplaces. Such high-profile brands as Prada, Gucci, Dove, and H&M have recently experienced significant public reproach as a result of their ill-considered uses of racial signifiers. Moreover, researchers are increasingly documenting and exposing widespread and persistent racial bias and discrimination on prominent digital platforms such as Facebook, Craigslist, Uber, and Airbnb. Research also reveals how race marginalizes and materially disadvantages people of color (POC) and demonstrates the persistence of race as an integral aspect of the functioning and ideological underpinnings of marketplace actions. Finally, research increasingly illustrates the myriad ways in which pervasive race-related marketing dynamics such as the surveillance of Black consumers while traveling and shopping can negatively influence consumerDownload Free PDFView PDFNevada Journal of Public HealthCOVID-19 and Communities of Color: Understanding the Impact of Racism on Public Health2021 • Daryl O TraylorAs the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the U.S., communities of color shared an uneven burden of the disease. The ability to understand from a public health perspective, the increase and devastating health effects and morbidity consequences due to COVID-19 is alarming, but not unexpected based upon structural racism. In light of the recent declarations of racism as a public health crisis, the push to address the situations that COVID-19 has brought to bear is an imperative. This article defines the levels of racism that exist, distinguishing between intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, and structural racism. Redlining in terms of the provision of home loans is used as an example of structural racism and its impact on COVID-19 and communities of color, even here in Nevada. With this understanding, the article closes with potential solutions in the areas of policy, health care and COVID-19, public health, as well as future research opportunities. While the solutions are not all encompassing, it does provide a starting point for dialogue, planning, and implementation in which to address the multitude of health disparities and health inequities that have always existed but systematically ignored either intentionally or unintentionally. Regardless of intentions, it took a pandemic to be the moving force and catalyst for enlightenment as it relates to the determinants of health and racism within communities of color.Download Free PDFView PDFNursing InquiryTransformative dissonant encounters: Opportunities for cultivating antiracism in White nursing students2021 • Julia S. Dancis, Brett Russell ColemanSharply in focus in the United States right now is the disproportionate COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates of Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and Pacific Islanders living in the United States in contrast to White people. These COVID-19 disparities are but one example of how systemic racism filters into health outcomes for many Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC).

It requires rigorous attempts to unsettle and decenter entrenched white supremacist ideology, assumptions, and values. In this labor, we create space for the multiple identities and worldviews that students and professors occupy to reshape educational encounters. In this paper, we present our critical pedagogical approaches as Black social work educators committed to liberation and healing. We articulate how our positionalities as Black cisgender women at urban universities, one a Northeastern Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and another at a Northeastern public university, facilitate our intentions ...Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal Health PromotionWhat would it take for health promotion to take structural racism seriously?Sume  Ndumbe-EyohDownload Free PDFView PDFmSystemsIntroducing the Microbes and Social Equity Working Group: Considering the Microbial Components of Social, Environmental, and Health JusticeEmily WisselHumans are inextricably linked to each other and our natural world, and microorganisms lie at the nexus of those interactions.

As a subdiscipline concerned with cultural production and reproduction, the persistence of White supremacy within music education contributes to its indefatigability within the broader society. This study is cast within theoretical framework that connects critical race theory and critical pedagogy in order to address the ways in which music teachers make meaning of gatekeeping practices mediated within hidden structures of White supremacy. This inquiry utilizes a methodology grounded in critical discourse analysis (CDA) that employs a seven-stage dialectical-relational elucidatory approach (DREA). The purpose of this study is to expose and analyze how White supremacy permeates the professional world of music teachers through professional discourse and gatekeeping apparatus.The findings reveal numerous mechanisms of White supremacy within music education discourse and through dialogue, these became visible to the teachers interviewed. Also discernable within interviews were relationships between music education, professional discourse, and gatekeeping hat are connected through four interrelated periods within music teachers’ experiences: PreK–12 schooling, college/teacher preparation, certification, and career. This study’s implications include the exposure and confrontation of White supremacy and gatekeeping practices and the ways they manifest within social and professional networks, both inside and outside of public-school education.

Thus, an examination into structural racism in STEM is needed to expose the marginalization of underrepresented groups in STEM and to improve understanding of the STEM policies, practices, and procedures that allow the foundation of racism to remain intact. I argue that, even at the top of the education hierarchy, Black STEM doctorate students and PhD degree holders consistently endure the racist residue of higher education institutions and STEM employers. Thus, this manuscript also discusses how universities institutionalize diversity mentoring programs designed mostly to fix (read “assimilate”) underrepresented students of color while ignoring or minimizing the role of the STEM departments in creating ra...Download Free PDFView PDFVoices: A World Forum for Music TherapyBlack AestheticsMarisol NorrisDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
