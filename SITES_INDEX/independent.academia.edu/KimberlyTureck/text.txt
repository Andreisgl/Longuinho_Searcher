Symptoms of the disorder occur in children, but the developmental trajectory of ADHD symptoms is not known. The present study examines the prevalence of ADHD symptomology in a sample of 2956 children who were determined to be at risk for developmental delay. Prevalence rates for ADHD in the overall sample was 4.50%, and prevalence rates by gender, race, and presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were comparable. The prevalence was not significantly different in children with an ASD diagnosis. No significant effects of gender or ASD diagnosis were observed. ADHD should be considered as a diagnosis among young children who present to clinics for children at risk for developmental delay, and future researchers should further study its developmental trajectory, beginning at an early age.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Many specific target behaviors and intervention strategies have been developed. In the last two decades the most heavily studied of these methods has been Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI). This package of ABA methods is unique in two ways. First, a broad range of target behaviors are trained for 20–40 h per week. This training is much more treatment per week than what is described in most ABA studies. Second, the children treated are typically 2–3 years of age, which is younger than for most ABA research. Reviews of EIBI have typically focused on the efficacy of the methods. These are important, but at present we argue that these methods are effective. This paper is different in that it looks at current trends such as generalization, parent training, factors that mitigate against effective treatment and the need for follow-up and booster treatment.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Parents and caregivers to 140 children ranging from 17-35 months with five different conditions (Down syndrome (n = 23), developmental delay (n = 18), prematurity (n = 56), Cerebral Palsy (n = 15) and Seizure disorder (n = 28)) were administered the BISCUIT-Part 3. An ANOVA on overall scores and a MANOVA on the sub-scale scores were conducted to determine if groups differed significantly. Results found no significant differences on total scores or differences on the sub-scales of the BISCUIT-Part 3: Aggressive/Destructive, Stereotypic and Self-Injurious. Some trends in individual item endorsement were found. It is possible that differences among individuals with these disorders are not apparent until later in life. These results emphasize the importance of monitoring challenging behaviours in all at-risk infants and toddlers to ensure that early interventions to treat these challenging behaviours are possible.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The relationship of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder to adaptive skills in young childrenDevelopmental Neurorehabilitation,  2013ABSTRACT Abstract Objective: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been linked to d... more ABSTRACT Abstract Objective: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been linked to deficits in socialization and communication, similar to those observed in children with ASD. In the present study, we examine the differences in developmental quotient and subscale scores between children with ASD and children with ADHD. Methods: We compared the developmental scores in a sample of 2990 children who presented to an early intervention program, who met criteria for ASD, inattentive ADHD, hyperactive/impulsive ADHD, combined ASD/ADHD, or are at risk for developmental disorders. Results: The overall developmental quotient did not significantly differ between those in the ADHD inattentive and hyperactive subtype groups. Adaptive skills differed most greatly between the ASD groups and the ADHD/atypically-developing groups. Conclusion: The present study represents a first step towards understanding the relationship of ADHD to ASD in early childhood. Young children with ASD symptoms are more greatly impaired than those with symptoms of ADHD.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the present study, the area of communication was examined, specifically related to the effect the DSM-5 changes have on scores of Expressive and Receptive communication in a sample of 3138 at-risk toddlers using the Battelle Developmental Inventory, Second Edition. Significant differences were not found in overall communication or Expressive Communication between toddlers who longer meet ASD criteria (n = 354) and those who continue to meet the new criteria (n = 486); a difference of only small effect size was found in Receptive communication. The toddlers who no longer met the new criteria represented a population of toddlers who were significantly more impaired than atypically developing peers who did not meet ASD criteria under either version of the DSM (n = 2298), with moderate effect sizes found in receptive, expressive, and overall communication. Importantly, results of the current study demonstrate that toddlers who no longer meet criteria do not differ from toddlers who continue to meet ASD criteria in their Expressive Communication, a common area of first concern noted by parents, and an area that is focused on during early intervention.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
