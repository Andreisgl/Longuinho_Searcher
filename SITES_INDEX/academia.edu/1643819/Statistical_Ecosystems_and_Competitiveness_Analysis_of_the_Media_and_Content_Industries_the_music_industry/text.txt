It looks at music companies, and covers the production and distribution of recorded music, including online distribution, and the competition which these companies face from other online music providers. It also looks at the organisation of live performances and the exploitation of music copyright, though data on how these activities contribute to revenues in the sector are less systematically available. The analysis integrates data from this project’s statistical report and includes a database of the major music publishing companies plus two company case studies (EMI and Spotify). The report is divided into six chapters. Following the introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 introduces the sector and its main economic and technological features. Chapter 3 analyses the value network of the music industry, identifying the transformations taking place in the value network and business model as a result of the on‐going digitization process. Chapter 5 identifies the main regulatory issues affecting the economic position of the EU music publishing industry. Finally, Chapter 6 weighs the strengths and weaknesses of the European music publishing industry against the opportunities and threats posed by digitization and the internet. The study is based on a review and synthesis of the available literature and reports and on official (Eurostat) and unofficial (trade organisations and consultancies) data on the music publishing industry.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMusic as Intangible Cultural HeritageThe Impact of the Music Industry in Europe and the Business Models Involved in Its Value Chain2021 • Pau Rausell-KösterThis chapter analyses the impact of the music industry in Europe. Although the direct and indirect impact of this industry in the European economy is significant, the sector is made up of different activities and companies, which compete and encounter diverse challenges in it. The current situation of these companies and organisations is presented through an analysis of the business models of several enterprises engaging in a variety of activities throughout the industry’s value chain, such as music production, publishing, distribution and exhibition. Moreover, we analyse digital transformation and the growth in rivalry detected in these activities.Download Free PDFView PDFDaniel NordgårdThe Music Business and Digital Impacts Daniel Nordgård Innovations and Disruptions in the Music Industries Music Business ResearchИрина РэйDownload Free PDFView PDFStatistical, ecosystems and competitiveness analysis of the media and content industries : The Newspaper Publishing Industry2012 • Andra LeurdijkThis report offers an in-depth analysis of the major economic developments in the music industry.

The European sound recording industry is a key asset. Three of the world's six largest music groups are European. Bertelsmann Music Group (Germany), Polygram (the Netherlands) and Thorn-EMI together with Time Warner (US), Universal (formerly MCA)(Canada) and Sony (Japan) account for about 75% of the world market for pre-recorded music, a market that was worth 31.5 bn ECU in 1995.Download Free PDFView PDFSSRN Electronic JournalThe Digitization of the Recorded Music Industry: Impact on Business Models and Scenarios of Evolution2000 • Marc BourreauDownload Free PDFView PDFRevista Contracampo Brazilian Journal of CommunicationTowards the consolidation of digital content markets: a case study of the music industry in Brazil2017 • Revista Contracampo  Brazilian Journal of Communication, Leonardo De MarchiIn reaction to the distrust of the feasibility of a market for digital music, ecompanies have presented new business models that generate value for this type of content. The access economy that characterizes them requires such businesses to compete with markets worldwide. As they start operating in a particular national market, they insert the works of local artists, record labels and music publishers into their virtual and global system. This presents commercial potentialities as well as cultural challenges. The article presents an explanatory case study of the Brazilian record industry from 2010 to 2015. Based on interviews conducted with different actors involved in the music industry, the objective is to understand this new composition of forces and the resulting tensions that characterize the Brazilian record industry in the digital age. In the concluding remarks, we underline some challenges for the music industry as well as for media and culture policies in Brazil.Download Free PDFView PDFSchool of Journalism and Mass Communications Faculty of Economic and Political Sciences Digital Music Business Models Specialization: Digital Media, Communication, Culture2019 • Esra PoryalıThe Internet and modern-day technologies have changed the way people connect with the world around them. The music industry is one of the areas that is undoubtedly affected by the Internet. Music technologies have faced a drastic reorganization process due to the digital revolution that changed the way people consume, source, listen, purchase, discover, experience, produce, read and learn music. These technological advancements have induced great changes for artists, listeners, and producers. This study will attempt to investigate the business models of digital music that can be profitable in the future. As previous studies suggest (Arditi, 2017), with the introduction of the technological revolution the whole revenue mechanism has shifted. This study attempts to give insight into the changing revenue mechanism of how musicians, record labels, make money from digital music by analyzing the digital music business models from the perspective of the consumer, the record labels and the artists. The fundamental questions this study attempts to address are a) how technology has changed by presenting an overview of the music industry, b) what kind of digital music business models exist by analyzing their effects from the perspective of the listeners, artists and record labels, and c) what happens if the business model does not meet the demand of the users by explaining the ‘piracy’ phenomenon. The present research seeks to identify where digital music services in the contemporary era are heading, to investigate the effectiveness and operation of digital music services and to offer implications about what can be expected in the future. To answer the given research questions, the literature on related topics suggests that both a quantitative and a qualitative approach are considered as the necessary methods for the present study. In the first phase, drawing on relevant literature review qualitative analysis is used to present the theoretical background for the thesis. In the second phase quantitative analysis is utilized. The primary tool is the questionnaire, which contains three sections of questions. The first section focuses on the personal background of the participants, determining the type of the person under examination. The second section includes questions regarding music consumption habits. The last section analyzes listeners’ perception towards piracy phenomenon. As an artist, I will also myself make empirical analysis based on my observations and experiences during my work with Sony Music Turkey in 2015 in the conclusion.Download Free PDFView PDFNew Media & SocietyMusic in Electronic Markets: An Empirical Study2001 • George Michael  KlimisDownload Free PDFView PDFBusiness Innovation and Disruption in the Music IndustryFrom record selling to cultural entrepreneurship: the music economy in the digital paradigm shiftPeter TschmuckDownload Free PDFView PDFSame tune, different words: The creative destruction of the music industry (revised)Sergio SparvieroIn this paper, we experiment and adopt „new‟ economic approaches to interrogate some of the fundamental changes and continuities in the music industry „system‟ that have been produced as a result of digitalisation. In this experiment, we also include established techniques of media industries‟ analysis like a value-chain analysis (e.g. Küng, Picard and Towse 2008) and the distinction between audience and users markets, following the seminal work by Picard (1989). However, not only we consider the music industry as composed by three segments: (1) the digitalisation of content production in the music industry stage; (2) the distribution and marketing stage; (3) the delivery and exhibition stage, but we also attempt to provide a map of the increasing variety of activities in each segment. Moreover, we embrace a service activity perspective and pay particular attention to changing relationships between these activities. Our account of the main changes to the music industry relies on evidence derived from the findings of a recent empirical research study of the music industry in Ireland, and in the conclusions we discuss the significance of the effects of unauthorised downloads of music and provide arguments on how the industry could deal with this issue. http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/view/514/471Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
