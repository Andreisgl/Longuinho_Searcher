(unrefereed conference proceedings from Bledcom, Slovenia July 2010)Philippa  BrearThis paper will look at a public relations campaign, led by the Orissa State Government in India, to create awareness of India’s Right to Information (RTI) legislation, and consider whether it meets conditions set out by Mendelsohn (1973) for the success of public information campaigns, and more recently corroborated by Windahl et al (p.145): • campaigns should have realistic goals • strategists should use environmental systems to support complement mass communication, for example interpersonal communication • strategists should know and segment their target publicsDownload Free PDFView PDFTurkey`s Foreign Aid: Who is the Target Audience (2016)Evren  EkenDownload Free PDFView PDFMapping the cyberspace: an emerging priority challengeLuis A Garcia-SeguraDownload Free PDFView PDFKorea ObserverBranding Korea as ‘My Friend’s Country’ The Case of VANK's Cyber Diplomats2018 • Kadir Jun AyhanThe role of non-state actors in public diplomacy remains an unsettled question in the literature. However, various transnational activities of non-state actors are often called public diplomacy, without discrimination. The lack of empirical studies on non-state public diplomacy is to blame for this conceptual confusion. Analytical and empirical studies of non-state public diplomacy are needed to consolidate this phenomenon, which is relatively new, while maintaining the conceptual clarity of public diplomacy. This study explores how Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK), a Korean NGO, conducts public diplomacy and nation branding of Korea based on its members’ relationships with foreigners. To gain an in-depth understanding of VANK’s activities from the perspectives of public diplomacy and nation branding, this study follows an exploratory single case study method. The findings of this article suggest how VANK and similar non-state actors offer potential for public diplomacy and nation branding that can be utilized also by state agencies.Download Free PDFView PDFDiplomatic training in the Central European Initiative countries and its comparative background (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2007, published in 2011 in Zagreb)Armando Marques-GuedesDownload Free PDFView PDFRoutledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy2008 • Nancy SnowDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Diplomacy: regional Cooperation, lifelong learning and diplomatic training Diplomatic Training in the CEI Area and its Comparative BackgroundArmando Marques-GuedesDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
