Many studies have established that high total-cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are risk factors for CHD and mortality. Many investigations have been carried out to explore the possibility of increasing components which have hypocholesterolemic effects in the diet. Two particular groups of substances phytosterols and β-glucans gained much attention in the last decade and there are already commercialized functional food products supplemented with plant sterols and/or derivatives (sterol-esters, stanols, etc) and specific polysaccharides mainly obtained from cereals which are able to inhibit the absorption of exogenous cholesterol. Edible mushrooms are good sources of phytosterol-like structures such as ergosterol, fungisterol and other derivatives since they were present in all mushrooms because they are constitutiv...Download Free PDFView PDFSCREENING OF HMG CO A REDUCTASE INHIBITOR PRODUCING MARINE ACTINOMYCETESNeeharika VeernalaThe objective of the present study was screening of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl Co A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor producing marine actinomycetes. A total of 65 morphologically different actinomycetes were screened for HMG CoA reductase inhibitor production in a two stage submerged fermentation and evaluated for HMG CoA reductase inhibitor activity by agar diffusion and thin layer chromatography technique using lovostatin as a control. Among 65 marine Actinomycete strains, only one strain produced HMG Co A reductase inhibitor.Download Free PDFView PDFApplied Microbiology and BiotechnologyBiosynthesis and biotechnological production of statins by filamentous fungi and application of these cholesterol-lowering drugs2002 • M.

Separation was achieved on capillary column DB-624 of length 30 m having internal diameter 0.32 mm and 1.8 ?m film thickness using a Flame ionization detector with gradient column oven temperature program. The headspace condition was optimized with the vial equilibration temperature of 100°C and time at 30 min. The injection was carried out in split mode, with a split ratio of 10:1. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone is selected as a diluent to obtain good sensitivity along with the recovery. Analytical method validation was performed within the requirements of ICH validation guidelines Q2 (R1). System suitability parameter set with tailing factor, theoretical plate and relative standard deviation as required with various pharmacopoeias are checked. Limits of detection and quantitation, precision, linearity and accuracy along with robustness are performed, and acceptable results are obtained. The proposed developed method is demonstrated to be simple, sensitive, linear, accurate and robust, hence can be used to determine the residual organic solvents in Neostigmine methylsulfate drug substance.Download Free PDFView PDFApplied Microbiology and BiotechnologyCompactin?a review2004 • Ritu ChakravartiDownload Free PDFView PDFEurasian Journal of Analytical ChemistryValidation and Uncertainty Estimation of Analytical Method for Determination of Benzene in Beverages2011 • Oman ZUASDownload Free PDFView PDFDevelopment of Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatographic Method for Determination of (+)-(S)-(o-Chlorophenyl)-6,7-Dihydrothieno [3,2-c] pyridine-5(4H)-acetic acid,Hydrochloride and Methyl (+/-) - (o-Chloro phenyl)-4,5-Dihydrothieno[2,3-c]pyridine-6(7H)-acetate, Hydrochloride from Clopidogrel BesylateInternational Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)Clopidogrel besylate contain single stereogenic center and has impurities like ((+) - (S) - (o-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c] pyridine-5(4H)- acetic acid, hydrochloride) which is known as impurity A and (Methyl (+/-) - (o-chloro phenyl)-4,5-dihydrothieno[2,3-c] pyridine-6(7H)-acetate, hydrochloride) which is known as impurity B. They are introduced during production. A simple, sensitive, precise and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed and validated for quantitative determination of impurity A and impurity B from clopidogrel besylate in bulk drug using uv detector at 220 nm. The developed method was able to separate impurity A and impurity B of clopidogrel besylate from its bulk drug within 50 min. The chromatographic separation was carried out by reverse phase chromatography using C8 column (Zorbax SB C8 250 mm x 4.6 mm x 5 µm), with mobile phase comprising of buffer solution and acetonitrile in the gradient composition, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, at 25°C temperature. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation of impurity A were found to be 0.07 µg/ml and 0.20 µg/ml and of impurity B were found to be 0.10 µg/ml and 0.30 µg/ml respectively. The linearity of response of impurity A was in the range of 0.20 µg/ml to 3.0 µg/ml with r > 0.9999. The linearity of response of impurity B was in the range of 0.30 µg/ml to 4.5 µg/ml with r > 0.9995. The method was validated and found to be suitable for determination of impurity A and impurity B from clopidogrel besylate bulk drug.Download Free PDFView PDFSTABILITY INDICATING STUDIES USING RP-HPLC METHOD FOR SIMULTANEOUS ESTIMATION OF SIMVASTATIN AND FENOFIBRATE IN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS AND DEGRADANTS IDENTIFICATION BY LC-MS; YEGGINA M RAGHAVENDRA*, A. K.M PAWAR, V. JAYATHIRTHA RAOMehar Raghavendra YegginaA simple, sensitive and accurate stability indicating RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous estimation of Simvastatin and Fenofibrate in active pharmaceutical ingredients was developed on a Macherey-Nagel EC 250 x 4.6 mm nucleosil 100-5 C18 column and PDA detector operated at 247 nm wavelength. The acetonitrile-ammonium acetate buffer (8 mM, pH 4.3, 70:30, v/v) was used as mobile phase in isocratic mode with a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and run time of 18 min. The combination of Simvastatin and Fenofibrate was subjected to stress degradation and the degraded products were separated and identified using LC-MS. Excellent separation of analytes form their degradation products proved the effectiveness of the developed stability indicating method. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines and can be applied for the quantification of Simvastatin and Fenofibrate in 10-60 µg/ml and 30-180 µg/ml range, respectively.Download Free PDFView PDFMultiple responses optimization in the development of a headspace gas chromatography method for the determination of residual solvents in pharmaceuticalsCarla TegliaAn efficient generic static headspace gas chromatography (HSGC) method was developed, optimized and validated for the routine determination of several residual solvents (RS) in drug substance, using a strategy with two sets of calibration. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was selected as the sample diluent and internal standards were used to minimize signal variations due to the preparative step. A gas chromatograph from Agilent Model 6890 equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-624 (30 m Â 0.53 mm i.d., 3.00 mm film thickness) column was used. The inlet split ratio was 5:1. The influencing factors in the chromatographic separation of the analytes were determined through a fractional factorial experimental design. Significant variables: the initial temperature (IT), the final temperature (FT) of the oven and the carrier gas flow rate (F) were optimized using a central composite design. Response transformation and desirability function were applied to find out the optimal combination of the chromatographic variables to achieve an adequate resolution of the analytes and short analysis time. These conditions were 30 °C for IT, 158 °C for FT and 1.90 mL/min for F. The method was proven to be accurate, linear in a wide range and very sensitive for the analyzed solvents through a comprehensive validation according to the ICH guidelines.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
