I argue that repetition is an important resource to metaphorical mappings as a result of the cinematic style of both directors. The repeated presence of food items and activities and also of Tokyo as a city are transformed from metonymic elements of the film&#39;s background to personifications or sources mapped on the concept of Self (Lakoff and Johnson Philosophy) or of national identity. In these films Coppola and Coixet attempt to break away from the Hollywood cinema style by using all the resources to represent and communicate emotional states onto their audiences.

Kassel and C. Austin Poetae Comici Graeci vol. VII pp. 102-220 Berlin/New York 1989, and a general introduct ion. The commentary of the 288 fragments is the main bulk of the work. Generally each play is treated according to the following scheme: first of all, I provide an &#39;introductory note&#39; in which I discuss different questions regarding authorship, date, plot and contents; secondly, a commentary on each fragment. The individual fragments are handled in a similar fashion: I deal first with metre, contents and interpretations and then with the problems in specific lines and words. Perhaps the most remarkable passages in the commentary are from the play Agammarhotiotaoiota, Korhoiotaalphanunuo (above all fr. 73-76), Krhoalphapialphataualphalambdaoiota, Mepsilontaualphalambdalambdaetazeta (fr. 113), piepsilonrhosigmaalphaiota, Xepsilon...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper applies the parameters of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory to identify the underlying metaphors and how those metaphors change throughout the films as both directors intend to redefine concepts such as self or sUbject, two components of the person according to Lakoff and Johnson (1999). For this purpose, a comparative analysis is conducted of Tokyo and of the characters in both films. This paper compares Sofia Coppola&#39;s film Lost in Translation (2003) and Isabel Coixet&#39;s Map of the Sounds of Tokyo (2009 a) and their dramatization of intercultural communication from the point of view of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory. These films narrate the drama of intercultural communication in a distinctively and paradigmatically exotic city: Tokyo.

Applying a diversity of methods on a corpus of car commercials, we connect valorization strategies and design categories. Consumerist ideology emerges in the dynamic interaction between valorization strategies and design categories. We identify metaphorical ways of conceptualizing the products and the ideological underpinnings motivating consumer's purchase decisions by creating a classification of different styles of consumption.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
De Corporibus Humanis: Metaphor and Ideology in the Representation of the Human Body in Cinemaby Fabio I . M .

Studies on the human body in cinema have documented how it changes according to underlying ideologies. Our research focuses on the role of image schemas and metaphors as they embody meanings and sociocultural paradigms. Metaphors also frame how the body is conceptualized according to dominating ideological practices such as (a) commodification, (b) the integration between artificial and organic, (c) dissatisfaction, (d) dynamics of beautification and idealization, and (e) politicization of the human body. We show how metaphors are creative tools to reframe meanings and representations of the body and how the body is a construct refashioned within the cinematic discourses of these films.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Multimodal Metaphor: republication of 2009 edited book in Chinaby Eduardo Urios-Aparisi and Charles ForcevilleMultimodal Metaphor,  2018"Metaphor studies" has over the past 30 years become a discipline in its own right, mainly becaus... more "Metaphor studies" has over the past 30 years become a discipline in its own right, mainly because of the cognitive linguistic claim that metaphors characterize thought, not just language. But most metaphor scholars hitherto focus exclusively on its purely verbal expressions. Since both persuasive and narrative discourses in contemporary society increasingly draw on modalities other than language alone, sustained research into a broader range of manifestations of metaphor is imperative. This volume is the first book-length study to investigate multimodal occurrences of metaphor, and is of interest to scholars interested in metaphor as well as in multimodal discourse. Each chapter investigates metaphors whose identification and interpretation depend on the co-presence of at least two of the following modalities: language, visuals, gestures, sound, music. On the basis of case studies in a variety of discourse genres (advertising, cartoons, films, comics, conversation, music, amply represented in photographs, logos, drawings, film stills, and musical scores), the contributors demonstrate that, and how, metaphor can occur multimodally, providing ideas and methodological angles enabling further theorizing and testing in this rapidly expanding field. Covering creative as well as conceptual metaphors, and where appropriate evaluating cultural factors governing metaphor interpretation, the contributors provide a wealth of material for studying the conceptual and rhetorical force of metaphor in contemporary society.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
