Oil Exploration and Scientific Conflict during the First Years of the Greek Geological Survey (1917–1925)When Konstantinos Ktenas and Georgios Georgalas, the two most prominent interwar Greek geologists, began their respective careers around 1910, they were already enmeshed in a tense occupational and scientific conflict.

The following decade, fraught with war and political upheaval, acted as a powerful “context of motivation” for their research and occupational strategies. The result was a host of scientific and institutional endeavours such as the founding of a Greek Geological Survey, the first attempts to assess the Greek lignite deposits, and involvement in consecutive oil exploration attempts that took place in Epirus between 1920 and 1937. As it turns out, the confrontational relation between the two geologists was actually productive. It signalled the emergence of a Greek geological community. It institutionalised the relations between this geological community and the Greek state. Most importantly, it produced a fusion of geological knowledge, tacit political calculation and obscure rhetoric that still remains in use to define the “reality” of the “Greek oil deposits”.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christos Karampatsos•  6  Greek History, History of Technology, History of Science, Energy historyReview of D.

Instead of confirming this division and abiding by a separation of idea and artefact, this article takes the instrument of the scales and the idea of equilibrium in antiquity as an example of their inextricability. To demonstrate this unity, the extant evidence on the implement of the scales is examined as it appears in the archeological and textual record of the ancient Mediterranean from the third millennium BCE to the first millenium CE, in close conjunction with conceptions of justice, debt, and imbalance. Beginning in ancient Greece, and from there retracing some of the peregrinations of an instrument across the ancient Mediterranean towards the Ancient Near East, ancient Egypt, Israel and Rome, the analysis suggests that the pervasive idea of debt and injustice as imbalance cannot be separated from the presence of a peripatetic and rather prosaic technological tool. A simultaneous examination of both can finally uncover the scales’ cross-cultural import, which resides in its close connection to a worldview it has helped to produce: able to render dissimilar things equivalent, the balance makes all objects potentially exchangeable.Save to LibraryDownloadby Luuk de Boer•  4  History of Ideas, History of Technology, Ancient Law, RetributionAz Okos Város (Smart City)Save to LibraryDownloadby Péter Hanák•  2  Engineering, Smart CityMcHarg and the Metropolitan Council An (Un)likely RomanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Kowsar Mohamed•  2  Romance, Metropolitan AreaSmall Hydro Plant DevelopmentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Peter Kadar•Environmental ScienceSCHEDE TECNICHE 2019 Chimica Astrofisica Educazione Finanziaria GIOVINESave to LibraryDownloadby Laura  Giovine•Kritische AusgabeSave to LibraryDownloadby Christian Weidemann•Astronomy and Musaeum Mathematicum at Clementinum College in PragueSave to LibraryDownloadby Martin Solc•EngineeringI misteri di LongobuccoI misteri di Longobucco Una grande caverna nel ventre della montagna, uno smisurato giacimento di tungsteno, una probabile miniera d'oro.

La versione integrale dell'articolo pubblicato dal giornalista Mario Morrone sulla Gazzetta del Sud del 17 agosto 2023. Longobucco è noto fin dall'antichità per le sue miniere dove si cavavano solfuri, in particolare blenda e galena argentifera. Verso la metà degli anni '80 del secolo scorso, la società Snia Viscosa ha effettuato delle prospezioni minerarie sulla montagna che sovrasta il centro urbano individuando un enorme giacimento di tungsteno in particolari rocce chiamate skarn. Non solo, ma è emersa la presenza di una grande cavità nel ventre della montagna. Abbiamo intervistato Luigi Spadafora di San Giovanni in Fiore, insegnante di laboratorio di elettronica e profondo conoscitore del territorio silano, che si è procurato e ha studiato le relazioni sui lavori della società milanese e ci ha fornito il materiale per scrivere queste note. Pare che il tungsteno sia presente in una vasta area con tenori spesso elevati. La società Snia ha però rinunciato nel 1987 alla coltivazione del giacimento probabilmente per difficoltà logistiche in quanto la zona è alquanto impervia e la presenza del minerale è piuttosto discontinua.Save to LibraryDownloadby Luigi Spadafora•  2  Geology, MineralogyFROM DEGREES TO UNITS.

This working paper continues work on both fronts by looking at the historical broadening of the concept of digitality to include non-numerical systems of representation such as those used to encode text and pictures. This conception underlies the ability of computers to deal with things other than numbers, but it has its roots in communications theory, most famously in the work of Claude Shannon. In parallel with our historical description of the emergence of non-numerical conceptions of digitality we broaden our analytical treatment of digitality to encompass more historical technologies and reading practices: not only adding machines and punched cards, but also musical boxes, weaving systems, movable type, and even alphabets and hand gestures.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sebastian Gießmann•  3  Digital Media, Media History, History of TechnologyLetture GalileianeSave to LibraryDownloadby Jürgen Renn•  2  Engineering, ArtilleryRiver of Enterprise: The Commercial Origins of Regional Identity in the Ohio Valley, 1790–1850 .

This article explores her biography from a different angle and focuses on her trajectories as a secrétaire ; namely, someone whose main charge was to store and exchange information by means of writing. The article investigates the presence of women in Paulze-Lavoisier&#39;s network before and after Lavoisier&#39;s death in 1794. First, it shows that her work as a secrétaire combined a wide set of writing practices with domestic sociability. Then, it examines how other women contributed to her collaboration with Lavoisier. Finally, it analyses how these relationships changed in the post-revolutionary and Napoleonic era, when Paulze-Lavoisier&#39;s role as a secrétaire took on a new meaning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Francesca Antonelli•  2  Biography, MultidisciplinarySharova T., Bodyk O.

The parade is led each year by 2 year students from the École Polytechnique, the top engineering school in France. At the key moment on the key day when the entire nation is focused on itself and its accomplishments under the leadership of a republican government, France makes its elite engineers visible to an extent found nowhere else in the world. Those engineering graduates who make it into the state administration in fact constitute the highest-ranked occupation in the country. Importantly both those engineers and the majority of engineers employed in lower-status locations in provincial governments or the private sector demonstrate through their work and careers that advanced mathematical knowledge is valued above all else in French engineering t...Save to LibraryDownloadby Juan Lucena•Wege zur Bescheidenheit, Strategien für die Zukunft, von K.

The main purpose of the study is to compare the way that these different civilizations used models but also the purposes of their utilization in pre-Hellenic and ancient Greek science. A core question that arose is: Can we trace the roots of the utilization of what we nowadays call ‘‘scientific models’’ in ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Greek scientific activity? Another important question is how the application of models differs in the scientific activity of these civilizations. Based on an extensive review of historical books, papers, and web sources I inferred that ancient Egyptians and Babylonians utilized tools that nowadays we call mathematical and analogue or material models and the ancient Greeks utilized theoretical, fiction, and analogue models. Moreover, while the basic function of these tools seems t...Save to LibraryDownloadby Virginia Grigoriadou•  5  History of Science, Scientific Models, Ancient Egypt, Ancient MesopotamiaElena Canadelli, Curriculum Vitae, 17 August 2023Save to LibraryDownloadby Elena Canadelli•  3  History of Science, History of Museums, History of Science MuseumsJulkaisuluettelo 1979-2017Uusimmat julkaisut löytyy academia.edu:n sivuiltaniSave to LibraryDownloadby Kari Väyrynen•FilosofíaJane Marcet and the limits to public scienceSave to LibraryDownloadby saba bahar•  8  Sociology, Chemistry, Interest, PoliticsThomas Coomans (ed.): Abdijmolens tussen Rijn en ScheldeRezension zu: Thomas Coomans (ed.): Abdijmolens tussen Rijn en Schelde (Moulins abbatiaux entre Rhin et Escaut/ Abteimühlen zwischen Rhein und Schelde), (Clavis.
