Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager
Mailman is free software for managing electronic mail discussion and
e-newsletter lists. Mailman is integrated with the web, making it easy
for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to administer
their lists. Mailman supports built-in archiving, automatic bounce
processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam filters, and more.
See the features page for details.
Mailman is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public
License, and written in
the Python programming language.
We want to thank our generous list of
financial donors whose
contributions allowed us to send a core developer to PyCon 2015.
Please consider
donating to the GNU Mailman
project yourself. (details)
See the Security page for important
security related information, and the help page for additional
