Not-withstanding this now more and more reports are emerging implicating vivax as a cause of cerebral symptoms. A soldier presentedwith pyrexia of three days duration and abnormal behaviour of six hours duration. Clinical evaluation and investigations revealedPlasmodium vivax as the culprit.

Serum Alanine Aminotransferase Elevations in HIV Positive Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy in IndiaThe Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,  2019Background Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is commonly used to measure liver injury in resource li... more Background Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is commonly used to measure liver injury in resource limited settings. Elevations in ALT are predictive of increased mortality from liver disease and may be influenced by antiretroviral drugs and concomitant hepatitis B infection. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and predictors of elevated ALT (defined as&gt; 40 IU/L) on HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) was conducted. Baseline ALT levels and at two weeks, six weeks, twelve weeks, twenty four weeks and one year were recorded for 320 patients on ART. Hepatitis B surface antigen was also recorded at baseline. Results Out of the total 320 patients, 249 were males and 71 females. A total of 252 patient records were used as controls who were not on ART. The mean ALT record before initiating ART was 30.6 IU/L. Peak rise in ALT was observed at twenty four weeks of therapy with mean ALT levels of 54.42 IU/L. Total toxicity was almost similar between the two regimes, ne...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study was designed to assess the clinical and biochemical parameters of dengue fever patients. METHODS Prospective observational study was undertaken among adult patients in a military hospital. Five hundred fiteen patients were studied and analysed. All patients who were NS1 antigen/IgM dengue positive were included in the study. Clinical features, hematological and biochemical parameters were noted. RESULTS Of the 515 patients studied, majority were males (72.81%). Fever was the major symptom (100%) followed by headache (94.75%), myalgia (90.67%), retroorbital pain (18.25%), conjunctival injection (39.41%), rash (37.86%), abdominal pain (24.46%), pleural effusion (20%) and ascites (16.31%). Significant derangements in platelet (69.51%), leucocyte counts (20.19%) and serum transaminases (88.54%) were noted. ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We report a patient who presented with pain in left hypochondrium, loss of appetite and weight. Evaluation revealed low-grade evening pyrexia, positive PPD test, multiple hypoechoic lesions in the spleen on USG. Antitubercular therapy (HREZ) was administered and review after 2 months of therapy revealed weight gain (4 kg), resolution of pyrexia, improved appetite, and resolution of the hypoechoic lesions in the spleen.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

METHODS This was a prospective study in a military hospital. A total of 78 patients of exertional heat stroke admitted and treated over more than 2 years are reported. Cooling measures started immediately on site of occurrence, carried on during evacuation and in hospital, IV normal saline initiated, clinical symptoms and signs were noted. Blood was collected and sent for hematological, biochemical and coagulation parameters. RESULTS Clinical features noted were violent behavior( 20.51%), confusional state (58.97%),coma (29.48%), seizure (33.33%),and vomiting (26.92%).Vital parameters were recorded and laboratory parameters revealed hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia along with raised transaminases, creatinine kinase and lactic dehydrogenase.

Methods This observational analytical study was conducted on 475 adult patients on follow up at Apex Immunodeficiency Center of Base Hospital, Delhi Cantt. We estimated the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency(&lt;30 ng/ml). Age, gender, BMI, CD4 count, plasma viral load, HBV/HCV coinfection, smoking status, time since diagnosis of HIV infection and selected liver enzymes were recorded. Antiretroviral therapy regimen was taken into account and its relationship with vitamin D levels were noted. Results Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency was noted in 92.63% of patients out of which 65.68 % were males. Median age of vitamin D sufficient group was slightly higher(52.11 vs 49.95). Patients with higher body mass index (BMI) had a slightly higher rates of Vitamin D insufficien...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
