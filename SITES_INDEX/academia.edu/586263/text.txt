Cambridge  …Helène WhittakerGullög Nordquist2007, Norwegian Archaeological ReviewLarsson sets out to provide a new picture of the European Bronze Age. The authors argue that current research has to a great extent been concerned with local and regional aspects and that there has not been enough focus on interactions between the various areas; as a result, the fact that social institutions in large parts of Bronze Age Europe have a Near Eastern and Mediterranean background has been overlooked.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Rise of Bronze Age Society2005 • Kristian KristiansenDownload Free PDFView PDFLegarra Herrero, B. 2011.

New York: Cambridge University Press.2014 • Peter van DommelenThe Cambridge Prehistory of the Bronze and Iron Age Mediterranean offers new insights into the material and social practices of many different Mediterranean peoples during the Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting in particular those features that both connect and distinguish them. Contributors discuss in depth a range of topics that motivate and structure Mediterranean archaeology today, including insularity and connectivity; mobility, migration, and colonization; hybridization and cultural encounters; materiality, memory, and identity; community and household; life and death; and ritual and ideology. The volume's broad coverage of different approaches and contemporary archaeological practices will help practitioners of Mediterranean archaeology to move the subject forward in new and dynamic ways. Together, the essays in this volume shed new light on the people, ideas, and materials that make up the world of Mediterranean archaeology today, beyond the borders that separate Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.Download Free PDFView PDF(2012) ‘A matter of quantity?

These were organized by the fellows and PhD-students of the Department of Ancient and Medieval Studies. Just as in the previous editions, for this workshop we propose a topic which allows researchers from various disciplines to participate. This year’s topic will address the contact among cultures and communities as a subject of studying the past. With this workshop we intend to foster the participation of young researchers of various disciplines in scientific meetings as well as to provide an environment of discussion in order to exchange knowledge of diverse areas of the research connected to the Study of Antiquity and the Middle Age. We consider it particularly interesting to focus on the contact among cultures and communities throughout history from an interdisciplinary view. In doing so, our aim is to achieve a meeting point where Classical Philology, History and Archaeology come together. We are aware of the fact that the afore-mentioned contacts must be considered as an on-going process that continues over the centuries, so that its beginning and end cannot be established with precise dates. That is why the structure of this workshop will not follow a diachronic chronological criterion. Instead, the workshop will be divided according to large thematic areas which shaped the social relationships and which will allow appreciating continuities and changes over the centuries, as well as comparing the various approaches that the communities put into practice under analogous circumstances. We are convinced that the contributions of each participant, following the aforementioned criteria, can yield significant input. In addition, their methodologies and their case-studies will provide new points of view for the approach to cultural contacts throughout history. We aim at resuming the essence of the previous workshops and at contributing to the conceptual and methodological renewal of the last years. At present, the old praxis of approaching the past from a unique discipline is obsolete and interdisciplinary work gathering the efforts of philologists, historians and archaeologists is clearly required. Therefore, the organization encourages all PhD-students from all the disciplines which work on the past to participate in the workshop.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
