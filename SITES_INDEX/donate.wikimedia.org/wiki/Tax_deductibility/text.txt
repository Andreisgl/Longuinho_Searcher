Because of the Wikimedia Foundation's 501(c)3 status in the United States, Canada's tax code will generally permit deductibility of donations to the WMF from the donor's US taxable income only. A useful reference may be Article XXI, Paragraph 6 of the US-Canada tax treaty. Please contact a tax professional for the details of deducting such a donation.

Netherlands
Dutch tax authorities have confirmed that, under Dutch law, the Wikimedia Foundation qualifies as a "public welfare institution" (in Dutch, “algemeen nut beogende instelling” or “ANBI”). This classification means that, if you are a Dutch resident, any donations made to the Wikimedia Foundation are deductible from your income tax subject to the normal tax rules on the donations deduction under Dutch tax legislation. Importantly, the Wikimedia Foundation does not seek donations from persons or entities located in any jurisdiction that prohibits or restricts fundraising activities by international charities or applies gift taxes on donations made to such international charities. The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit charity established in the United States under the U.S. IRS Code Section 501(c)(3).
