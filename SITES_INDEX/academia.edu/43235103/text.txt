What follows is a brief account of this period, using historical and commemorative medals to illustrate this sordid epoch.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersUnfinished Business: A Comparative Survey of Historical and Contemporary SlaveryJoel QuirkDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Legal Understanding of Slavery:  From the Historical to the Contemporary, (Oxford: Oxford University Press)Defining Slavery in All its Forms: History Inquiry as Contemporary Instruction (uncorrected proof copy)Joel QuirkDownload Free PDFView PDFTransatlantic & Interdisciplinary Approaches to SlaveryKelly WrenhavenDownload Free PDFView PDFSlavery: A Basic BibliographyPatrick S.

As the Western world (and through the processes of globalization, much of the rest of the world) seems to be moving towards more universal and inclusive principles of human rights, social and political constructions of race still echo with often polarizing power as humanity struggles to reconcile concepts of race, by definition exclusionary, within a more inclusive paradigm. Like all social and political ideas, concepts of race are historically rooted. These seeds of these concepts were carried deep within the bowels of the ships, which one recent historian describes as “complex, technologically sophisticated instruments of torture,” that transferred millions of Africans across the Atlantic Ocean over the course of four centuries. Much of the history of what is now termed the Atlantic World has been directly affected by the consequences of the conceptions of race that solidified as African men and women were offloaded, weary and emaciated, from the decks of those floating gulags. To understand the Atlantic World today, it is imperative to trace the ways these concepts have manifested historically and continue to shape the ways that humanity conceives of itself socially, politically, and culturally.Download Free PDFView PDFHuman Rights ReviewCollapsing the Boundaries Between De Jure and De Facto Slavery: The Foundations of Slavery Beyond the Transatlantic FrameKatarina  SchwarzThe identification of contemporary forms of slavery is often problematically demarcated by reference to transatlantic enslavement as the definitive archetype. Such an approach overlooks other historic slaveries and neglects the totality of the maangamizi—the African holocaust. This article addresses the problematics of positioning the transatlantic system as the paradigm and unpacks the constituent elements of de jure slavery to construct an understanding of slavery as a condition as well as a status. By identifying the core features of de jure chattel slavery through time, this paper displaces the assumption that legal status is determinative, giving meaning to the concept of slavery in the contemporary world.Download Free PDFView PDFin Alice Bellagamba, Sandra E.

Punishing the Enslaved in the Americas, 1760s-1880s", Journal of Global Slavery, 7 (2022), pp. 1-18Viola Müller, Christian G. De VitoThis special issue explores how enslaved workers of African descent were punished in the Americas. It studies punishment inside and beyond the criminal justice system, investigating its legitimation and implementation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Collectively, the articles address three main themes: the relationship between the enslaved, the slaveholders, and the state; the shifts in modalities of governance across space and time; and the entanglement of modes of punishment across geographies. This perspective illustrates the broader implications of punishment for issues of labor supply and labor control, and helps us understand how slavery was produced and reproduced in different, yet connected, regions of the Americas.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
