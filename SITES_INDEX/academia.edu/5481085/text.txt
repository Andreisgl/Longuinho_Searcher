Despite its inauguration in 2011, many aspects of the CDS are not new. CDS does however, mark a shift from the deterrent strategy that, in the 1990s that relied heavily on the dangers of the natural terrain to dissuade unauthorized border crossers, to one that actively punishes, incarcerates, and criminalizes them. This article presents findings from the Migrant Border Crossing Study, a random sample survey of 1,100 recently deported migrants in six cities in Mexico conducted between 2009 and 2012. It examines the demographics and family ties of deportees, their experiences with immigration enforcement practices and programs under the CDS, and how these programs have reshaped contemporary migration and deportation along the US-Mexico border. The article covers programs such as criminal prosecutions of illegal entries under Operation Streamline, and the Alien Transfer and Exit Program (ATEP) or lateral repatriation program which returns immigrants to different locations from where they illegally entered. In relationship to these programs, it considers issues of due process and treatment of deportees in US custody. It also examines interior enforcement under Secure Communities, which, during the study period, comprised part of the overarching border security plan, and screened virtually everybody arrested in the United States againstDownload Free PDFView PDFIn the Shadow of the Wall (Print Version)Jeremy Slack, Daniel E Martínez, Scott  WhitefordDownload Free PDFView PDFMigraciones InternacionalesRisk of Death and Aggressions Encountered while Illegally Crossing the U.S.-Mexico Border2014 • Pedro Paulo  Orraca RomanoThis article analyses the type of migrant who is most likely to be exposed to the risk of death or be a victim of aggression by U.S. authorities while illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, and the impact this has on the future migration intentions of repatriated or deported individuals. On the basis of a logistic regression analysis, the study shows that those most vulnerable to risk or aggressions are first-time migrants who hire the services of human smugglers. Furthermore, migrants who were previously exposed to the risk of death or whose belongings were confiscated and never returned are less likely to engage in subsequent migration attempts. Finally, being a victim of physical or verbal abuse at the hands of U.S. Border Patrol agents is unrelated to future migration intentions.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Use of Social Media as a Tool for Collaborative Research on the U.S.-Mexico BorderScott  Whiteford, Alison Elizabeth Lee, Sonia BassDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Migrant Border Crossing Study: A methodological overview of research along the Sonora–Arizona borderDaniel E Martínez, Jeremy SlackIncreased border enforcement efforts have redistributed unauthorized Mexican migration to the United States (US) away from traditional points of crossing, such as San Diego and El Paso, and into more remote areas along the US–Mexico border, including southern Arizona. Yet relatively little quantitative scholarly work exists examining Mexican migrants’ crossing, apprehension, and repatriation experiences in southern Arizona. We contend that if scholars truly want to understand the experiences of unauthorized migrants in transit, such migrants should be interviewed either at the border after being removed from the US, or during their trajectories across the border, or both. This paper provides a methodological overview of the Migrant Border Crossing Study (MBCS), a unique data source on Mexican migrants who attempted an unauthorized crossing along the Sonora–Arizona border, were apprehended, and repatriated to Nogales, Sonora in 2007–09. We also discuss substantive and theoretical contributions of the MBCS.Download Free PDFView PDFSocial & Legal StudiesWhat Part of 'Illegal Don't You Understand? The Social Consequences of Criminalizing Unauthorized Mexican Migrants in the United States2013 • Daniel E Martínez, Jeremy SlackIn this article, we examine the social repercussions of criminally prosecuting individuals that cross into the United States without official documentation. The “criminalization of immigration law” (Coleman, 2007), federal- and state-level anti-immigrant initiatives, and an incarceration-oriented approach to dealing with unauthorized migration have redefined what it means to be undocumented in the United States, a definition with more sociological implications than ever before. Using strain theory (Agnew, 1992; Merton, 1938) and Cloward and Ohlin’s (1960) concept of illegitimate means structures, we discuss the social ramifications for migrants who are exposed to a potentially unfamiliar criminal element while incarcerated for unauthorized entry. First-hand accounts of migrants’ experiences were gathered from face-to-face semi-structured interviews of 210 randomly selected individuals at a migrant shelter in northern Mexico.Download Free PDFView PDF"What part of "Illegal" don't you understand?

Tomamos una perspectiva geográfica para entender el papel de la violencia tanto en sus formas oficiales como el encarcelamiento y castigos para migrantes, que los no-oficiales, tales como los abusos y la violencia perpetrada por agentes. Por medio de los datos del Estudio de Migrantes y el Cruce Fronterizo (MBCS por sus siglas en ingles), basado en más que 1,100 encuestas con un muestreo aleatorio de deportados con un equipo binacional en cinco ciudades fronterizos y la Ciudad de México y una investigación con familiares y migrantes que han devuelto a Puebla. Aprovechamos estos datos para proporcionar una explicación sobre la geografía de violencia y migración. Las diferencias regionales demuestran las prioridades y el uso estratégico de la violencia en ciertas zonas fronterizas. Afirmamos que el entendimiento del papel de la violencia nos permite explicar la prevalencia de varias formas de abuso en las estrategias de control fronteriza. La violencia no es un efecto secundario sino un aspecto central de las prácticas fronterizas militarizadas. Palabras claves: Violencia, Trauma, Seguridad Fronteriza, Migración Abstract Despite proposed increases in spending on personnel and equipment for border enforcement, the complex geography of border militarization and the violence it produces require further examination. We take a geographical perspective to determine the role of violence in both its official forms, such as the incarceration and punishments experienced by undocumented migrants, as well as through abuses and violence perpetrated by agents in shaping border and immigration enforcement. By drawing on the Migrant Border Crossing Study (MBCS), which is a unique data source based on 1,110 surveys of a random sample of deportees, as well as research with family members and return migrants in Puebla, Mexico, we provide an innovative and robust account of the geography of violence and migration. Identifying regional variation allows us to see the priorities and strategic use of violence in certain areas as part of enforcement practice. We assert that understanding the role of violence allows us to explain the prevalence of various forms of abuse, as well as the role of abuse in border enforcement strategies, not as a side effect, but as elemental to the current militarized strategies.
