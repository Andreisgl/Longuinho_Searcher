An instrument was designed to calculate the various aspect factors and social networking use intention by using the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information success model (ISSM). A survey was administered among university students of China and Pakistan. The purposed model was empirically tested by PLS-SEM to examine the influential factors on the use of social networking sites. To the best of our knowledge, there is no cross-cultural published study associated with contextual factors effecting use of social networking sites between China and Pakistan. Our findings show that there are indeed important learning and network factors that lead to social networking sites.

Nowadays, Mobile Payments are on the way to disrupting the traditional Payment methods and contributing to a massive shift to a cashless society. However, some Mobile Payment users may be resistant to changing from conventional Payment methods. Therefore, it is critical to guarantee users’ continuance intention (CI) toward Mobile Payments to ensure the widespread uptake of Mobile Payments. Given this, this research aims to study the influence of the quality of Mobile Payment impacts users’ CI in Saudi Arabia (SA). Methods: The conceptual model was constructed based on the Information System Success Model and Information System post-adoption researches to support the framework of the current study. Results are drawn from a self-administered survey of a random sample of 389 respondents who regularly use Mobile Payment services in SA. Quantitative analysis is used to determine the impact of Mobile Payment quality on persistence intention to operate in Saudi Arabia. Results: The current study outcomes have shown that all three dimensions of quality (system quality (SYSQ), service quality (SERQ), and information quality (INFQ)), influence user satisfaction (SAT). https://www.isecure-journal.com/article_128632.htmlDownload Free PDFView PDFSustainabilityAntecedents of Self-Disclosure on Social Networking Sites (SNSs): A Study of Facebook Users2021 • Dr. saira  soroyaSelf-disclosure on social networking sites (SNSs) leads to social capital development, connectedness, and relationship building. Due to several benefits associated with this behavior, self-disclosure has become a subject of research over the last few years. The current study investigates the antecedents of self-disclosure under the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM). The research is quantitative, and the data were collected from 400 Pakistani Facebook users with a variety of demographic characteristics. The partial least squares-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) analysis technique was employed to analyze the data. The study0s findings confirmed that perceived usefulness is a strong predictor of personal information sharing, and it along with other variables causes a 31% variation in self-disclosure behavior. However, trust (medium and social) mediates the relationship of perceived usefulness, privacy concerns, and self-disclosure behavior.Download Free PDFView PDFOnline Education Adopted by the Students of Business Science2021 • Sarfraz sarfraz hussainFacebook is a popular social networking platform used for a variety of uses, including general and educational purposes. Digital links between teachers and students can now be created, removing physical distance barriers and enhancing the transformation of knowledge, data, and other tools. This research uncovered several variables that affect business students&#39; usage of Facebook, primarily for educational purposes. A total of 611 business students from various Lahore universities took part in the survey. The data was then evaluated using the R programming language. To determine the relationship between latent and observable variables, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used. The relationship between latent variables was determined using path analysis. The findings revealed that social impact on business students could contribute to Facebook adoption. Finally, rather than its use as a social networking platform, Facebook&#39;s adoption has broadly explained its educational use.Download Free PDFView PDFMobile Information SystemsUnderstanding Mobile Tourism Shopping in Pakistan: An Integrating Framework of Innovation Diffusion Theory and Technology Acceptance ModelSafeer Ullah KhanConsumer adoption of mobile-based tourism shopping is an emerging but overlooked area in tourism research. Given the paybacks and potential scope of this new channel, this study attempts to bridge the gap by proposing a multimediation model investigating mobile tourism shopping (MTS) in a developing country, Pakistan. In particular, we applied structural equation modeling through partial-least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) on 396 responses collected from mobile respondents who recently purchased tourism products using a mobile device(s). It was discovered that social presence, directly and indirectly, influences tourist intentions towards MTS. The results further show that the tourists’ perception of compatibility and relative advantages of MTS have insignificant influence on their intention to accept a mobile device(s) for tourism shopping. The findings and implications of the study furnish new vistas to research discourse and managerial significance.

Facebook, the most commonly used SNS has become an essential part of almost every college students' daily life; it serves not only as primary tool of communication but also electronic socialization. However, studies have shown that students are using such technologies more for social purposes rather than as a means of engaging with academic content. Thus, this study aims to identify the intention to use Facebook for learning support among the college students. Four constructs, namely, Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Social Influence (SI) were examined against Intention to use Facebook for Learning Support (IU). A survey research method was used and data was collected involving 325 college students. The results of the study revealed that PU, PEOU, FC and SI were found to be significant predictors of IU. PU was found to be the best predictor among the four.Download Free PDFView PDFNOVIY MIR Research JournalA TAM Based Empirical Study of Acceptance of SNS by Academicians of Professional Colleges in and around Pune2021 • Pratibha KulkarniThis paper inspects the acknowledgment of academicians of professional colleges in and around Pune city towards Social Networking Sites (SNS) utilizing the technology acceptance model (TAM), inside the framework of a course.
