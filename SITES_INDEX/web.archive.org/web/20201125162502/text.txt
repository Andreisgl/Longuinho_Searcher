 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Marquette University
  Marquette UniversityArchive-It Partner Since: Dec, 2010Organization Type: Colleges & UniversitiesOrganization URL:http://www.marquette.eduThe mission of Marquette University Libraries' archives program is to collect and service records of enduring historical value for research, instructional, and administrative use. Recognizing that information is increasingly maintained, distributed, and sought in electronic format, in late 2009 archivists conducted a pilot project to capture websites published by Marquette University. In addition, archivists preserved the websites of several organizations whose historical records are preserved by the archives, including the Catholic Worker website.
