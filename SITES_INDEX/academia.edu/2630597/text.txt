The legend relates in part to the letters exchanged between the two, years after Abelard had been castrated at the behest of Heloise's vindictive uncle, Fulbert. These "personal" letters form the basis for bestselling compilations of works by Abelard and Heloise in translation, such as the recently revised Penguin The Letters of Abelard and Heloise or the new Hackett Abelard and Heloise, The Letters and Other Writings. They hold fascination for the light they shed on the relationship between the man and woman, as teacher and student, lovers, husband and wife, monk and nun, abbot and mother superior, and much more. The popularity of the "personal" letters has generated considerable fanfare for the publication of another set of correspondence printed under the title The Lost Love Letters of Heloise and Abelard. The authorship of all these letters has been contested repeatedly, with the last-mentioned collection being the center of a present firestorm. Generally ignored have been nearly a dozen other letters or letter-like texts, unassailably the work of Peter Abelard. Jan M. Ziolkowski's comprehensive and learned translation of these texts affords insight into Abelard's thinking over a much longer sweep of time and offers snapshots of the great twelfth-century philosopher and theologian in a variety of contexts. One group shows him engaging with Heloise and nuns of the Paraclete, another with Bernard of Clairvaux, and a third with four entirely different addressees on four entirely different topics. Broadening our panorama of the twelfth-century Renaissance, the picture presented by these texts complements, complicates, and enriches Abelard's autobiographical letter of consolation and his personal letters to Heloise."See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Medieval and Renaissance StudiesAuthority, authenticity, and the repression of Heloise (1992)1992 • Barbara NewmanDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Medieval History“‘Men’s Duty to Provide for Women’s Needs’: Abelard, Heloise, and their Negotiation of the Cura monialium.”2004 • Fiona GriffithsDownload Free PDFView PDFB.

Thereafter such notation of Virgil apparently ceases for centuries. The neumes (and singing) may have fallen by the wayside as new practices developed of singing Latin rhythmic poems or vernacular songs based on Virgil, rather than excerpts from Virgil's own quantitative poetry. In prefaces to the Paraclete Hymnbook Peter Abelard quotes observations by Heloise on the need for a more regular syllable count than in quantitative hymns. Virgilian reception and musical notation may have evolved together away from quantitative Latin.Download Free PDFView PDFDiscretio: Heloise of the Paraclete's Embodied Reading of the Rule of Benedict2011 • Carmel PosaDownload Free PDFView PDF SpeculumThe Cross and the Cura monialium: Robert of Arbrissel, John the Evangelist, and the Pastoral Care of Women in the Age of Reform2008 • Fiona GriffithsDownload Free PDFView PDFPARADOXES OF CONSCIENCE IN THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES: Abelard, Heloise, and the ArchpoetAlmeida NetoDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Passion of Peter Abelard2004 • Kristel PentDownload Free PDFView PDFViatorBRIDES AND DOMINAE: ABELARD'S CURA MONIALIUM AT THE AUGUSTINIAN MONASTERY OF MARBACH2003 • Fiona GriffithsDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
