For example, studies have found that assessing online students can take two to five times the amount of time as comppared to face-to-face classes. Because of these time costs, it is important for online instructors to have a variety of strategies and tools to use to be more effective in managing their online classes as it relates to assessment (tests and projects), interactions, feedback, structure, and student presentations.

The focus is on the use of science fiction films to engage students and encourage greater enthusiasm and interest in science. &quot;Jurassic Park &quot; is used as an example that can provide educators with countless lesson opportunities. This approach recommends the use of fun as an effective tool for motivating students and takes the stance that science is a vehicle for comprehension.

If you have been having trouble understanding what is going on when you read a book, then it is important to change the way you read a book. This book should help you practice with a number of strategies as you read with purpose and become an active reader. To read with a purpose you will have things to be thinking about as you begin to read a chapter and activities to do to help you better understand what you have read. Put together, these activities are useful in helping you practice, access, and organize information and better understanding your reading. When you are Reading with Purpose, that means doing more than just reading the words in a chapter or section and hoping that you understand or remember it, but instead you start by thinking about what and why you are reading, even b...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Already, legislatures in 23 states have mandated that school systems use digital textbooks or digital resources as part of their textbook resources, thus shifting the definition and conceptions of the term textbook. In addition to added functionality (i.e., highlighting and dictionary functions), electronic textbooks allow the teacher to choose, edit, and modify text, becoming a more active consumer of curricular materials. This shift brings challenges as preservice teachers adapt to integrating this new technology into their practice. They need greater opportunities to manage this technology to select and adapt text to better match the curriculum to student need and interest.

In order to develop shared course maps, three components were needed: a tool that identified longitude and latitude, a shared spreadsheet for the longitude and latitude data, and the map that displayed the data. Using the dynamic map and the related online editable spreadsheet, the course instructors created digital maps where the students interacted spatially with other members of the course. The maps supported active participation in the course and put the students in control as they visualized the relationships between other course members ’ locations and themselves. Interactive course maps are recommended in online courses for reducing transactional distance and to support team building among the ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Getting to the Point: Integrating Fast-Presentation Design in Kinesiology and Sport ManagementInternational Journal of Kinesiology in Higher EducationABSTRACT Fast-presentation formats such as Ignite Talks, Data Blitzes, PechaKucha, and Speed Geek... more ABSTRACT Fast-presentation formats such as Ignite Talks, Data Blitzes, PechaKucha, and Speed Geeking can be an efficient and effective alternative to standard presentations given by students within a class. The limitations put on these style presentations, such as time or number of slides, can actually encourage creativity and getting students to focus on the important elements because of the restrictions. Motivating factors that led to the decision to integrate fast-presentation design into the curriculum were time efficiency along with student creativity with an authentic learning experience. By implementing fast-paced, succinct presentation formats, classes are able to provide a valuable learning process presented in a “concentrated” form, while meeting program goals and accreditation standards. There is a recognized pedagogical need for classes that have student presentations to provide opportunities for students to deliver professional presentations in a concise, impactful format. By doing presentations within a class, students are able to learn a number of professional skills, including speaking in front a group, preparing material for public presentation, and, through practice, improving their speaking skills. The constraints brought on by large class sizes and a single student presentation activity could take up a quarter or more of the semester’s allotted time. The awareness of such constraints served as a motivation to engage in assignments focusing on presentation design that requires time and content efficiency. Accordingly, the innovative pedagogy selected was to conduct a fast-presentation design, specifically that of PechaKucha, because of its&#39; built-in time and content limitations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
