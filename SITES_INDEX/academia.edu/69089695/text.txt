We analyze term frequency and co-occurrence to identify patterns in specific usage of the phrase “boat people.” We then identify how the term is variously deployed in Parliament and discuss the relationship between these uses and government policy and practice. We conclude that forms of “discursive bordering” have amplified representations of asylum seekers as security threats to be controlled within and outside Australia’s sovereign territory. The scope of policy or legislative responses to boat arrivals is limited by a poverty of political language, thus corroborating recent conceptual arguments about the securitization and extra-territorialization of the contemporary border.

Such claims are held especially when painting a contrast with the hardline policies implemented by Prime Minister John Howard from 2001 onwards. Although Fraser achieved many things around the intake of Indo-Chinese refugees following the fall of Saigon, the combination of his “boat-holding policy”, his deterrent international broadcast messages about “queue jumpers” and his refusal to deal with five huge vessels sailing from Vietnam show that in relation to “boat arrivals” Fraser was similar to all Prime Ministers that came after him, hoping that “the boats would stop”. Fraser not only refused to deal with these five huge vessels, even after the UN stated that the passengers should be treated as refugees, he held them up as examples of “trafficking” when his “people smuggling laws” were presented, debated and passed in Parliament during 1980. Moreover, the policy patterns and directions set in place from 1978 to 1980, although they may well have been drafted by Australian immigration officials, confirmed the directions firmly maintained under successive governments from Fraser onwards. If Fraser would have employed a different response around immigration department initiatives, Australians may now well react very differently every time an asylum seeker boat arrives on their horizon.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Social Construction of Moral Disengagement: Australian Asylum Seeker PolicyTristan HennessyDownload Free PDFView PDFForthcoming, University of New South Wales Law JournalOver the Borderline: A Critical Inquiry into the Geography of Territorial Excision and the Securitisation of the Australian Border2014 • Anthea VoglDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Sociolinguistics‘Taking advantage’ or fleeing persecution?

The governing parties range from center-left to center-right for a long time. Asylum-seeker and refugee resettlement issue is an important and popular matter of debate in Australian political context. Since the beginning of detention processes, asylumseekers and refugees are mostly in the middle of political and public discussions. To analyze and interpret varying discourses of political actors from parliament, I chose four different parliamentary speeches of senators and members of parliament from four different parliamentary parties. A speech on The Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill from One Nation Party senator Malcolm Roberts, two speeches on the same issue from Liberal party senator Amanda Stoker and Labor Party senator the honourable Kristina Keneally and a speech on The Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection and Other Measures) Bill from Green Party member Adam Bandt will be examined. The question whether what were the main positions regarding the Pacific Solution, OSB, Migration Amendment Act etc. will be answered as much as possible, and in which way were/are their positions and consequently their normative principles related to the Australian cleavage structure is going to be answered.Download Free PDFView PDFNeoclassical realism and Australian foreign policy: understanding how security elites frame domestic discourses2015 • Wayne McLeanThis article uses neoclassical realism to explore how foreign policy elites in Australia frame domestic debates so as to prevent certain ideas interfering with security responses. It does this by presenting a typology that seeks to understand elite dynamics in Australia by capturing three different elite responses – dilution, deflection and inflation. Taken together, these explain how elites mitigate potentially problematic domestic policy contests by pulling ideas towards the centre of debates, and marginalizing others, depending on the issue involved.Download Free PDFView PDFThe International Journal of Human RightsIn fear of refugees: the politics of Border Protection in Australia2004 • Richard DevetakDownload Free PDFView PDFREGIONAL COOPERATION BETWEEN ASYMMETRIC COUNTRIES:  EXAMPLE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA ON ASYLUM SEEKERS’ MANDATORY DETENTION AND ITS IMPLICATIONSBojan GeorgijevBilateral cooperation between Australia and Indonesia has never been unproblematic. However despite many differences both countries have significantly improved their cooperation and concluded a number of bilateral agreements particularly during the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (Indonesian president during 2004-2014). This master thesis discusses the countries’ bilateral cooperation on mandatory detention of asylum seekers who are caught in Indonesia and held in Indonesian detention centres that have been regularly criticized by human rights advocates. The purpose of this research is to illuminate the role of Indonesian government vis-à-vis Australia’s export of its domestic immigration policies on asylum seekers who flee from their home countries due to war and/or fear from persecutions and in search of international protection travel through Indonesia to reach Australia by boats; Australia remains to be the only country in the region that has ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol that have been incorporated into its domestic laws. With long tradition of immigration Australia is also perceived as a multi-cultural country with a long history of democracy and the rule of law, it is economically developed and of the most developed countries that has also signed the international treaties on human rights. From late 90’s Australian governments have again attempted to limit the arrival of ‘non-white’ immigrants and the bilateral cooperation on Australia’s domestic policy of asylum seekers’ mandatory offshore detention serves to deter asylum seekers from reaching Australian territories where they would be able to seek asylum. On the other side, Indonesia is a young democracy and developing country that has only recently established itself as a democratic country, has taken full advantage of financial and diplomatic incentives offered by Australia in return for cooperation on migrants’ detention.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
