Additional examples of contemporary macro-historical thinking are also brought in to elucidate and corroborate the insights of these earlier models, coming from the worlds of comparative mythology (Michael Witzel 2012, Wim van Binsbergen 2009) comparative history of religions (Robert Bellah 2011), and continental philosophy (Sloterdijk 2011, 2014, 2016). The overarching theme of this comparative enterprise is a more comprehensive account of the evolution of human consciousness in light of the history of mythology and religions as well as the history of media technologies, all of which serves as a frame of analysis for the contemporary emergence of religiosity outside of recognized traditions and within the digital media matrix that constitutes our primary information environment in the present.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Scholar and the Sacred: Transdisciplinarity and the role of mysticism and direct experiential encounter with the sacred in the study of religionNicholas E CollinsThis paper explores the role of mysticism in religious studies scholarship, both as a fundamental part of religion and as a dimension of the scholarly endeavor. The essay, written for a graduate class, serves as an introduction to a (hypothetical) journal issue which focuses on this topic. A Transdisciplinary paradigm is found to be necessary to the study of religion, and four dimensions of transdisciplinarity are explored: an inquiry based emphasis, integration of the inquirer into the study, a metaparadigmatic perspective, and attention to complexity of thought. The integration of the scholar into the religious inquiry is basic, and is essential to the unity of experience in the world that religion always asserts. A path dependency theory of culture argues for the deep embeddedness of religion in human cultural history and its persisting influence on contemporary modes of thought.Download Free PDFView PDFDiscarnate Man's Divination: The Evolution of Religion and Religious Experience in the Digital Age (paper presented at the 18th Media Ecology Association conference)Nicholas E CollinsMarshall McLuhan's idea of the " discarnate man, " who's organs without bodies are extended across the global digital nervous system in dialogic interaction with those of multiple Others provides new opportunities for the emergence of religiosity, the " irruption of the sacred " as Mircea Eliade called this kind of spontaneous emergence and direct encounter with the divine through hierophanies of all kinds. " We must get used to the idea of recognizing hierophanies absolutely everywhere " he writes, and the digital surround is emphatically not excluded from such consideration. (Eliade, 1996: 11) More recent thinkers like Bruce Powe, William Irwin Thompson, and Mark Hansen have written on the significance of new media to the evolution of religion, using McLuhan's work as a prophetic lens, and heralding, in the words of Thompson, a movement toward " the beginning of a unique/universal self-similar architecture of consciousness that is based upon individual experience and not upon priestcraft, rigid dogma and collective forceful indoctrination. " (Thompson, 2013: 85) As we struggle to adapt to our extended nervous systems and the discarnate, nonlocal interactions produced by this arrangement, the nature of self-awareness is transformed from private individual enclosed in a three dimensional physical body to distributed lattices of consciousness, and yet the obsolescence of a particular notion of private individuality does not necessarily equate to the doing away with all notions of individual selfhood. As the digital architecture comes to mirror the consciousness of which it is an extension, and personality takes form in the relationships cultivated and reflected upon, both within and alongside the digital surround, an expanded notion of selfhood comes into focus, not separate from the world but constantly in relationship with the whole as well as with what is beyond it. In the 10 th century Indian philosophical school known as Pratyabhijna (self-recognition) we may find an analogous description of such an awareness, now retrieved by digital technology.Download Free PDFView PDFTactility is the Message: Sacralization of Subjectivities and Digital Religious Retrieval in the Contemporary Media EnvironmentNicholas E CollinsDownload Free PDFView PDFLove in the Time of Mechanized Petrifaction: Eros and Ānanda in Klages and AurobindoNicholas E CollinsLove, conceived of as a metaphysical principle, is explored in the mystical philosophies of Ludwig Klages and Aurobindo Ghose (Sri Aurobindo). This principle appears for Klages as Cosmogonic Eros, a chthonic, pandaemonic ocean of distance-bridging affective involvement that unifies the cosmos and the individual soul. Aurobindo, coming out of the Indian sanskrit tradition, conceives of love as Ananda, the bliss of the divine which is involved or secret within all phenomenal forms in the universe and whose expression is its teleological aim. Love thus becomes a metaphysically significant experience at its heights, with all particular forms of love leading toward such an encounter. It is contrasted with more egoistic modes of rational thought and individual will, either as their eternal adversary (Klages) or as their route to perfection and divinization (Aurobindo).Download Free PDFView PDFDiscarnate Śivas: Marshall McLuhan, Pratyabhijñā Philosophy and the Evolution of ReligionNicholas E CollinsThis paper explores the interface between the media ecological theories of Marshall McLuhan and the Indian philosophical system known as Pratyabhijñā (recognition). It is argued that our contemporary media environment composed of digital networked electronic media forms reorients human perception, expanding our normal awareness to spatial and temporal ranges of extension that are, metaphorically and in some senses actually, universal in scope. This massive extensivity is further compressed into a single, resonating sphere of electronic interpenetration, rendering all individuals simultaneously present. In this "discarnate condition" our metaphysical state approximates the condition of divinity itself as conceptualized in the pratyabhijñā. This is further indicative of more general transformations effected by the mediated environment in the sphere of religion, in which subjectivity itself becomes the locus of religious recognition and the site for the irruption of the sacred, due to its having become electronically externalized in the pervasive forms of media use.Download Free PDFView PDFBibliographical Essay: Jung and Religion with Special Attention to Asian TraditionsNicholas E CollinsIn this bibliographical essay, I have attempted to chart a course into the religious dimensions of Jung's thought, focusing on his relationship to his own mystical experiences and to the religious ideas to which he was drawn in the endeavor to clarify what such experiences meant in the context of his psychology. The majority of Jung's own experiences are recorded in The Red Book and his auto/biography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, as well as the forthcoming Black Books, which I have not had the opportunity to include here. In his writings on religion and its relationship to psychology it is evident that these experiences served as the foundation for Jung's theoretical work, which exhibits a dyadic structure that oscillates (and often bridges the gap) between the metaphysical and the psychological. This parallels Jung's dual aims of creating a psychological theory and helping his patients individuate while also prophesizing and proclaiming the emergence of a qualitatively new religious consciousness. Jung is more or less always relating the ideas he sees in religious traditions, both western (Christian) and Asian (Hindu, Buddhist, Daoist), to his own emerging psychological-metaphysical theory (which he will be quick to qualify isn't really metaphysical, even though it is), which is his primary concern. He is in this sense a syncretist, trying to coax out the new consciousness contained as a seed within older religious forms, integrating them by reading them through the lens of his psychological theory. However, Asian religions also offered Jung a different cultural psychology with which to contrast (sometimes unnecessarily) that of modern European westerners. While some of these distinctions have been eroded by our now thoroughly electrically interconnected global civilization, the contributions made to Jung's thought by Asian religions is considerable, as is their influence on contemporary ("new-age") spirituality, for which Jung serves as a kind of cultural guru figure. I have only been able to wade into the shallow waters of the seemingly endless ocean of Jung (and Jungian scholarship) in this bibliography, but my hope is that it may serve as an initial orienting map for the significance of Jung in the study of religion.Download Free PDFView PDFBecca Tarnas – Iridescent Infinity: Participatory Theory and Archetypal CosmologyBecca S TarnasDownload Free PDFView PDFPARTICIPATORY SPIRITUALITY AND TRANSPERSONAL THEORY: A TEN-YEAR RETROSPECTIVEMr SarojiDownload Free PDFView PDFIntroduction to Participatory SpiritualityJorge  FerrerDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
