Atlee shares some of the history of the Pride and Prejudice adaptations that were made for TV and film. Angelina highlights different ideas of what makes a good film adaptation of a book. Cindy brings up the importance of the casting, and Angelina talks about why she still feels like no film has gotten Mr. Darcy right.

Our hosts critique each major movies from over the decades, sharing what they like and dislike about each one.

Commonplace Quotes:  If we cannot get the better of life, at any rate, we can be so free as to laugh at it. Desmond MacCarthy  Jane Austen is thus a mistress of much deeper emotion than appears upon the surface. She stimulates us to supply what is not there. What she offers is, apparently a trifle, yet is composed of something that expands in the reader’s mind and endows with the most enduring form of life scenes which are outwardly trivial. Virginia Woolf  The most extraordinary thing in the world is an ordinary man and an ordinary woman and their ordinary children. G. K. Chesterton  Never judge a book by its movie. Anonymous False Though She Be by William Congreve FALSE though she be to me and love,     I'll ne'er pursue revenge;  For still the charmer I approve,     Though I deplore her change.   In hours of bliss we oft have met:     They could not always last;  And though the present I regret,     I'm grateful for the past.
