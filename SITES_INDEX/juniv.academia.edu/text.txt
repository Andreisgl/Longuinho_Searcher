Much of this work has made a positive contribution to the communities involved, but – as with all development and community work – there are lessons to be learnt. We believe that CSR (or „Community Engagement‟ as it is termed by Chevron) has the potential for poverty alleviation in Bangladesh, and in this spirit offer this short discussion paper in the hope that our reflections, drawn from our research, might be of use for Chevron in the further development of its programmes, both in Bibyana and elsewhere. We also hope that our work might contribute to national debates surrounding natural resource extraction in Bangladesh.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Whilst apparently building partnerships in the villages that surround the Bibiyana Gas Field, we suggest that the corporation remains detached from the local population via their community development programmes and employment policies. This contradiction is submerged by ideas and practices within global development discourse which celebrate the disconnection and disengagement of donors via the rhetoric of sustainability. Chiming with development praxis and the neo-liberal values which underscore it by stressing self-reliance, entrepreneurship and ‘helping people to help themselves’, the corporation&#x27;s Community Engagement Programme does little to meet the demands of local people who hoped for employment and long term investment, a form of connection that is discordant to discourses of self-reliance and sustainability.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

চর্চা: নৃবিজ্ঞানের প্রবন্ধ সংকলন (Practice: A Collection of Essays in Anthropology)by Manosh Chowdhury and Zahir AhmedDepartment of Anthropology, JU,  2001About the Book: This was an outcome of a conference in 2000, sponsored by the Ford Foundation Res... more About the Book: This was an outcome of a conference in 2000, sponsored by the Ford Foundation Research Grant to the department of anthropology at Jahangirnagar Anthropology. That time anthropology practitioners in Bangladesh, or a portion of them, were much tensed with the dichotomy of 'academic' and 'applied' anthropology, a binary that might have borrowings of extravagant developmentalist projects in Bangladesh. This binary, however, has a little meaning in what is being called as 'anthropological' practices, or in any disciplinary 'boundary' for that matter. I, for some complicated reasons, eventually had to convene the conference as well, and anticipated this book since the time I took responsibility of the convener. Prof. Zahir Ahmed and I co-edited the book.  Many people, mostly then students of anthropology (including some from other disciplines) worked very hard: documentation, transcription, typesetting, translation, and above all, exhibiting huge energy that made this production possible which otherwise could be an 'expensive' project. This book is an utmost example of how teamwork can reduce expenses, and how a book could be produced from materials of different modalities. Years after, a copyleft study circle (Grontho Dot Net) uploaded this book on the internet. But the document has problems: missing pages, disorganized pages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This story is about me, my fieldwork, and about the Bangladeshi diaspora. It centers on my temporary residence in Orange County, southern California, between 2011 and 2012over ten months. It is an accumulation of narratives. This book forgoes the traditional tendency of anthropology which revolves around the locality, fieldwork, and interpretation of findings. It has been written in light of sundry times, places, and experiences. My fieldwork began with my arrival in California, but it gained momentum through my association with the South Asian Diaspora’s engagement in the ongoing Occupy Wall Street movement in Irvine in 2011.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Today, there are more than 70 walls worldwide. Walls on nation-state borders are an increasingly prominent focus of modern life with far-reaching impacts on human culture and well-being, and the environment we live in. Border walls have always been political symbols and today transformations of these walls (such as "virtual walls") remain a hot topic of discussion. Border barriers are ever-present and continue to be implemented throughout the world. Our work touches on many diverse areas of concern: Mobility is a natural human behavior that wallsattempt to void. Currently, capital and commodities movemore freely than people. Walls create unequal mobility inwhich privileged and functional workers pass. Those whoare not allowed to pass face the payment of large sumsand debt to human smugglers, and risk physical injury anddeath in the dangerous journey around walls. Walls—and,more widely, restrictions, checkpoints, and barriers—havecut off normal social-cultural ties across regional and localborder communities that depend on informal mobility.2 Limiting mobility chips away at human rights.Enclosures set limits on basic and meaningful humangoals and needs: to gain a livelihood, seek asylum, oravoid danger. But there is also a “domino effect” whenpeople do not even try to move through walls and otherbarriers, despite fear of persecution and hope for abetter life. They recognize that the path to such hopes isphysically dangerous, and often lined with victimizers. Theaccumulation of waiting people in camps and towns in themidst of danger and extreme exploitation, and even thetrips never taken, despite compelling reasons, need muchmore penetrating attention.3 Walls politicize space. Symbolic or political drivers, suchas nativism, underlie and are the foundation of walls. Thediscrepancy between offcial formal policy claims for asupposed need of walls and the actual reality and resultsof walls spotlight the political symbolism embedded in theideology of walls: An enclosed inside distinguished froman “othered” outside, or a “threatening other” containedfrom spilling out. Walls are often implemented afterperiods of “crisis,” mostly national, but also class-based inthe case of gated communities. This includes the closurethat concentrates refugees and asylum seekers into campsand settlements.4 Walls are not limited to human-made physicalbarriers. Obstacles to entry include checkpoints onmovement paths or belts of concentrated enforcementnear boundaries. New detection technologies, “virtualwalls,” identify moving people and conveyances, andaim to inhibit them. Geographic obstacles, such as theMediterranean Sea or perilous deserts, may be used asbarriers by design. Walls are materialized forms of spatialsocialexclusion, deployed unequally against some but notall people.5 Placing rigid barriers across the landscape obstructsecology. The result of such physical borders is a disruptionto breeding diversity for many moving animals; habitatdestruction through wall building itself; and rechannelingor blocking the fow of surface water. These walls alsodamage cultures tied to the free flow of ecology.6 Walls have important effects on health. People areharmed by actually trying to cross a border (sometimesfalling from the wall, or being shot at by border guards),but walls also bar people from seeking out betterhealthcare services.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
