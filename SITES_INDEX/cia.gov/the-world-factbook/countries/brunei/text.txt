Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in the world. In 2017, Brunei celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Sultan Hassanal BOLKIAH’s accession to the throne.TipVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.Definitions and NotesGeographyLocationSoutheastern Asia, along the northern coast of the island of Borneo, bordering the South China Sea and MalaysiaGeographic coordinates4 30 N, 114 40 EMap referencesSoutheast AsiaAreatotal: 5,765 sq kmland: 5,265 sq kmwater: 500 sq kmcomparison ranking: total 172Area - comparativeslightly smaller than DelawareArea comparison map:Land boundariestotal: 266 kmborder countries (1): Malaysia 266 kmCoastline161 kmMaritime claimsterritorial sea: 12 nmexclusive economic zone: 200 nm or to median lineClimatetropical; hot, humid, rainyTerrainflat coastal plain rises to mountains in east; hilly lowland in westElevationhighest point: Bukit Pagon 1,850 mlowest point: South China Sea 0 mmean elevation: 478 mNatural resourcespetroleum, natural gas, timberLand useagricultural land: 2.5% (2018 est.)arable land: 0.8% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 1.1% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 0.6% (2018 est.)forest: 71.8% (2018 est.)other: 25.7% (2018 est.)Irrigated land10 sq km (2012)Population distributionthe vast majority of the population is found along the coast in the western part of Brunei, which is separated from the eastern portion by Malaysia; the largest population concentration is in the far north on the western side of the Brunei Bay, in and around the capital of Bandar Seri BegawanNatural hazardstyphoons, earthquakes, and severe flooding are rareGeography - noteclose to vital sea lanes through South China Sea linking Indian and Pacific Oceans; two parts physically separated by Malaysia; the eastern part, the Temburong district, is an exclave and is almost an enclave within MalaysiaPeople and SocietyPopulation484,991 (2023 est.)note: immigrants make up approximately 26% of the total population, according to UN data (2019)comparison ranking: 173Nationalitynoun: Bruneian(s)adjective: BruneianEthnic groupsMalay 67.4%, Chinese 9.6%, other 23% (2021 est.)LanguagesMalay (Bahasa Melayu) (official), English, Chinese dialectsmajor-language sample(s): Buku Fakta Dunia, sumber yang diperlukan untuk maklumat asas. (Malay)The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.Malay audio sample:ReligionsMuslim (official) 82.1%, Christian 6.7%, Buddhist 6.3%, other 4.9% (2021 est.)Demographic profileBrunei is a small, oil-rich sultanate of less than half a million people, making it the smallest country in Southeast Asia by population.  Its total fertility rate – the average number of births per woman – has been steadily declining over the last few decades, from over 3.5 in the 1980s to below replacement level today at nearly 1.8.  The trend is due to women’s increased years of education and participation in the workforce, which have resulted in later marriages and fewer children.  Yet, the population continues to grow because of the large number of women of reproductive age and a reliance on foreign labor – mainly from Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Asian countries – to fill low-skilled jobs. Brunei is officially Muslim, and Malay is the official language.  The country follows an official Malay national ideology, Malay Islamic Monarchy, which promotes Malay language and culture, Islamic values, and the monarchy.  Only seven of Brunei’s native groups are recognized in the constitution and are defined as “Malay” – Brunei Malays, Belait, Kedayan, Dusun, Bisayak, Lun Bawang, and Sama-Baiau.  Together they make up about 66% percent of the population and are referred to as the Bumiputera.  The Bumiputera are entitled to official privileges, including land ownership, access to certain types of employment (Royal Brunei Armed Forces and Brunei Shell Petroleum), easier access to higher education, and better job opportunities in the civil service.  Brunei’s Chinese population descends from migrants who arrived when Brunei was a British protectorate (1888 and 1984).  They are prominent in the non-state commercial sector and account for approximately 10% of the population.  Most Bruneian Chinese are permanent residents rather than citizens despite roots going back several generations.  Many are stateless and are denied rights granted to citizens, such as land ownership, subsidized health care, and free secondary and university education.  Because of the discriminatory policies, the number of Chinese in Brunei has shrunk considerably in the last 50 years.  Native ethnic groups that are not included in the Bumiputera are not recognized in the constitution and are not officially identified as “Malay” or automatically granted citizenship.  Foreign workers constitute some quarter of the labor force.Age structure0-14 years: 21.83% (male 54,523/female 51,334)15-64 years: 71.07% (male 164,957/female 179,721)65 years and over: 7.1% (2023 est.)

in 2022 there was a concerted effort to build out the fixed-line infrastructure while progressing towards introducing 5G mobile services; Brunei’s fixed-line market is one of the few countries in the world to have displayed significant growth rather than a decline in teledensity in the last few years; this upward trend is set to continue as the new Unified National Network (UNN) works diligently to expand and enhance the fixed-line infrastructure around the country; strong growth was also seen in the fixed broadband space, on the back of those same infrastructure developments that are part of the Brunei Vision 2035 initiative; fixed broadband is starting from a relatively low base by international standards and is still only at 18%, leaving lots of room for growth; mobile and mobile broadband, on the other hand, are still suffering from the market contractions first felt in 2020; Brunei’s 2G GSM network is shut down, with the spectrum to be reallocated to 3G, 4G, and potentially 5G use (2021)domestic: 25 per 100 fixed-line, 136 per 100 mobile-cellular (2021)international: country code - 673;
