Lefteratou Mary's Lament Modulations and Transpositionsin The Genres of Late Antique Christian poetry: between modulations and transpositions DeGruyter,  2020Classicists and Byzantinists alike largely ignore the lament in the I HC,13 alt- hough its study ... more Classicists and Byzantinists alike largely ignore the lament in the I HC,13 alt- hough its study might help to bridge the gap between the fourth-century Acts of Pilate B and the sixth-century Kontakion of Romanos, and also add to the classical pedigree of such ritual lamentations, as already argued in the magisterial work of Alexiou (2002). This is not the place to discuss the influence of Ephrem on the Marian Lament found in the I HC; that of the Acts of Pilate B, however, is more than certain.14 The focus of this paper is twofold: On the one hand, I will illustrate the continuity and the subversion of classical versions of goos and rhetorical lamentations in this Christian lament for the Son of Man and explore the signifi- cance of this generic modulation for the reception of classicizing genres in Late Antiquity. Secondly, I will address the question of authorship and religious con- text of the I HC within the setting of events following the Council of Ephesus in 431 CE, which declared the Virgin the ‘Theotokos’, given that, surprisingly enough, this early Marian lament does not resurge in the second edition of the Homeric Centos.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These scenes may not, at first sight, appear close to the thoroughly researched mythical mises-en-abîme, such as the Europa painting in Achilles Tatius, but I will argue that they have a similar function since they require from their audience a good knowledge of the contemporary visual culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a test case I will use Xenophon’s of Ephesus ekphrasis of the bed-canopy depicting Ares’ and Aphrodite’s embrace, in the Ephesiaca. The novel might have been written as early as 65 AD but there are still scholars who place it in the early second century.  In what follows I will argue that the scene described on the canopy would have prompted a variety of intertexts, both literary and visual, in the minds of the imperial audience: that is, Xenophon’s model is not just Demodocus’ song of the love of Ares and Aphrodite but also the idealised Roman version of the myth, which was so frequently depicted on frescoes and mosaics in Roman villas in the first century and revisited also in Plutarch and Lucian.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Homeric Centos:  Homer and the Bible interwovenOUP forthcomingThis study is the first attempt to contextualise the First Edition of Homeric Centos, a biblical ... more This study is the first attempt to contextualise the First Edition of Homeric Centos, a biblical epic in Homeric hexameter, within the cultural milieu of Late Antiquity and with regard for its intellectual, literary, and religious aspects. What today we call centos are poems, typically Christian, written in a technique that flourished from the third to the seventeenth century CE, and eventually came to be known as cento poems, κέντρωνες, or κέντρα. Today, thirty years after the publication of Michael Roberts (1989) magisterial Jeweled Style, the number of studies on late antique poetry, both Christian and secular, has exploded. Although these have focused primarily on the Latin authors,  some have been also devoted to the Greek ones, especially their chief representative, Nonnus of Panopolis.  The time is thus ripe for re-contextualising the first edition of Homeric Centos within the framework of Late Antiquity and re-evaluating it with an eye for the biblical poetry of that period.  The present study aspires to examine the first and longest edition of Homeric centos, which date roughly to the first half of the fifth century, to peel back the layers of its thick textual fabric in order to contextualise it within the literary and religious milieu of Late Antiquity: by unpicking and unweaving the poem’s Homeric and biblical strands,  the present reading will show that the Homerocentones is a biblical poem representative of the late antique Homeric reception and biblical exegesis, which, intriguingly, displays a stark female focus.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Greek novels, I argue, shape their plot according to the anticipations of a readership well versed both in mythical and novelistic narratives. Taking axiomatically the novel’s emphasis on mutual love and chastity as indispensable narrative means of achieving the happy ending, I explore four relevant major mythical megatexts of the Greek novels inspired from Homer and Euripides - the myths of Iphigenia, Phaedra, Penelope and Helen - and I analyse their contribution in the shaping of the reader’s expectations regarding the novelistic narrative at a metaliterary level.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
