ITRANS
Version 5.30, July 2001
 freeware  
© 1991-2001, Avinash Chopde
    A package for printing text in Indian languages using English-encoded input.
    
Online Interface to ITRANS
  ITRANS - Indian Language Transliteration Package
  
Version 5.3
  © 1991-2001 by Avinash Chopde. All Rights Reserved.
  Devanagari (Sanskrit/Hindi/Marathi), Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali,
  Gujarati, Gurmukhi, and Romanized Sanskrit script output.
  Output in TeX, HTML, Unicode.
ITRANS is a pre-processor, converts English-encoded text into various
Indian Language scripts for printing or for display.
The input text to ITRANS is in a transliterated form, each letter
in an Indian Script is assigned an English equivalent, and the
English letters are used to represent what will eventually print out in
the Indian Language Script.
ITRANS offers a choice of two input encodings:
ITRANS Encoding, and the CS/CSX encoding.
ITRANS encoding is a 7-bit ASCII encoding (English alphabet),
while the CS/CSX encoding is a 8-bit encoding.
The ITRANS encoding uses multi-character English codes
to represent each Indic Script letter, while the CS/CSX encoding uses a
one-character code to represent each Indic Script letter.
[See ITRANS/doc/icsx.itx in the ITRANS archive for more details regarding
CS/CSX.]
ITRANS supports three kinds of output interfaces: one for TeX documents, one
for PostScript documents, and a third for HTML documents.
The TeX interface is available for most languages, while the PostScript
interface is available for PostScript fonts only, and the HTML interface
is available for TrueType or Unicode fonts only.
The HTML Unicode output uses UTF-8 format, and supports all languages.
  ITRANS 5.3 New Features (released July 2001)
The only addition to this release is the support for Unicode UTF-8 output.
Unicode output is supported for Oriya and Malyalam also, in addition
to all the scripts supported for the TeX interface. Scripts supported for
Unicode: Bengali, Devanagari (Hindi/Marathi/Sanskrit), Gurmukhi (Punjabi),
Oriya, Malayalam, Romanized Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu.
ITRANS package itself
does not include any Unicode fonts, so this feature is useful
only on systems that have a Unicode font for Indian Languages.
Version 5.3 also includes pre-built binaries for installation on i386 Linux
systems or Windows systems.
  ITRANS 5.2 New Features (released Feb 2000)
ITRANS 5.2 is completely compatible with the older ITRANS 5.1 or 4.04
release, so any documents encoded in ITRANS 5.1 or 4.04 will work correctly with
ITRANS 5.2.
ITRANS 5.2 was released Sep 1998, and ITRANS 5.22 in Feb 2000.
Here's a list of major new features added to ITRANS 5.2 (for a complete
list, look at the CHANGES file present in the ITRANS archive).
  New fonts added.
  
Bwti, a Bengali font, and
Pun, a Gurmukhi font for Punjabi,
added to ITRANS.
  
  Input encoding extended with new codes.
  
    ITRANS 5.1 is fully compatibile with ITRANS 4.04 encoding.
    A few new codes are now also accepted:
         Added additional ITRANS codes:
 
         RRi == R^i       RRI == R^I
 
         LLi == L^i       LLI == L^I
 
         '   == .a      (only when #usecsx is in effect)
 
 For bengali:
         Added "Y" (yya in the IFM file), and changed: f --> Y
 
         Added "J" (jadot in the IFM file), now y, z == J.
    Jump to the
    Transliteration Map for a complete
    listing of the ITRANS encoding.
  
#include= command searches for files in more directories.
  
    #include=<filename>
       added as a new ITRANS command, this command will behave as if the
       given file name was copied in at that point. Can appear anywhere
       in the document, and can have nested #include commands (to some maximum).
       This command now searches for <filename> in all directories
       defined in the environment variable ITRANSPATH.
  
#endfont= command added.
  
        Added #endfont=<string>
and extended #<langfont>, mainly for ease of use
with direct HTML output mode of ITRANS.
Usage:
        #endfont=</FONT>% this is a global command, for all languages
        ....
        #hindifont=<FONT FACE="Xdvng">% this is language specific
        now, every #hindi will then print <FONT FACE="Xdvng">
        & any #end<lang> will print </FONT>

Warning: Do not download without reading this:
Installing ITRANS and configuring all
tools required to make it work is a
non-trivial task, and unless you already 
have installed packages such as TeX, dvips, GhostScript
on Windows or Unix platforms and configured them correctly,
it will not be worth your while to attempt an ITRANS installation.
It is much easier to use the Online ITRANS interactive tool,
or the ITRANS-Email server, these tools are described elsewhere on
this page and can be used from most web browsers or email programs.
 End of Warning
The current version of ITRANS 5.3 is now available.

Note that all these fonts are freeware collected from the Web,
they are not considered as part of the ITRANS package. All fonts
are copyright and licensed by their respective owners. These fonts are
provided here in one archive just as an convenience.
  Web server interface scripts:
[CGI]
itrans-cgi.zip
(33 kbytes)
Contains perl scripts and data files used for the 
Online Interface to ITRANS.
These files are specific to my site, they may be used elsewhere
if needed, but will require extensive customization and editing, and
there is little documentation. For experts only.
  Additional binaries:
[MacOs X(10.2)/Darvin 6.0]
MacOS X port of ITRANS 5.3 developed by Shrisha Rao
shrao@dvaita.org
If above link is not working, here's a brief summary of the install steps
from an email from Shrisha Rao:
The file to download is
http://www.dvaita.info/shrao/itrans53-darwin.tgz
but unfortunately the instructions that went with it have been lost when
we moved the site.
Basically, what you need is to do the following:
gunzip itrans53-darwin.tgz
tar xvf itrans53-darwin.tar
This will create a directory with all the files, including the sources and
the MacOS X binary.  The only change to the source from Avinash's website
is in itrans.h, which is altered so that malloc.h is not referenced (it is
unavailable in BSD and derivative strains like Darwin).
You should be able to get this to work with teTeX and related apps., so
make sure you have those installed.  It might also be worth your while to
have the Apple Developer Tools
installed.  (I _think_ utilities like tar and gzip are part of the base MacOS X, but
they may come in the Developer Tools instead; the gcc compiler is for sure
not part of the base OS and comes with the Tools.)  If you plan on using
xdvi or any other X-Window tools, you will of course also need to install
an X environment, which can be done either using Fink or with (Apple's port of X11).

  List of sites that archive ITRANS documents
There are many WWW and FTP sites that store documents in ITRANS format.
The documents can be retrieved in their input format which is the
transliterated form in English, or in the output format which displays
the text in the Indian Language Script.
The Indian Language Script output is may be in the form of a PostSript
file, a GIF image, or HTML ISO-Latin1 or Unicode output.
Here is the list of the archives:
ITRANS Song Book hosted at this site, contains
    some hindi and marathi lyrics, displayed using dynamic fonts in
    Netscape 4.0+ and IE 4.0+.
    
    The
    Sanskrit Documents List
    contains a large collection of ITRANS encoded
    Sanskrit documents, multiple online tools, email tools, and
    many other items related to Sanskrit.
    
    K Vijay Kumar's
    Consolidated
    
    ITRANS Song
    Book archives, 
    a WWW Interface to 2000+ film song lyrics files
    in ITRANS format.
    
Rabindra Sangeet,
Bengali documents -- lyrics of almost all songs Tagore composed.
    
Shatataarakaa,
a WWW Interface to a large collection of Marathi Song Lyrics
in ITRANS format
contributed by many Marathi enthusiasts,
also includes links to RealAudio files where available.
    
    This list is incomplete, if you know of any more sites that archive
    ITRANS documents and allow public access to the documents, send me e-mail,
    I'll list them here.
    
  ITRANS tools: WWW, E-mail processing, etc
As has been pointed out many times by many people, it is very complicated
to configure ITRANS to work correctly on a system with LaTeX, dvips,
Ghostscript, etc.
Here's a list of some tools that make using ITRANS easier - some are online
tools, others require simple installation:
Online Interface to
    ITRANS --- not only can you directly type in text for
    ITRANS processing, you can also submit files in ITRANS .itx format
    for ITRANS and LaTeX processing.
    This interface supports output in GIF, PostScript, PDF, or HTML (Latin1
    or Unicode) formats.
    
    [ This is a new version of the
original
itrans web interface
    created by Hari Adiseshu and others. ]
    
Sanskrit Documents List
    has many tools available:
    
Email
    interface for ITRANSing documents using e-mail.
    
Web Interface, for
    GIF/PS/HTML etc output, supports many fonts.
    
Itranslator,
a freeware package for PCs developed by
Omkarananda
Ashram Himalayas
which interactively converts ITRANS Sanskrit
text into Devanagari scipt (True Type), which can then
be exported or pasted via the clipboard to any application. Itranslator
produces results that are
fully editable, printable on any printer, and of book-quality.
    
Transliteration and Devanagari Fonts for Sanskrit in
  TrueType, PostScript Type 1, Unicode and OpenType Font formats.
  Website maintained by
  Ulrich Stiehl,
  Heidelberg, Germany.
    
    Volker Schuermann's  Jaadoo - ITRANS to
    Devanagari full screen editor for MS-DOS.
    This is an interactive package, instantly shows
    what the given ITRANS input will look like in Devanagari. Output can
    be an ITRANS file, a printed copy of the ITRANS text, or, on a HP
    DeskJet, a print in Devanagari.
    This site also has a simple Hindi learning package with 2000
    words, using English or German as the basis language.
    
Sandeep
    Sibal's Jtrans package, Javascript based online tool for HTML
    output in Devanagari.
    
    This list is definitely incomplete, if you know of any more ITRANS tools
    floating around that should be included here, send me e-mail.
  Online Documentation
Using the Latex2html ITRANS extensions made by 
Ross Moore,
all the documents in ITRANS are available in online form.
This requires using the latest Latex2html (version 2K.1 or later),
which is a Beta version as of July 2001,
available
from here.
For additional info on using Latex2HTML with ITRANS, visit the ITRANS/contrib/
directory for the latex2html.txt file which contains Ross's original
instructions with some comments I added, and the mkl2h script I used
to generate these documents. 
These two files are available in the itransNN.zip source code archive.
The online documents:
All the Indic Script text in the following HTML files is displayed
using .GIF images.
 Main User Manual - idoc.itx
 A table showing ITRANS
encoding for all languages and fonts
Here are all the more more detailed language manuals:
 Bengali - beng.itx
 Devanagari Devnac - dvnc.itx
 Devanagari Devnag - dvng.itx
 Gujarati - gujdoc.itx
 CS/CSX - icsx.itx
 Kannada - kantex.itx
 Punjabi - pundoc.itx
 Romanized Devanagari - romancsx.itx
 Tamil - tamil.itx
 Telugu - tlgutx.itx
Oriya and Malayalam are not supported in ITRANS for LaTeX processing,
but they are available for Unicode output. No documentation is available,
but the ITRANS Transliteration Map
shown above should be used as a guide.
Printing:
the above manauls for online browsing use GIF images for Indic text, 
these are LaTeX documents converted for display on the Web; printing
these pages will result in poor quality output.
For good quality output, use the PostScript files present in
the itransps.zip archive.
Some example documents:
 LaTeX Example input ( ex_latex.itx )     DVI/PS/GIF/PDF output
 HTML Example - ISO Latin1 fonts containing
     Devanagari, Gujarati, Bengali, and Romanized Devanagari text. 
 HTML Example - Unicode UTF8 output containing
     following scripts:
     Bengali, Devanagari (Hindi/Marathi/Sanskrit), Gurmukhi (Punjabi),
     Malayalam, Oriya, Romanized Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu.
