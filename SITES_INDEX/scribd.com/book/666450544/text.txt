Christianity is a relationship—a personal relationship you can have with God through faith in Jesus Christ. In Wisdom for Each Day, Graham crafted 365 devotions to help you nurture and strengthen your faith.

His ministry extended far beyond stadiums and arenas, utilizing radio, television, film, print media, wireless communications, and thirty-three books, all that still carry the Good News of God's redemptive love for mankind. Engraved on a simple fieldstone in the Memorial Prayer Garden where he is buried at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, these words exemplify how the man and the minister wished to be remembered: "Preacher of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ."Read moreRead more from Billy GrahamSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextJust As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy GrahamEbookJust As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy GrahambyBilly GrahamRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Just As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy Graham for laterHope for Each Day: Morning & Evening DevotionsEbookHope for Each Day: Morning & Evening DevotionsbyBilly GrahamRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Hope for Each Day: Morning & Evening Devotions for laterWWE Legends - Superstar Billy Graham: Tangled RopesEbookWWE Legends - Superstar Billy Graham: Tangled RopesbyBilly GrahamRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save WWE Legends - Superstar Billy Graham: Tangled Ropes for laterHear My Heart: What I Would Say to YouEbookHear My Heart: What I Would Say to YoubyBilly GrahamRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Hear My Heart: What I Would Say to You for laterRelated to Wisdom for Each DayRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextThe Spoken Word: 365 Days of RhemaEbookThe Spoken Word: 365 Days of RhemabyZuriel Ann MurphyRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Spoken Word: 365 Days of Rhema for laterThe Imitation of Christ: A Timeless Classic for Contemporary ReadersEbookThe Imitation of Christ: A Timeless Classic for Contemporary ReadersbyThomas à KempisRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save The Imitation of Christ: A Timeless Classic for Contemporary Readers for laterBread for the Journey: A Daybook of Wisdom and FaithEbookBread for the Journey: A Daybook of Wisdom and FaithbyHenri J.

Tap to rateWrite a reviewReview must be at least 10 wordsBook previewWisdom for Each Day - Billy GrahamPREFACE Christianity is more than a system of beliefs or a series of moral guidelines. Christianity is a relationship—a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ. When we commit our lives to Him, the barriers are torn down... the gap between us is bridged...and we become members of God’s family forever. We no longer face life alone, for Christ’s promise is true: I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:20). But like any other personal relationship, our relationship with God must be nurtured and strengthened. If it isn’t, our faith will grow weak and we will become increasingly vulnerable to Satan’s deceptions and temptations. Nor will we experience the joy and peace that Christ promised us, even in the midst of life’s worst storms. How do we grow in our relationship with Christ? The most important step we can take is to set aside time each day to be alone with God—reading His Word, meditating on its truth, and coming to Him in prayer. Even a few minutes alone with God will help you keep your priorities straight, and focus your heart and mind on God’s love and God’s will for your life. This book isn’t a substitute for reading the Bible more extensively—but my prayer is that God will use it to strengthen you and give you the wisdom you need to live for Christ every day. BILLY GRAHAM JANUARY JANUARY 1 New Year, New Ways Give careful thought to your ways. HAGGAI 1:5 Making New Year’s resolutions and not keeping them is a universal experience. We may be sincere when we make them, but then we find them too hard to keep, or perhaps we forget all about them. Let me give you two reasons why it can be good to make resolutions at the beginning of a new year. First, it forces us to look at ourselves—to be honest about our failures and our need to change. Many New Year’s resolutions are unrealistic or only wishful thinking, but the exercise of examining ourselves—with God’s help—and seeing where we fall short is important. Second, making a list of resolutions can turn us to God. If we are honest, we know we fall far short of being what we ought to be—and because of that, we need God’s forgiveness. We’ll also realize that we can’t live the way we should in our own strength. We need God’s help. Begin this year by making resolutions—especially the resolution to open your heart and life to Jesus Christ more than you ever have before. JANUARY 2 Hope for the Future If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 2 CORINTHIANS 5:17 NKJV As we start a new year, the Bible tells us there can be hope for the future. First, there is hope of a changed person. No matter how hard we try, we are incapable of ridding ourselves of the selfishness and greed that cause conflict and strife and war. Our only hope is a changed heart—and Jesus is in the business of changing hearts. Second, there is hope of a changed world. When we know Christ, He gives us by His Spirit a new love and concern for others. We can no longer be indifferent to their sufferings, and we’ll want to do something about them. Changed by Christ, we can begin to change our world. Third, there is hope of an unchanging eternity in Heaven. This world is not all there is. Someday all its pain and heartache will come to an end for those who know Christ (Rev. 21:4). Evil and death will be abolished, and we will be safely in God’s presence forever. As you read the headlines or look at your own life, you may be wondering if there is any hope. The answer from the Bible is a resounding yes. JANUARY 3 Your Purpose in Life Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path. PSALM 27:11 God has a plan or purpose for every person, although many people go through life without ever thinking about it. But their lack of awareness doesn’t change the fact that God put each of us here for a purpose. We aren’t here by accident. We are here because God put us here. And He put us here for a reason: so we could come to know Him in a personal way and then live in a way that brings glory to His name. This is the greatest discovery you will ever make: You were created to know God and to be His friend forever. When I was young, my mother taught me from our church’s catechism that the chief end [or purpose] of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. But God not only has a general purpose for each of us; He also has a specific plan for each of our lives. Don’t wander through life without any purpose or direction, but pray and seek God’s will, and learn to follow Him. JANUARY 4 Revival Begins with You Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near. MATTHEW 4:17 If Christianity is important at all, then it is all-important. If it is anything at all, then it is everything. It is either the most vital thing in your life, or it isn’t worth bothering with. So don’t give the lie to the Christian faith by professing Christ without possessing Him. Don’t lock the church door with the key of inconsistency and keep the lost from coming to Christ. Don’t hinder revival by your unbelief and prayerlessness. Don’t cheat yourself out of spiritual victory by allowing sin to imprison you. Seek God’s face and turn from your wicked ways. Then you will hear from heaven and true revival will begin—starting with you. The Church holds the key to revival. It is within our grasp. Will we rise to the challenge? Will we dare pay the price? The supply of heaven is adequate for the demands of our spiritually starved world. Will we offer that supply to the hungry masses? May the revival that the world needs begin in you—starting today. JANUARY 5 Tending to Our Earthly Tent We know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven. 2 CORINTHIANS 5:1 Her uncle had some very bad health habits that would kill him if he didn’t stop them. But when she shared her concern, he laughed and said he’d rather enjoy his life, even if it shortened his days. Why, she asked me, would anyone act like this? I was first struck by his self-centeredness. Deliberately doing something that will cut short his life revealed that he was thinking only about himself, and ignoring all the hurt and sorrow his premature death would bring to his family. Perhaps I suggested, she could remind him of this—as well as urge him to give his life to Christ. But his situation got me to thinking: In what ways might we be like him? What health rules are we violating? In what ways are we not taking care of the body God has given us? Someday each one of us who follows Jesus as our Savior and Lord will leave behind our earthly tent—our flesh-and-bone body—and join Him in Heaven for eternity. But until that day—as the Bible says—Honor God with your body (1 Corinthians 6:20). JANUARY 6 Vision, Integrity, Presence Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. ROMANS 12:2 In many contexts, VIP means Very Important Person. But the acronym also offers us a character test. The V stands for VISION, for where there is no vision, the people perish (Prov. 29:18, KJV). Having a vision means seeing what can be done, what ought to be done, and how to get it done. The highest vision we can have is to glorify God by discovering God’s will for our lives—and then doing it. The letter I stands for INTEGRITY, meaning that a person is the same on the inside as he or she appears on the outside. There must be no discrepancy between what we say and what we do between our walk and our talk. The P stands for PRESENCE—God’s presence in our lives. Without God’s help we are doomed. Only in Christ do we find out who we are, why we are here, and where we are going—and only in Him do we find the power to fulfill our God-given vision. So be steadfast in your commitment to Christ, and be a real VIP—a person with vision, integrity, and God’s presence. JANUARY 7 How Will We Learn? The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple. PSALM 119:130 We know we ought to know more about the Bible—but perhaps you’re like many Christians: It’s so overwhelming you’ve never really gotten into it. The first step is to realize what it is: God’s love letter to you. From one end to the other it tells of God’s love for us—a love so great that He sent His Son into the world to redeem us. You wouldn’t ignore a letter from someone who loved you; don’t ignore God’s love letter either. Then think of ways you can learn about the Bible from others—gifted teachers on the radio, your pastor’s sermons, group Bible studies, even books like this. Some people have a special God-given gift for teaching His Word, and they can help you learn more about it. Finally, get acquainted with the Bible on your own. Set aside a few quiet minutes and begin reading through one of the Gospels (such as John)—perhaps only a paragraph or two at first. Ask God to help you understand it, and to apply it to your life every day. JANUARY 8 Eyes that Refuse to See They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people. EZEKIEL 12:2 The Bible tells us that we have two sets of eyes. We have physical eyes—but we also have spiritual eyes. With one set we see the physical world around us, while with the other we discern the spiritual truths God has set forth for us in His Word. Tragically, some who are able to see physically do not see spiritually—and spiritual blindness keeps us from knowing God. Sometimes physical blindness can be prevented or cured. Spiritual blindness, however, is caused by sin—and only the Lord Jesus Christ can cure spiritual blindness because only He can take away our sin. When we come to Christ, He comes to live within us by His Holy Spirit—and He then opens our spiritual eyes to God’s truth. This is one reason why the Bible is important, because God uses it to help us discern His truth. May you turn to God and receive from Him the cure for your spiritual blindness. May He open your eyes to His love, so you learn to trust Him no matter what troubles you. And may He guide you as He opens your eyes to His will every day. JANUARY 9 God’s Desire for You We… are being transformed into [Christ’s] likeness with ever-increasing glory. 2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 God can seem near to us when we walk in the woods or are surrounded by the grandeur of a starry night, and that is a wonderful experience. But it shouldn’t become a substitute for going to church. Never forget: God doesn’t want us to just feel His presence. He wants to change our lives. He wants to take away our self-centeredness and make us more like Christ. He also wants to teach us His truth and prepare us to become His servants. How does this happen? How does God change us into the people He wants us to be? Not just by a walk in the woods, as pleasant as that may be. No, God mainly changes us by His Word, the Bible, as we listen to its truth and allow it to shape our lives. That is one reason I urge you to become active in a church where God’s Word is taught and lived. You will become more like Christ as you hear and obey His Word. JANUARY 10 New Hearts, New World I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. EZEKIEL 36:26 Today we have more knowledge than at any other time in history. In seconds our laptops or personal computers can call up information about a topic that would have taken years to collect formerly. Young people graduate from high schools, colleges, and universities with more knowledge than ever before—but they are not always acquiring the wisdom to use it. In spite of their knowledge, they are confused, bewildered, frustrated, and without moral moorings. Why is there so little peace in a world of unprecedented knowledge and unlimited potential? The problem, Jesus said, is the human heart: out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries… (Matthew 15:19 NKJV). The new world will come about only when Jesus Christ, the King of kings and the Lord of lords, reigns supreme in people’s hearts. At the end of the present age God will act, and Scripture promises that He will act dramatically and decisively. But before that time comes, God wants to rule in our hearts. Is He ruling in yours? JANUARY 11 What Are You Pursuing? I denied myself nothing.... Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless. ECCLESIASTES 2:10–11 King Solomon was convinced he knew how to find happiness—and because he had vast resources at his command, he was able to pursue it. Wealth, fame, pleasure, power, lavish houses, a reputation for wisdom—you name it, King Solomon achieved it. And yet after gaining everything he had ever wanted, he reluctantly concluded that his life was still empty and without meaning. His search for lasting happiness had failed, and his soul was still empty. Are you in danger of making the same mistake King Solomon made—convinced that the things of this world will bring you happiness and peace, and pursuing them with all your might? Don’t be deceived; they never will. And the reason is because you were made to know God. Later King Solomon realized this. He should have known it sooner; after all, his father David was a man after God’s own heart, and Solomon himself had vowed to live according to God’s wisdom. Don’t be misled (as he was), but make Christ the center and foundation of your life—beginning today. JANUARY 12 True Worship Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. PSALM 95:6–7 When was the last time you truly worshiped God? What is worship anyway? Worship in the truest sense takes place only when our full attention is on God—on His glory, His power, His majesty, His love, His compassion. And if we’re honest, this doesn’t happen very often, because even in church or in our times of quiet devotion we get distracted and fail to see God as He truly is. Notice in these verses what prompted the Psalmist’s worship. First, he recognized that God was the Lord—the sovereign, all-powerful God of the universe. He recognized, too, that God had made him; he wasn’t here by accident but by God’s perfect plan. Finally, he worshiped God because God had made him part of His flock, constantly watching over him and providing for his every need. Learn to shut out the distractions that keep you from truly worshiping God. Then turn your mind and heart to Him every day, praising Him for who He is and thanking Him for His love for you in Christ. JANUARY 13 God’s Life-Changing Word They asked each other, Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us? LUKE 24:32 Can an ancient book that was written by many people over the course of many centuries have anything to say to us today? Is the Bible’s message honestly relevant? Yes, it is—as millions of believers around the world would attest. If anything, in fact, it’s more relevant today than ever before, as we see the storm clouds gathering and events taking place that herald the second coming of Jesus Christ. As the Bible says, Our salvation is nearer than when we first believed (Romans 13:11). But the Bible is as up-to-date as tomorrow for another reason: It alone answers the deepest questions of the human heart—questions that have not changed over the centuries. Who am I? Why am I here? Where did I come from? Where am I going when I die? How should I live? Only the Bible gives us firm answers to these questions—and the reason is because it is God’s Word, given by Him to guide us and point us to Christ. Is the Bible the foundation of your life? JANUARY 14 Love in Action Since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 1 JOHN 4:11–12 Jesus said, All men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another (John 13:35). But how do we put that love into action? Serve one another. The Lord modeled this when He washed His disciples’ feet. Be patient with one another. This is possible because of the Spirit’s presence in us. Be courteous to one another. Even if someone is difficult or disagreeable, treat them with gentleness and love. Set an example for one another in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity (1 Timothy 4:12). Forgive one another because God forgave us. If we do not extend forgiveness, God will not forgive your sins (Matthew 6:15). We are not to judge one another. That is the Lord’s job. We may be called to rebuke or reprove in love, but we are not to judge. Be subject one to another. That will mean not always having things our way. Edify one another. We are to encourage and build up our brothers and sisters in Christ. Pray for one another. What a privilege to come before the Lord on another’s behalf. JANUARY 15 Seeking the Truth While Paul was… in Athens... he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. ACTS 17:16–17 When the apostle Paul came to Athens, Greece, he saw people who were like many in our world today: they were trying to put together the puzzle of life. The average Athenian of that day was a religious person. In fact, the people in Athens had numerous gods, and their city was sprinkled with numerous idols and temples. They also followed numerous philosophies in their search for truth. One group of philosophers, the Epicureans, thought that happiness and pleasure were the goal of life. They sought an absence of pain and a maximum of pleasure. Another group, the Stoics, believed that the world was governed by reason or logic, and the goal of life was to accept whatever life sent to them. Those philosophers argued with Paul—but some who heard him were serious searchers after truth. The religions and philosophies of the day had left them empty, and they wanted to know the truth. And they heard it as they listened to Paul tell them about Jesus, and the hope we can have because of Him. Are you searching for the truth? Don’t let anything—or anyone—keep you from Jesus, who alone is the way and the truth and the life (John 14:6). JANUARY 16 Ask…and Receive Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. LUKE 11:9 How can you know you’ll go to Heaven when you die? Suppose a friend comes by your house and offers you a gift. What would you do? Would you refuse to take it until you had paid him for it? Would you decline it because you felt you weren’t worthy of it? No, of course not. Your friend wants you to have it and has already paid for it; all you must do is accept it. In a far greater way, this is what Jesus Christ did for you. By His death on the cross he paid the price for your salvation—completely and fully. Now He offers it to you as a free gift—and all you have to do is receive it. The Bible says, For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23). Have you received this gift? You can, by confessing to God your sins and your need of Christ, and then asking Him to come into your life. Salvation is God’s free gift; why not receive it today? JANUARY 17 Problems—and Peace Present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. PHILIPPIANS 4:6–7 God doesn’t necessarily remove all our problems when we become followers of Christ. But He has promised to be with us and help us and encourage us in the midst of those problems. Jesus’ promise to His disciples is still true: Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you… Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid (John 14:27). How is it possible to experience this kind of peace? It’s possible first of all because we are never alone if we know Christ. He loves us and is with us, and nothing we will ever face takes Him by surprise. This peace is also possible because the Holy Spirit gives us patience and joy even in the midst of life’s difficulties. And peace is possible because we know our problems are only temporary; someday they will all come to an end. Which is better: facing life’s problems and hurts without God—or facing them with Him? Which are you choosing today? JANUARY 18 Putting the Pieces Back Together Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life. PSALM 138:7 Do you feel as if you’ve let God down? Let me reassure you that He loves you no matter what you’ve done. The last thing God wants you to do is to spend your life filled with guilt and shame and remorse. May that truth give you hope, because it means that God wants to help you. He wants to put back together the Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksChristianityFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
