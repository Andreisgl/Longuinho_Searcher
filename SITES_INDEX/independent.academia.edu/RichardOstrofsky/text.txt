Richard E OstrofskyScience and Religion+6Born in New York City in 1942. BA in Math from Columbia University.  Nidan in aikido and about 35 years teaching experience. Contract work for Canadian Government in Informatics and Program Evaluation. Central Research Interest: Human existence in a self-organized cosmos.Supervisors: amateur, largely auto-didactPhone: 514-342-0528Address: Montreal, QC, Canadaless105 Followers4 FollowingTotal Views ;21 Public MentionsFollowFollowingall4 Religion in the Modern World6 Theoretical Psychology2 Short Columns1 Papers2 DraftsReligion in the Modern WorldReligion from the Perspective of BiologyReligion (broadly understood as committed worldview and approach to life) does not need gods or s... more Religion (broadly understood as committed worldview and approach to life) does not need gods or supernatural entities of any kind. Everyone has a religion of sorts, because it is hardly possible to function without one. It serves a variety of cognitive and social functions, and is developed - with lesser or greater sensitivity and consciousness - over the course of a life. So understood, religion without superstition, compatible with modern science and biology is entirely possible.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our groups make us, even as we make them.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

But the question “What am I?” is even more central, and more difficult to answer consciously. It asks about my nature as a thing, an entity, among all other entities – and types of entity – in the universe. It questions what I can expect from myself, and what I should ask of myself and others. It asks: “What is it to be human, and to be the particular human that I am?”Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We are ashamed of every thing that is real about us, ashamed of ourselves, of our relatives, of our incomes, of our accents, of our opinions, of our experience, just as we are ashamed of our naked skins. George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman Note: Parts one and two of this essay are largely precis of another man's book. Accordingly, I must begin by acknowledging my debt to Dr. Donald Nathanson for all material in those sections on affect theory and shame, and for such understanding of these as I have gained and re-package here. The misunderstandings are my own.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Between them, they motivate much or all of human activities, and can be seen as drivers of culture and history - in particular, their power relationships of dominance and submission.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
