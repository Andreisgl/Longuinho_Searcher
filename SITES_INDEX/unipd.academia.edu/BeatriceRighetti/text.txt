How Women Wrote about Themselves: A Corpus-informed Comparison of Women Writers’ Defences in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth- century EnglandWomen’s written defences of their sex developed within the literary context of the querelle des f... more Women’s written defences of their sex developed within the literary context of the querelle des femmes, a mainly male debate on female intellectual worth, which started in the Middle Ages and came to a peak during the Renaissance. This paper focuses on the discourse some women writers started to develop in sixteenth- and seventeenth- century England, when the growing number of misogynist attacks led some of them to respond in kind. The first works directly engaging the topics of the querelle are usually identified in Isabella Whitney’s poem The Copy of a Letter (1567) and Jane Anger’s Jane Anger Her Protection For Women (1589). These are coupled with three later pamphlets framed in the so-called Swetnam debate, from the name of the misogynist pamphleteer to whom these three women writers replied, namely A Muzell for Melastomus (1617) by Rachel Speght, Ester Hath Hang’d Haman (1617) by Ester Sowernam and The Worming of a Mad Dogge: or, A Soppe for Cerberus, a Redargution of the Bayte...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although a first interpretation of the play hints at the fact that fear should be found mainly in Kate, many critics have claimed that this emotion is embodied by other characters as well, especially by Petruchio, who mirrors male anxiety and violent behaviour during the Renaissance. Petruchio’s violence hints at a third reading, which suggests that both Kate and he may be ‘subjects’ and ‘objects’ of fear as they both cause it and feel it as ‘refractions of reality’ and onstage as characters.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
