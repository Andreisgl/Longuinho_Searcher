Although his writings are not directly related to movies, a close look at his concepts can help to solve some problems in film semiotics, and some concepts can be used to analyze a special case of filmic discourse. Film and Self-Referentiality – a brief introduction The topic of film and self-referentiality covers a vast domain and poses several problems. The difficulties start already with the ambiguity of the term “film”. When we just say “film ” without any context to define how the term is used, it could mean many different aspects: the material film strip; something that has been produced and is subject to economic exchange; film as a cultural phenomenon, or a type of discourse; one concrete film (text); and finally in a certain way, the sum of the flickering light projected on the screen. It can also include further aspects of cinematic phen...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Censorship, the act of censoring a text — be it a literary text, a newspaper or a movie —, is a large topic and its discussion necessarily has to include political, sociological and economic aspects in addition to the analysis of the actual changes of the text. As a matter of fact, even if confined to censoring films, it is too large a topic to be discussed in a short contribution. Accordingly, the paper will deal only with one small and very special subject that — though it might be considered marginal to the overall problem — sheds light on the view on censorship from within the medium: The paper will give some examples of how the issue is presented in movies and thus focus on the discussion of self-referential filmic modes of discourse and not on the analysis of censorship as such.

Reading the books and watching the movies and buying collectibles is definitely not confined to young adults – the original primary target group, nor is all that done just for fun as the long long list of books and articles analyzing the texts and the phenomenon demonstrates. Authors come from the entire spectrum of the humanities (and even a few scientists are among them), however, there are so far not too many semiotically oriented papers. In my paper I will try to read the texts (from all three canons: the novels, subsequent writings by J.K. Rowling in print and online, and the movies) from a socio-semiotic perspective inspired by the work of Ferruccio Rossi-Landi. I will focus on the character of magical performance which can be examined in view of his concepts of materiality, signs and bodies. Unfortunately, other questions touching a more comprehensive (socio )semiotic analysis can only be briefly mentioned; the same goes for topics obviously related to specific sign systems like runes and divination as well as the strong inter- and intratextual relations presented in the saga.[At the end of this uploaded version of the paper is the original powerpoint presentation, not included in the published proceedings.]Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, semiotics in the sense of a real enterprise developed only in the late 1970s starting with the foundation of the Österreichische Gesellschaft für Semiotik–Austrian Association for Semiotics ÖGS/AAS in 1976. Some thirteen years later, in 1989, the Institute for Socio-Semiotic Studies ISSS followed. Together they organized larger and smaller conferences, published several book series and two journals and initiated research projects. Following the subtitle, the major part of my contribution is dedicated to the late Jeff Bernard who initiated, or was at least closely connected to, these activities. The final parts of the paper will deal with his role on the international semiotic scene as shown by the close collaboration with other semiotic groups (especially in the neighboring countries) and by the twenty years of fulfilling different functions in the Bureau of the International Association for Semiotic Studies IASS. The contribution ends with an overview on Jeff Bernard’s (mostly socio-) semiotic research and the major models.[At the end of this uploaded version of the paper is the original powerpoint presentation, not included in the published proceedings.]Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to deal with the variety of manifestations, ‘censorship’ will be used here in the widest sense, covering the range from selfregulation, that is forms of self-imposed control, to actual direct state censorship (in advance as well as on the nished product) or to its milder contemporary form of a rating system. The agents will be both official censors, working on a large scale for an entire country, and local authorities, like the representatives of the Church, who simply ordered the local exhibitors to cut certain scenes, otherwise the population of the village would hear the strong disapproval of the movie during Sunday morning services. Apart from these stories about controlling the filmic text, a second group of examples will include the rare cases of an actual and deliberate onscreen presentation both visual or verbal of censorial practices.
