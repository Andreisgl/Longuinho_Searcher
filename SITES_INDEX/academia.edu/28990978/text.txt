Several type sites were identified as typical of fortified Judean cities based on these elements including Beit Mirsim, Tel en-Nasbeh, Beth Shemesh, and Beer-sheba. In 2008, Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Saar Ganor of the Israel Antiquities Authority began excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, which I joined as an area supervisor in Area C during the 2009-2010 seasons. These excavations found that Khirbet Qeiyafa was built following the same urban plan as that of other Iron Age Judean cities. A gradualistic sequence is here observed in the evolution of a distinctly Judean urban plan as an expression of public policy related to urban planning in the Kingdom of Judah. Khirbet Qeiyafa, which is dated to the early Iron IIA period, is chronologically placed at the beginning of this sequence.Download Free PDFView PDFPapers Presented at a Colloquium of the Swiss Society for Ancient Near Eastern Studies Held at the University of Bern, September 6, 2014, ed. by S. Schroer and S. Münger (Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 282). Fribourg (CH): Academic Press/Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & RuprechtKhirbet Qeiyafa in the Shephelah2017 • Stefan MüngerExcavations at the early Iron age site of Khirbet Qeiyafa (Israel), directed from 2007 to 2011 by Yosef Garfinkel and Saar Ganor under the auspices of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Israel Antiquities Authority, have attracted considerable scholarly and media attention since the very first season, when the discovery of an inscribed ostracon sparked controversies over the site’s historical significance and nature. Located at the entrance of the Elah Valley, protected by a casemate wall and two monumental gateways, the settlement of Qeiyafa existed for barely half a century. Its dating and the correlation of the archaeological evidence with the regional history, not least the rise of an early Judahite monarchy, have become matters of intense academic debate. Resulting from a colloquium of the Swiss Society of Ancient Near Eastern Studies, this volume offers a condensed report by main excavator Yosef Garfinkel as well as several in-depth studies on archaeological, historical, epigraphical, iconographical and biblical issues.Download Free PDFView PDFDebating Khirbet Qeiyafa: A Fortified City in Judah from the Time of King David. Y. Garfinkel, I. Kreimerman and P. Zilberg, 2016. Debating Khirbet Qeiyafa: A Fortified City in Judah from the Time of King David. Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society.Yosef  Garfinkel, Igor KreimermanIn 2007 the name “Khirbet Qeiyafa” was still unknown both to professional archaeologists and to the public. In 2008 Khirbet Qeiyafa became world-famous. This spectacular success is entirely due to the figure of King David, who is so well known from the biblical tradition but is a very elusive figure from the archaeological or historical point of view. Nowhere else had an archaeological layer that can be related to this king been uncovered, not even in Jerusalem. For the first time in the archaeology of Judah, a fortified city from the time of King David had been exposed. The date of the site was obtained by accurate radiometric measurements conducted on short-lived samples of burned olive pits. The location in the Elah Valley, just one day’s walk from Jerusalem, places the site in the core area of the Kingdom of Judah. Moreover, it is exactly in this area and this era that the biblical tradition places the famous combat between the inexperienced and anonymous young shepherd David and the well-equipped giant Philistine warrior Goliath. Khirbet Qeiyafa has become the point of contact between archaeology, biblical studies, ancient history and mythology. The fieldwork at Khirbet Qeiyafa lasted seven seasons, from 2007 to 2013. This book, written at the end of the excavation phase, summarizes the main results, supplies answers to various issues concerning the site that have been raised over the last few years, and presents a comprehensive interim report. We are using this opportunity to discuss various methodological issues that relate to archaeology and the biblical tradition, and how to combine the two.Download Free PDFView PDFKhirbet Qeiyafa: An Unsensational Archaeological and Historical InterpretationAlexander Fantalkin, Israel FinkelsteinABSTRACT The article deals with the finds at the late Iron I settlement of Khirbet Qeiyafa, a site overlooking the Valley of Elah in the Shephelah. It points out the methodological shortcomings in both field work and interpretation of the finds. It then turns to several issues related to the finds: the identity of the inhabitants, their territorial affiliation and the possibility of identifying Khirbet Qeiyafa with sites mentioned in the Bible and in the Shoshenq I list.Download Free PDFView PDFWas Khirbet Qeiyafa a Judahite City? The Case against It - Journal of Hebrew Scriptures 17 (2017), Article 7 (pp. 1-40)Nadav Na'amanThe article critically examines Khirbet Qeiyafaʼs excavators’ conclusion that the site was a Judahite city established by King David. The site is located in the Shephelah, far from the highlands; its city plan, the strength of its fortifications, its vast commercial relations, and its economic prosperity are unparalleled in the highlands in the first half of the tenth century BCE. Detailed analysis of the published reports did not disclose any findings that connect it to either Jerusalem or the Judean and Benjamin hill country. On the contrary, according to the archaeological reports, the site conducted ramified commercial relations with districts located throughout the Land of Israel and beyond, but not with sites located in the highlands. Moreover, the siteʼs excavators failed to bring parallels between Khirbet Qeiyafa and early tenth century BCE sites in the highlands. Instead, they suggested parallels between elements uncovered at the site and closely related elements discovered in ninth-eighth century sites in the Kingdom of Judah. This kind of discussion that rests on the late reality to demonstrate the early one is anachronistic and should be dismissed altogether. Likewise, the presentation of early tenth-century Khirbet Qeiyafa as a site located in the Judahite Shephelah is wholly anachronistic. The article demonstrates that Khirbet Qeiyafa is connected neither to the emergence of the Kingdom of Judah in the early tenth century BCE nor to King David. Rather, it should be studied in the context of the Shephelah, the district in which it is located, and the major urban centres of the coast and the nearby regions.Download Free PDFView PDFY.

The Shephelah in the Iron Age: A New Look on the Settlement of Judah, Palestine Exploration Quarterly 145: 203-219.Avraham FaustThe Shephelah was densely settled in the Late Bronze Age, but most of the settlements were gradually abandoned during the transition to the Iron I period. Only a few Iron I settlements existed in the eastern part of the region (excluding the Philistine sites at the northwestern edge of the Shephelah), forming a small Canaanite enclave. During the Iron II period the region was gradually resettled, and it became part of Judah. This process lasted until the 8th century BCE, when the region reached an unparalleled demographic peak. Sennacherib’s campaign brought wide-scale destruction, and the region recovered only partially before being devastated by Nebuchadnezzar. After reconstructing the region’s settlement history, the article reassesses its political and demographic history in comparison to the neighbouring regions of the Judean highlands and the southern coastal plain, it is concluded that the Shephelah had a lesser role in the history of Judah than some recent studies suggest.Download Free PDFView PDFLehmann G. and Niemann H.M. 2014 When Did the Shephelah become Judahite?
