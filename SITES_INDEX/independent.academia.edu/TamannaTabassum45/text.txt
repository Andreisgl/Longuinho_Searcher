Candidate bacteria were isolated using Nutrient Agar (NA) and de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar in duplicate. An immersion technique was employed to determine the biosafety of these isolates in both catfish species at a dose of 10 7 CFU/mL. Three experimental diets: D1 (basal diet + putative Bacillus sp., 10 8-10 9 CFU/g), D2 (basal diet + 3% BioFav Aqua) and D3 (basal diet + putative Lactobacillus sp., 10 8-10 9 CFU/g) were prepared to conduct a 4-week long feeding trial, whereas the control diet received no probiotic supplementation. The probiotic performance was analysed by comparing the growth performance and survival of C. batrachus and H. fossilis. Resistance against Aeromonas veronii infection was determined by a challenge test of catfish. Initially, 16 autochthonous isolates were collected, and among them, an isolate from C. batrachus intestine and another from the gut of H. fossilis were selected for further studies. A series of biochemical analyses identified that the putative bacteria were Bacillus sp. and Lactobacillus sp., respectively. The biosafety test showed no clinical signs of infection or mortality among experimental catfishes. All probiotic-treated fish showed higher growth increments than control. Incorporation of Bacillus sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the basal diet significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) improved growth and survival in both catfish, where Bacillus sp. showed the best effects in C. batrachus, and Lactobacillus sp. in H. fossilis. Intramuscular (IM) injection with A. veronii revealed that probiotic-treated fish had better survival rates. The study demonstrated the potentiality of autochthonous bacteria to enhance growth, survival, feed efficiency and immunity and hence recommended as a better health management approach in catfish aquaculture.

Microplastics in fishmeal: A threatening issue for sustainable aquaculture and human healthAquaculture ReportsPlastic pollution is a global concern, leading to the abundance of macro-and microplastics (MPs) ... more Plastic pollution is a global concern, leading to the abundance of macro-and microplastics (MPs) in the marine environment and subsequent accumulation in many marine organisms, particularly small pelagic and oceanic fish species. These small fishes are usually considered as the non-target catch or by-products of marine capture fisheries. However, these by-catch fishes convert into fishmeal due to their excellent nutritional value, and thereby, it used as the primary ingredient of artificial feeds for aquaculture and livestock animal production. The fishmeal and fish feed facilitates MPs&amp;#39; entry into the aquaculture systems when the MPs− contaminated feeds are supplied to cultured fish for regular feeding. Thus, MPs get access to interact with the elements of the culture pond ecosystem and leading to subsequent alterations in the physiological and behavioral attributes of cultured fishes. Consequently, MPs may accumulate in the edible portions of cultured fishes, which may cause severe physiological disorders in fish consumers. Thus, human exposure to MPs becomes a significant threat to global public health. Therefore, this review discussed the factors associated with MPs&amp;#39; introduction to the aquaculture systems via fishmeal. In addition, this article enlightened the possible consequences of MPs on the pond ecosystem, cultured fish physiology, and consumer health. We hypothesized that the growing concern among people about MPs might be impacted the demand for aquaculture goods. This study recommended taking necessary steps towards improving the MPs&amp;#39; screening process during fish feed production and focusing on more exclusive studies to elucidate the impacts of MPs on sustainable aquaculture production.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and predictors of anxiety, depression and stress among young people diagnosed with COVID-19 of Bangladesh amidst the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 1 May to 30 May 2020 using an online Google form-based questionnaire posted on Facebook. A snowball sampling approach was used for data collection. A total of 974 self-declared healthy individuals not diagnosed with COVID-19 participated here. Anxiety, depression and stress were measured using Bangla validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), respectively. Statistical software SPSS 20 was used for analysis. Result Average age of the population was 25.86±6.26 (SD) years with nearly half (48.6%) of them being young people (15 to ≤24 years). Most of the participants were male (76.3%). The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress was found to be 64.1%, 73.3% and 69.4%, respectively. Young people had significantly higher proportion of anxiety (67.2% vs 61.1%), and depression (78.2% vs 68.7%) compared to adults (p=0.045 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). However, most of the participants had mild depression (30.3%), minimal anxiety (31.4%), and moderate stress (67.5%) and severity of depression and anxiety being higher in the young participants. The mean GAD-7, PHQ-9 and PSS scores were 7.57±5.61, 9.19±6.15 and 16.02±5.55 (SD), respectively. On multivariable logistic analysis, unemployment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 3.642; Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.005-13.200; p&lt;0.05) was the single most important predictor of depression. For stress, unemployment (AOR 1.399; CI: 1.055-1.855), and female sex (AOR 1.638; CI: 1.158-2.317) were significant predictors. Conclusion Anxiety, depression and stress were highly prevalent among young people (≤24 years) not diagnosed with COVID-19 in Bangladesh amidst the pandemic. Unemployment is the most common underlying determinant. Authorities should address the issue on a priority basis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

METHODOLOGY: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) technique tools such as personal interview, focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interview with fish farmers were done to collect preliminary data. Fish and water samples were collected from catfish ponds and were analyzed in the Fish Disease Laboratory, Faculty of Fisheries, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The microbial loads of pond water (CFU/ mL) were determined by ten-fold serial dilution using Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) after incubation at 25 °C for 48 h. Hematological analysis of blood samples were done to determine RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, blood glucose level and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) of the over-wintered catfish. KEY FINDINGS: It was found that the water temperature, pH, dissolve oxygen, total alkalinity and ammonia ranged from 27 to 20.5°C, 8.2 to 7.0, 7 to 5 ppm, 190 to 120 ppm, 0.03 ppm, respectively during the study period. Among the 15 ponds, the highest and lowest temperature was recorded in P. hypophthalmus ponds. The highest alkalinity was observed in P. hypophthalmus ponds and minimum was found in O. pabda ponds. The ammonia concentration was more or less similar (0.03 ppm) in 15 ponds. Average bacterial load of rearing water was ranged from the highest 2.6 ± 1.60 ×105 CFU/ mL to lowest 2.3 ± 1.93 ×103 CFU/ mL in H. fossilis ponds. The study revealed maximum RBC, WBC contents and the highest glucose level in O. pabda and minimum in H. fossilis and P. hypophthalmus. However, MCH and hemoglobin levels were found higher in P. hypophthalmus and lower in O. pabda.

Specialized voice service in virtual environment enables users to speak to each other naturally and seamlessly. The spatial 3D avatar location and the voice direction in the virtual environment are used to generate realistic sound. Although with this specialized audio or voice streaming in virtual environment the real user can more easily identify who is talking, if several people are taking simultaneously. But this is a challenging task to stream the voice or audio data to the users&#39; machine by considering the user bandwidth limit and the tight latency constraint and this can be formalized as a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we presented the proof of NP-completeness of the specialized audio streaming problem called DBF-MLT.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

First treatment (T1) was supplemented with the soil probiotic Super PS/ week, T2 was designed to add gut probiotic Zymetin with feed, T3 contained half of the recommended doses of soil, gut, and water probiotics pH FIXER, T4 was planned to supplement with pH FIXER/ week, and no probiotic was used in T5 (control). Growth parameters (net weight gain, weight gain (%) and specific growth rate (%), SGR), survival, feed utilization (feed conversion ratio, FCR and feed conversion efficiency, FCE); water quality (dissolved oxygen, DO, free ammonia, temperature, alkalinity and pH), hematological parameters (RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, glucose, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH), gut bacterial load and intestinal histomorphology (villi length, and enterocyte height) were analyzed fortnightly by sacrificing 3 fish/ treatment. Significant improvements in water qualities, growth performance, feed utilization, hematological parameters, intestinal microbial load and morphology were found with probiotic supplemented treatments than the control group where supplementation of gut probiotic (T2) and combination of soil, gut and water probiotics (T3) significantly augmented growth performance and feed utilization with improved gut microbiota and intestinal morphology. Hence, the findings recommended probiotic supplementation as an eco-friendly health management approach for tilapia aquaculture.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Consumer, governmental and business trends are pushing us towards the IoT. 1.9 billion devices are being used today, and more than 50 billion will be used by 2020. So with the increase of internet connected devices, there is an increasing need for strong security measures. The sensors are manufactured by different companies with different processing power. In this huge number of low power sensors how the data will be protected from different attacks? As IoT data need to transit through different gateways and cloud to reach its final destination so what will happen if any attacker change the data or in any other way take the control and destroy the whole system. Our main target is to ensure a protected and secure IoT by introducing a secure key exchange mechanism, along with a key replacement process. As from our initial experimentation, we found out that the proposed approach of distributed key management technique is appealin...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and predictors of anxiety, depression and stress among young people diagnosed with COVID-19 of Bangladesh amidst the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 1 May to 30 May 2020 using an online Google form-based questionnaire posted on Facebook. A snowball sampling approach was used for data collection. A total of 974 self-declared healthy individuals not diagnosed with COVID-19 participated here. Anxiety, depression and stress were measured using Bangla validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), respectively. Statistical software SPSS 20 was used for analysis. Result Average age of the population was 25.86±6.26 (SD) years with nearly half (48.6%) of them being young people (15 to ≤24 years). Most of the participants were male (76.3%). The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress was found to be 64.1%, 73.3% and 69.4%, respectively. Young people had significantly higher proportion of anxiety (67.2% vs 61.1%), and depression (78.2% vs 68.7%) compared to adults (p=0.045 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). However, most of the participants had mild depression (30.3%), minimal anxiety (31.4%), and moderate stress (67.5%) and severity of depression and anxiety being higher in the young participants. The mean GAD-7, PHQ-9 and PSS scores were 7.57±5.61, 9.19±6.15 and 16.02±5.55 (SD), respectively. On multivariable logistic analysis, unemployment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 3.642; Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.005-13.200; p&lt;0.05) was the single most important predictor of depression. For stress, unemployment (AOR 1.399; CI: 1.055-1.855), and female sex (AOR 1.638; CI: 1.158-2.317) were significant predictors. Conclusion Anxiety, depression and stress were highly prevalent among young people (≤24 years) not diagnosed with COVID-19 in Bangladesh amidst the pandemic. Unemployment is the most common underlying determinant. Authorities should address the issue on a priority basis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although IoT provides new opportunities, security remains a key concern while providing various services. It is especially challenging how the data generated from IoT devices can be protected from potential security attacks and how to safeguard the exchange of these data while transiting through different nodes and gateways. In this research, we aim to ensure a safe IoT environment by proposing an efficient key management technique that uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystem to obtain the speed of the former as well as the security benefits of the latter. Our proposal considers a set of Smart Objects (SO) capable of key registration, generation and distribution for IoT data transmission. We used the open-source Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to facilitate communications between the source and the de...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

METHODOLOGY: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) technique tools such as personal interview, focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interview with fish farmers were done to collect preliminary data. Fish and water samples were collected from catfish ponds and were analyzed in the Fish Disease Laboratory, Faculty of Fisheries, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The microbial loads of pond water (CFU/ mL) were determined by ten-fold serial dilution using Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) after incubation at 25 °C for 48 h. Hematological analysis of blood samples were done to determine RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, blood glucose level and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) of the over-wintered catfish. KEY FINDINGS: It was found that the water temperature, pH, dissolve oxygen, total alkalinity and ammonia ranged from 27 to 20.5°C, 8.2 to 7.0, 7 to 5 ppm, 190 to 120 ppm, 0.03 ppm, respectively during the study period. Among the 15 ponds, the highest and lowest temperature was recorded in P. hypophthalmus ponds. The highest alkalinity was observed in P. hypophthalmus ponds and minimum was found in O. pabda ponds. The ammonia concentration was more or less similar (0.03 ppm) in 15 ponds. Average bacterial load of rearing water was ranged from the highest 2.6 ± 1.60 ×105 CFU/ mL to lowest 2.3 ± 1.93 ×103 CFU/ mL in H. fossilis ponds. The study revealed maximum RBC, WBC contents and the highest glucose level in O. pabda and minimum in H. fossilis and P. hypophthalmus. However, MCH and hemoglobin levels were found higher in P. hypophthalmus and lower in O. pabda. CONCLUSION: The study revealed preliminary data regarding over-wintering farm condition, bacterial loads of over-winter water, hematology and water quality paramete [...]Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
DBF-MLT: NP-completeness of specialized voice service in networked virtual environment a peer-to-peer approach16th Int'l Conf.

Specialized voice service in virtual environment enables users to speak to each other naturally and seamlessly. The spatial 3D avatar location and the voice direction in the virtual environment are used to generate realistic sound. Although with this specialized audio or voice streaming in virtual environment the real user can more easily identify who is talking, if several people are taking simultaneously. But this is a challenging task to stream the voice or audio data to the users&#39; machine by considering the user bandwidth limit and the tight latency constraint and this can be formalized as a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we presented the proof of NP-completeness of the specialized audio streaming problem called DBF-MLT.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
