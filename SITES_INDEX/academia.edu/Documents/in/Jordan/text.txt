Established techno-managerial approaches have been criticised as inappropriate and the professional community of planners and architects was increasingly drawn into debates for alternative solutions. This article traces the “innovations” that promise better, more effective, and more humane emergency shelters using the examples of the “Tempohomes” in Berlin as well as the Jordanian refugee camps of Zaatari and Azraq. In both cases, planners were employed to address the ambivalent reality of protracted refugee camps and include “lessons” from failures of earlier solutions. While the article acknowledges the genuine attempt of planners to engage with the more complex needs and expectations of refugees, a careful look at the results of the planning for better camps reveals ambivalent outcomes.

The link between climate change and human security was first recognised in the early 2000s. This paper examines how climate change has exacerbated uncertainty and instability in vulnerable populations in different regions. It achieves this by looking at diverse national and local experiences through multiple policy lenses, namely, the proliferation of extreme weather events, coastal erosion and sea level rise, internal displacement, cross border migration, and climate change as a threat multiplier. It looks at specific cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific Islands and the Levant to understand how human (in)security is being affected by climate change. It also addresses the future of global climate policy by assessing the current state of climate policies in light of the Paris Agreement. Global action on climate change is urgent. While many developed countries like to avoid notions of climate justice and differentiated responsibilities, the reality for the most vulnerable countries is that supranational policy is crucial if they are to tackle the climate challenge at home. This paper emphasises the importance of having meaningful and focused national climate adaptation and mitigation policies in place in order to address both the avoidable and unavoidable impacts of climate change on the economy, the culture and ultimately the security of a country. This study finds that as climate change plays an increasingly important role in discussions of security, comprehensive strategies are needed to respond to climate-induced security threats and geopolitical (in)stability both nationally and around the world. The Paris Agreement was a good first step in driving countries to commit to curbing emissions and drafting climate adaptation action plans. We now need the global climate regime – including countries, industry, and researchers – to step up to the plate and implement effective policies if we are to limit the serious impacts of climate change. The findings in this paper aims to contributeto the global debate around security and climate change.Save to LibraryDownloadby Simon Chin-Yee•  13  African Studies, Coastal Management, Climate Change, ConflictUNRWA at 70: Palestinian Refugees in ContextSave to LibraryDownloadby Pietro Stefanini•  6  Refugee Studies, Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, SyriaJordanian nurses’ perceptions of their preparedness for disaster managementSave to LibraryDownloadby Jafar Alasad•  15  Nursing, Jordan, Disaster Management, Disaster PreparednessResearch Proposal: Determining the Effects of Flipped Classroom Learning Approach on Jordanian Students' Achievement in Maths TIMSS TestResearch proposal for assessing the impact of flipped classroom learning on Jordanian students' Maths performance.

Country of origin encompass products imported from Italy and China solely. The main focus is on Jordanian consumers. It aims at studying the level of satisfaction regarding these products and the relation of the products country of origin to their standard of living and how it is conceived. Often, certain high-end products are linked with high prestigious lives and vice versa. Therefore, it has been asserted the need to conduct surveys distributed among 100 different consumers of these hospitality products in order to have a thorough finding for the reasons aforementioned. As a result, this study concludes whether consumers perceive Italian products as of a higher quality than Chinese ones due to the country of origin.

In the case of Palestine, it is because of its absence of control of surface waters, and Cyprus and Malta because of their insular character. In most countries the main use of water is for agricultural purposes, except in France, Slovenia, Croatia, and Palestine where urban and industrial use is dominant. A clear trend is the diversion of water uses from agriculture to industry and urban development. However, a mix of policies is needed to provide alternatives to the actual use of water for agricultural purposes, taking into account the demographic displacements to the Mediterranean shores, but also the enormous fraction of population dedicated to agriculture in many Mediterranean countries. The waste water treatment situation is very uneven among countries and the related data corresponding to urban and industrial waste water production in most case has not been properly identified and differentiated. Waste water in France, Malta and Cyprus are treated to a tertiary level, while it is treated to a secondary level in the majority of Mediterranean countries. In several countries, such as Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Morocco and Palestine, most of the waste waters receive no treatment. Except Slovenia, the level of waste water treatment has increased for the last ten years in most countries, but with varying percentages ranging from 100% in the case of Malta to 1% in the case of Croatia.Only few Mediterranean countries have implemented wastewater reuse within their water plans, and farmers often irrigate with untreated or partially treated wastewater.Regarding desalination, most of the countries are nowadays using this technology, although only a few of them have done it within a planned integrated framework, and none has a clear strategy for the management of the resulting brines.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hilmi S.

Together with other sectors, the existing building stock is responsible for high energy consumption, as average energy performance levels are much lower than the standards prescribed in the recent Jordanian Energy Efficient Building Code. Addressing issues related to energy retrofitting will assist the country to develop effective plans to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and, therefore, decrease the associated energy costs on a large scale, thus helping Jordan’s sustainable development. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the current situation of the building sector and the energy performance of existing buildings in Amman, identifying issues, obstacles and opportunities to be considered for retrofitting this stock.

This value of Mo-concentration was far beyond the Jordan Institution for Standards and Metrology (JISM) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Hydro-geochemical studies were carried out in order to assess the chemistry of the groundwater quality focusing on identifying the hydrogeo-chemical processes and mechanisms that are involved in the high Mo concentration. The water quality data of Wadi Al Arab boreholes (1986-2018) was collected, and the dataset analyzed. Interpretation of hydrochemical data showed that the anions are dominated by 3 HCO − with abundance order of 3 HCO − > 2 4 SO − > Cl − > 3 NO − , while the main cation is Ca 2+ , with abundance order of Ca 2+ > Mg 2+ > Na + > K + ; water type is 3 Ca-HCO −. The reason is the passage of groundwater through carbonate rocks. The distribution of the sampling points in the Gibbs diagram showed that the majority of samples are plotted within the field of rock weathering, which indicates that the main factor controlling dissolved hydrochemical components of the water samples is the dissolution of the rock-forming minerals. The scattered plot of the Mo with other critical heavy metals shows two different trend lines suggesting initiation of molybdenum to groundwater which is probably derived from oil shale and phosphate. The effects of pH and redox potential on Mo mobility in water are reviewed using the paurbaix diagram. The Mo species of the sampled wells are confined to the field of () 2 4 MoO − : anoxic/non-sulfidic condition (Fe reduction) which is located in the unconfined part of the aquifer, and () s 2 MoS which is sulfidic condition (low and high) in the confined aquifer.

This is as an attempt to fill the lack of research in this vital area in order to arrive at constructivesuggestions that could enhance the quality of insurance regulation in both countries. Indeed, this paper found thatthe insurance sector in Saudi Arabia and Jordan lags behind most of the other developing economies in Asia and Europe. Also, full implementation of the insurance regulatory Information System (IS) and publication of a clearregulatory ladder could support the taking of early and consistent intervention action on insurance companies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ra'ed Masa'deh•  4  Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Insurance IndustryEating disturbances among adolescent schoolgirls in JordanSave to LibraryDownloadby Tamara Mousa and +1Rima Mashal•  20  Eating Disorders, Family, Jordan, AdolescentWork-related stress among health professionals in northern JordanJob stress is common in health care professionals in the west.

The changes have been painfully felt in Ramtha, 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from the Syrian city of Daraa. Ramtha was a prime destination for Syrian goods imported formally or informally. Petty cross-border trade, especially informal trade, was not only the basis of the city’s economy but also the foundation of an implicit contract between the authorities and locals. The state allowed such trade because it supplemented local revenues, enhancing social stability. This saved the state from investing resources that would have been needed to create jobs. By undermining this understanding, the Syrian conflict provoked growing local discontent.Save to LibraryDownloadby Armenak Tokmajyan•  15  Middle East Studies, Protest, Border Crossing, SyriaAda Aharoni's From the Nile to the Jordan reviewed by Toni Matthias MeyThe historical novel From the Nile to the Jordan is an enthralling story about the "Second Exodus" of Jews from Egypt to Israel.

This so far little-noticed aspect of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, could spread new light on the events of 1948, make the suffering of both sides public and bring the middle east one step closer to peace. Before 1948 there was a prospering community with 100,000 Jews in Egypt, today there are only few Jewish widows left. This book combines the well-researched historical facts based on Aharoni's research on the topic, as a professor of Sociology, with her personal perspective as a witness who had to leave Egypt as a young woman. This approach makes the book an eye-opener for an important chapter of Jewish history, that is widely unknown. Aharoni goes beyond the past, aiming at using the story of the "Second Exodus" as a tool for reconciliation, convinced that if Israel and Egypt can make peace, peace between Israel and Palestine is possible too.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ars Artium•  20  Peace and Conflict Studies, Peace Movements, Egypt, PeacekeepingThe Perceived Social and Physical Effects of Micro-loan Default on Jordanian Women/ a qualitative studyThe purpose of the study is to determine the social and health impacts of microloan default on women by relying on in-depth interviews with a group of women who have failed to repay their microloans in Jordan.

It is evident that defaulting on their microloans is a result of women's inability to repay those loans from the start. One of the predominant social repercussions of defaulting is the pressure and rebuke that women are subjected to by their family and community, especially when a woman faces prosecution for defaulting on her microloan. These repercussions have in turn led to constraints on women's mobility and caused damaged to her health and wellbeing. In many cases, such women resorted to emotional eating which consequently developed into obesity or being subject to severe stress caused her physical harm, such as dental damage or hair loss due to vitamin deficiencies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Social Sciences  COES&RJ-JSS•  11  Health Sciences, Health Promotion, Public Health Policy, WomenThe Arab Spring -Implications for the Russian FederationThe Arab Spring led to a major transformation of political systems of the region's most countries; an increase in the significance of radical Islam in the political life; a degradation of the security environment.

Although the optimum tilt angle is normally close to the latitude value of the location, lots of other factors affect this. So when designing a power plant, it is necessary to take these factors into consideration to maximize the output of those plants. The present paper reviews the main scientific concepts related to solar radiation, the models used to describe the solar radiation properties, and the methods of calculating the optimum tilt angle. The optimum tilt angle for northern Jordan and, as a case study, Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) Campus is then calculated by applying the appropriate methods and models. In addition to that, simulation software is used to calculate the optimum tilt angle and the yield of the power station. Other factors affecting the tilt angle of a PV array are reported and relevant recommendations are given. © 20...Save to LibraryDownloadby Qais A Khasawneh•  8  Photovoltaics, Renewable Energy, Optimization techniques, JordanNextLast »Related TopicsMiddle East StudiesFollowFollowingLebanonFollowFollowingMiddle East PoliticsFollowFollowingSyriaFollowFollowingIsrael/PalestineFollowFollowingIraqFollowFollowingPalestineFollowFollowingProcesses of Democratization In the Middle EastFollowFollowingJordan (History)FollowFollowingArab Spring (Arab Revolts)FollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
