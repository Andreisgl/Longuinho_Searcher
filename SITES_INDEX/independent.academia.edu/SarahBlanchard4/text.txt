We use information from a panel survey of Mexican adults to examine how job characteristics affect the risk of international migration. The sampling strategy and overall size of the survey allow us to analyze the effect of employment characteristics on migration from urban areas, which have much greater labor market diversity, and to separate our analysis by gender. We also distinguish migrants according to whether they migrate for work or for other reasons. We find informality to be a significant predictor of international migration. Even after controlling for individual factors including workers&amp;#39; wages, as well as various household- and community-level predictors, we find that workers employed in the informal sector have significantly higher odds of migrating than their counterparts in the formal sector. The pervasive nature of informality in many developing countries from which a high proportion of international migrants originate may therefore create a constant supply of workers who are predisposed to migrate. Our findings thus have important implications for a proper understanding of the effects of economic development on migration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Gatekeepers of the American Dream: How teachers' perceptions shape the academic outcomes of immigrant and language-minority studentsby Chandra Muller and Sarah BlanchardSocial science research,  2015High school teachers evaluate and offer guidance to students as they approach the transition to c... more High school teachers evaluate and offer guidance to students as they approach the transition to college based in part on their perceptions of the student&#39;s hard work and potential to succeed in college. Their perceptions may be especially crucial for immigrant and language-minority students navigating the U.S. educational system. Using the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), we consider how the intersection of nativity and language-minority status may (1) inform teachers&#39; perceptions of students&#39; effort and college potential, and (2) shape the link between teachers&#39; perceptions and students&#39; academic progress towards college (grades and likelihood of advancing to more demanding math courses). We find that teachers perceive immigrant language-minority students as hard workers, and that their grades reflect that perception. However, these same students are less likely than others to advance in math between the sophomore and junior years, a critical p...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Set within a predominantly low-income, majority-minority community, our study aims to investigate the impact of Beyond Blackboards on students&#39; interest in and understanding of engineering, as well as their ability to align their educational and career plans. We compare participants&#39; and nonparticipants&#39; questionnaire responses before the implementation and at the end of the program&#39;s first academic year. Statistically significant findings indicate a school-wide increase in students&#39; interest in engineering careers, supporting a shift in school culture. However, only program participants showed increased enjoyment of design-based strategies, understanding of what engineers do, and awareness of the steps for preparing for an engineering care...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
