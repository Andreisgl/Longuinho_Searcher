It compares the work of two path-breaking historians—Mark Levene and Timothy Snyder—while also discussing recent research by other scholars. The reviewer discusses the recent turn to microhistories in Holocaust scholarship. The article points to the limitations of the discourse of the nation-state in narrowing the historical context and our world of imagination. It concludes that the complexities on the social level, each rooted in specific circumstances and histories, challenge the analytical value of the general term “Holocaust.” "Tomasz Frydel, for example, has described his research on the Rzeszów region in the General Government of German-occupied Poland as 'integrated microhistory' that offers 'an antidote to polarized historiography,' usually along national fault lines. Focusing on the 'hunt for Jews' in the Polish countryside from 1942 to 1945, Frydel explores the violence within the context of the brutality of the German occupation and the related hunt for Soviet prisoners or war, partisans and deserters from the German army. Within this extremely violent reality, 'local attitudes and violence against Jews was connected with—and conditioned by—violence against Poles for sheltering Jews.' It is for this reason 'that rescuing and killing were not infrequently carried out by the same people.' The term 'the Holocaust' offers no insight into such complexity, and it blurs the wide range of complexities that Jews and others faced in vastly different places and times throughout World War II."See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIntegrated Genocide HistoryMatthias BjørnlundA review essay in Genocide Studies International, vol. 12, no. 1, 2018, pp. 129-146.
