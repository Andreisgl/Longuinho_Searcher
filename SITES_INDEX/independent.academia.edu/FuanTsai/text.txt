In this study a group of connected polyhedrons is considered as “one building”, after which the generalization is applied to each building consecutively. The most detailed building models used is the polyhedral building model which allows for an elaborate roof structure, vertical walls and a polygonal ground plan. In the work the term “Pseudo-Continuous LODs” is described. The maximum distinguishable “feature resolution” can be estimated from the viewer distance to a building and is used to simplify the building structure by the polyhedron merging and wall collapsing with regularization processes. Experimental results demonstrate that the number of triangles can be reduced as a function of the feature resolution logarithm. Some case studies will be presented to illustrate the capability and feasibility of the proposed method including both regular and irregular shape of buildings.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In computer graphics the Continuous LoDs (CLoD) for terrain geometry or general objects means the number of triangles was changed by one or two triangles between two consecutive LoDs. Since the geometrical structure is inherently different between the continuous terrain and the sparse distributed 3D building models, the creation of CLoD for 3D building models is impractical. In this study, a group of connected/contacted polyhedrons with vertical wall were considered as “one building”, thus the generalization could be applied on each building respectively. The most detailed polyhedral building model was created by the SMS algorithm using three-dimensional building structure lines which were measured from aerial photos. In a 3D visualization system, depend on the viewer’s distance we can estimate a maximum distinguished “feature resolution”. The feature resolution will be used to detect small 3D features in “one building”. Two polyhedrons will be merged, if the height difference between them is smaller than the feature resolution. A wall will be eliminated if its length is smaller than the feature resolution. In order to maintain the building’s principal structure, a piping process is necessary after wall collapsing. In an interactive 3D browsing system, since the distance variation is continuous while its corresponding PCLoD building model can thus be generated immediately. Experiment results demonstrate that the number of triangles was reduced as a function of logarithm of feature resolution. Additionally, the building’s main structure can be preserved. Some case studies will be presented to illustrate the capability and feasibility of the proposed method either for regular or irregular type of buildings.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Integration of GPS, GIS and Photogrammetry for Texture Mapping in Photo-Realistic City ModelingThe generation of the textures of building facades from terrestrial photos is time-consuming work... more The generation of the textures of building facades from terrestrial photos is time-consuming work. A more cost-effective way to create a photo-realistic city model containing thousands of buildings and facade textures is necessary. This paper proposes an approach which integrates GPS, GIS and photogrammetry for multi-face texture mapping of a three-dimensional building model. A GPS integrated, high-resolution, non-metric and wide field-of-view digital camera is used. By means of integrating the GIS graphic interface and GPS information about camera location, a large quantity of pictures can be managed efficiently. A graphics user interface for the interactive solving of the exterior orientation parameters is designed. In the meantime, during texturing mapping lens-distortion can be corrected and self-occluded facades can be automatically compensated for. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is efficient due to a complex building could be treated in one process and multi-face texturing is designed thus the number of pictures can be reduced. Additionally, a large quantity of pictures can be managed efficiently by GPS-Photo-GIS integration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
