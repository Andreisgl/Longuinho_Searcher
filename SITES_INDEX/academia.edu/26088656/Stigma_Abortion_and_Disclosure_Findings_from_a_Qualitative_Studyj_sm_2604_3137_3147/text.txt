H. Ed., RGN, FHEA.Introduction. This study qualitatively explores perceptions of women who have experienced abortion care. It explores women's journey through abortion from confirmation of pregnancy to post-abortion. Aim. The study seeks to understand the implications of these perceptions for policy and practice. Main Outcome Measures. A qualitative study involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 women, aged between 22 and 57 years, who had undergone legal induced abortion in the UK when they were 16 years or older. Participants were not recruited under the age of 16 because of the ethical and legal complexities of interviewing minors. Additionally, 16 years was deemed to be the most appropriate age as this is the legal age of consent in the UK. Methods. Participants were recruited from 12 community contraception and sexual health clinics in two NHS trusts, one in England and one in Wales. Participant recruitment was set at a minimum of 12 and participants were recruited on a " first come first served basis " (i.e., the first 12 who contacted the researcher). The number of participants was raised to seventeen as this was the number deemed to be the most suitable for data saturation in this particular qualitative research. Results. Women in this study understood abortion as highly taboo and a potentially personally stigmatizing event. These perceptions continued to affect disclosure to others, long after the abortion, and affected women's perceptions of the response of others, including society in general, significant others, and health professionals. Conclusions. Women's experiences of abortion may be influenced by perceived negative social attitudes. Health professionals and abortion service providers might combat the perceived isolation of women undergoing abortion by attending not only to clinical/technical aspects of the procedure but also to women's psychological/emotional sensitivities surrounding the event.

H. Ed., RGN, FHEA.In a country in which abortion is paid for and supplied by a government department, one might expect there to be substantially reduced stigma around performing abortion work. It is therefore significant that not only do patients experience stigmatisation, but those who choose to work in abortion care also do so, even though it ispart of a national commitment to universal health care.Download Free PDFView PDFReproductive healthDecision making on unsafe abortions in Sri Lanka: a case-control study2014 • Lalini  RajapaksaFollowing an unintended pregnancy, not every woman would invariably choose to undergo an unsafe abortion. It suggests that in the decision making process, women face both &#39;push&#39; factors that favour abortion and &#39;pull&#39; factors that work against it. This study assessed the circumstances that surrounded a woman&#39;s decision to undergo an unsafe abortion, compared to a decision to continue, when faced with an unintended pregnancy in Sri Lanka. An unmatched case-control study was conducted among 171 women admitted to nine hospitals in eight districts following an unsafe abortion (Cases) and 600 women admitted to the same hospitals for delivery of an unintended term pregnancy (Controls). Interviewer-administered-questionnaires and in-depth interviews assessed women&#39;s characteristics, decision making process and underlying reasons for their decision. The risk of abortion related to their decision making was assessed using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (C...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Public Health“Sometimes they used to whisper in our ears”: health care workers’ perceptions of the effects of abortion legalization in Nepal2012 • Philip Darney, Cynthia HarperDownload Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Medical Genetics Part B-neuropsychiatric GeneticsPerceptions of discrimination among persons who have undergone predictive testing for Huntington's disease2008 • Anne WallisPotential discrimination from genetic testing may undermine technological advances for health care. Researching long-term consequences of testing for genetic conditions that may lead to discrimination is a public health priority. The consequences of genetic discrimination generate social, health, and economic burdens for society by diminishing opportunities for at-risk individuals in a range of contexts. The current study objective was to investigate perceptions of genetic stigmatization and discrimination among persons who completed predictive testing for Huntington's disease (HD). Using semi-structured interviews and computerized qualitative analysis, the perceptions of 15 presymptomatic persons with a positive gene test predicting HD were examined with regard to differential treatment following testing. The sample comprised 11 women and 4 men, mostly married (73%), aged between 22 and 62 years, with an average education of 14.6 years (SD ± 2.57) and residing in urban, rural and suburban settings of eight U.S. States. Participants reported perceptions of consequences following disclosure of genetic test results in three areas: employment, insurance, and social relationships. Although most employed participants (90%) revealed their test results to their employers, nearly all reported they would not disclose this information to future employers. Most (87%) participants disclosed test results to their physician, but a similar majority (83%) did not tell their genetic status to insurers. Most participants (87%) disclosed test results to family and peers; patterns of disclosure varied widely. Discrimination concerns remain high in this sample and point to the need for more information to determine the extent and scope of the problem. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.Download Free PDFView PDFAbortion Counselling in Britain: Understanding the ControversyLesley  HoggartThis article reviews literature from a number of disciplines in order to provide an explanation of the political controversy attached to the provision of abortion counselling. It will show how this is an area of health policy debate in which women's reproductive bodies have become a setting for political struggle. The issue of abortion counselling in Britain has undergone a number of discursive shifts in response to political manoeuvring and changing socio-legal framing of abortion. In particular, the article shows how much of the controversial reframing of abortion counselling was a tactical shift by political actors opposed to abortion per se, and this work is critiqued for not contextualising abortion. The article then focuses on women's abortion experiences and discusses research that shows how women's decision-making processes, and responses to an abortion, are related to gendered socio-cultural contexts: the extent to which women having an abortion feel they have transgressed societal norms and values, for example, is likely to affect their abortion experiences. Finally, it is suggested that providing a non-judgemental context, and challenging negative discourses on abortion, may be the most effective way of minimising the possibility of negative emotions.Download Free PDFView PDF'High Profile Health Facilities could add to your trouble':Women, stigma and un/safe abortionRispah OkeloDownload Free PDFView PDF'High profile health facilities can add to your trouble': Women, stigma and un/safe abortion in KenyaChimaraoke IzugbaraPublic health discourses on safe abortion assume the term to be unambiguous. However, qualitative evidence elicited from Kenyan women treated for complications of unsafe abortion contrasted sharply with public health views of abortion safety. For these women, safe abortion implied pregnancy termination procedures and services that concealed their abortions, shielded them from the law, were cheap and identified through dependable social networks. Participants contested the notion that poor quality abortion procedures and providers are inherently dangerous, asserting them as key to women's preservation of a good self, management of stigma, and protection of their reputation, respect, social relationships , and livelihoods. Greater public health attention to the social dimensions of abortion safety is urgent.Download Free PDFView PDFAspectos Psicologicos del AbortoCristián RodríguezRevision bibliografica de al literatura especializada sobre la relacion entre aborto y salud mental de la mujer, a la luz del Proyecto de Ley en discusion en Chile.
