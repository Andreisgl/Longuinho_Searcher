English also enjoys special status and privileges, and despite the fact that it is officially only a ‘foreign’ language, in practice it is one of the most dominant languages in educational and economic domains. Both Nepali and English have become status symbols and tools in the hands of the ruling elites who use them to create linguistic hegemony. Speakers of other languages, on the other hand, are confused about their languages, their ethnic identity and their place in the community. To become a part of the mainstream life, they learn and use Nepali and English at the expense of their own languages. While Nepali and English contribute significantly to the development and modernisation processes, the people have paid a heavy price for them. In this article, I describe strategies adopted by the ruling elites to impose linguistic, as well as cultural dominance. I also demonstrate how the dominance of Nepali and English has led to a situation in which the people abandon their language and culture to adopt those of someone else.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ram Ashish Giri•  7  Language Education, Ancient Indo-European Languages, Cultural Identity, Ethnic IdentityTeaching English: The Language-Literature ControversyAbstract Literature has always been an important resource or tool, for teaching and learning of language.

Officially, however, it was adopted as a foreign language into the formal education system only in the first half of the twentieth century. Despite its “foreign” status until now, users of the language and related studies claim that it is anything but foreign. Its current use in all spheres of life makes the language indispensable and at par with Nepali, the only official language for wider communication. As such, its speakers advocate that English in Nepal deserves more veneration than the term offers. The article provides a socio-linguistic analysis of the English language situation in Nepal, and drawing from research and available literature, it assesses to what extent is such a claim justifiable. In the pretext of its growing popularity and dominance, the article examines its role, status and its position in the national language education policy and points out what implications its changing status has on the national curriculum and pedagogic resources.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ram Ashish Giri•  3  World Englishes, EIL, English language educationNew Perspectives in Managing Diversity in Educational Contexts (Book review).  http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540250902745255#abstractSave to LibraryDownloadby Ram Ashish Giri•Resource Centre: A Model for Developing Contextsfile:///C:/Users/ram.a.giri/Downloads/4611-16047-1-PB%20(1).pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Ram Ashish Giri•Languages and language politics: How ‘unplanning’ of languages helps achieve ‘planned’ results in Nepal.http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/lplp/2011/00000035/00000003/art00001Save to Libraryby Ram Ashish Giri•On teaching in English in a Japanese Context. http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-06127-6Save to Libraryby Ram Ashish Giri•The Pedagogy of English as an International Language: Theory, Research and Narratives from the Asia-Pacific.

Adopted first as a ‘foreign’ language, English, in recent years, has become an indispensable part of life for the Nepalese people. In fact, it is presently used as an additional language,second language and even primary language in many socio-economic and educational domains in Nepal. Even though English had been in use in Nepal for a long time, it was only adopted as a foreign language into the formal education system in the first half of the twentieth century, and it continues to have this status, despite the fact that scholars and users of the language claim that it is anything but foreign. Its current domination in all spheres of life makes the language indispensable and on a par with Nepali, currently the only official language for wider communication.As such, many advocate that English in Nepal deserves greater recognition than the term foreign language offers. The present article makes a sociolinguistic analysis of the English language situation in Nepal and, drawing from research and the available literature, it assesses to what extent the claim that it has many faces is justifiable. In view of the growing popularity and dominance of English, the article examines its role and status in the national language education policy, and points out what implications its changing status has on the nationalcurriculum and pedagogic resources.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ram Ashish Giri•  3  Language Testing, Language Planning and Policy, Language Teaching MethodologyLeadership and diversity: challenging theory and practice in education, by Jacky Lumby and Marianne ColemanSave to Libraryby Ram Ashish Giri•  3  Sociology, Theory and Practice, Gender EducationOn Teaching EIL in a Japanese Context: The Power Within and Power WithoutSave to Libraryby Ram Ashish Giri•English language educationEvaluation of Errors Committed by Nepali Learners of EnglishSave to Libraryby Ram Ashish Giri•Collaborative Approch to Feedback.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Ram Ashish Giri•  2  Language Policy, Bi/plurilingualism/literacyIdenty, equity and social justic - Lilly - Raqib Final.pdfMy chapter in this book.https://www.academia.edu/38445446/Identy_equity_and_social_justic_-_Lilly_-_Raqib_Final.pdfSave to LibraryDownloadby Raqib Chowdhury and +1Ram Ashish Giri•
