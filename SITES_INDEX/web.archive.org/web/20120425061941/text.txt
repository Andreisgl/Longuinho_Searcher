Negaraku was a rip off from Mamula Moon?Oct 6, '05  2:57 PM for everyone"Simple, it is a folk song that have probably been around 100 of years, then a local songwriter/singer translated it to malay entitled ' Terang Bulan' probably meaning ' Mamula Moon' or clear moon - listen to lyrics of song. When they were looking for a tune for national song, they may not realize the local chap copied from this folk song. So voila!!! we have the negaraku. Copy catting has been around for thousands of years so no big deal, it is just that it is a national anthem.""The anthem  was previously known in Malaya and Indonesiaas a popular song entitled  "Terang Bulan" (Moonlight), which has since been banned from being performed. In  addition to the national anthem, there are also thirteen state  anthems.""I did some checking.  That is the official story, and the Perak State Anthem was supposed to be similar to Keroncong melody, Terang Bulan, a popular song in Indonesia and Malaysia in the 1930's.   If that was so, then Mamula Moon would be a plagiarism itself, since it was released somtime in the 1940's.Anyway, the tunes are too similar so someone obviously copied someone else. Who knows?"Negaraku?  (Official  Symbols)NegarakuTanah  tumpahnya darahkuRakyat hidup bersatu dan majuRahmat bahagia Tuhan  kurniakanRaja kita selamat bertakhtaRahmat bahagia Tuhan  kurniakanRaja kita selamat bertakhtaThe  Malaysian anthem Negaraku (My  Country) was selected by a special committee headed by Malaysia's first  prime minister, the late Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al Haj, who at the time, held  the title of Chief Minister and Minister of Home Affairs.Prior to the selection, a contest,  open to music composers from across the world, was held to pick a composition  that would be used as the national anthem for the soon-to-be sovereign nation,  the Federation of Malaya. The entries received included those from  internationally renowned composers. However, none of the compositions were  deemed suitable.As  such, a ceremony was held at the Police Depot, Kuala Lumpuron Aug 5, 1957, to select a  suitable composition. It was here that the Negaraku, an adaptation of the Perak State  Anthem, was chosen by the committee; it was favoured for its traditional flavour and melody.Perhaps, the other reason why it was  chosen was the fact that the tune has a romantic historical background, which  dates back to 1876. It was linked closely to the fate of Sultan Abdullah of  Perak who was exiled to the Seychelles by the British  colonialists following the assassination of the state's first British Resident,  J.W.W. Birch.The  Federation of Malaya, with the voluntary inclusion of Sabah and Sarawak, and the  exclusion of Singapore and  Brunei, became known as Malaysia on Sept 16, 1963. It was  only natural then, for the Negaraku to be adopted as the national  anthem of the newly restructured nation.On  April 4, 1968, the National Language Act was gazetted. This officially makes any  act of disrespect towards the national anthem a punishable offence. Also, the  honour of performing the anthem is restricted to designated individuals.In  1992, during the National Day celebrations, the Negaraku was given a livelier tempo to  make it more contemporary, as well as to signal the dynamic progress that the  nation has seen as it moves towards Vision 2020.Is Negaraku from a Hawaiian melody?BY TEH ENG HOCKKLUANG: Is the Negaraku adapted from a Hawaiian melody?This question stirred in his mind when Mohd Zain Sahadan, 49, heard his son playing a record from his antique collection.The song, entitled Mamula Moon by Felix Mendelssohn and His Hawaiian Serenaders, carried the melody of the national anthem but had a slower and more  romantic beat.Zain, who works as a junior  general administrator with the National Institute of Public Administration  (Intan) here, said he felt excited when he heard the tune.An avid antique collector, he said he had owned the record for more than 10 years without realising the significance of its content."I bought it together with 10 other records from an old man for RM500."Recently, my son rummaged through my antique collection and played the song  on the gramophone."Only then did I notice the similarity," he said, adding that he believed the  record dated back to the 1940s.The record showed the name of song, the artiste and also indicated that it was made in England, but there was no mention of the year it was released.Checks on music websites showed that Felix Mendelssohn and His Hawaiian Serenaders were artistes in the 1940s.According to www.cduniverse.com, they played Hawaiian-style music, while www.  musicweb-international.com described the band's music as "immediately recognisable by its swing, swooning, sensual ethnic style".This Mendelssohn should not be confused with the 19th century German composer  and pianist Felix Mendelssohn.History has it that the Negaraku was adapted from the state anthem of Perak, which had a similar melody to the keroncong-influenced Terang Bulan, a popular song in the 1930s in Indonesia and Malaya.It was also a familiar tune in the island of Mahe in the Seychelles where a former Perak Sultan lived in exile. A French band used to play the tune when it  performed on the island.There is, however, no record of the exact origin of the melody.Some historians believe that a well-known 19th century French poet and composer, Pierre Jean de Beranger, wrote the music.But there is no reference on any link to the Hawaiian Mamula Moon.Go here to listen to the song.Prev: Miserable FailureNext: Funeral Service for my father, James Horeply

replyfatimaria wrote on May 5, '07I have this record too 78 rpm which I played endlessly as a child in the late 70's. My Dad a serving officer of the R.I.N. (Royal Indian Navy) , most probably picked it up in Singapore/ Malaysia or Indonesia during the WW 2. He was commissioned in 1942 , so the record is at least that old. Another thing, because the Music was performed by the Hawaiian Serenader's, doesn't necessarily mean that the music has any connection with Hawaii. I believe the  music  has its roots in Malaysia , and was  modified by local (colonial influenced ) Bands . These military / police bands though usually led by Englishmen had a large component of  Goan / East Indian / Ceylonese / Chinese and Malay performers whose western musical taste and ability   far surpassed those of their tone deaf masters. As with everything else the west takes credit for all the pretty things  on mother earth. The Terang Bulan is now being attributed to some 19th century French man......what will they think of next....the Taj Mahal built to the engineering designs of British Engineers perhaps?
replycmorbutt wrote on May 5, '07cool! Thanks for extra info =) At least we have some more insight into the matter ... but in any case, you would think our national anthem should have been an original composition =(

replyjat2007 wrote on Aug 28, '07"Negara ku" is definitely a plagiarism for today's context but the original song is an indonesian folk song.the most famous is "terang boelan". there are many copied songs following that which include "boeaya timboel", "cari laki" and "mamula moon".The moment "Negara ku" is made the national anthem of Malaysia (then it was Malaya) "Terang Boelan" is banned from being aired in public.I have "terang boelan","boeaya timboel" and "mamula moon " in my collection.It is always someone's nature that he will try to get credit from someone else's hard work.
