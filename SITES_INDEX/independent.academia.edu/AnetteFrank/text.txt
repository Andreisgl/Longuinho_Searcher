Yet it is of greatimportance, since unintended ambiguities arising fromunderrestricted rules or interactions have to be distinguishedfrom linguistically warranted ambiguities. In this paper wereport on various tools in the XLE grammar development platformwhich can be used for ambiguity management in grammar writing.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper sketches how one can construct Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRSs (Reyle, 1993)) via glue semantics (Dalrymple et al., 1999b). In most cases, UDRSs are constructed in linear time, analogously to the linear time construction of skeleton-modifier representations presented in (Gupta and Lamping, 1998).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We look at the thematic relations holding between questions and the preceding context and discuss to which extent thematic related-ness plays a role in discourse structure.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They typically provide syntactic constituent or dependency structures for sentences, but increasingly extend to annotation beyond syntactic structure, in-cluding semantic, pragmatic and rhetorical annotation, or go beyond a single language, as in parallel treebanks.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Automatically obtained TimeML annotations in the English portion of a parallel corpus are transferred to the German translation along a word alignment. Direct projection augmented with shallow heuristic knowledge outperforms the uninformed baseline by 6.64% F1-measure for events, and by 17.93% for time expressions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For the representation of adjective meanings, we reformulate the pattern-based approach for attribute learning of Almuhareb (2006) in a structured vector space model (VSM). This model is complemented by a structured vector space representing attribute dimensions of noun meanings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Two alternative ways are investigated to integrate this analysis into the LFG framework: complex predicate formation in syntax or by lexical rule.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We apply this method to the NEGRA treebank to derive an LTAG grammar of German. We describe the methodology and tools for structure conversion and LTAG extraction. The conversion and grammar extraction process imports linguistic generalisations that are missing the in original treebank.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We show how to model frame semantic annotations in an LFG projection architecture, including special phenomena that involve non-isomorphic mappings between levels. Frame semantic annotations are ported from a manually annotated corpus to a “parallel” LFG corpus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This model can be interpreted as a graph structure that offers flexible querying functionality beyond current XML-based query languages and powerful methods for consistency control. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the syntactically and semantically annotated SALSA/TIGER corpus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The question that is at issue is how to represent analytic tense formation to obtain a uniform functional structure for analytic and synthetic tense formation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We build on a lexicalsemantic conceptual structure for question interpretation, which is interfaced with domain-specific concepts and properties in a structured knowledge base. Question interpretation involves a limited amount of domain-specific inferences and accounts for quantificational questions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We present a general, resource-poor account to create such a linking automatically by extracting Wikipedia articles corresponding to ontology classes. We evaluate our approach in an experiment with the Music Ontology. We consider linking as a promising starting point for subsequent steps of information extraction.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

NERC for more fine-grained semantic NE classes has not been systematically studied. This paper quantifies the difficulty of fine-grained NERC (FG-NERC) when performed at large scale on the people domain. We apply unsupervised acquisition methods to construct a gold standard dataset for FG-NERC.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We conducted an empirical study to collect verbal route directions, and annotated the acquired texts on different levels.
