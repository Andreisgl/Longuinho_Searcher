J. Klein & B. Joseph). Vol. 3, 2079–2175This chapter aims to provide an updated overview of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) morphology, broadly establishing the typological properties of the reconstructible system, and offering some new perspectives on certain controversial aspects of this reconstruction. In this respect, we hope to make this chapter both relevant and accessible to several audiences: to students of IE languages looking to understand which categories are reconstructed for the proto-language and what their formal exponents looked like, so that they may see the daughter languages in the light of their diachronic developments; to specialists in IE linguistics, who may be interested in a " state-of-the-art " assessment of long-standing issues in PIE morphology and, to a lesser extent, the proposals we advance here; and to general linguists pursuing typological, historical, or theoretical questions who wish to see what kinds of morphological categories are reconstructed for the IE languages, on what basis they are reconstructed, and what types of analyses have been proposed.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe History of the Eastern Polynesian Passive Part I (Handout)Mark HaleDownload Free PDFView PDFSyntax, Scope and Prosody: Ancient Greek as a Human Language (Handout)Mark HaleDownload Free PDFView PDFVowel length in Shetland Norn: Contact, change and competing systemsRemco KnooihuizenOne of the areas in which Scandinavian influence is apparent in the traditional Shetland Scots dialect is the distribution of vowel length: Shetland Scots generally follows the Scottish Vowel Length Rule, but also shows the complementary distribution of consonant and vowel length known from modern North Germanic languages. During the earliest development of Shetland Scots, three different systems of vowel length can be argued to have been in contact: 1. (Nearly) unconstrained vowel length, as in Old Norse 2. Scandinavian combinatory vowel length 3. The Scottish Vowel Length Rule All these systems were in the process of change in our time period, with System 1 giving way to System 2 across Scandinavia, and the SVLR also developing at about the same time. In both System 2 and the SVLR, we also observe the rise of an interaction between vowel quantity and ‘tense/lax’ quality. Thus, the system in Shetland Norn presents a set of interesting questions for the study of historical dialectology, language contact and historical phonology. We give a detailed account of the distribution of vowel length in a 2m000-token sample of Jakob Jakobsen’s dictionary of Shetland Norn, and compare it to the contact systems. We show that clear traces of all three systems, as well as local innovations, are found in the data. We also place the Shetland Norn data in the context of both Scots and Scandinavian historical phonology. Note that the handout has more detail than the slides.Download Free PDFView PDFMorphology and dialectology in the Linguistic Survey of Scotland: A quantitative approachWilliam LambWe present a study of Gaelic dialectal variation based on the unpublished, morphological section of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland (Gaelic). Our findings indicate that a quantitative (dialectometric) approach can yield important insights into the range of internal variation in Gaelic and elucidate certain issues of language structure. Here, we focus on two questions: (1) what patterns of spatial variation are observed in the morphological data, and (2) how are different morphological features in the dialects correlated? To answer the first question, we fit a logistic, generalised, additive model against a longitude-latitude spline and observe a number of patterns. Some features show a pronounced northwest-southeast cline, usually with more morphologically ‘innovative’ dialects in the east and south. Demographic variables, such as mean age and concentrations of speakers, may be a factor. Others show a clear focus on the Outer Hebrides, particularly from North Uist southwards. This suggests that the Gaelic dialects of the southern Outer Hebrides are the most morphologically ‘conservative’ of the surviving varieties. Our approach allows us to precisely quantify these patterns, providing a firm underpinning for earlier descriptions. In some cases, the data also pose challenges for received pedagogical practice and prescriptive standards. For the second question, we use Ward clustering on a correlation matrix to identify which features frequently co-occur in the dialects. The results shed light both on the dialectal divisions of Gaelic and, arguably, on its grammatical structure. For instance, we identify a strong correlation between the absence of lenition in returns such as an cas (nominative), cas beag (nominative) and am fear (genitive). These patterns are not strongly correlated with other cases of lenition absence. We interpret this as suggesting that lenition in these contexts may be driven by a single grammatical mechanism (whose loss underlies this consistent absence of lenition), which is not in action in other lenition contexts. Overall, our results show the potential of a quantitative approach to Gaelic dialectology and its promise for a larger study.Download Free PDFView PDFPoverty and Methodism in JapanChristian M . HermansenWhy and with what understanding of poverty would Methodist missionaries and their church in Japan involve themselves with the poor? Primarily based on missionaries' reports in the Minutes and Reports of the Annual Conference of Missionaries of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South here are some observations and reflections on the background of the Japan Methodist Church and in particular on circumstances that, theoreticaly, must have conditioned its perception of poverty and the poor. These circumstances include a diachronic dimension namely the perceptions within the Methodist church as such since the Wesley brothers and a synchronic dimension, i.e., contemporary perceptions of poverty and the poor in the USA and Japan.Download Free PDFView PDFDybo's law in Proto-celticRanko MatasovićDownload Free PDFView PDFURBANISM MATERIAL CULTURE AND SOIL OCCUPATION DURINGTHE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE NI THE MIDDLE EUPHRATES VALLEYAnas AL KHABOURAnas Al KhabourThe Euphrates valley played a key role in the history of Mesopotamia as the axis of communication between distant lands with variation of natural recourses,and linked Mesopotamia,the land with dearth of stone and wod,to Anatolia the north and to the Mediterranean in the west and along the history, from the Paleolithic to practically today.The importation of the raw material and the development of the trade system were some of the reasons behind the rise of the transformation of the Near East settlements from villages to organized urban centers [Margueron2014:9], pastoralism also had a crucial role in formation the settlements in Ancient Near East, the topic is deeply discussed in Porter 2012 [Porter2012]. The task of this paper is emphasize the geographical, political and social aspects of the settlement phenomena along the Euphrates valley int he Syrian territory, shedding light on the archaeological works along the river’s course between the mouth of the Balikh to the Khabour, as well as the area of Mount Bishri, located to the south of the Euphrates course during the Middle Bronze Age (20–150BC). The region witnessed a significant cultural and scientific development characterized by the emergence of new states and the interaction between various ethnicities and cultures; visible both in texts and material culture, and had a remarkable impact on the historical scene of the region.Download Free PDFView PDFPh.D. Dissertation, "THE LIMITS OF AMERICAN HEGEMONY IN OCCUPIED JAPAN  --JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS DURING THE OCCUPATION, 1945-1952--" (U. of Wisconsin-Madison, 1999)388p.Yoneyuki SugitaDownload Free PDFView PDFAnimal.Behavior Alcook An.Evolutionary.Approach.7.EditionBeatriz fDownload Free PDFView PDFOld Tibetan Manuscripts from East TurkestanOld Tibetan Manuscripts from East Turkestan Vol.2 DescriptiveCatalogue1998 • Tsuguhito  TakeuchiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
