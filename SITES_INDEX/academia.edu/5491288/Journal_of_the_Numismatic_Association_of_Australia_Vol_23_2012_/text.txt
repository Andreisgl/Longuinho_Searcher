There are eleven articles reflecting a remarkable range of numismatic interests. I am particularly pleased to see the balance of modern Australian and historical numismatic interests, and the excellent scholarship throughout. Many of the articles derive from presentations given at the wonderful NAA conference held in Melbourne from 21-22 October, 2017. I thank the presenters for being willing to quickly turn their talks into articles, despite the hard work this entailed, as well as the dedication of the other contributors. This journal is the annual publication of the peak numismatic body in the country. As noted in the last volume, I have been working with the President and the Editorial Committee to ensure the standard of all articles we publish compares favourably with the best international numismatic journals. This includes a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. I thank the members of the Editorial Committee and the two anonymous reviewers assigned to each article for their prompt and constructive help. In this volume we have six articles on modern Australian topics. The articles by Paul Holland and Walter bloom are numismatic studies respectively of George V pennies and award medals struck by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, WA chapter. Their treatments are exemplary demonstrations of the ‘arcane art’ of numismatic studies combining detailed knowledge with keen observation. These are foundational studies for others to follow. Vincent Verheyen uses his expertise in chemistry to analyse surface marks on predecimal proof coins made at the Melbourne branch of the Royal Mint. He successfully demonstrates that some of the marks result from production rather than careless handling, a finding that will have implications for collectors of proofs generally. Jeremy McEachern, Barrie Newman and David Rampling show another side of numismatics – how it can be used to inform our understanding of the past. Their entertaining articles range from illuminating the story of one of Australia’s earliest dealers (Rampling on Isidore Kozminsky), to the sporting achievements of one of the country’s celebrated early athletes (McEachern on Richmond ‘Dick’ Eve and the collection of his memorabilia in the National Sports Museum), and even the sorry tale of an ‘official’ fraudster who nonetheless got away with his misdeeds (Newman on a Ugandan High Commissioner). The volume also contains five articles on matters historical. Three of them deal with iconography and make fascinating reading, especially when taken together. Bridget McClean looks at Tarentine civic coinage c. 470 - 450 BC. Charlotte Mann and Rachel Mansfield both deal with iconography under emperors of the Severan dynasty of Rome in the early third century AD. Charlotte deals with the imperial portraiture of Caracalla, while Rachel examines the civic coinage of the eastern city of Antipatris under Elagabalus. The results of their studies are illuminating about how important coins were for disseminating propaganda, and in turn, understanding what was important to the emperors and cities that commissioned them. Christian Cuello takes us to the world of the Visigoths, best known for sacking Rome, but also producers of coinage, some of which reside in the Australian Centre for Ancient Numismatic Studies collection at Macquarie University, which he catalogues and discusses. Finally, Frank Robinson provides a careful study of bank notes of the Empire of Brazil which will be of interest to aficionados of paper money.Download Free PDFView PDFByzanz.

At the present time, three types of silver medallion (of coin weight) and a unique gold medallion are known. We assess the propaganda message, and the doubts concerning the authenticity of some of these types.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of the Numismatic Association of Australia_Vol 27_2016.pdfGil DavisDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
