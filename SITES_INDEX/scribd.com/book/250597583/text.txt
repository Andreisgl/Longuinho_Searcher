Cervantes, Donnelly River, Yallingup, Fremantle, Leonora, and beyond are richly evoked in poems ranging stylistically from accomplished mature lyrics and the confessional to narratives of raw power and feeling. Restlessly questioning and frequently allusive, slipping between promise and possibility, Maling's poems are invested in the actuality of the world, exploring the landscapes of memory and the brief moment of now.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextPoetryLanguageEnglishPublisherIndependent Publishers GroupRelease dateFeb 1, 2015ISBN9781925162417Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleCMAuthorCaitlin MalingRead more from Caitlin MalingSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextBorder CrossingEbookBorder CrossingbyCaitlin MalingRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Border Crossing for laterFish SongEbookFish SongbyCaitlin MalingRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Fish Song for laterSpore or SeedEbookSpore or SeedbyCaitlin MalingRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Spore or Seed for laterRelated authorsSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextJoseph McElroyMark TurnerFriedrich HölderlinN.

Like you can’t put your feet down the bottom, we were too soft for yabbies and you never dive from the bank because the logs move overnight.

A Ceauşescu baby, he arrived fully formed, since then he’s never not been touching one of us and I think his parents named him after a Disciple so he would always be surrounded by hovering ghosts and histories.
