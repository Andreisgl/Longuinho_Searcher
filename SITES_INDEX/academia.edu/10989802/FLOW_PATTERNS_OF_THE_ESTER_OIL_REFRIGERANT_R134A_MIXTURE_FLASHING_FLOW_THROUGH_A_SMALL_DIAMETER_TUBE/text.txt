An experimental apparatus was designed to allow the measurement of both pressure and temperature profiles along the tube as well as the visualization of the flow patterns. Tests were performed at different mass flow rates, several refrigerant mass fractions at the inlet of the flow, and inlet mixture temperatures around 28 and 39 °C. A liquid mixture flow with constant temperature and pressure gradient could be noticed at the inlet of the tube. As the flow proceeded towards the exit of the tube the pressure drop produced a reduction of the refrigerant solubility in the oil yielding to formation of the first bubbles. Initially, small and few bubbles could be noticed and the flow behaved as a conventional two-phase flow. Eventually, the bubble population increased and foam flow was observed...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersFoam Flow of Oil-Refrigerant R134A Mixture in a Small Diameter Tube2004 • José Luiz GascheDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and EngineeringFoam flow of oil-refrigerant R12 mixture in a small diameter tube2006 • José Luiz GascheDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of RefrigerationPressure drop correlation for oil–refrigerant R134a mixture flashing flow in a small diameter tube2009 • José Luiz GascheDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and EngineeringMathematical Modeling of the Ester Oil-Refrigerant R134a Mixture Two-Phase Flow with Foam Formation Through a Small Diameter Tube2011 • José Luiz GascheDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of RefrigerationEffect of oil on R134a distribution in the microchannel heat exchanger with vertical header2014 • Pega HrnjakDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of RefrigerationFlow boiling characteristics and flow pattern visualization of refrigerant/lubricant oil mixtures2009 • Lixin  ChengDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of RefrigerationA model to predict R134a refrigerant leakage through the radial clearance of rolling piston compressors2012 • José Luiz GascheDownload Free PDFView PDFOil-Refrigerant R134a Mixture Non-Isothermal Two-Phase Flow Through the Radial Clearance of Rolling Piston Compressors2010 • José Luiz GascheDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Enhanced Heat TransferEvaporation Heat Transfer and Pressure Drop in Micro-Fin Tubes Before and After Tube Expansion2005 • John PanekDownload Free PDFView PDFThermal ScienceFlow boiling heat transfer coefficient of R-134a/R-290/R-600a mixture in a smooth horizontal tube2008 • Raja BalakrishnanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
