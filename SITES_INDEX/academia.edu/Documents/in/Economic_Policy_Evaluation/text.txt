The outcome of supply constraints and demand impulse are reflected in high inflation; a large current account deficit; and currency volatility. The developments are weighing on private sector confidence despite the ongoing boost to sales, employment, and profits. Enabling an orderly adjustment is important for productivity and potential output. Turkey has been prone to large economic swings in the past. The greater the volatility in growth, the more pronounced is the negative impact on productive investment and efficiency of resource allocation. The possibility for monetary policy to respond to adverse external developments is more challenging. A combination of high inflation (due to demand pressures, exchange rate passthrough, and higher production costs) on the one hand, and rising (and positive) policy rates on the other, creates challenges for a monetary stimulus in the event of an external shock. This challenge is exacerbated by the need to cool credit expansion, which has been above its long-term trend.Save to LibraryDownloadby Erdem Atas•  4  Macroeconomics, Economic Policy Evaluation, Fiscal Policy and debt Management, Monetary Policy and Exchange RateDriving Agricultural Transformation with the Power of Information and Communication Technology: The Performance of Nigeria's Growth Enhancement Support SchemeNigeria liberalized input distribution and established the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) in 2011 to deliver subsidized inputs to farmers as part of its Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA).

Despite the relevance of the GESS as a subsidy delivery mechanism, its achievements during the first year of implementation (2012) were below expectations. In 2015, as the first phase of the GESS is ending, has there been any significant improvement in its implementation? What improvements have occurred in redemption and participation rates? Even though the GESS is known to be making contributions in terms of ensuring direct access by farmers to subsidized inputs, the main determinants of farmers’ participation remain unknown. This study seeks to (i) examine the application of ICT innovations in the implementation of the GESS; (ii) assess its implementation performance from inception to date; and (iii) determine the factors influencing farmers’ participation in the scheme.

The main message in the book is ‘Knowing a country means knowing the people and making friends’. It highlights the importance of cooperation and co-creation with friendly nations for mutual prosperity. The book reflects the author’s own way of detailing the importance of cooperation for Indian managers in international business as part of his teaching in MBA class. The book describes the role of history, culture, religion, corruption, politics, etc. in economic policy making especially in the contemporary developing world, including India. It is full of anecdotal evidence that have made it an articulate polemic and provide a counter-intuitive look toward understanding the business environment.Book is available in amazon and google playhttp://www.amazon.com/My-World-Rafiki-Travelogue-Miscellany/dp/1482836734https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Biswajit_Nag_My_World_with_Rafiki?id=YOCVBQAAQBAJSo, please buy and leave a review in the site.

Two years of intensive trade missions, and efforts to woo China’s favour, have positioned Britain to share in the benefits of China’s economic restructuring programme. To reap the vast rewards on offer the British government must devise and project a clear and focused strategy regarding China. This must show how Britain can contribute to China’s economic reform, while stressing how China can enhance Britain’s own industrial base and technological comparative advantages—for Britain.....Save to LibraryDownloadby Winnie King•  7  Business, Political Economy, Development Studies, Foreign Policy AnalysisTHE IMPACTS OF NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNDING IN THE UK: A PUBLIC MANAGEMENT EVALUATION SUMMARYThis Impact Report identifies and summarises the diverse impacts, resulting from the £500m of UK funding of Science and Technology in 2013, using numerous quantitative metrics and short case study extracts.

The theoretical and methodological ideas behind the book, inspired by Aristotelian phronesis, represent an original perspective within the social sciences, and this volume gives readers for the first time a set of studies exemplifying what applied phronesis looks like in practice. The reflexive analysis of values and power gives new meaning to the impact of research on policy and practice. Real Social Science is a major step forward in a novel and thriving field of research. This book will benefit scholars, researchers, and students who want to make a difference in practice, not just in the academy. Its message will make it essential reading for students and academics across the social sciences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg and +1Sanford  Schram•  1613  Screenwriting, Critical Theory, Critical Theory, Critical TheoryNeoliberalna zabluda 26 godina kasnije [Neoliberal Fallacy 26 Years On]Is the neoliberal economic policy applicable in East and Central Europe after the breakdown of communism in 1989?

The first part of the article defines neoliberalism as a system of market allocation of resources, the domination of private property, personal initiative for exchange, and the minimal state. This definition is derived from the two cases of neoliberal reforms in the US and the UK in the 1980s. The second part discusses market imperfections by considering the government solution for the principal-agent problem created by information asymmerty. Since the state intevention itself suffers from political failures resultingin inefficient allocation, it can be justified only if it offers an institutional design that solves the principal-agent problem and political failures.Keywords: neoliberalism; market failures; political failures; principal-agent model; supply-side economicsSave to LibraryDownloadby Dušan Pavlović•  14  Institutional Economics, Economic Policy Evaluation, Neoliberalism, Institutions and Economic growthA Rookie mistake made byIt is very simple article about how professional economists sometimes make a rockie mistake by ignoring simple economics notions and mehods.It is the case when american economist Peter Navarro and Bloomberg columnist Nao Smith disputed... moreIt is very simple article about how  professional economists sometimes make a rockie mistake by ignoring simple economics notions and mehods.It is the case when american economist Peter Navarro and Bloomberg columnist Nao Smith disputed with each other and while doing it they both made a mistake.This lesson would be very important for those who working or studing as economist.Save to LibraryDownloadby Demberel Sambuu•Economic Policy EvaluationEfectos de la Ley de Reestructuración de Pasivos (Ley 550 de 1999) en las Entidades TerritorialesEl objetivo de este documento es presentar una estimación de los principales efectos de la Ley de Reestructuración de Pasivos (Ley 550 de 1999) en las entidades territoriales.

As such, we may treat them as similar events for the purpose of estimating the benefits of the active economic policy pursued in the former episode but not in the latter. The Great Depression episode is the gold standard of how costly a “hands off” economic policy can be in the presence of a severe economic downturn. The Great Recession, on the other hand, is the gold standard of how beneficial a “hands-on” economic policy can be under basically identical conditions. In this paper, we measure the GDP lost  under each of the two episodes and call the difference between the two measures the cost of a passive economic policy or a benefit of an active policy.Save to LibraryDownloadby H.

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorFinancial Crises: Who Is to Blame?The essay seeks to answer the question of who is predominantly to blame for financial crises.

Since the independence of Bangladesh, it has been gone through many ups and downs in the country's economic movement. The per capita income of the country has exceeded about two thousand US dollars. All the development indicators are upward in GDP. Rohingya people in Rakhine state, Myanmar have been facing decades of planned discrimination, statelessness, and targeted violence. For many years this kind of torture over the innocent Rohingya women, girls, boys and men has forced them to the influx to Bangladesh. The rapid spread of the Rohingya crisis also has been surprising for last three years to the Bangladesh government. From social to economic, economic to politics Rohingya refugees have impacts into the country. This research paper follows the empirical and narrative oriented research design in relation to find out the negative economic impact of the Rohingya influx to Bangladesh. One of the principal aims of the findings of this paper is to draw the attention of the policymakers and other concerns about the deleterious effects of the influx both in the future and present conditions. First and foremost, the negative impact of the Rohingya influx to Bangladesh on the economy is the increased cost of living and regional employment crisis. Moreover, a huge fall of the daily wage amount can be noticed. Furthermore, the country is facing a noticeable loss in the tourism sector and government expenditure on the health and security sector has risen since 2017. Hence, the government of Bangladesh should take necessary steps for the effective repatriation process without any delay to mitigate the financial cost burden.Save to LibraryDownloadby Syed Magfur Ahmad and +1Nasruzzaman Naeem•  17  Economic Policy Evaluation, Refugee Studies, Migration, Bangladesh Studies1.10 Making Organization Research Matter: Power, Values and PhronesisSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank Meier•  940  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorPoliticas de Desarrollo Económico TerritorialSave to LibraryDownloadby Mauricio Cuervo•  5  Latin American Studies, Economic Policy Evaluation, Regional policy, Political InstitutionsPhronetic Organizational ResearchPhronetic organizational research is an approach to the study of management and organizations focusing on ethics and power.

It is based on a contemporary interpretation of the Aristotelian concept phronesis, usually as ‘prudence’. Phronesis is the ability to think and act in relation to values, to deliberate about ‘things that are good or bad for humans’ in the words of Aristotle (1976:1140a24–b12). Phronetic organizational research effectively provides answers to the following four value-rational questions, for specific problematics in management and organization studies: 1. Where are we going with this specific management problematic? 2. Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? 3. Is this development desirable? 4.

The basic idea of the project was comprehensive, coherent, and innovative, and it was based on rational and democratic argument. During implementation, however, when idea met reality, the play of Machiavellian princes, Nietzschean will to power, and Foucauldian rationality-as-rationalization resulted in the fragmentation of the project.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  960  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorThe Automated Payment Transaction TaxSave to LibraryDownloadby Edgar L Feige•  9  Economics, Development Economics, Monetary Economics, Institutional EconomicsEconomic Policy During Ataturk's Era in Turkey (1923 -1938)New Republic of Turkey took over Ottoman Empire with a highly centralized political structure; this structure featured authoritarian management with an economic infrastructure based mainly on agriculture, where commerce and industry were... moreNew Republic of Turkey took over Ottoman Empire with a highly centralized political structure; this structure featured authoritarian management with an economic infrastructure based mainly on agriculture, where commerce and industry were almost completely dominated by the Europeans. It is unlikely to grasp the new era in an integrated manner, if the economical and political structures are handled separately. The economical classification and considerations on Atatürk's period should also take into account the political restructuring and the relations in between. This is the only way to approach the question in an integrated manner. As a result of such an approach, we see that the attempt to create a nation-state understanding in the political domain from the very beginning, even though the analysis of the economic policy of Atatürk's period may be divided into two sub-periods, namely 1923-29 and 1929-1938, was not easy. It is evident that such an understanding that completely dominated the political domain could not be based on the inherent motives of the economic domain and the very rules of the markets at all.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ensar  YILMAZ•  6  Economic Policy Evaluation, Economic policy, Turkish Economy, Mustafa Kemal AtatürkCase StudyAt the same time that case studies are widely used and have produced canonical texts, it may be observed that the case study as a methodology is generally held in low regard, or is simply ignored, within the academy.

For example, only 2 of the 30 top-ranked U.S. graduate programs in political science require a dedicated graduate course in case study or qualitative methods, and a full third of these programs do not even offer such a course. In contrast, all of the top 30 programs offer courses in quantitative methods and almost all of them require training in such methods, often several courses. In identifying this paradox of the case study’s wide use and low regard, Gerring rightly remarks that the case study survives in a “curious methodological limbo,” and that the reason is that the method is poorly understood. In what follows, we will try to resolve Gerring’s paradox and help case study research gain wider use and acceptance.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  959  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorProgressive Taxation, Income Inequality, and HappinessIncome inequality has become one of the more widely debated social issues today.

The current article explores the role of progressive taxation in income inequality and happiness. Using historical data in the United States from 1962 to 2014, we found that income inequality was substantially smaller in years when the income tax was more progressive (i.e., a higher tax rate for higher income brackets), even when controlling for variables like stock market performance and unemployment rate. Time lag analyses further showed that higher progres- sive taxation predicted increasingly lower income inequality up to 5 years later. Data from the General Social Survey (1972–2014; N   59,599) with U.S. residents (hereafter referred to as “Americans”) showed that during years with higher progressive taxation rates, less wealthy Americans—those in the lowest 40% of the income distribution—tended to be happier, whereas the richest 20% were not significantly less happy. Mediational analyses confirmed that the association of progressive taxation with the happiness of less wealthy Americans can be explained by lower income inequality in years with higher progressive taxation. A separate sample of Americans polled online (N   373) correctly predicted the positive association between progres- sive taxation and the happiness of poorer Americans but incorrectly expected a strong negative association between progressive taxation and the happiness of richer Americans.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kostadin Kushlev•  48  Sociology, Economic Sociology, Political Sociology, PsychologyEvaluation of Norwegian Innovation ClustersSince the early 2000s, Norway has had a strategy to strengthen industry clusters through a national cluster programme.

The cluster programmes’ role is to stimulate cluster development, or more specifically to trigger collaboration-based development which would not otherwise have happened, and to reinforce and accelerate existing collaboration. A total of 47 cluster projects are included in the current evaluation. We do find significant growth in formal collaboration through constructing R&D collaboration networks before and after participation in the cluster project. Comparing cluster members in our sample with a matched control group, we also find significant positive effects on employment, sales revenues and value added in the first three years after enrolment in a cluster project (but not thereafter). Our interpretation of the results is that the cluster projects primarily have a “kick-off” effect. Thus, we recommend a more limited period of public funding of cluster projects than today.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marina Rybalka•  3  Economic Policy Evaluation, Economics of Innovation, Social Network Analysis (SNA)Household Welfare: How to Measure and Index?Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Johanni•  10  Welfare Economics, Economic Policy Evaluation, Practice theory, Behavioral Economics'Death to Capitalism' and Future of Despair?

We posit an alternative approach based on the power analytics of Michel Foucault which focuses on ‘what is actually done’, as opposed to Habermas’s focus on ‘what should be done’. We discuss how the Foucauldian stance problematises planning, asking difficult questions about the treatment of legitimacy, rationality, knowledge and spatiality. We conclude that Foucault offers a type of analytic planning theory which offers better prospects than does Habermas for those interested in understanding and bringing about democratic social change through planning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  959  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorEconomic Policy in Nazi Germany: 1933-1945Save to LibraryDownloadby L.

Such research sets out to answer four questions of power and values for specific instances of planning: (1) Where are we going with planning? (2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What, if anything, should we do about it? A central task of phronetic planning research is to provide concrete examples and detailed narratives of the ways in which power and values work in planning and with what consequences to whom, and to suggest how relations of power and values could be changed to work with other consequences. Insofar as planning situations become clear, they are clarified by detailed stories of who is doing what to whom. Clarifications of that kind are a principal concern for phronetic planning research and provide the main link to praxis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational Behavior"Europe At a Crossroads," Near Futures OnlineAttracting international investors while repelling undesirable migrants: since the Great Recession of 2009, these two preoccupations have dominated the European agenda.

To help young people fill it in and ease school-to-work transitions, every EU country provides a mix of policy instruments, including different degrees and types of labour market flexibility, of educational and training systems, of passive income support schemes ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Floro E Caroleo and +1Francesco  Pastore•  14  European Studies, Comparative Literature, Economics, Labor EconomicsMy Research on Compensating VariationSave to LibraryDownloadby Munawar Asikin•  3  Social Sciences, Economic Policy Evaluation, PoovertyAfter The Neoliberals: A New Middle Way for Britain and America… / Rescuing Native Workers and Jumpstarting the EconomyThe stunning defeat of the ‘Remain camp’ in the Brexit referendum in the UK and the surprise ‘discursive dominance’ of Bernie Sanders and Donald J.

Trump throughout the presidential primaries cycle on the other side of the Atlantic have shaken the neoconservative-consumerist policy consensus in Berlin and Brussels. A new consensus seems to be emerging amongst British, American and French experts, one that favors ambitious developmentalism, modern infrastructure investment and the defense of native workers’ rights including pensions over lawless ‘free trade’ and regulatory overreachSave to LibraryDownloadby M.

The Danish town of Aalborg is to Flyvbjerg what Florence was to Machiavelli: a laboratory for understanding the real workings of power, and for grasping what they mean to our more general concerns of social and political organization. Politics, administration, and planning are examined in ways that allow  a rare, in-depth understanding. The reader witnesses, firsthand, the classic and endless drama which defines what modernity and democracy are and can be.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  959  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorΟικονομικές και Πολιτικές Εξελίξεις στο Περιθώριο του 1ου Συνεδρίου του Οικονομικού Ταχυδρόμου.-Economic and Political Developments in GreeceThis article summarizes the developments that came out of the conference of the main neoliberal bulletin in the Greek Press (Economicos Tahydromos).

The most interesting part was that the Economic Developments were not analyzed by the Prime Minister that addressed the conference, but by the Governor of the Bank of Greece. The latter expressed views (for example on possible stagflation) that were different from the views of the ECB. He sounded more like a Mario Draghi-type prime minister that an ECB official. This indicates possible future political developments as well (PARON 3/4/2022).Save to LibraryDownloadby Nikos  Stravelakis•  4  Political Economy, Economic Policy Evaluation, Economic policy, Economics and PoliticsINTRODUCTION TO HEALTH ECONOMICS - SAĞLIK EKONOMISINE GIRIŞSave to LibraryDownloadby Adnan Kisa•  18  Health Economics, Economic Policy Evaluation, Primary Health Care, Health OutcomesWhy is Mexico Poorer than Spain?This is a chapter no. 6 from the Wolrd Bank's publication (2014) "Puzzles of Economic Growth" edited by L.

Balcerowicz and A. Rzońca.Until the mid-19th century, these two countries had many features in common in terms of politics, institutions, culture, as well as the economy. They generated almost identical GDP per capita and grew at a similar pace. Since 1960s the paths of the two countries have begun to diverge. In 1960–2001 average annual growth stood at 3.8 percent in Spain and at only 2 percent in Mexico. This chapter aims at providing relevant explanations referring to the concepts of stabilizig and propelling institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anna Kurowska•  7  Economic History, Economics, Economic Policy Evaluation, Economic GrowthThe New Bolivian Economic ModelSave to LibraryDownloadby Luis Alberto Arce-Catacora•  12  Latin American Studies, Development Economics, Political Economy, Economic Policy EvaluationThe Life Cycle Hypothesis: Theory Validity Assessment Using Evidence from the USA and JapanThis paper aims to present one of the most important models in macroeconomics, the life-cycle theory of savings, and evaluate if this theory still provides a valid explanation of the household saving rates in the United States of America... moreThis paper aims to present one of the most important models in macroeconomics, the life-cycle theory of savings, and evaluate if this theory still provides a valid explanation of the household saving rates in the United States of America (USA) and Japan. The explanation and validity assessment will bring evidence from the impact of demographic trends on the savings rates evolution. The first part of the paper will give a brief overview of the different theories on income developed throughout the time and it will focus on the life-cycle theory of savings and its perspectives on income, consumption and savings. The second part will evaluate the model’s credibility by reviewing empirical support from the USA and Japan.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria-Iuliana Maxim•  4  Economic Policy Evaluation, Income Distribution, Income, Life Cycle Income HypothesisΙδιωτικές Υποδομές, Δημόσιο Χάος και Κράτος ΜΚΟ - Private Infrastructure, Public Chaos and the State like o Non Government OrganizationLast week the Greek Capital Athens was paralyzed because of a snow storm.

A good part of this infrastructure (roads, trains but also the electric company) is private (in full or in part) or privately managed. Privatization has gone together with rising cost and degradation of the services. However, the most outrageous part is that the neoliberal government said "its not my fault, the fault is with the private managers". It is time infrastructure returns under state ownership and management (PARON 10/01/2022)Save to LibraryDownloadby Nikos  Stravelakis•  3  Economic Policy Evaluation, Privatization, Poltical EconomyEconomic policy in Slovakia 1990-1999Save to LibraryDownloadby Miroslav Beblavy•Economic Policy EvaluationNextLast »Related TopicsWelfare EconomicsFollowFollowingEconomicsFollowFollowingEconomic DevelopmentFollowFollowingApplied MicroeconomicsFollowFollowingDevelopment EconomicsFollowFollowingEconomic GrowthFollowFollowingPublic PolicyFollowFollowingPublic EconomicsFollowFollowingRegional EconomicsFollowFollowingPoetry AnalysisFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
