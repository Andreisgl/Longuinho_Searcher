You may remember that, in the beginning of our Radio Arlecchino Holiday Special, Eric had been invited to join our commedia friends as they celebrated the season backstage before opening a new show. As they shared reminiscences of holidays past, we reviewed the grammar points we've encountered so far. So now we can continue to enjoy the warm fuzzy feelings, as we continue to review our grammar. Let's listen in before something else happens!Dialog: ItalianA First ThanksgivingArlecchino: A me, a me, a me il pandoro di Verona!Arlecchina: E mentre assaporate il pandoro ecco un altro ricordo di cibo ... Ricordate la professoressa Pease? Mi ha mandato questo biglietto ...Arlecchino: Indimenticabile! Cosa racconta?Arlecchina: Il suo primo Thanksgiving in America. Sentite, ragazzi: Antonella Pease: Per il Thanksgiving quell'anno ero a Austin dove studiavo all'Università del Texas ...Avendo affittato un piccolo appartamento, ho invitato alcuni amici per la festa e loro mi hanno portato un enorme tacchino.In Italia non abbiamo la festa del Ringraziamento e io non avevo mai visto un tacchino così grosso e non sapevo come cucinarlo. Alla fine ho tagliato il petto del bestione a fettine e le ho saltate in padella con burro olio e vino.Immaginate la sorpresa dei miei amici!Colombina: Nuova tradizione texana: tacchino al burro olio e vino!Dialog: EnglishArlecchino: I'm all about pandoro from Verona!Arlecchina: And while you're tasting the pandoro here's another food memory ... You remember professor Pease? She sent me this card ...Arlecchino: Unforgettable! What does she have to tell us?Arlecchina: About her first Thanksgving in America. Listen, guys: Antonella Pease: For Thanksgiving that year I was in Austin where I was studying at the University of Texas.Having rented a small apartment, I invited some friends for the holiday and they brought me an enormous turkey.In Italy we don't have the Day of Thanksgiving and I had never seen such a huge turkey and I didn't know how to cook it. In the end I cut up the breast of the beast into little slices and tossed it in a pan with butter, oil and wine.Imagine my friends' surprise!Colombina: A new Texas tradition! Turkey with butter oil and wine!Dialog: ItalianA Terrible Christmas SecretPantalone: Qui c'è un altro biglietto ... Colombina! Questo è indirizzato a te ...Colombina: È da Adria!Everybody: Adria!Colombina: Come ci divertivamo una volta a tramare complotti con sua sorella ... Ora scrive: 'Che Babbo Natale non esisteva me l'ha detto mia sorella una sera in bagno, dove andavamo spesso insieme a raccontarci segreti.'Adria: Che Babbo Natale non esisteva me l'ha detto mia sorella una sera in bagno, dove andavamo spesso insieme a raccontarci segreti. La storia di Babbo Natale per me era sempre stata piuttosto problematica perché dovevo difenderne l'esistenza con gli altri bambini, che mi prendevano in giro perché a loro i regali li portava Gesù Bambino.  La delusione più grande è stata capire che Babbo Natale non si nascondeva sul balcone il giorno prima della vigilia di Natale--questo non me l'aveva raccontato nessuno, era una cosa che mi ero inventata io e di cui ero convintissima.Arlecchino: Ma chi gliel'ha detto alla sorella che Babbo Natale non esiste?!Arlecchina: Pensi che sia vero?Arlecchino: È assurdo!Dottore: Falsitas mentitur!Colombina: Dev'essere uno scherzo!Arlecchino: Babbo Natale esiste! È sempre esistito!Arlecchina: Ci credo anch'io!Pantalone: Calma, calma, ragazzi! In questa Compagnia, Babbo Natale esiste!Arlecchino: Evviva Babbo Natale!Everybody: Evviva! Evviva!Dialog: EnglishPantalone: Here's another card ... Colombina! This one is addressed to you ...Colombina: It's from Adria!Everybody: Adria!Colombina: What fun we used to have hatching plots with her sisReleased:Dec 18, 2007Format:Podcast episodeTitles in the series (22)Radio Arlecchino provides mp3 podcast lessons that illustrate specific Italian grammar points.
