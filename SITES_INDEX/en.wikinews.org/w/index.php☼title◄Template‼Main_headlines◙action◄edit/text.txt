Why is this page protected?
What can I do?
Archived Wikinews articles are fully protected, as they are considered snapshots in time, permanent records of history.
Published Wikinews articles are usually semi-protected from editing, and fully protected from moving, as they are exported content of the project.
While most general-purpose pages can be edited by anyone, sometimes page access needs to be restricted due to vandalism.
The reason for protection can be found in the protection log. If there are no relevant entries in the protection log, the page may have been moved after being protected.
If you have a user account, log in first. If you do not yet have an account, you may create one; after you've edited a bit and a few days have passed, you will be able to edit semi-protected pages.
If you feel an edit is needed to this page, first check the talk page to see if the matter has been raised already.  You may then wish to start a new thread on that page and use {{editprotected}} to request the edit.
You can view and copy the source of this page.
