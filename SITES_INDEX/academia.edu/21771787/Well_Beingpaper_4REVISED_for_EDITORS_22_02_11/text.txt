It discusses work carried out in a series of workshops with young people in UK schools in the East and West Midlands, South Yorkshire. Whilst POE methodologies allow an examination of the physical, technical and management factors influencing the actual performance of building, using action research based participatory and co-research methods also gives an opportunity to explore children's knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards low carbon buildings and living more sustainable lifestyle, and this influence on energy behaviours. Intergenerational influence, often goes unacknowledged: children’s attitudes, knowledge and behaviours (and school-based education for sustainability) has influence within households, as do the experiences of the older generation able to reflect on consumerism and unfettered spending. Understanding why our energy use and our relationship to the natural resources has to change raises, complex social issues, but schools provide a unique opportunity for feedback tools not only improve the performance of 'sustainable' architecture but also to address how we can motivate more sustainable lifestyles.Download Free PDFView PDFWheeler, Andrea and Dino Boughlaghem and Masoud Malekzadeh (2011) “What do young people tell us about sustainable lifestyles when they design sustainable schools?” Architecture and Sustainable Development, Proceedings of PLEA 2011, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, July 2011. 2011 • Andrea WheelerABSTRACT: The UK government created a unique educational opportunity with the recent school building programme. Its aims were described as transforming learning and embedding sustainability into the life experience of every child. However, how do young people understand these aims, and the concepts of sustainable lifestyles and sustainable communities, now they have begun to be translated into school design? This paper reports on the recently suspended programme and discusses the value of Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) as a way of capturing successes and failures of what has been implemented so far. POE provides an opportunity for young people to critically engage with why our energy use and our relationship with the natural environment has to change. POE can also examine the gap between predicted and actual energy performance of a building and human behaviour is key in such investigations. The focus on innovative technologies is in danger of ignoring the human factors involved in reducing our impact on the environment. Current approaches used in Education for Sustainability can also ignore the complex social aspects of encouraging sustainable lifestyles. This paper describes an emergent POE approach developed and used to carried out research with young people in the UK using this method. It examines reoccurring themes across case studies and describes young peoples’ experience with contradictory adults’ behaviours. If we are to meet the needs of future generations, we will all have to be able to design for ourselves – albeit in negotiation with others – environments in which we can live in different ways. Participatory post-occupancy assessments hence have multiple benefits, whilst for architects, they provide feedback on the performance of buildings; for young people they are also creative opportunities to begin to explore sustainable development, with all the philosophical and political complexities this entails, and to begin to rethink and redesign their lifestyles.Download Free PDFView PDFTheatre Practices, Performativity and Young People's Ethical ArchitecturesAndrea WheelerDownload Free PDFView PDFWheeler, Andrea (2009) "Theatre Practices, Performativity and Young People's Ethical Architectures", Ethics and the Built Environment Conference, University of Nottingham, 9-11th September 2009Andrea WheelerDownload Free PDFView PDFAedm Poe 2-10-15Andrea WheelerDownload Free PDFView PDFArchitectural Engineering and Design ManagementExploring the use of new school buildings through post-occupancy evaluation and participatory action research2015 • Andrea WheelerThis paper presents the results of the development and testing of an integrated post-occupancy evaluation (POE) approach for teachers, staff, pupils and community members using newly constructed school buildings. It focusses on three cases of UK secondary schools, demonstrating how users can be inspired to engage with the problems of school design and energy use awareness. The cases provided new insights into the engagement of school teachers, staff and young people regarding issues of sustainability, management, functional performance and comfort. The integrative approach adopted in these cases provided a more holistic understanding of these buildings’ performance than could have been achieved by either observational or more traditional questionnaire-based methods. Moreover, the whole-school approach, involving children in POE, provided researchers with highly contextualised information about how a school is used, how to improve the quality of school experiences (both socially and educationally) and how the school community is contributing to the building's energy performance. These POE methods also provided unique opportunities for children to examine the social and cultural factors impeding the adoption of energy-conscious and sustainable behaviours.Download Free PDFView PDFWheeler, Andrea (2012) “From Agent of Change to Global Citizen?” Dialogue, drawings, narratives and performances of secondary school children engaged with the design of a sustainable school”.

Andrea Wheeler Loughborough University Abstract Why is comfort such a key term for engaging children in dialogue about their natural and designed surroundings? This paper discusses the findings of a 3 year RCUK post-doctoral research project with children in secondary schools describing the methods adopted and the conclusions of findings. I argue that comfort acts as a means to connect the personal to wider issues of climate change and to move children’s understandings of themselves from agent of change to global citizen. This paper speculates on the future for the design of the ‘sustainable’ school. It also poses the following questions: are there new ways of thinking, living and being emerging from the younger generation, demanding support from adults; and does the ‘sustainable’ school and its design provide a testing ground for supporting changes in patterns of living? These questions are explored and illustrated through the dialogue, drawings, narratives and performances of secondary school children.
