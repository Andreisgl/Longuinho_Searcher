Networking Security: At An Evolutionary Crossroads
For decades, networking security has been the core element of well-designed cybersecurity programs. The ability to effectively secure corporate networks from hackers, viruses and intruders has been front and center of all cybersecurity efforts. New forces on the horizon are changing perceptions of network security, however. Networks are no longer simply contained within enterprise walls—today’s networks encompass platforms and extend to outside parties, including partners, developers, industry collaborators and customers. In addition, cloud, software as a service and virtualization have become a vital part of enterprise infrastructure, changing the scope of protection. The Internet of Things (IoT) is also bringing new end points and players into corporate network environments. As a result, the size and scope of the enterprise attack surface have grown significantly, with enterprises expanding their reach outward.

We explore how organizations are addressing these changes in this report, which is based on a survey of 1,001 enterprises conducted by Forbes Insights, in partnership with VMware. We also outline the trends that will shape networking security management over the coming years.

This brief details the findings among the 213 retail respondents. Where appropriate, retail results are contrasted with the overall sample.

End-Users: The Critical Last Mile Of Cybersecurity
While cybersecurity is an initiative that affects all levels of the technology stack, it is most critical at the end-user level. The expansive attack surface represented by the increasing volume and variety of end-user devices means security executives and professionals need to take a hard look at how they are securing these endpoints. These include the devices end-users use to access compute services, be they mobile devices, laptops, desktops or other systems. It also encompasses the rise of virtualization and service layers that enable access to enterprise data and applications.
