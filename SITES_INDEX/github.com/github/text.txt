README.md
Hey, this is us üëã
Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we‚Äôve been doing this since October 19th, 2007. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed over 2.5 million commits, opened over 1 million issues, submitted roughly 650k pull requests across 4357 repositories from over 50 countries ü§Ø. But that's just us. We are proud  to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system ü™ê. Yes, Robots!
üçø An interconnected community
The open source community is the üíó heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:
GitHub Sponsors helped support more than 5k individuals and projects around the world üåç
Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning 218 million contributions üöÄ in the last year alone
Every minute a developer creates a new release üèÑ for a public project on GitHub
Now that we are talking about the important things ‚òùÔ∏è, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! üé∏ If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about how to contribute.
ü¶¶ Contributing to the ecosystem
We contribute to the tools üîß we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è our own open source projects like:
GitHub CLI - A command line tool for GitHub
Git Large File Storage - A git extension for versioning large files
Primer - The GitHub design system
üëì Appendix
See what's next on our public roadmap ‚ú® and let us know if you have any suggestions üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to join our team üôå.
"Tell me more, I can't get enough!"
GitHub is built using mighty üî® open source technologies like Ruby on Rails, Go, Primer, React and Kafka among others.
The three open source projects GitHub members have most contributed üë©‚Äçüíª to are:
Visual Studio Code
Ruby on Rails
Homebrew
By the way, our documentation ü§ì is also open sourced
ü§´ Psst! You can create your own organization README.
