During the early stages of site investigation planning for Luva, various deepwater site investigation options were considered: surface mounted drilling, seabed based drilling, combined seabed PCPT and deep gravity / piston core option and acoustic coring. An extensive market survey was performed which in particular researched the currently available seabed drilling technology concepts, variations in their design and operation and their limitations. This Paper highlights the main issues raised during the market survey and technical evaluation, discusses the various site investigation systems available for deepwater geotechnical site investigations and identifies the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. The Paper is the first in a series of 4 which together describe the Project in detail. The Paper should be read in conjunction with the others which follow during this conference session.Download Free PDFView PDFFrontiers in Offshore Geotechnics IILuva deepwater site investigation programme and findings2010 • Tor Inge TjeltaDownload Free PDFView PDFAspects on offshore drilling process in deep and very deep waters2020 • Valentin TudoracheOffshore is a broad concept and therefore in this article offshore refers to drilling wells of oil and gas in the hydrocarbons deposits located deep from the seabed. Oil and gas is drilled wells with help of different offshore structures, for example rigs and vessels. Offshore drilling is a complex process where a borehole is drilled through the seabed. Of course, offshore refers to energy activity located at a distance from the shore. Oil and natural gas is located below the bedrock, which makes it difficult to extract them. A limited amount of inland oil has driven oil industry to the seas to find more oil deposits. There are high financial markets in the offshore industry and that is why much money is being invested in new offshore structures all around the world. Offshore structures are constructed for many different purposes worldwide. The structures are expensive to construct but there is an opportunity to have significant financial profit.Download Free PDFView PDFDeepwater drilling offshore NorwayPeter Aird, C.Eng, C.MarEng, FIMarESTDownload Free PDFView PDFSeafloor based drilling and sample quality at soft clay sitesJean-louis Colliat-dangus, Tom Lunne, Amandine LonguetTwo soil investigations were performed in soft, lightly overconsolidated clays in 1,300m of water depth. This paper will review and compare the results of these investigations and the subsequent onshore laboratory testing, in particular focusing on the quality of the samples and the performance and efficiency of the seafloor based drilling system that was utilised. The laboratory testing results clearly demonstrate that the lower plasticity clays encountered at Site L are more susceptible to sample disturbance compared with the high plasticity clays from Site C. Previous soil investigations were also conducted in the vicinity of both these fields which utilised conventional vessel-based drilling techniques and additional geotechnical information was available from seafloor based systems operated in non-drilling mode in similar ground conditions. The two sites are both deepwater lightly overconsolidated soft clay sites and they are geotechnically homogeneous.

A concept based on subsea tunnels and caverns has been developed for an offshore oil field in Northern Norway as alternative to traditional development strategies for offshore oil fields. The concept includes 2 or 3 parallel tunnels descending from an onshore terminal facility to a base station at the low point. From the base station, parallel tunnels will be bored by TBMs to the location of large production caverns that need to be established for drilling and operation facilities. The concept has been found to be feasible and viable compared to traditional development concepts, and the associated cost and time schedules to be competitive for fields in the range of 30 km from the shore. Several challenges need to be tackled for a robust solution, but these are all considered being within th...Download Free PDFView PDFNorwegian Journal of GeologyPetroleum, coal and research drilling onshore Svalbard: a historical perspectiveAleksandra  Smyrak-SikoraDownload Free PDFView PDFaaee.atDrilling Productivity on the Norwegian Continental ShelfRagnar TveteråsDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
