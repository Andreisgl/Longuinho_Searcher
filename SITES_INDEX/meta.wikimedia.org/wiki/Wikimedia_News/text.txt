This page is for the announcement of milestones on the Wikimedia projects. If you want to make such an announcement, please post it here and translate it if you can.
Recommended article-count milestones are 100, 500, 1k (1,000), 2k, 5k, then 5k increments to 20k, 10k increments to 100k, 50k increments to 200k, 100k increments to 1M (1,000,000), 500k increments to 2M, and 1M increments to 10M. Article (or content-page) counts should reflect the counts seen at each wiki's Special:Statistics page, which are based on what MediaWiki sees as constituting an article. Other milestones, such as page edits, registered users or featured articles, can also be announced here, but typically only the powers-of-ten levels of these statistics are considered significant enough to announce.
Wikimedia Forum provides a place for general discussion.

Older news
For older news items, see the 2022 archive or the archives for earlier years listed at the top of this page.
Projects by number of content pages
The tables below are arranged chronologically by the original launch dates of the major content projects, within two main groups: "interlingual" projects (different wiki for each language) followed by "multilingual" projects (all languages on the same wiki). The older Wikimedia projects (such as Wikipedia) tend to be larger than the newer ones, but note that these tables are not arranged by number of sub-wikis nor by total article count (across all languages).
For the interlingual projects, within each table the individual language editions are arranged by milestone level, and then chronologically by the date the milestones were first reached.
Note: You can go directly to the table for Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote, Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikinews, Wikiversity, Wikivoyage, Wikimedia Commons, Wikispecies, or Wikidata.
