Country Analysis Brief ›
With its North Sea production declining, the United Kingdom became a net importer of both crude oil and natural gas in 2005.  Oil remains important to the UK economy, with oil's contribution to total energy consumption accounting for 38 percent in 2007.  The UK is one of the largest natural gas producers in the world. Natural gas-fired power stations are replacing coal as the principle source of the UK power supply.
