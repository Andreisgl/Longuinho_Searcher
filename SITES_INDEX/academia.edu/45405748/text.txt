This paper focuses on a research strategy combining the concept of mental models, diary method, drawings technique and thematic analysis to study individual information spaces. The possibility of implementing such approach was tested on a case study of personal information spaces of undergraduate information management students. Method. Methods of critical literature review and case study were used. Empirical data were gathered by means of the diary technique in its verbal, written and open form and by participant-generated drawings, and analysed with thematic analysis. Analysis. The analysis allowed to: (1) elicit selected components of individual information spaces as represented in their mental models, such as information activities, sources, people, places, affective and socio-cultural factors, and (2) to capture the main features of mental models, i.e. themes (cross-data patterns). Results. The pursuit of positive emotions, comfort, peace and safety is the dominant force shaping information behaviour and personalized information spaces. Conclusions. Triangulation of concepts of mental models, diary method, drawings technique and thematic analysis proved to be a fruitful study approach, not only offering holistic insight into personal information spaces but also opening new research questions.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersZagadnienia Informacji Naukowej - Studia InformacyjneQualitative Analysis of Visual Data in Information Behavior ResearchMonika KrakowskaPurpose/Thesis: The paper contains a methodological reflection on qualitative analysis of visual empirical data as a research procedure in the contemporary human information behavior research. The possibility of implementing this approach has been tested on a case study of personalized information spaces in everyday life of undergraduate information management students in the academic year 2018/2019.Approach/Methods: The reported research employs the realist epistemological stance, qualitative and descriptive approaches, and four methods/techniques: critical literature review, case study, drawing as a mental mapping tool, and thematic analysis. Results and conclusions: Visual data analysis is cognitively fruitful; it enables grasping the multidimensional “information reality” as perceived by the users (the humanistic coefficient). However, it is time-consuming, it requires meticulousness and self-reflection on the part of the researcher; it must also leave a clear audit trail to ass...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Librarianship and Information ScienceInformation landscapes as contexts of information practicesReijo SavolainenThe article examines the strengths and limitations of the analogy of information landscapes proposed by Annemaree Lloyd. The analogy offers a novel approach to the conceptualization of the spatial contexts of information practices. Drawing on the ideas of metaphor analysis, the analogy is scrutinized by comparing the similarities between its source domain, that is, natural landscape, and target domain, that is, information landscape. The study identified three main aspects of the analogy: (1) information landscapes as spaces affording the accomplishment of information practices, (2) information landscapes as spaces entwining physical and imaginary qualities and (3) information landscapes as socially constructed spatial contexts of information practices. The findings suggest that the construct of information landscapes represents a spatial analogy in which the properties of the source domain partially elucidate the nature of the contexts of information practices. The analogy works be...Download Free PDFView PDFZagadnienia Informacji Naukowej - Studia InformacyjneAffective Factors in Human Information Behavior: A Conceptual Analysis of Interdisciplinary Research on Information BehaviorMonika KrakowskaPurpose/Thesis: The article contains theoretical and conceptual reflection and analysis of how emotions and other affective phenomena are defined and understood in contemporary research on human information behavior. The article draws attention to the interdisciplinary nature of research into affective information activities. Approach/Methods: The reported research employs a qualitative approach, relying on critical literature review, and conceptual and thematic analysis. The analyzed material came from select publications from 2014–2020. Results and Conclusions: Information science studies the role of emotions in information behavior. However, the application of the affective paradigm remains very limited. The affective understanding of information activities should be constantly expanded on an interdisciplinary basis with reference to theories and methods of other disciplines, such as psychology. Originality/Value: The article studies the development of the theoretical affective p...Download Free PDFView PDFState of the art/science: Visual methods and information behavior research2012 • Diane H .

It includes theoretical reflection on the subject of identifying heterogeneous information activities and attempts to define and characterize various crisis situations. Approach/Methods: The presented research employs qualitative approach, and methods/techniques: scoping literature review, conceptual analysis and thematic analysis. The data sample comprised selected, representative publications from 2001-2020. Results and Conclusion: Research on information behavior in various crisis situations is an important research area of information science. However, it remains understudied; the field should be expanded to account for multifaceted issues of individual and collective informational behavior in contemporary crisis situations and disasters. Originality/Value: The article is the first theoretical and conceptual analysis of information behavior in crisis situations. The article discusses various types of crises and information activities undertaken in crisis situations to develop a theoretical and practical foundation for future research on information behavior.Download Free PDFView PDFInformation ResearchResident university students' everyday-life information seeking behaviour in Pakistan2021 • Dr. Muhammad Asif NaveedIntroduction. This study seeks to investigate the everyday-life information seeking behaviour of postgraduate students living in the residence halls of the University of the Punjab, Lahore. Method. A critical incident technique, a qualitative research approach, was used in order to achieve its objectives. Face to face interviews of twenty postgraduate students, having a rural background, selected through purposive sampling, using a semi-structured interview approach were conducted. Analysis. The verbal data was organized and analysed using thematic analysis. The important data was coded and grouped for deriving themes. Results. The participants' situations were centred on health, socioeconomic , cultural, technological, and legal issues. These students mainly relied on inter-personal information sources in order to resolve their everyday-life issues. The role of university libraries was nonexistent in meeting the everyday-life information needs of these participants. Some participants suspected the quality and scope of information received from news and social media. These participants were mostly unsuccessful in accessing needed everyday-life information on time due to lack of information sources. Conclusions. The results have implications for both theory and practice. It extends the scope of the everyday-life information seeking model by adding a new dimension and provides insights into trans-national perspectives. If the everyday-life issues of resident postgraduate university students remained unresolved due to lack of information and institutional support, it might affect their academic achievement and research productivity. Therefore, the university administration should plan on-campus consultancy services within student affairs offices for supporting such students to overcome difficulties in light of their everyday-life information needs. The library staff should also design services to support those provided by the university administration. Resident university students' everyday-life information seeking behaviou...Download Free PDFView PDFLibrary and Information ResearchParticipant-driven photo-elicitation in library settings: A methodological discussionJenaya WebbWith the current attention in libraries on user-focused services and spaces, there is an increased interest in qualitative research methods that can provide insight into users’ experiences. In this paper, we advance photo-elicitation—a research method that employs photographs in interviews—as one such method. Although widely used in the social sciences, photo-elicitation has seen comparatively little uptake in Library and Information Studies (LIS). Here, we provide an overview of the method, consider epistemological and theoretical approaches, discuss cases of its application in library contexts and examine the benefits of using photo-elicitation for LIS research. We draw on our own research experiences and argue that photo-elicitation is a productive method for learning about the lived experiences of our users and for creating a collaborative approach to library research.Download Free PDFView PDFInformation Research an International Electronic JournalInformation work analysis :an approach to research on information interactions and information behaviour in context2008 • Isto HuvilaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Librarianship and Information ScienceSeeing information: Visual methods as entry points to information practicesAnnemaree  LLoydRecognising the importance of exploring multimodal experiences of information, this paper provides a detailed examination of the scope of visual research methods within information practices research. More specifically, the paper will use the examples from one completed study (Lloyd and Wilkinson, 2017) and one ongoing study (Hicks, in progress) to discuss and provide a detailed examination of the use, affordances and limitations of two research methods that centre upon participant-created photographs: photo-elicitation and photovoice. Demonstrating that the use of photographs helps to evoke and communicate complex meaning as well as to mediate between linguistic, temporal and spatial constraints, this study highlights the continuing need to develop research methods that privilege participants’ understandings and perspectives.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
