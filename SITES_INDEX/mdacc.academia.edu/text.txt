Mutation of this receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in the response of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) to EGFR-targeted therapies. It is envisaged that imaging of EGFR using positron emission tomography (PET) could aid in selection of patients for treatment with novel inhibitors. We recognised multi-drug resistant phenotype as a threat to development of successful imaging agents. In this report, we describe discovery of a novel cyanoquinoline radiotracer that lacks ABC transporter activity.

In recent years, the targeted imaging of the C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), a chemokine receptor that has been associated with tumor metastasis, has become an area of intensive research. This review article focuses on positron emission tomography (PET) and aims to provide useful and critical insights into the application of PET to characterize CXCR4 expression, including the chemical, radiosynthetic, and biological requirements for PET radiotracers. This discussion is informed by a summary of the different approaches taken so far and a comparison of their clinical translation. Finally, our expert opinions as to potential future advances in the field are expressed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
