The approach requires researchers and implementing partners to learn new skills and build new capacities as they work in multistakeholder teams. Capacity development is central to programs utilizing RinD, both to ensure quality engagement with stakeholders and to enable capacity to innovate as an outcome. In this working paper, the authors share learning from the implementation of a systems approach to capacity development in the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) over 3 years in five geographies.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersResearch in development: Learning from the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems2015 • Boru DouthwaiteThis working paper aims to synthesize and share learning from the experience of adapting and operationalizing the Research in Development (RinD) approach to agricultural research in the five hubs under the The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems. It seeks to share learning about how the approach is working in context and to explore the outcomes it is achieving through initial implementation over 3 Â½ years. This learning can inform continuation of agricultural research in the second phase of the CGIAR research programs and will be useful to others aiming to implement research programs that seek to equitably build capacity to innovate in complex social-ecological systems. Each of the chapters in this working paper have shown that RinD has produced a range of outcomes that were often unexpected and broader in scope than might result from other approaches to agricultural research. RinD also produces innovations, and there is evidence that it builds capacity to innovate.Download Free PDFView PDFLearning from the lagoon: Research in development in Solomon Islands2016 • Joelle AlbertA major challenge for international agricultural research is to find ways to improve the nutrition and incomes of people left behind by the Green Revolution. To better address the needs of the most marginal and vulnerable people, the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) developed the research-in-development (RinD) approach. In 2012, WorldFish started to implement RinD in Solomon Islands. By building peopleâ€™s capacity to analyze and address development problems, actively engaging relevant stakeholders, and linking research to these processes, RinD aims to develop an alternative approach to addressing hunger and poverty. This report describes the key principles and implementation process, and assesses the emergent outcomes of this participatory, systems-oriented and transformative research approach in Solomon Islands.Download Free PDFView PDFCollaborative effort to operationalize the gender transformative approach in the Barotse Floodplain2014 • Conrad MuyauleDownload Free PDFView PDFResilient livelihoods and food security in coastal aquatic agricultural systemsRanjitha  PuskurAquatic agricultural systems (AAS) are diverse production and livelihood systems where families cultivate a range of crops, raise livestock, farm or catch fish, gather fruits and other tree crops, and harness natural resources such as timber, reeds, and wildlife. Aquatic agricultural systems occur along freshwater floodplains, coastal deltas, and inshore marine waters, and are characterized by dependence on seasonal changes in productivity, driven by seasonal variation in rainfall, river flow, and/or coastal and marine processes. Despite this natural productivity, the farming, fishing, and herding communities who live in these systems are among the poorest and most vulnerable in their countries and regions. This report provides an overview of the scale and scope of development challenges in coastal aquatic agricultural systems, their significance for poor and vulnerable communities, and the opportunities for partnership and investment that support efforts of these communities to sec...Download Free PDFView PDFGender-transformative approaches to address inequalities in food, nutrition and economic outcomes in aquatic agricultural systems2014 • Silvia  SarapuraDownload Free PDFView PDFGetting beneath the surface in program planning, monitoring and evaluation: Learning from use of participatory action research and theory of change in the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural SystemsJeston LundaDownload Free PDFView PDFSocial and gender analysis report: Barotse Floodplain, Western Province,Zambia2015 • Festus ZuluThere is increasing awareness that integrating gender into development frameworks is critical for effective implementation of development strategies. In working to alleviate rural poverty, the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) recognizes that â€œbusiness as usualâ€ gender integration approaches will not deliver lasting and widespread improvements in agricultural productivity, poverty reduction and food security. In response, AAS operationalized a gender transformative approach. The approach is informed by conceptual frameworks that explicitly recognize the potent influence of social relations on creating and perpetuating gender inequalities. In this way, AAS aims to address the underlying causes of rural poverty and gender inequality in Zambiaâ€™s Barotse Floodplain, where people rely extensively on riverine and wetland ecosystems for food and livelihood security. A central question guiding the research program is â€œHow do social norms and gendered power ...Download Free PDFView PDFPlanning a nutrition-sensitive approach to aquatic agricultural systems research in Solomon Islands2015 • Joelle AlbertDownload Free PDFView PDFEcology and SocietyIdentifying opportunities to improve governance of aquatic agricultural systems through participatory action research2017 • Ram BastakotiDownload Free PDFView PDFCogent Food & AgricultureWorking towards an engagement turn to agricultural research in the Tonle Sap Biosphere, CambodiaRam BastakotiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
