The latest peril is the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic; it has especially serious consequences for tourism development.  Since the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004 the Southeast Asian economies have become increasingly integrated into those of East Asia; specifically, China’s contribution to tourism in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has grown exponentially.  In this paper some of the most significant literature on crises and tourism in Southeast Asia is examined, with a focus on the East Asian market  taking case material on the impacts of the pandemic on one particular part of Malaysia, the state of Sabah, which has enjoyed substantial success in  attracting Chinese and Korean tourists to northern Borneo. Some of the policy and practical responses to the effects on the tourism industry are also considered.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is our hope that this annual review acts as a forum for disseminating best practices, while also stimulating further research in the field of IEM.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The article suggests that consumer satisfaction can be measured by proposing a paradigm that adopts a behavioral and experiential perspective as an alternative to the confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm, rather than the expectancy disconfirmation paradigm that is predominantly employed in measures of consumer satisfaction. It argues that guest satisfaction in the ecolodge context is the consumption of experiences involved in both behavioral and comparison components. Building on Herzberg, underlying satisfaction and dissatisfaction dimensions are linked to job satisfaction in a way that is a function of two types of condition, known as hygiene factors (dissatisfiers), leading to the condition of dissatisfaction (prevention), and motivators (satisfiers), leading to a condition of satisfact...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The literature shows contradictions and gaps among theoretical propositions, empirical findings, and the realities of human resource management (HRM). Theoretical approaches and empirical studies state that effective HRM is essential, yet in actual practice and employment conditions, the importance of effective HRM is not reflected. Thus, this paper aims to determine the critical emerging issues that affect human resource practices and management in the current employment context, as well as proposes a sustainable human resource framework for the hotel industry. Data were collected via in-depth focus group interviews with 40 respondents from operational, supervisorial, and managerial positions in the Malaysia hotel industry.

For example; film The Beach (Thailand), Tomb Raider (Cambodia), Entrapment (Malaysia), Lord of The Rings trilogy (New Zealand), Harry Potter trilogy (UK) and others. Many of this destination has turned into a popular tourist attraction. However, film products to induce tourism can also be unpredictable.

Thus, this paper will analyze six of the characteristics of film products namely on location, off location, storyline, celebrity, film genres and film festivals. By understanding these characteristics of film products, this paper can help to increase a better understanding of the context of film products to induce tourism.
