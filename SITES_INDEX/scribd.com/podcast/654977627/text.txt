How would Jesus have us actually simplify our lives? How can embracing simplicity enrich our day to day experience? May your heart and mind be open to all the wisdom and goodness God has for you today. And may you find comfort in making Jesus your one necessary thing. Our Scripture for today comes from 2 Corinthians 1:12, and today's worship is  Simple Gospel by United Pursuit. --   Faith doesn’t happen on its own. It’s a byproduct of time spent experiencing the faithfulness of our God. It’s a gift given to us by the Giver of good gifts, himself.    It was a supernatural faith that allowed Paul to sing even while in chains. It was supernatural faith that allowed Peter to proclaim the gospel, even unto death. And it’s supernatural faith that will carry you to and through the greatest gospel opportunities in front of you.    We pray our printed devotionals, Faith and Trust, help people like you experience the life changing reality that faith and trust have on your everyday life.     With Faith you’ll:     Discover a Biblical framework for living faithfully Study powerful moments of God’s faithfulness in scripture Tear down personal strongholds in your life where you struggle with faith Develop a lifestyle of faith, that weathers the storms of life    And every dollar you give today goes to help more people like you experience the nearness and love of our God.   Everything changes when we learn to trust and become filled with faith in our good, good God.
