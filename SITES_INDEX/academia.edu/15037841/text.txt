These materials are often poorly characterized, and use of inappropriate specimens may result in erroneous conclusions regarding quality of laboratory data. Several techniques are described that characterize specimens used in the quality-control or calibration of laboratory procedures. A characteristic approach requires detailed study of a few fundamental characteristics of reference preparations-such as steady-state kinetic properties of an enzyme-and comparison with the same parameters determined for patient specimens. Descriptive techniques-ratio methods and the multivariate statistical procedure of correspondence analysis-are used for further description of the interactions of materials in a variety of assay methods. The applications of these procedures to two clinical analytes-theophylline and alkaline phosphatase-are described.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersClinical BiochemistryImpact of reference materials on accuracy in clinical chemistry1998 • Ferruccio CeriottiDownload Free PDFView PDFClinical chemistryCommutability of control materials in glycohemoglobin determinations1998 • Ferruccio CeriottiThe intermethod variabilities of control materials and patient blood samples for the measurement of glycohemoglobin were compared. Sets of 50 blood samples and 15 control materials were analyzed by HPLC and affinity and immunochemical methods. For each pair of methods, the distances of the materials from the regression line of patient blood results (expressed as normalized residuals) were calculated. Only two of 15 controls had normalized residuals exceeding 3 standard deviations from the regression line. Total hemoglobin (Hb) content, Hb derivatives, and cellulose acetate electrophoresis demonstrated that only a minority of controls could be considered similar to patients&#39; blood samples. We selected Menarini&#39;s and our home-prepared controls to simulate calibration of the different techniques by these materials. Intermethod calibration succeeded mostly in harmonizing results obtained by HPLC methods. On the contrary, calibration of the immunochemical techniques (Boehringer a...Download Free PDFView PDFClinical ChemistryCommutability of calibration andcontrol materials for serum lipaseGianlodovico D'ErilTo effectively assess and correct for intermethod variability, calibration and control materials (CCMs) must show the same intermethod behavior as patient sera, i.e., they must be commutable. We describe the commutability of selected CCMs for lipase assays, the impact of noncommutability of CCMs in normalizing patient results, and characteristics of reagents that affect assay specificity and commutability. Lipase was measured in 98 patient sera and in 29 commercial CCMs, with 2 commercial methods using different substrates and with 4 experimental methods using 1,2-o-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-(6&#39;-methylresorufin) ester as substrate and colipase as cofactor, but differing in the stabilizing proteins used and in the size of the substrate micelles. The noncommutability rate, i.e., the frequency of aberrant intermethod behavior of CCMs in comparison with patient sera, was 27% for liquid CCMs and 47% for lyophilized CCMs. The normalized residuals, measuring the degree of no...Download Free PDFView PDFClinical ChemistryCommutable Calibrator with Value Assigned by the IFCC Reference Procedure to Harmonize Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase Activity Results Measured by 2 Different Methods2008 • Ferruccio CeriottiDownload Free PDFView PDFClinical chemistryBehavior of frozen serum pools and lyophilized sera in an external quality-assessment scheme1995 • Ferruccio CeriottiTo further improve analytical accuracy in clinical chemistry, proficiency testing needs amelioration in the quality of materials tested and in target value assignment. To obtain information on the actual state-of-the-art in the Lombardy region of Italy, and to examine the behavior of different types of control materials (fresh-frozen human sera and lyophilized materials), we developed the following experimental design. Two human serum pools and two lyophilized sera were distributed to 32 laboratories for determination of glucose, creatinine, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT). Each analyte was measured in triplicate on each of 3 days. Target values for the controls were obtained with Reference Methods. The results show a good intralaboratory precision for every component but some accuracy problems for glucose, creatinine, cholesterol, and gamma-GT. Lyophilized materials showed some commutability problems for glucose, electrolytes, and gamma-GT, ...Download Free PDFView PDFResultswithPatients'SpecimensGary LensmeyerDownload Free PDFView PDFClinica Chimica ActaProduction and certification of an enzyme reference material for pancreatic α-amylase (CRM 476)1996 • Ferruccio CeriottiDownload Free PDFView PDFClinical chemistrySelection, preparation, and characterization of commutable frozen human serum pools as potential secondary reference materials for lipid and apolipoprotein measurements: study within the framework of the Dutch project "Calibration 20002002 • Christa CobbaertThe Dutch project &quot;Calibration 2000&quot; aims at harmonization of laboratory results via calibration by development of matrix-based secondary reference materials. We considered the selection, preparation, and characterization of 34 potential reference materials (PRMs). Sixteen PRMs were prepared either strictly according to the NCCLS C37-A protocol or in a less stringent and more convenient way. In addition, 18 commercial, so-called human serum-based calibrators or controls were purchased and tested. Lipoprotein integrity was evaluated by examining the physicochemical characteristics of the materials. Commutability of the PRMs was assessed in 86 Dutch clinical laboratories, using a multicenter split-patient-sample between-field-method (twin-study) design. Normalized residuals of the PRMs with respect to the patient regression lines were calculated; in addition, the extra contribution of each PRM to the total measurement uncertainty (CV(Netto)) was calculated.
