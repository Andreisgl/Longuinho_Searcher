The aim of this study is to assess the disturbance of thiamine and other B-vitamin status of patients with type 2 diabetes in Indonesia. One hundred and fifteen patients with type 2 diabetes with and without microalbuminuria or albuminuria and 39 healthy people were recruited. After a 2-month washout period for B-vitamin supplementation, markers of vitamins B(1), B(6), B(9) and B(12), were determined. Fractional excretion of thiamine (22.8 versus 33.5%; P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05) and urinary excretion of the vitamin B(6) degradation product 4-pyridoxic acid (0.081 versus 0.133 μmol/g creatinine, P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.001) was increased in patients with type 2 diabetes with respect to healthy controls. There was also increased total plasma cobalamin (398 versus 547 pmol/l, P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.001) and holotranscobalamin (74 versus 97 pmol/l, P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.001) in patients with type 2 diabetes. In multiple regression analysis these were linked to HbA1c, duration of diabetes and systolic blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose, folate and C-reactive protein, respectively. There was renal mishandling of thiamine, increased degradation of vitamin B(6) and cytosolic metabolic resistance to vitamin B(12) in patients with type 2 diabetes in Indonesia.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersReviewsVitamin B and its derivatives for diabetic kidney disease1996 • Rama WaliaDownload Free PDFView PDFDiabetologiaHigh prevalence of low plasma thiamine concentration in diabetes linked to a marker of vascular disease2007 • H. al-AliDownload Free PDFView PDFHandbook of Vitamins, 4th EditionTCHIEGANG ClergeDownload Free PDFView PDFDiabetes CareFasting and post-methionine homocysteine levels in NIDDM.
