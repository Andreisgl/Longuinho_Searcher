This article provides an edition, translation, and discussion of a petition housed among the Genizah documents of the Bodleian Library. The petition is addressed to Sitt al-Mulk, half-sister of the caliph al-Ḥākim (386–411/996–1021). While at least one chronicler mentions that Sitt al-Mulk received petitions, this is the first documentary evidence for that claim. It shows Sitt al-Mulk to have headed the Fatimid state between her brother's death and her own in 414/1023. Geoffrey Khan had previously identified two petitions, housed in Cambridge and New York, addressed to a Fatimid princess. It is likely that these, too, were addressed to Sitt al-Mulk. The article offers possible explanations as to why petitions such as this one, which concerns an Ismaili mosque, found their way to the Jewish community of Fustat whose members reused them and preserved them in the Geniza. It also suggests some broader conclusions about the dispersal, survival, or disappearance of pre-Ottoman Middle Eastern archives and documents.Download Free PDFView PDFCollective Petitions (ʿarż-ı maḥżār) as a Reflective Archival Source for Jerusalem's Networks of Citadinité at the End of 19th CenturyYasemin AvcıDownload Free PDFView PDFChronique d'EgypteA Second-Century AD Petition in the Cairo Collection2011 • Mohamed El-AshiryDownload Free PDFView PDF"Petitioning the Sultan"by Yuval Ben-BassatRoberto MazzaDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Middle East StudiesReview of BRINKLEY MESSICK, Sharı̄ ʿa Scripts: A Historical Anthropology (New York: Columbia University Press, 2018).2019 • Yavuz AykanDownload Free PDFView PDFMark R.

The reinstatement of parliamentary life, the reintroduction of the suspended constitution of 1876, and the lifting of the ban on the press and political action all generated profound political and social changes. Subjects' petitions reflected these changes vividly and in often surprising detail. As the sultan became a figurehead with little actual power, petitions which hitherto had been addressed to the sultan either directly or through the grand vizier and had requested his benevolence and mercy, while also granting him much needed legitimacy, now began to be sent instead to the Council of State (Şura-yı Devlet), the parliament, and various government ministries. Their content changed as well, as will be shown in this article through an analysis of dozens of petitions from Ottoman Palestine. Petitions now sought to obtain political rights and ensure civil equity and constitutional rights. In focusing on rights, the rule of law, and the deficiencies of the former system, the petitions echoed changes in popular discourse and mirrored the transformation from justice as a sultanic prerogative to constitutional and civil law.Download Free PDFView PDFPetitioning The Sultan: Table of Contents + IntroductionYuval Ben-BassatTable of Contents + Introduction of the Book: Petitioning the Sultan: Protests and Justice in Late Ottoman Palestine.
