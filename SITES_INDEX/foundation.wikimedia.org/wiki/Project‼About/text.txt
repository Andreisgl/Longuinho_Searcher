Welcome to the Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki, where the Wikimedia Foundation makes available to the public multiple types of governance and policy related materials.
Welcome
Thanks for being here!
This wiki does not exactly follow the same rules as the other Wikimedia projects, since it is not open to all for editing, and in case of disagreement, the mechanism for making decisions will be handled by the Wikimedia Foundation staff or Board of Trustees.
It is managed by Wikimedia Foundation staff and contractors, primarily within the Communications and Legal departments.
Scope
Main page: Wikimedia:Scope
This wiki makes publicly available multiple governance and policy related materials from the Wikimedia Foundation, such as:
Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees documentation, such as:
Minutes
Resolutions
Official Wikimedia Foundation documentation, such as:
Institutional knowledge documentation
Legal documentation
Organization policies and guidelines
Security documentation
It also stores the archives of the no longer actively used or maintained Foundation Wiki content.
Accounts on this wiki
Register account
Main page: Wikimedia:Accounts policy
In October 2021, all registered accounts on other Wikimedia project wikis got edit access to the talk and user pages of this wiki and became able to support translation of this wiki's content into languages other than English.
Editing on regular content pages is restricted to approved editor accounts.
Administrators on this wiki
Administrators previously included a variety of Foundation staff and non-Foundation volunteers. From May 2013, only Foundation board and staff members may be administrators on this site (though temporary adminship for non-Foundation personnel may be possible in certain cases).
Stewards and global sysops also have administrator rights on this wiki.
