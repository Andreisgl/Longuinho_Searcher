Altering a Homogenized Heritage: Articulating Heterogeneous Material Cultures in Norway and SwedenRequest PDFAltering a Homogenized Heritage: Articulating Heterogeneous Material Cultures in Norway and SwedenKjetil Fallan and Grace-Lees-Maffei (eds.), Designing Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalization (New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2016), pp. 172-187., 2016Kjetil FallanChristina ZetterlundAbstractThe Nordic countries are generally perceived as relatively egalitarian and homogenous societies, in terms of gender, class and race/ethnicity. On closer inspection, however, this image of uniformity starts to crack. The ethnic makeup of the Nordic nations has always been mixed, and is becoming ever more diverse. The Sami constitutes an indigenous population whose homeland cuts across national boundaries, and is considered a (state-less) nation in itself. There are also other older minorities in the region, such as Jews and Romani, as well as the kven population of Finnish decent in Norway and the Swedish population in Finland. Although they have only experienced significant non-European immigration relatively recently, the Nordic countries have now become multi-cultural societies with sizable diaspora from Africa, South America and Asia.
The material cultures of ethnic minorities, old and new, are rich and profoundly present in everyday life—from Sami language signage in the northern regions to hijab-wearing women everywhere, as well as in home-making practices where new, hybrid forms of design culture emerge. However, these elements of our environs are completely absent from Nordic design history. Even recent national survey histories, which have incorporated many of the critical and theoretical discourses in international design historiography, are mute on the subject of ethnic minorities. The absence of Sami material culture, which is largely craft-based and traditional, in Nordic design history may be partially due to design history’s preference for industrial manufacture and for aesthetic innovation in the modern sense. The absence of newer minorities’ material culture may also have to do with the bias towards production of commodities at the expense of more mediation- and consumption-oriented approaches.
Based on the premise that a more inclusive approach describing a more heterogeneous material culture will lead to a better design history, this chapter explores why Nordic design history has been so 'white' and what strategies can be devised for a more colourful future history. How can the nuances of minority material cultures be articulated and incorporated in new national design histories? Which topics, approaches and methods need to be adopted and developed to foster such new narratives? What role do national contexts play in framing these? How do we make the conceptual maps fit the empirical terrain of culturally heterogeneous modern nation states?
The minority populations of the Nordic countries might be small compared to those of other nations, but they are rapidly increasing both in number and percentage. At the same time, the majority populations are small in absolute numbers in a globalizing world. As minor majorities we should, therefore, recognize the importance of writing inclusive and nuanced design histories on a national and regional scale as contributions to a more global discourse.
