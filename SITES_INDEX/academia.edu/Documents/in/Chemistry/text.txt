These targets, and many conservation programs, require monitoring to assess progress toward specific goals. However, comprehensive and easily understood information on biodiversity trends at appropriate spatial scales is often not available to the policy makers, managers, and scientists who require it. We surveyed conservation stakeholders in three geographically diverse regions of critical biodiversity concern (the Tropical Andes, the African Great Lakes, and the Greater Mekong) and found high demand for biodiversity indicator information but uneven availability. To begin to address this need, we present a biodiversity &quot;dashboard&quot;--a visualization of biodiversity indicators designed to enable tracking o...Save to LibraryDownloadby Thomas Brooks•  11  Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, BiologyCross-Laboratory Experimental Study of Non-Noble-Metal Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction ReactionSave to LibraryDownloadby Iris Herrmann•  16  Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrochemistry, CatalysisCrystallization scale preparation of a stable GPCR signaling complex between constitutively active rhodopsin and G-proteinThe activation of the G-protein transducin (Gt) by rhodopsin (Rho) has been intensively studied for several decades.

It is the best understood example of GPCR activation mechanism and serves as a template for other GPCRs. The structure of the Rho/G protein complex, which is transiently formed during the signaling reaction, is of particular interest. It can help understanding the molecular details of how retinal isomerization leads to the G protein activation, as well as shed some light on how GPCR recognizes its cognate G protein. The native Rho/Gt complex isolated from bovine retina suffers from low stability and loss of the retinal ligand. Recently, we reported that constitutively active mutant of rhodopsin E113Q forms a Rho/Gt complex that is stable in detergent solution. Here, we introduce methods for a large scale preparation of the complex formed by the thermo-stabilized and constitutively active rhodopsin mutant N2C/M257Y/D282C(RhoM257Y) and the native Gt purified from bovine...Save to LibraryDownloadby Gebhard F X Schertler and +3Dmitry VeprintsevShoji MaedaMichael Hennig•  14  Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, BiologyEnzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids and Chemosystematic Significance of Polymethoxylated Flavonoids and Quinoline Alkaloids In Neoraputia ( …Save to LibraryDownloadby Paulo Cezar Vieira•  2  Chemistry, CHEMICAL SCIENCESPHYSICAL AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF Hedychium coronarium RHIZOMES AND STARCH CARACTERIZAÇÃO FÍSICA E FÍSICO-QUÍMICA DE RIZOMAS E AMIDO DO LÍRIO-DO-BREJO (Hedychium coronarium)O presente trabalho teve por objetivos avaliar a composição de rizomas do lírio-do-bejo (Hedychium coronarium) e isolar e caracterizar seu amido, por meio de análises físicas e físico-químicas.

A composição química dos grânulos de amido isolados dos rizomas também foi determinada, bem como o formato, tamanho, distribuição de tamanho de partícula por difração a laser, viscosidade de pasta em analisador rápido de viscosidade, poder de inchamento, índice de solubilidade em água, propriedade térmica por calorimetria diferencial de varredura e cristalinidade por difração de raios X. Observou-se que os rizomas apresentaram elevado teor de água e baixos teores de matéria graxa, carboidratos, cinzas, proteínas e fibras. Os rizomas de lírio-do-brejo apresentam-se inadequados para produção de amido, devido ao baixo teor de matéria seca (17,3%), com 21,97% de amido, bem como fibras longas e látex, que dificultam a extração do amido.

Bacterial and fungal kingdom exhibits mutual symbiosis that can offer advanced functionalities to these bionic architectures. Moreover, functional nanomaterials can serve as probing agents for accessing newer information from microbial organisms due to their dimensional similarities. In this article, a bionic mushroom was created by intertwining cyanobacterial cells with graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) onto the umbrella-shaped pileus of mushroom for photosynthetic bioelectricity generation. These seamlessly merged GNRs function as agents for mediating extracellular electron transport from cyanobacteria resulting in photocurrent generation. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) printing technique was used to assemble cyanobacterial cells in anisotropic, densely packed geometry resulting in adequate cell-population density for efficient collective behavior. These 3D printed cyanobacterial colonies resulted in comparatively higher photocurrent (almost 8-fold increase) than isotropically casted cyanobacteria of similar seeding density. An insight of the proposed integration between cyanobacteria and mushroom derives remarkable advantage that arises from symbiotic relationship, termed here as engineered bionic symbiosis. Existence of this engineered bionic symbiosis was confirmed by UV− visible spectroscopy and standard plate counting method. Taken together, the present study augments scientific understanding of multidimensional integration between the living biological microworld and functional abiotic nanomaterials to establish newer dimensionalities toward advancement of bacterial nanobionics.Save to LibraryDownloadby SUDEEP JOSHI•  7  Chemistry, Cyanobacteria, Nanotechnology, Additive ManufacturingThe Fitness for Purpose of Analytical MethodsThis document has been developed by a EURACHEM Working Group from a draft originally produced by LGC.

A microcellular plastic is a foamed polymer with a cell density greater than 109 cells/cm3 and fully grown cells smaller than 10 µm. Recent studies have shown that the morphology and crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers have a great influence on the solubility and diffusivity of the blowing agent and on the cellular structure of the resulting foam in microcellular batch processing. In this research, blends of HDPE and iPP were used to produce materials with variety of crystalline and phase morphologies to enhance the subsequent microcellular foaming. It was possible to produce much finer and more uniform foams with the blends than with neat HDPE and iPP. Moreover, the mechanical properties and in particular the impact strength of the blends were significantly improved by foaming.(citation # 293)Save to LibraryDownloadby Saeed  Doroudiani, PhD, P.Eng.•  10  Chemical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Physical ChemistryToxicological properties comparison between hypervalent iodine reagents and metals : effects on growth and photosynthesis of duckweed Lemna minorSave to Libraryby Baneenah Amharib•  3  Chemistry, Iodine, Lemna minorColor, Solubility, and Complex Ion Equilibria of Nickel (II) Species in Aqueous SolutionSave to LibraryDownloadby Fernanda Mora•ChemistryRevisiting special relativity: A natural algebraic alternative to Minkowski spacetimeMinkowski famously introduced the concept of a space-time continuum in 1908, merging the three dimensions of space with an imaginary time dimension $ i c t $, with the unit imaginary producing the correct spacetime distance $ x^2 - c^2... moreMinkowski famously introduced the concept of a space-time continuum in 1908, merging the three dimensions of space with an imaginary time dimension $ i c t $, with the unit imaginary producing the correct spacetime distance $ x^2 - c^2 t^2 $, and the results of Einstein's then recently developed theory of special relativity, thus providing an explanation for Einstein's theory in terms of the structure of space and time. As an alternative to a planar Minkowski space-time of two space dimensions and one time dimension, we replace the unit imaginary $ i = \sqrt{-1} $, with the Clifford bivector $ \iota = e_1 e_2 $ for the plane that also squares to minus one, but which can be included without the addition of an extra dimension, as it is an integral part of the real Cartesian plane with the orthonormal basis $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $. We find that with this model of planar spacetime, using a two-dimensional Clifford multivector, the spacetime metric and the Lorentz transformations follow immediately as properties of the algebra. This also leads to momentum and energy being represented as components of a multivector and we give a new efficient derivation of Compton's scattering formula, and a simple formulation of Dirac's and Maxwell's equations. Based on the mathematical structure of the multivector, we produce a semi-classical model of massive particles, which can then be viewed as the origin of the Minkowski spacetime structure and thus a deeper explanation for relativistic effects. We also find a new perspective on the nature of time, which is now given a precise mathematical definition as the bivector of the plane.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nicolangelo Iannella and +1Azhar Iqbal•  15  Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, BiologySDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-Page)Save to LibraryDownloadby Ed Rybicki•  4  Chemistry, Electrophoresis, SDS PAGE, PolyacrylamideEXPERIMENT 5: MOLAR CONDUCTIVITIES OF AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTESObjective: To determine the conductivity of various acid and the dissociation constant, a K for acetic acid 1 Theory 1.1 Electrical conductivity in solutions An electric current in solution is the result of the net movement of free ions... moreObjective: To determine the conductivity of various acid and the dissociation constant, a K for acetic acid 1 Theory 1.1 Electrical conductivity in solutions An electric current in solution is the result of the net movement of free ions in a specific direction. The current may be determined by measuring the resistance R between two similar inert electrodes immersed in the solution, as in the figure below where the oval region represents the solution; A represents the electrode area and l is the normal distance between the electrode planes. In actual practice an A.C. current with a low frequency of the order of approximately 1000 Hertz is used (to prevent electrolysis) in the measurement, and the components representing the resistance R in the complex impedance Z for the circuit is determined. We will always refer to this component (the real portion of the complex impedance) for what follows. The resistance is also dependent on the frequency (Debye-Falkenhagen effect). The theory and measurement here concentrates on low frequency measurements where the Onsager equation is meaningful. The fully automated measuring apparatus has been configured for low frequency measurement in accordance with the theory of electrolytes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Collins Madu•ChemistryFault Diagnosis of Gear Box by Using MCSA TechniqueAn efficient and new but non-intrusive method to detect the fluctuation in gear load may be the motor current signature analysis (MCSA).

In this paper, a multi-stage transmission gearbox (with and without defects) has been studied in order to replace the conventional vibration monitoring by MCSA. It has been observed through FFT analysis that low frequencies of the vibration signatures have sidebands across line frequency of the motor current whereas high frequencies of vibration signature are difficult to be detected. Hence, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested to decompose the current signal, and FFT analysis is carried out with the decomposed current signal to trace the sidebands of the high frequencies of vibrationSave to LibraryDownloadby Engineering Research Publication  and IJEAS•  18  Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Environmental EngineeringCerebellar afferent projections from the perihypoglossal nuclei: An experimental study with the method of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidaseSave to LibraryDownloadby Naiphinich Kotchabhakdi•  11  Chemistry, Medicine, Cats, CerebellumChemistry: A life in science and literatureSave to LibraryDownloadby Alison Abbott•  5  Psychology, Chemistry, Arts, MultidisciplinaryLaboratory Information Management SystemLaboratory Information System (LIS) streamlines workflow in the laboratory and eliminates time-consuming paperwork.

The business today is getting increasingly pressured to be more productive and efficient with less traditional resources. If we look at a typical production process, for instance, the level of automation and optimization that has permeated into the production floor is quite astounding. Many industries have had a tremendous impact in bringing to the market the automation and optimization solutions to streamline -the production floor. The other ends of the spectrum are the back-office transaction oriented processes like Inventory Management, Materials Management, Financials and so on, Therefore a lab’s ability to process data quickly and its ability to disseminate that information efficiently throughout the plant is vital for the success of the production process. Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) can help in managing the information flow within the lab and can be the modus operandi of connecting the lab with the rest of the organization. For instance, imagine all the information that is generated in a lab.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  17  Chemical Engineering, Pharmacology, Chemistry, Analytical ChemistryThe Secret Doctrine Volume IV, The Nature of EverythingPart I – Spirilla Theory and Cosmology Stephen Hawking once proclaimed that String Theory may be able to unify the various forces although later he became disillusioned thinking that there may be no Theory of Everything.

This very condensed book pulls together the various forces into the Spirilla Theory which supersedes String Theory and introduces the Relativity of Consciousness.The foundation of the Spirilla Theory is based on the writings of H. P. Blavatsky, A. B. Bailey, and A. Besant. By overlaying the works of Einstein, Bohm, de Broglie, Dirac, Bell and other great scientific minds, on top of the foundation, the unification of the various forces and theories starts to appear; each field of study supplying a part of the puzzle but only a holistic view of ALL endeavors will solve the mystery. The book starts by laying the groundwork through the Introduction, a review of Bell’s Theorem and p-adic mathematics; following this, each major section begins with a quote from the foundational works followed by the quotes from scientific papers demonstrating the current known thinking on the various topics; no attempts are made to edit the works (except with a few exceptions for clarity and/or length) of the various authors and references to the scientists’ works are maintained. Each section is pulled together so that a picture can be seen.This section;1.Redefines the atom with the addition of a subquark;2.Defines the Spirilla Theory which unifies Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, and explains Quantum Entanglement;3.Defines new particles;4.Redefines time and space;5.Defines and solves the mystery of Black Holes and links the cosmic and quantum black hole through the spirillae; 6.Delves into the mystery of the Macroverse;7.Outlines the steps in the origins of the universe;8.Adds an equation to Einstein’s original 1905 paper on relativity which sees the speed of light approaching infinity; 9.Gives the foundation for developing space travel; and, as an appendix,10.Gives detailed information for the development of a new energy source – Quantum Energy. Part II - Ontology, Epistemology & ManifestationsPart II is divided into three sections:1.Ontology and the fundamental concepts of reality which discusses:a.consciousness and delves into the mystery of human consciousness having cosmic origins;b.reincarnation and gives the various laws affecting rebirth, with a discussion on the principle of mutation and the perfecting of form;c.the work of form-building, transmutation of form and the building of a human form.2.Epistemology which covers a great deal of topics however; for the purposes of NOE the subject is restricted to;a.evolution including a definition of the Law of Evolution, the cyclic ebb and flow and the rhythmic work of creation, the process of substitution, the evolution of man and the genesis of the pithecoid stocks; and b.death including the processes of death, two main reasons for cremation and the sequence of events at death.3.Manifestations of the various religions including:a.why Christians don’t believe in reincarnation;b.the coming science of invocation and evocation;c.Quantum Entanglement Over Time (QEoT) or The Law of Cause and Effect, and The Law of Karma with a discussion on The Golden Rule ; andd.The New World Religion.Save to LibraryDownloadby Madonna-Megara Holloway•  32  P Adic Analysis, Quantum Physics, Chemistry, Space SciencesCHEMICAL AND MINERAL COMPOSITIONS OF WATER EXTRACTS OF ZOBO (Hibiscus sabdariffa)ABSTRACT This work was carried out to investigate the chemical/mineral composition of the water extract of zobo (Hibiscus sabdariffa) drink using the modern atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

With a few exceptions, metals are unstable in ordinaryaqueous environments. Certain environments offer opportunities for these metals tocombine chemically with elements to form compounds and return to their lower energylevels. Corrosion is the primary means by which metals deteriorate. Most metals corrode oncontact with water (and moisture in the air), acids, bases, salts, oils, aggressive metalpolishes, and other solid and liquid chemicals. Metals will also corrode when exposed togaseous materials like acid vapors, formaldehyde gas, ammonia gas, and sulfur containinggases. The production of oil and gas, its transportation and refining, and its subsequent useas fuel and raw materials for chemicals constitute a complex and demanding process.Various problems are encountered in this process, and corrosion is the major one. Sincemetals are the principal material suffering corrosive deterioration, it is important to developa background in the principles of metallurgy to fully understand corrosion. The control ofcorrosion through the use of coatings, metallurgy, nonmetallic materials for constructionscathodic protection and other methods has evolved into a science in its own right and hascreated industries devoted solely to corrosion control. Metallurgical factors that affectcorrosion are chemical composition, material structure, grain boundaries, alloying elements,mechanical properties, heat treatment, surface coating, welding and manufacturingconditions. Understanding these factors are of great importance to decrease and controlcorrosion problem in many industrial applications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Professor Dr. Loutfy H .

Metal objects that indicate social class differences, advancements in architecture, and finds that point to connections with distant regions all demonstrate that a political structure began to emerge in Anatolia during this period. Parallel to these developments, especially with the increase in interregional relations, the use of new vessels indicates a novelty in eating and drinking habits. Tankards, bell-shaped cups and depas amphikypellon stand out within this group and are referred to as the new drinking vessels. In addition to these, it is noteworthy that beakers or goblets, and also container amphorae started to become widespread. All these types are considered to be associated with new drinking habits, and the new drink type is suggested to be wine. However, the suggestions proposed regarding the use of these vessels are not supported by any archaeometric studies until now. In this study, we share results from total lipid extraction analyses (TLE) performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on a group of depa vessels from the archaeological site of Küllüoba located in Eskişehir, Turkey, and re-evaluate at the possible purposes of these vessels. Biomolecules such as fatty acids, salicylic acids, organic acids, hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, and herbal steroids identified as a result of these analyzes provided the first direct evidence of the use of fermented products such as wine and herbal analgesics in Early Bronze Age Anatolia. Additionally, we present the first archaeological data of the period and the region regarding the use of salicylic acid.Save to LibraryDownloadby Murat  Türkteki•  20  Archaeology, Prehistoric Archaeology, Chemistry, Anatolian ArchaeologyEvaluating agarwood products for 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones using direct analysis in real time time-of-flight mass spectrometrySave to LibraryDownloadby Cady Lancaster•  10  Earth Sciences, Chemistry, Mass Spectrometry, FlavonoidsSolutions Manual Organic Structures from 2D NMR Spectra 1st edition by Field & MagillDownload Solutions Manual Organic Structures from 2D NMR Spectra 1st edition by Field & Magill  PDFhttps://buklibry.com/download/solutions-manual-organic-structures-from-2d-nmr-spectra-1st-edition-by-field-magill/Save to LibraryDownloadby JuanC.

Honey samples were collected from several production seasons and following physicochemical parameters were determined: water content, electrical conductivity, pH value, free acidity, sugar content, diastase activity and HMF content. The results of electrical conductivity (0.155 - 0.456 mS/cm), free acidity (16.1 - 35.8 mEq/kg) and diastase activity (16.3 - 45.8) varied in a wide range. Fructose/glucose and glucose/water ratios indicate moderate crystallisation rate of the honey.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ljiljana Primorac•Chemistry“The Relationship of Motivation to Learn and Attitude Towards Chemistry on the Academic  Achievement of High School Chemistry Students,”Denila, Richard V.

Study show that they have the desire to learn the concepts and skills in chemistry. Collectively, the third year high school  students’  have  favorable  attitude  towards  chemistry.     The academic performance level of the of the third year students in high school chemistry is satisfactory. This indicates that the students are moderately competent in the knowledge and skills in chemistry. There is a statistically significant relationship between the third year students’ motivation to learn chemistry and their attitude towards chemistry. A statistically significant relationship exists between the third year students’ motivation to learn chemistry and their academic achievement in chemistry.  Statistically there is a significant relationship between the third year students’ attitude towards chemistry and their academic achievement in chemistry.Save to LibraryDownloadby Richard V Denila•  3  Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Organic ChemistryTwo package waterborne urethane systemsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jolanta Gurtat•  5  Chemistry, Collagen Cross-linking, Applications, PolyaminesNextLast »Related TopicsPhysical ChemistryFollowFollowingNanotechnologyFollowFollowingComputational ChemistryFollowFollowingAnalytical ChemistryFollowFollowingOrganic ChemistryFollowFollowingMaterials ScienceFollowFollowingTheoretical ChemistryFollowFollowingInorganic ChemistryFollowFollowingNanoscienceFollowFollowingCatalysisFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
