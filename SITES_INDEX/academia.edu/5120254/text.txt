ECHAM5 accurately reproduces the annual cycle of SD and correctly captures the timing of the snowmelt. ECHAM4, in contrast, simulates an excessive Eurasian snow mass in spring due to a delayed snowmelt. Annual cycles of continental snow cover area (SCA) are captured fairly well in both ECHAM4 and ECHAM5. The negative SCA trend observed during the last two decades of the twentieth century is evident also in the ECHAM5 simulation but less pronounced. ECHAM5 captures the interannual variability of SCA reasonably well, which is in contrast with results that were reported earlier for second-phase Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) models. An error analysis revealed that, for studies on SCA, it is essential to test the data records for their homogeneity and trends.
