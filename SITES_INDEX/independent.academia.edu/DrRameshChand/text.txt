Agricultural trade liberalization policies in India: Balancing producer and consumer interestsTwenty Years of India's Liberalisation,  2013India followed an inward-looking and highly protectionist trade policy in agriculture till early ... more India followed an inward-looking and highly protectionist trade policy in agriculture till early 1990s. Barring a few traditional commercial commodities, agricultural trade was subjected to measures like quantitative restrictions, canalization, licenses, quotas and high tariff rates. These measures strictly regulated imports and exports to safeguard domestic producers’ and consumers’ interests. In most commodities levels of export and import were determined by fluctuations in domestic supply and exports were residuals. Similarly, imports were allowed with fall in domestic production to fill the gap between domestic demand and supply. The production pattern was strictly guided by domestic requirement and self sufficiency in almost all major commodities. Allocation of resources based on comparative advantage in trade did not get much emphasis. This scenario started changing with economic reforms of 1991. External trade was further liberalised with the implementation of WTO Agreement on Agriculture in 1995. The process was accelerated after India lost the dispute in WTO to retain Quantitative Restrictions (QRs) on ground of Balance of PaymentSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Agricultural marketing in India suffers from inefficiency, a disconnect between the prices received by producers and the prices paid by consumers, fragmented marketing channels, poor infrastructure and policy distortions. Urgent reforms are needed to address these inadequacies and check the excesses of middlemen. While encouraging new models that improve the bargaining power of producers and scaling up successful experiments, producers’ companies and cooperative marketing societies could be promoted to provide alternative avenues for sale of produce. Meanwhile, price policy has to be reoriented to bring it in tune with the emerging demand and supply of various crops. Though the private sector is vital to improving efficiency, the public sector is equally essential to serve the larger social goal of maintaining price stability through market operations. In a narrow sense, the role of agricultural markets is delivering products from sources to consumers. But, in a broad sense, their role extends to transmitting macroeconomic signals to producer fi rms, providing incentives to producers to attain the desired growth in agri-food output, improving the welfare of producers and consumers, balancing demand and supply, and promoting the effi cient use of resources in the production and distribution systems. These roles require a competitive environment, strong physical and institutional infrastructure, and a favourable regulatory system. These conditions cannot come up on their own, particularly in a developing country like India. Therefore, agricultural market policies are treated as an integral part of development policies and their functioning has remained an important part of public policy in India. This paper discusses various policies related to agricultural markets since the early 1960s, a time when major steps were taken for their transformation. It analyses how these policies have performed and their relevance, given changing production and consumption patterns, and technological and commercial developments.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A multi-pronged strategy to permanently deal with monsoon deficiency requires exploring newer drought tolerant and climate-conducive crop varieties, enhancing employment opportunities to non-poor households, and developing a new model that improves the efficacy of the IMD forecast.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
