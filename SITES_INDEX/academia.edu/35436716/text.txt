This programme of work sought to understand what form of curatorial model and interpretative framework could generate new artworks and co-produce interdisciplinary knowledge across areas of specialist research and geopolitical urgency. The projects take the form of exhibitions, texts and edited books, which are presented as the portfolio of work. The selected projects are: Malamp UK, Brandon Ballengée (2007-2010); Arctic Perspective Initiative (2009-2011); ITACCUS – IAF Technical Activities Committee on the Cultural Utilisation of Space – and associated activities (2007-2014); Holoturian, Ariel Guzik (2013-2015); and Wrecked on the Intertidal Zone, YoHa, Critical Art Ensemble, et al. (2013-2016). Through analysis of and reflection on the projects, this commentary proposes a curatorial model of interdisciplinary co-inquiry, which can foster an ecology of practices, enabling curators, artists, scientists, specialist experts and people with situated expertise to coproduce knowledge around matters of concern, particularly relating to human-environment interaction and common and extraterritorial spaces. It examines the roles of the curator in this model and how these might differ from those commonly understood as established curatorial practice. The commentary further presents an interpretative and tactical framework of the planetary commons for curating art-led projects in the realm of ecopolitical concerns, that can engage audiences and publics with the art and ideas emerging from this co-inquiry approach. The combination of curatorial model and interpretative and tactical framework contribute to discourses on both inter/trans-disciplinarity and the role of art in relation to the politics of ecology. The Ph.D. contributes to the field on several levels. Within curatorial studies, the interdisciplinary co-inquiry model reconfigures curatorial practice as a collective, inquiry-driven, knowledge-producing practice, and provides a useful methodology for inter-/trans-disciplinary artistic practice in relation to the politics of ecology, while the framework of the planetary commons proposes direction and allows for investment in reciprocity through commoning practices. Beyond contemporary art, a curatorial co-inquiry model deepens and alters existing approaches for listening to, valuing, and synthesising different types of knowledge and expertise around current environmental and related social concerns. While the commentary argues for the planetary commons framework within the contemporary art space, there are wider implications for it as a complement and alternative to the dominant interpretative framework of the Anthropocene.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersArt JournalCrash: Specters of Colonialism in Contemporary Indigenous Art2017 • kate morrisDownload Free PDFView PDFCreative Responses to Sustainability Berlin GuideYasmine  OstendorfDownload Free PDFView PDFNot Quite in Love with Japan: Perceptions of Contemporary Japanese Fashion in Australia2018 • Tets KimuraSince the international debut of the ‘big three’ Japanese fashion designers, Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo, almost 40 years ago, Japanese fashion has established its strong presence in the global fashion arena. Australia is not the most fashion-conscious country, due to its laid-back culture and its distance from international fashion capitals such as Paris and New York, but by the early 00s, as Yuniya Kawamura notes, Japanese fashion is shown in a positive light in Australian boutiques. Australia is even home to Akira Isogawa, the Kyoto-native designer, who was chosen as one of the six best Australian fashion designers at the 2005 Australian Legends stamps collection. Japanese fashion designers are well-known for challenging the established Western discourse of fashion, for example, by avoiding vivid colours, employing new synthetic materials such as polyester and applying traditional Japanese folding techniques as seen in the kimono and origami to present modern two-dimensional designs. My analysis of Australian fashion magazines suggests that Japanese fashion items are well accepted by Australians. To a degree, this evidence is also supported by qualitative interviews I conducted both in Australia and Japan with professionals in the world of fashion, including designers, journalists and retailers. However, the interview findings from Australian participants reveal that they do not necessarily find Japanese fashion better than that from other countries. Japanese fashion is only attractive because it is different. Japan’s alternative designs are not winning over the hearts of the Australian people.Download Free PDFView PDFEle Carpenter,  The Nuclear Anthropocene.Ele CarpenterSummary of lecture on nuclear culture and the nuclear anthropocene, keynote lecture, Fluid Encounters between Art & Science Conference, BildMuseet, October 2014.Download Free PDFView PDF« Le mysticisme et la religion des Incas dans le dessin cosmologique de Pachacuti Yamqui ».

The approach originates out of examining audience responses to two exhibitions of digital art that I have curated on this topic and discerning that audiences require particular forms of care to support their encounter with the complex dialogues about mental distress that are presented. Out of this process I evolve a psychosocial approach to curatorial practice. Psychosocial studies is an emergent field of enquiry that differs from clinical paradigms because it understands the mind and society as fundamentally entwined — allowing for interpretation of the mental health impacts of technology as a product of cultural and economic conditions. Object relations psychoanalysis is one of the theoretical linchpins of the psychosocial field and is used within my research as a means of theorising and designing curatorial care for audiences encountering digital art that deals with mental distress. This process hinges upon the application of an innovative psychosocial audience research method called the visual matrix which was devised by Professor Lynn Froggett (Froggett et al. 2014) to capture complex emotive responses to aesthetic experience. Over the course of the study, the theoretical grounding of the visual matrix in object relations psychoanalysis has unfolded not just as an influence on my evaluative methodology, but as a discursive tool that shapes my entire approach to curatorial knowledge. The methods proposed fill a knowledge gap in the curatorial field, where little attention has been given to methods and practices of curatorial care for audiences encountering artwork that deals with psychological distress. The study is based on two iterative case studies—an international group exhibition and a solo show—allowing for exploration of the research questions across two different curatorial modalities. Case study one, Group Therapy: Mental Distress in a Digital Age, features 13 international artists and explores the relationship between personal wellbeing and the technological systems that structure contemporary culture. The concept of containment is borrowed from object relations psychoanalysis and is used to curate an exhibition environment that supports audiences in their psychological processing of experiences of being anxious and overwhelmed that arise in the exhibition. Case study two, Are We All Addicts Now?, is a solo exhibition by Katriona Beales shown at Furtherfield, London, which explores the emerging diagnostic territory of internet addiction. In this case study, the concept of holding is borrowed from object relations psychoanalysis to theorise ways of supporting audiences through the shifting subjective states that they experience in response to artworks that deal with the habit-forming nature of digital interfaces.Download Free PDFView PDFOn CuratingSome Theoretical and Empirical Aspects on the Decolonization of Western Collections2017 • marie-laure allain bonillaDownload Free PDFView PDFArt and the Uncanny (organization by Gerry Kisil)On the Uncanny in the Encounter between the Living and the Inanimate in Performed Immobility.pdf2017 • Mélanie BoucherIn The Uncanny, Freud undertook to determine the sources of this feeling by referring to Jentsch’s work, the conclusions of which he contradicts. e feeling of the uncanny that arises from the short story The Sandman by Ho mann would not be due to the object, which one endows with a soul, but rather to the set of choices made by the author, which would explain why the same object can appear, or not, to be uncanny depending on the context. ough they are not as such a source of the uncanny, the representations that blur the distinction between the living and the inanimate appear to be a favoured vehicle to stimulate this feeling, as is borne out by several examples from literature and the visual arts. Horst Bredekamp describes these representations as “living images,” which he classi es into three groups. For this presentation, we will draw on the group of schematic images, and more speci cally the tableaux vivants that make it up. We will study a selection of performances carried out from the mid 1990s to today in which the performers’ immobility draws an operative force from the tableau vivant. The use that is made of inaction and movement will be examined in order to envision how the indetermination that is thereby created fosters a feeling of the uncanny. In his study on the movement of statues, Kenneth Gross for his part suggests that the encounter between human life and the world of objects serves to go beyond systems of opposites and to ensure a survival of life in death. Following Gross, we could thus put forward that the performances under study, in which individuals remain inactive, make up a way of embodying opposites and death by picturing, at least a partial, deliverance from it.Download Free PDFView PDFDecolonizing Art InstitutionsDorothee I RichterIssue 35: Decolonizing Art Institutions Edited by Ronald Kolb & Dorothee Richter www.on-curating.org/issue-35.html With contributions by Sabih Ahmed, Marie-Laure Allain Bonilla, Binna Choi, Eyal Danon, Claire Farago, Yolande van der Heide, Nkule Mabaso, Same Mdluli, Shaheen Merali, Ivan Muñiz-Reed, Shwetal Patel, Rohit Jain, Raqs Media Collective, Dorothee Richter, Sophie Vögele and Philippe Saner, Woon Tien Wei, Sophie J Williamson, Claire Wintle, Michelle Wong Oncurating Issue 35 compiles the outcome of the symposium at the Kunstmuseum Basel and a summer academy at the Zurich University of the Arts.
