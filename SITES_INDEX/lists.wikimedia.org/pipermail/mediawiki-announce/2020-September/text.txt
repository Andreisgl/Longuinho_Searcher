[MediaWiki-announce] Announcing MediaWiki 1.35.0

I am happy to announce the belated availability of the general release of
MediaWiki 1.35!
Tarballs have already been uploaded, and the git tag has been pushed.
Thanks to everyone who helped out with this release, especially thanks to
those who tested out the release candidates and provided feedback, as well
as the developers who worked hard to get several important fixes merged in
time for the 1.35 final release. To see what's changed in 1.35, see the
release notes below.
Please note that the PHP version requirement has been raised from 7.2.9 in
MediaWiki 1.34 (and 7.0 in MediaWiki 1.31), to 7.3.19.
MediaWiki 1.35 is an LTS and is due to be supported until the end of
September 2023.
As a reminder, 1.31 is due to become end of life in June 2021. 1.34 is due
to become end of life in November 2020.
As per the pre-release announcement, 1.35.0 also includes some security
fixes that weren't in the release candidates, which came out yesterday for
the ther supported MediaWiki branches.
Known/outstanding issues:
* VisualEditor and Parsoid are now bundled in the tarball and no longer
need a separate Node.js service. The documentation for this still may still
require some updates. Please report any bugs [2] if this affects you.
* (T259685) Zeroconf (zero-configuration) VisualEditor/Parsoid doesn't work
using SQLite as the database backend for MediaWiki. This is due to the lack
of write concurrency in SQLite. If you wish to use this feature, it is
recommended to use MySQL/MariaDB rather than SQLite.
* Watchlist expiry (behind the $wgWatchlistExpiry flag) is currently still
experimental. It should become stable in a later point release. Please
report any issues/bugs [3].
== Security fixes ==
* (T232568, CVE-2020-25813) SECURITY: SpecialUserrights: If a viewer lacks
`hideuser`, ignore hidden users.

* (T258763, CVE-2020-17367, CVE-2020-17368) SECURITY: Prevent invoking
firejail's --output functionality.
* (T86738, CVE-2020-25814) SECURITY: mediawiki.jqueryMsg: Sanitize URLs and
'style' attribute.
* (T115888, CVE-2020-25828) SECURITY: mediawiki.js: Escape HTML in
mw.message( ... ).parse().
