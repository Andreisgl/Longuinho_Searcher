Developing Program Performance Measures for Rural Emergency Medical ServicesPrehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,  Jan 16, 2016The development of measures to monitor and evaluate the performance and quality of emergency medi... more The development of measures to monitor and evaluate the performance and quality of emergency medical services (EMS) systems has been a focus of attention for many years. The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program (Flex Program), established by Congress in 1997, provides grants to states to implement initiatives to strengthen rural healthcare delivery systems, including better integration of EMS into those systems of care. Building on national efforts to develop EMS performance measures, we sought to identify measures relevant to the rural communities and hospitals supported by the Flex Program. The measures are intended for use in monitoring rural EMS performance at the community level as well as for use by State Flex Programs and the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) to demonstrate the impact of the Flex Program. To evaluate the performance of EMS in rural communities, we conducted a literature search, reviewed research on performance measures conducted by key EMS ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The strategy is relatively new, and little is known about TPN structure, implementation, or operation. In this article, we present findings about tiered provider networks developed from a national survey of health plans and from interviews with health plan executives, their employer clients, and providers in their networks.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We use Medicaid claims and enrollment data to measure these outcomes. The reimbursement changes included substantial percentage changes in fees, however the value of the Medicaid fee improvements relative to the private market eroded very rapidly in the months following the interventions. Although the fee increases did not improve the outcome measures, they might have prevented conditions from worsening.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article reports on the evaluation of a demonstration in 10 rural communities to improve the safety of nursing facility (NF) transfers to hospital emergency departments by forming interprofessional teams of hospital, emergency medical service, and NF staff to develop and implement tools and protocols for standardizing critical interfacility communication pathways and information sharing. We worked with each of the 10 teams to document current communication processes and information sharing tools and to design, implement, and evaluate strategies/tools to increase effective communication and sharing of patient information across settings. A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate changes from baseline in documentation of patient information shared across settings during the transfer process.

Program effectiveness was evaluated through measures of changes in clients&#39; personal and community living skills. Medicaid and other data were used to establish individual and aggregate costs. It was found that the waiver program is a cost-effective alternative to intermediate care placements but that client screening is necessary to limit the enrollment of clients not at risk of institutional placement.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The chief executive officers (CEOs) and/or key managers responsible for patient safety activities in a diverse group of 29 small and rural hospitals assessed the potential effectiveness and feasibility of the 26 interventions. Representatives of 25 hospitals participated in structured, follow-up phone discussions. Adverse drug events were the highest-priority area for 14 hospitals, followed by patient falls (selected by 5 hospitals). Some hospitals had already implemented intervention 1 (use at least two patient identifiers) and intervention 6 (read back of verbal orders) and thus ranked them highly, especially for implementability. Intervention 3 (24-hour pharmacist coverage) was ranked low, especially on implement...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
