We then hypothesize that the flexibility of the species "biogeochemical niche" will influence the quality of plant tissue, which may have implications for herbivores, and will affect the species capacity to respond to disturbances and climate change and to adapt to the new climate conditions. We show with a simple multivariate procedure, a principal component analysis (PCA), first, that there is a strong differentiation in the total and relative (stoichiometry) content of the different elements in coexisting plant species, and, second, that there is species-specific plasticity in the response of this elemental composition to experimental climate change. The concentrations of foliar macro and micronutrients, as well as...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEcosystemsEffects of Plant Growth Characteristics on Biogeochemistry and Community Composition in a Changing Climate1999 • Göran ÅgrenDownload Free PDFView PDFChemosphereWarming and drought change trace element bioaccumulation patterns in a Mediterranean shrubland2008 • Josep  PenuelasDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of  …Endemic plant communities on special soils: early victims or hardy survivors of climate change?2012 • Barbara Fernandez-GoingDownload Free PDFView PDFPlant EcologyClimate and taxonomy underlie different elemental concentrations and stoichiometries of forest species: the optimum “biogeochemical niche”2014 • Jordi SardansDownload Free PDFView PDFClimatePreface: Climate Change Impact on Plant Ecology2020 • Alessio CollaltiClimate change likely represents the major modifying agents of functional and structural processes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Its importance lies in the fact that the space-time dynamics through which it acts on environmental systems are scale dependent and, consequently, the responses are also dependent on the space scale. Writing, therefore, on the impact of climate change on the ecology of plant species is certainly a tremendous-highly timely-challenge. This is also given the huge collection of studies that have analysed the consequences of climate change as specific effects on plant species and plant communities. Many studies have been conducted so far on the alteration of primary productivity, which is so important in the economic evaluation of the effects of climate change on agricultural species, but also on forest ecosystems, where the damage caused by environmental pollution has also been exacerbated by sudden changes of climatic parameters. As a consequence of the, only apparently, chaotic behaviour of the climate, the effects on photosynthetic activity and primary productivity are different at the various latitudes and longitudes of the planet. In fact, globally, greening trends (the increased photosynthetic activity in vegetation over time) have significantly increased over the last two-three decades by 22%-33%, particularly over China, India, many parts of Europe, central North America, southeast Brazil, and southeast Australia [1]. This also results from a combination of direct factors, i.e., land use and management, forest conservation, and expansion, and other indirect factors, i.e., increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and its relative fertilisation effect, extended growing season, global warming, nitrogen deposition, and an increase in diffuse radiation [2-5]. Such factors are, to a variable extent, linked to human activities. Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) are a significant net source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing to about 23% of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) combined as CO2 equivalents in 2007-2016. AFOLU results in both emissions and removals of CO2, CH4, and N2O to and from the atmosphere. These fluxes are affected simultaneously by natural and human drivers, making it difficult to separate natural from anthropogenic fluxes. The total net land-atmosphere flux of CO2 on both managed and unmanaged lands very likely provided a global net removal from 2007 to 2016 according to models of-6.0 ± 3.7 Gt CO2 yr-1 [6]. This net removal is comprised of two major components: (i) modelled net anthropogenic emissions from AFOLU are 5.2 ± 2.6 Gt CO2 yr-1 driven by land cover change, including deforestation and afforestation/reforestation, and wood harvesting (accounting for about 13% of total net anthropogenic emissions of CO2); and (ii) modelled net removals due to non-anthropogenic processes are 11.2 ± 2.6 Gt CO2 yr-1 on managed and unmanaged lands [7], driven by environmental changes such as increasing CO2, nitrogen deposition and changes in climate (accounting for the removal of 29% of the CO2 emitted from all anthropogenic activities: fossil fuel, industry, and AFOLU). The responses of vegetation and soil organic carbon (SOC) to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change are not well constrained by observations.
