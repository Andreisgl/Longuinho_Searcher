ReproductionThe reproductive cycle of a species implies a set of physiological and behavioural processes infl... more The reproductive cycle of a species implies a set of physiological and behavioural processes influenced by various factors in the abiotic and biotic environment. Traditionally a distinction is made between gametogenesis and spawning. Gametogenesis is the physiological process involved in gonad development that leads to the formation of gametes (oocytes and spermatozoa). In tropical regions, gametogenesis is controlled by tiny changes in environmental factors, and its duration varies according to species (Munro, 1990). Spawning is the critical moment of the reproductive cycle, which includes the sequence of events that leads to laying of the gametes (maturation of oocytes, ovulation, spermiogenesis), under the influence of specific stimuli (Billard &amp; Breton, 1978).Gametogenesis is the longest of these processes. It generally lasts several months, but reproductive success depends to a large extent on the success of a set of behavioural activities. These include the search for partners, parental care before and after spawning, whether or not migration is required to find suitable sites for eggs and larvae, synchronization of spawning with changes in environmental factors, synchronization of the genital products laying, etc. These activities may be accompanied by a set of phenological adaptations, such as the development of secondary sexual characters with regard to morphology or colouring.The study of the fish reproductive cycle thus requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves ecologists, physiologists, ethologists, and geneticists. Coordinating all these disciplines is not always a straightforward affair, and explains why data is often fragmentary. Yet we need studies that include them if we want to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between environmental factors, physiological processes, and reproductive behaviour of speciesSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is a biological heritage, the product of a long history of evolution, marked by periods during which life diversified, but also punctuated by dramatic events and major “disasters” that led to the extinction of many species.Knowledge on the speciation processes for African fishes have seen much progress in recent years, thanks mainly to advances in molecular biology as well as international attention focussing on the East African Great Lakes, where hundreds of endemic Cichlidae species are threatened by extinction even as they represent a unique model for the study of speciationSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At various timescales, certain basins were colonized from other basins, and such colonizations were sometimes followed by selective extinctions resulting from geological and/or climatic events. The genesis and continued existence of aquatic habitats depend on two main factors: their morphology, which may change over the long term as a result of erosion or tectonics; and their hydrologic budget, which is dependent on precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, and for which slight changes may lead in the short or medium-term to either the drying out or expansion of the aquatic milieu in question, depending on the basin’s shape. Simultaneously, some species were able to give rise to others, and these speciation events often explain the presence of centres of endemism.Biogeography is the discipline that seeks to explain the distribution of organisms and the relationships between the areas of distribution of different species, by attempting to reconstruct the series of events that led to the present situation. To describe the relationships between the establishment of faunas and the spatio-temporal history of the physical systems, scientists need to draw up the most exhaustive inventories possible for different regionsSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Urgent measures must be taken to conserve these ecosystems particularly with regard to fishes, which represent an especially rich and diverse evolutionary heritage. Fishes were long unaffected by human activity on the African continent, but anthropogenic pressure has increased in recent decades. Good management of African continental waters is thus of paramount importance in terms of heritage and economics, as fishes are a vital natural resource for the people in sub-Saharan Africa. In view of biodiversity conservation, African fishes are investigated here as a biological model owing to their enormous ecological and genetic diversity. It is essential to know the ecology and structure of various communities, and to understand the impact of human activity. This book discusses the diversity of environments, the origin and evolution of species, survival and adaptive strategies, the structure of fish communities, and the impact of human activity. It also devotes a section to fisheries and fish culture. This ambitious project summarizes the current state of knowledge on African fishes and their populations, highlighting the mechanisms regulating their equilibrium and the causes contributing to their erosion. It is a reference not just for readers involved in African aquatic environments, but for anyone interested in biodiversity conservation in generalSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cette espèce est en effet présente dans tous les milieux aquatiques de l'Afrique sahélo-soudanienne où elle cohabite avec les autres espèces, sans poser de problèmes particuliers. Rechercher les causes de la prolifération de la perche du Nil, nécessite de s'intéresser au fonctionnement du système écologique luimême, afin de tenter d'identifier les facteurs qui pourraient être à l'origine de cette prolifération.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
