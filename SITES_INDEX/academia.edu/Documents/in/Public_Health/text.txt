A number of studies have documented the devastating impact on the public and especially public mental health. Health care systems in low- and lower-middle income countries that are frequently already challenged by the existing mental health services gap cannot provide the necessary care for those displaced by war with existing services. This is especially the case in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) after the invasion of the terror organization ISIS in 2014. Most projects in post-conflict areas focus on short term basic psychological services and do not contribute to sustainable long-term capacity building of mental health services. An “Institute for Psychotherapy and Psychotraumatology” was therefore founded in order to train local specialists on a professional level with evidence-based methods adapted to culture and create sustainable long-term structures for psychotherapeutic treatment in the KRI.

Here we provide a systematic analysis of the occurrence of NORM ((232)Th, (228)Ra, (238)U, (226)Ra, and (210)Pb) in coals and associated CCRs from the Illinois, Appalachian, and Powder River Basins. Illinois CCRs had the highest total Ra ((228)Ra + (226)Ra = 297 ± 46 Bq/kg) and the lowest (228)Ra/(226)Ra activity ratio (0.31 ± 0.09), followed by Appalachian CCRs (283 ± 34 Bq/kg; 0.67 ± 0.09), and Powder River CCRs (213 ± 21 Bq/kg; 0.79 ± 0.10). Total Ra and (228)Ra/(226)Ra variations in CCRs correspond to the U and Th concentrations and ash contents of their feed coals, and we show that these relationships can be used to predict total NORM concentrations in CCRs. We observed differential NORM volatility during combustion that results in (210)Pb enrichment and (210)Pb/(226)Ra r...Save to LibraryDownloadby halmat hassan•  19  Geography, Environmental Science, Chemistry, CombustionABAFOR: A Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Architecture for Efficient Contact Tracing and GIS AnalysisThe Coronavirus disease 2019 has manifested into a global pandemic spreading into almost all the countries and territories in the world.

Contact tracing, followed by testing and isolation, have been identified as important tools in containing the proliferation of the disease. Because of manual contact tracing limitations, smartphone apps for digital contact tracing have been deployed by authorities in multiple countries. However, many of these apps have faced criticism because of interoperability, privacy and security issues. This paper proposes an open architecture based on blockchain technology that addresses some of these criticisms. It enables interoperability through a publicly-readable consortium blockchain database, preserving privacy by distributing users’ partial identities among multiple decentralised authorities and providing security through digital signature and asymmetric key encryption. In addition, the architecture provides a fast proof-of-authority based consensus a...Save to LibraryDownloadby muhammad nazir abubakar•  11  Computer Science, Information Security, Architecture, Computer SecurityManaging and assembling population-scale data streams, tools and workflows to plan for future pandemics within the INFORM-Africa ConsortiumSave to LibraryDownloadby sunday oladejo•MultidisciplinaryData sharing: A Long COVID perspective, challenges, and road map for the futureSave to LibraryDownloadby sunday oladejo•MultidisciplinaryThe effect of alcohol and drug testing at the workplace on individual’s occupational accident riskSave to LibraryDownloadby Valter  Vairinhos•  15  Engineering, Surprise, Injury Prevention, Suicide preventionNutritional concepts of health promotion in sub urban community: focus on obesity and hypertensionMany obese and hypertensive individuals reside in suburban areas with poor health infrastructure and low levels of public awareness.

The adult morbidity and mortality rates are currently being dominated by diet-related non-communicable diseases like obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome in various countries. Applying both individualized and community-based health promotion strategies can result in the prevention and control of obesity and hypertension. This study examined the role of nutrition in promoting good health, preventing and treating obesity and hypertension in suburban areas. The prevalence of diet-related non-communicable diseases has been notably reduced as a result of health promotion programs. A diet high in dietary fiber, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils, and nuts (in moderation) has been promoted.

At the time of writing, one half of the world’s population has been asked to stay home and avoid many public places. What will be the long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public space once the restrictions have been lifted? The depth and extent of transformation is unclear, especially as it relates to the future design, use and perceptions of public space. This article aims to highlight emerging questions at the interface of COVID-19 and city design. It is possible that the COVID-19 crisis may fundamentally change our relationship with public space. In the ensuing months and years, it will be critical to study and measure these changes in order to inform urban planning and design in a post-COVID-19 world.Save to LibraryDownloadby Erick Villagomez•  16  Political Science, Urban Planning, Public Health, Public SpaceCuidado coordenado em um programa de telemonitoramento pós-alta hospitalarO telemonitoramento é utilizado em um serviço de saúde suplementar como ferramenta para continuidade no tratamento do paciente pós-alta.

In this study, we integrated genomic and travel data to investigate the emergence and spread of the B.1.1.318 and B.1.525 variants of interest in Nigeria and the wider Africa region. By integrating travel data and phylogeographic reconstructions, we find that these two variants that arose during the second wave emerged from within Africa, with the B.1.525 from Nigeria, and then spread to other parts of the world. Our results show how regional connectivity in downsampled regions like Africa can often influence virus transmissions between neighbouring countries.

Ethiopia is one of the Sub-Saharan African countries with a high unmet need for contraceptives. Contraception is a good indicator of the extent to which couples have access to reproductive health services. A study on contraceptives can provide overall direction by helping to identify the obstacles in society and weaknesses in services that need to be overcome. However, little is known in Amhara region context. Therefore, this analysis was aimed to assess modern contraceptive use and influencing factors in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia. Methods.

In an academic sphere today modernity theory relies on the key idea of rationalization to give explanation on the distinctiveness of the modern societies. The rationales for creating fresh federal and state capital cities in the third world especially Nigeria is to accomplish national ambition of a modern capital as a sign of state identity.

Aim and Objectives: The present study was conducted to assess BODE index and GOLD severity staging (based on FEV1) in stable COPD patients, and to assess the utility of BODE index and GOLD severity staging in predicting acute exacerbations and their outcomes in the following one year. It is a hospital based prospective observational study done from September 2014 to November 2016 at Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases, Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. Results:100 stable COPD patients were enrolled and were followed up for a period of one year or until their death whichever was earlier. 6 patients were lost to follow-up. Out of 94 patients; 23.40% had a BODE index of 0-2, 28.72% had a BODE index of 3-4, 20.21% had a BODE index of 5-6 and 27.67% had a BODE index of 710.

Psychological responses are thus of vital importance to disease prevention. While the stress of a pandemic has been associated to many psychological symptoms, these symptoms have not been systematically explored in a broader sociopolitical context. Psychological responses may be linked to the perceptions of health professionals and may also relate to trust in public institutions. As such, psychopathology is not only a consequence of stress associated with pandemics but rather, the result of an interplay of personal and sociopolitical contexts. This study showed that members of the general population are experiencing significant symptoms of psychological distress. Regression analyses showed that psychological distress was associated with negative attitudes towards healthcare professionals as well as distrust in public he...Save to LibraryDownloadby Laura V Sanchez-Vincitore•  5  Psychology, Public Health, Population, DistrustComorbidity Indices Based On Health-Related Quality Of Life Are More Strongly Associated With Patient Outcomes Than Mortality-Based IndicesSave to LibraryDownloadby Regina Rendas-Baum•  5  Mental Health, Medicine, Applied Economics, ComorbidityAs novas institucionalidades do trabalho no setor público: os agentes comunitários de saúdeO artigo analisa o surgimento dos agentes comunitários de saúde como categoria de trabalhadores num contexto de flexibilização das relações de trabalho, numa dupla direção: na valorização da atividade do trabalho, maior autonomia,... moreO artigo analisa o surgimento dos agentes comunitários de saúde como categoria de trabalhadores num contexto de flexibilização das relações de trabalho, numa dupla direção: na valorização da atividade do trabalho, maior autonomia, formação continuada e valorização de habilidades sociais como elementos primordiais na implementação de serviços sociais pelo Estado; e no caráter atípico representado por contratos de trabalho fora da estabilidade do funcionalismo, condição para a atividade desenvolvida, por um lado, e, por outro, fator de vulnerabilidade social do trabalhador pela preponderância de contratos de subcontratação, informais e outros marcados pela instabilidade da relação de trabalho.Save to LibraryDownloadby Fazendo arte com o Gabriel Cockell Perticarrari•  3  Political Science, Autonomy, OutsourcingProduction of the First Effective Hyperimmune Equine Serum Antivenom against Africanized BeesSave to LibraryDownloadby Fábio Castro•  19  Biology, Medicine, Multidisciplinary, Biological SciencesFrom gorse to ngahere: an emerging allegory for decolonising the New Zealand health systemPrior to colonisation, Māori had a well-developed holistic health system based on maintaining balance between people, place and spirit.

The colonial imposition of British economic, religious, educational, legal, health and governance, through warfare, immigration, legislation and social coercion had a devastating effect on Māori health outcomes. With the release of the WAI 2575 Waitangi Tribunal report exposing the failings of our health system in relation to Māori health, the need to decolonise our health system becomes more pressing. A key difficulty in this work is the poverty of transformative language, concepts and frameworks in our workforce. This paper is the product of an anti-racism think tank that occurred in April 2019. While working through a system change analysis on our colonial health system, Māori and Tauiwi activists and scholars created an allegory-from gorse to ngahere. The allegory depicts the ongoing impact of the colonial health system as represented by gorse, ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Heather Came•  4  Colonialism, Medicine, Treaty of Waitangi, AotearoaIntroducing Critical Tiriti Policy Analysis: A new tool for anti-racism from Aotearoa New ZealandIssue/problem Te Tiriti o Waitangi (te Tiriti) was negotiated between the British Crown and Indigenous Māori in 1840.

Māori understood the agreement as an affirmation of political authority and a guarantee of British protection. The Crown understood it as a cession of sovereignty. Te Tiriti places a mandatory obligation on the Crown to protect and promote Māori health that has not been upheld. Description of the problem Ethnic inequities in health outcomes have been allowed to flourish in Aotearoa. We explored to what extend te Tiriti could be a anti-racism tool that health policy could be usefully evaluated against? Results We introduce Critical Tiriti Analysis (CTA) a new form of critical policy analysis. CTA involves reviewing policy documents against the Preamble and the Articles of the Māori text of te Tiriti o Waitangi. The review process has five defined phases: i) orientation; ii) close reading; iii) determination; iv) strengthening practice; and v) Māori final word.
