Apoorva GhoshMuhlenberg College,  Sociology,  Faculty MemberSocial Movements+5As a sociologist, I study the factors shaping LGBTQ identities and activism from intersectional and transnational perspectives. My latest journal article from Socio-Economic Review shows, using the case of the adoption of sex-reassignment health benefits by Fortune 500 employers, how and under what conditions social movement actors challenge their target entities through the politics of alignment, instead of mounting contentious protests on them, and win favorable outcomes from them. My other peer-reviewed works have been published in Gender, Work & Organization, Handbook of Research in Workforce Diversity, Sexualities, Sociology Compass, University of California eScholarship, and the Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Sexuality Studies. I have also studied industrial relations, cross-cultural management, and cultural competence, and my peer-reviewed works in these areas appear in Indian Journal of Industrial Relations, Management and Labour Studies, and South Asian Journal of Management.I teach several topics, such as, introduction to sociology, gender & society, sexualities, social movements & collective action, social problems, globalization, and race, culture & health. I'm also enthusiastic about teaching other core and elective topics. I was the chair of American Sociological Association's (ASA's) Graduate Student Forum Advisory board (2019-20) and an elected board member of the Society for the Study in Social Problems (2018-20). I also served as an elected council member in ASA's sections on Sex & Gender (2016-18) and Sexualities (2018-19). I have a PhD and MA in Sociology, an MS in Quality Management, and a BE in Mechanical Engineering. I was a Fulbright Doctoral & Professional Research Fellow in the University of Connecticut in 2012-13 and have been awarded the James Harvey Scholar Award 2020 for my works on sexualities. I speak Bangla, English, and Hindi fluently and have a basic/working knowledge of Gujarati and Sanskrit.less201 Followers0 FollowingTotal Views ;87 Public MentionsFollowFollowingPapersAfter Coming Out: Parental Acceptance of Gay men in India and the United StatesUC Irvine Doctoral Dissertation,  2020This dissertation examines the process of parental acceptance for gay men in India and the US.

In academic literature and public discourse, this acceptance is often seen as a linear, albeit often gradual, process. However, interviews with gay men conducted for this study show that this acceptance waxes and wanes in patterned ways. It is found that gay men often experience *contextual* parental acceptance. Acceptance becomes weaker or stronger at different points and stages in the life course and in different interactional settings. Parental acceptance becomes stronger or diminished in these contexts depending on how gay men’s parents respond to the forces of heteronormativity and homonormativity, and whether American gay men align with the racial normativity while experiencing their sexuality, in these time and spatial contexts. Finally, this study incorporates the experiences of gay men from India to show that the understanding of parental acceptance through the lenses of homonormativity is more exclusive to the US. Parental acceptance in India can be better understood through how queerness, in addition to homonormativity, shapes gay men’s perceptions of parental acceptance.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Politics of Alignment and the 'Quiet Transgender Revolution' in Fortune 500 Corporations, 2008 to 2017Socio-Economic Review,  2021This study shows that when social movements achieve a general acceptance for the legitimacy of th... more This study shows that when social movements achieve a general acceptance for the legitimacy of their cause in the institutional environment, they may start pursuing further demands by challenging their target entities through the "politics of alignment," meaning engaging these entities in professionally developed programs and demanding specific outcomes by introducing timed interventions in them. This study exemplifies this politics using the case of American LGBT workplace movement which used its Corporate Equality Index (CEI) program to extend reputational and economic benefits to its target entities—the Fortune 500 corporations—but also added an intervention to this program in 2011 to demand the adoption of gender transition-related health benefits by these corporations as a specific movement outcome which, if not met, would make these corporations lose the benefits they had been deriving through their performance in the CEI program. A longitudinal study of 456 Fortune 500 corporations from 2008 to 2017 conducted through hazard rate analysis indicates that corporations affected by this intervention, as well as by other movement factors, were the most likely to adopt these health benefits for their employees. Further quantitative analysis—using QCA—shows that early adoptions were explained largely by the LGBT workplace movement forces and the later adoptions by insider activism and isomorphic diffusion. These findings highlight that an incisive understanding of organizational change can be best gathered by examining social movements and institutional forces together.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Global LGBT Workplace Equality MovementThe Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Sexuality Studies,  2020This article examines the LGBT Workplace Equality Movement at a global and cross-national level. ... more This article examines the LGBT Workplace Equality Movement at a global and cross-national level. This movement is a niche sphere of activism within the larger LGBT social movement which focuses on fighting for the equality and inclusion of LGBT employees in the workplace. A global review suggests that no one model for this sphere of activism can be replicated in all parts of the world. Cross-nationally, multiple models of the LGBT workplace equality movement exist on the basis of each location’s unique goals, intersectionality, and movement participation. Globally, this movement has pursued location-specific goals using strategies tailored to each situation. The global character of this movement can be retained by continuing to address the range of unique challenges and issues faced by LGBT employees across the world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
After Coming Out: Parental Acceptance of Young Lesbian and Gay PeopleSociology Compass,  2020This study examines extant scholarly knowledge on parental acceptance of young lesbian and gay pe... more This study examines extant scholarly knowledge on parental acceptance of young lesbian and gay people in traditional heteronormative families. Recent literature shows that parents generally accept their lesbian and gay children. However, parents do not always accept them immediately after they come out. Acceptance takes time, and transitioning to acceptance is often a complex process that depends on parents’ access to the necessary resources for coping with the stresses of knowing that their child identifies as lesbian or gay. These resources include counseling or therapy, supportive friends and extended family, and a network of other parents with lesbian and gay children. This study also highlights the need for further research on parental acceptance in non-traditional families and of children with other non-heterosexual identities, such as asexuality, gray ace, bisexuality, or pansexuality. It also calls for an exploration of the complexities of parental acceptance as an ongoing process rather than as a singular event.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study indicates that these pathways aid in the interaction between externally derived sexual schemas and pre-existing sexual schemas, which may in turn lead to a configuration of "differential congruence" whereby competing sexual schemas may coexist rather than fuse or replace each other in an individual's life, albeit in different spheres.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Leveraging Sexual Orientation Workforce Diversity through Identity DeploymentDisclosure decisions for lesbian and gay employees have been researched in organizational context... more Disclosure decisions for lesbian and gay employees have been researched in organizational contexts. While the dilemmas associated, factors affecting, and situations encouraging or discouraging disclosure have been studied, the relatively unexplored area is how homosexuality can be strategically deployed at workplace to contest the associated stigma and bring positive social and political changes in the organizational climate. While scholars believe that remaining closeted may be the best strategy in a heterosexist and homophobic environment, studies report psychological strain, lack of authenticity, behavioral dilemmas, etc. experienced by closeted individuals, which, at minimum, lead to conflicts in daily situations of identity management and, at the peak, suicidal attempts due to perceived burdensomeness and failed belongingness. To address this dilemma in leveraging sexual orientation diversity in workplaces, this chapter deals with the framework of identity deployment offered by Bernstein (1997) to explore how homosexuality can be deployed in the workplace.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
LGBTQ  Activist Organizations as “Respectably Queer” in India: Contesting a Western ViewGender, Work & Organization,  Jan 2015This study contests the distinction of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) orga... more This study contests the distinction of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) organizations suggested by earlier studies as ‘respectable’ — i.e. normalizing,  professionalizing and conforming to the dominant cultural and institutional patterns — and ‘queer’, meaning challenging the cultural and institutional forces that ‘normalize and commodify differences’. Using Bernstein’s model of identity deployment, it is found problematic to distinguish LGBTQ organizations this way because when the actions of LGBTQ organizations are more complex to describe, it is not warranted to conflate identity goals with identity strategies — whether normalizing (respectable) or differentiating (queer). To examine these concerns, a  qualitative inquiry was used to study five LGBTQ  organizations in India where the intersections of post-colonial ethnicity, gender, social class and sexuality offer an intriguing context through which to study queer activism. Based on the findings, it is argued from a post-colonial perspective that when the socio-cultural and historical existence of non-homonormative queer communities and practices is strong, LGBTQ organizations challenge the homonormative and/or other forms of domination to become 'queer'. But they may simultaneously become 'respectable'  by conforming to the diversity politics of non-profit business, donors, and social movement organizations they seek support from, and turn out as 'respectably queer'.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Culturally Competent Behaviors at Workplace: An Intergroup Perspective for Workplace DiversitySouth Asian Journal of Management, Vol 21, issue 3With focus on cultural identities like ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation e... more With focus on cultural identities like ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation etc., this study views cultural competence from the lenses of intergroup theory and workplace diversity. This paper has two highlights. First, the major focus is on using qualitative inquiry to offer a framework for culturally competent behaviors of organization and its personnel. This framework offers themes and categories on what behaviors of individuals and organization help them in dealing with cross-cultural situations effectively at workplace. Second, the findings also suggest how culturally competent behaviors of members and leaders of the organization groups affect the intergroup relations (group boundaries, power differences, affective patterns, cognitive formations including ‘distortions’) that involve identity groups and organization groups. Directions for future research are also discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Various scholars ranging from system theorists, pluralists, Marxists and neo- Marxists to the modern HR and strategic choice perspectives have added, modified or questioned its subject matter. An attempt has been made to propose a model for IR so that it can involve all the addressed as well as unaddressed issues. This model is then tested with what have been the scholarly opinions of how IR should change and respond to the contemporary realities. The article concludes by proposing empirical testing of this model in the service economy of post-industrial age when we have knowledge workers instead of blue-collar workers, flat team-based structures instead of hierarchy and participative control rather than bureaucracy. The possibility of IR, given its experience and time-tested understanding of managing workers of huge strength, to borrow the concepts from contemporary disciplines like HRM and behavioural sciences and develop new theories and frameworks that can add meaning to the new realities is also explored.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
