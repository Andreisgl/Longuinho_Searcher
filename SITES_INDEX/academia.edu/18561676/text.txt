Ground measurements of carbon uptake and primary productivity in specific locations are fundamental for assigning biological meaning to the spectral data derived from satellite-based remote sensors, which can be used to generate ecological information in a geographical context. Spectral indices derived from remotely sensed data are valuable in the study of the structure and functioning of terrestrial vegetation . The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the most widely used remotely sensed index, is most often used as an estimator of the fraction of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that is absorbed by the canopy (fPAR; . The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was developed to reduce the noise produced by the soil background and also to reduce the saturation of the reflectance signal at...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersGlobal Change BiologyRemote estimation of carbon dioxide uptake by a Mediterranean forest2008 • Josep  PenuelasDownload Free PDFView PDFThe photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the remote sensing of leaf, canopy and ecosystem radiation use efficiencies.

Current remote sensing methodologies for estimating gross primary productivity are not satisfactory because they rely too heavily on (i) the availability of climatic data, (ii) the definition of land-use cover, and (iii) the assumptions of the effects of these two factors on the radiation-use efficiency of vegetation (RUE). A new methodology is urgently needed that will actually assess RUE and overcome the problems associated with the capture of fluctuations in carbon absorption in space and over time. Remote sensing techniques such as the widely used reflectance vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) allow green plant biomass and therefore plant photosynthetic capacity to be assessed. Nevertheless, detecting how much of this capacity is actually realized is a much more challenging goal.
