History of Soca Music,
a Child of Calypso
Soca Music
     
What is Soca?
Soca is a modern form of 
    calypso with an up-tempo beat. There is a popular misconception that 
Soca is a fusion of American soul music and traditional calypso. Hence the 
name "so-ca," soul/calypso. Though this sounds plausible, it is simply not 
true. Soca music originated as a fusion of calypso with Indian rhythms, thus 
combining the musical traditions to the two major ethnic groups of Trinidad 
and Tobago.
The Father of Soca
Born October 6, 1941 
in Lengua, Trinidad, Garfield Blackman would become the creator of soca. 
Blackman began singing calypso at the tender age of seven. Performing under 
the name Lord Shorty, he rose to fame in 1963 with his recording of 
Clock and Dagger. The name 
Lord Shorty is a paradoxical reference to his imposing height of 6-ft 4-in.
Talk that calypso 
was dying, and reggae was the new thing, prompted Lord Shorty to experiment 
with the calypso rhythm for nearly a decade. He combined Indian rhythm 
instruments (particularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal) with traditional 
calypso music. The result was a new energetic musical hybrid called soca. In 
1973, Lord Shorty introduced soca to the world with his hit song 
Ïndrani. The release of his 
1974 album Endless Vibrations 
prompted dozens of musicians to adopt the new soca style.
Lord Shoty initially 
referred to his musical hybrid as "solka", representing the true "soul of 
calypso." The "Indianization" of calypso brought together the musical 
traditions of Trinidad and Tobago's two major ethnic groups, the descendants 
of African slaves and of indentured laborers from India. The name was later 
changed to "soca" by a music journalist.
Endless 
Vibrations, the first soca 
album, contained the popular 
Om Shanti, a song that 
sparked controversy because of its use of a Hindu chant in the chorus line. 
Lord Shorty was no stranger to controversy in the ensuing years performing 
songs such as The PM Sex Probe, 
which poked fun at the Prime Minister. He was equally adept at performing 
songs dealing with social and political issues as in his hit 
Money Eh No Problem.
By the turn of the 
1980s, "the father of soca"  had become disenchanted with music he had 
created, saying that soca was being used to "celebrate the female bottom, 
rather than uplift the spirits of the people." Lord Kitchener's classic hit 
Sugar Bum Bum
    is a prime example of what he meant.
Around 1981, Lord Shorty 
converted to Rastafarianism, changed his name to Ras Shorty I, and moved 
into the Piparo forest in southern Trinidad, 50 miles from Port of Spain. 
There the prolific musician, composer and innovator continued to explore new 
musical frontiers while devoting himself to writing songs about spiritual 
matters and the dangers of hedonism. He formed the group Love Circle with 
his wife Claudette and several of their children. (He is said to have 
fathered anywhere from 14 to 20 children.) In the late 1980's he introduced 
a new style of music, jamoo, (Jah Music) which combined elements of reggae 
and gospel.
In 1997, he released 
the anti-drug song Watch Out 
My Children which went to the 
number one spot in the Caribbean. The song became an international hit and 
has been translated into ten languages.
On July 12, 2000 at the 
age of 58 Ras Shorty I died after a battle with multiple myeloma, a cancer 
of the bone marrow. His greatest legacy is the soca rhythm he created, 
bringing calypso into the modern era. The infectious soca rhythm has made 
calypso assessable to the young and the young at heart everywhere.
The Evolution of Soca
Innovative 
Montserrat singer Arrow did much to popularize soca internationally with his 
1983 number one soca classic 
Hot Hot Hot. Arrow has also 
recorded a string of CDs including
    Knock Dem Dead (1988), 
O'La Soca (1989) and 
Soca Dance Party (1990) which 
have become timeless examples of the best of the genre.
Some of the most 
popular soca recordings include 
Sugar Bum Bum - Lord 
Kitchener (1978),
    Soca Baptist - Super Blue 
(1980), Meh Lover
    - Lord Nelson (1983), Hot, 
Hot, Hot - Arrow (1983), 
Tiny Winey - Byron Lee & The 
Dragonaires (1985), Nani Wine
    - Crazy (1989),
    Teaser - Becket (1990), 
Dollar Wine - Collin Lucas 
(1991), and
  Jump
    - Rupee (2000).
Soca has continued to grow 
and evolve giving rise to offshoots such
as ragga soca  and the 
increasingly popular chutney soca. Today soca
is the definitive 
indigenous musical form associated with the Eastern
Caribbean. Thanks, Lord 
Shorty.
