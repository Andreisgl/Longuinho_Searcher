The evidence accumulated in the studies of radiation area has led to the conclusion that the ratio of clothing surface area to body surface area (fcl) may be defined as a function of clothing insulation. However, the effects of clothing fit have been disregarded. Radiation area factors (Ar/AD) were derived from pictures of five subjects wearing four different helicopter pilot suits. While sitting on a seat suspended in the center of a box-shaped frame, photographs were taken of the subjects with a fish-eye lens at 90 equidistant points on the six sides of the frame. The derived Ar/AD of 0.7 +/- 0.18 for the unclothed subjects closely agreed with that reported by Fanger, while it scattered in a relatively wide range for a given suit. The present study proposes a new approach for predicting fcl as related to body volume and the clothing microenvironment ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Igor Mekjavic•  11  Photography, Anthropometry, Humans, Computer SimulationModels for the indices of thermal comfortThe current paper propose the analysis and extension formulation required for establishing decision in the management of the medical national system from the point of view of quality and efficiency such as: conceiving models for the... moreThe current paper propose the analysis and extension formulation required for establishing decision in the management of the medical national system from the point of view of quality and efficiency such as: conceiving models for the indices of thermal comfort, defining the predicted mean vote (on the thermal sensation scale) &quot;PMV&quot;, defining the metabolism &quot;M&quot;, heat transfer between the human body and the environment, defining the predicted percent of dissatisfied people &quot;PPD&quot;, defining all indices of thermal comfort.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sergiu Costoiu•  8  Biomedical Engineering, Energy Metabolism, Humans, ClothingEffect of fabric characteristics on pesticide penetration through selected apparel fabricsSave to LibraryDownloadby Karen Leonas•  6  Aerosols, Adsorption, Environmental Sciences, Clothingمقررات لباس پوشیدن برای مردان در ترکیه و ایرانSave to LibraryDownloadby Houchang Chehabi•  5  Kemalism, Turkey - Iran relations, Clothing, HatsSocially Oriented Behavior and Purchasing Emotions of Filipino Consumers towards Eco-Friendly Apparel ProductsIn recent years, Filipino consumers are becoming more socially aware of the usage of products that can be harmful to the environment.

Purchasing eco-friendly products is a big step towards sustainable development in the Philippines. The objectives of this study are to identify what are the socially-oriented behavior that influences Filipino consumers to purchase eco-friendly apparel products, if emotions play a role in the purchasing behavior regarding eco-friendly apparel products, and to identify the key determinants that are behind the reason for the intention-behavior gap and purchasing behavior of Filipino consumers regarding eco-friendly apparel products. Filipino consumers from age 18 and above and those residing in Metro Manila are the respondents, while the use of descriptive survey methods was utilized in data collection.

Józef Gajek was the one who initiated the series, published by Polish Folk Association to this day. He was associated with Polish Ethnographic Atlas, which had a great impact on the character of the series. Its main objective was to describe Polish traditional costumes according to particular regions. Janusz Kamocki and Barbara Bazielich were subsequent editors of the series. Since 2011 the authors of this article have been part of the editorial staff. At their initiative ten more books of the series were published in the years 2013–2018, field research on traditional handicraft was conducted and the Traditional Costume Section was established. The article describes the circumstances accompanying this editorial series appearance and discusses both main directions in research on traditional costumes and activities for popularising knowledge of this unique cultural phenomenon.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anna Brzezińska•  3  History, Art, ClothingFactors associated with trace evidence analyses and DNA findings among police reported cases of rapeThe aim of this study was to examine the association between victim, suspect and assault characteristics and (1) forensic analysis of trace evidence, (2) detection of spermatozoa and (3) DNA match in police-reported cases of... moreThe aim of this study was to examine the association between victim, suspect and assault characteristics and (1) forensic analysis of trace evidence, (2) detection of spermatozoa and (3) DNA match in police-reported cases of rape/attempted rape. In addition, we explored whether DNA findings were associated with legal outcome. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study based on police-reported rapes and attempted rapes of women  ≥16 years of age in Sør-Trøndelag Police District throughout 1997-2010. Police data were merged with information from the Sexual Assault Centre (SAC) at St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. We used binary and multivariable logistic regression for the comparisons. We identified 324 victims (mean age 24 years).

Diatom analysis is currently an underused technique within the forensic geoscience approach, which has the potential to provide an independent ecological assessment of trace evidence. This study presents empirical data to provide a preliminary evidence base in order to be able to understand the nature of diatom transfers to items of clothing, and the collection of transferred diatom trace evidence from a range of environments under experimental conditions. Three diatom extraction methods were tested on clothing that had been in contact with soil and water sites: rinsing in water (RW), rinsing in ethanol (RE), and submersion in H2O2 solution (H).

Japan has relaxed the dress norms of school teachers over the years from a traditional/formal dress to a casual dress. We intended to examine if this change has a significant effect on the self-perceived job performance among school teachers in Japan with the purpose of seeking recommendations for many Asian countries like Sri Lanka in which traditional dress norms applied to teachers have not changed much or at all. A combined qualitative and quantitative study was conducted with three chosen prefectural schools in the Saga city, Japan. The qualitative study was a thematic analysis based on in-depth interviews with five selected school teachers. The quantitative study (n=30) was a descriptive cross-sectional study.

Such response occurs due to the presence of, what is conceived as, pseudo-damping and meta-damping in some special class of FO systems. Here, approximation of such damped oscillation in FO systems with the conventional notion of integer order damping and time constant has been carried out using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Next, a multilayer feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been trained using the GA based results to predict the optimal pseudo and meta-damping from knowledge of the maximum order or number of terms in the FO dynamical system.Save to LibraryDownloadby Saptarshi Das•  27  Information Systems, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, EconomicsPrinted t-shirts in the linguistic landscape: a reading from functional linguisticsSave to LibraryDownloadby David  Caldwell•  3  Visual Semiotics, Systemic Functional Linguistics, ClothingThe Evolution Of The Textile And Clothing Industry - Romania: From Lohn To LossTextile industry and clothing represent an important source of income and employment opportunities for many developing countries.

Recent global economic events determined rapid changes which led to restructuring and reorganization of the industry. In recent years, in Europe and implicitly in Romania has increased the competition from a number of third countries, particularly in Asia, which benefit from low labour costs. An important feature of European textile and clothing industry is the widespread use of lohn production, which means that labour-intensive operations with lower added value are transferred in countries where labour cost is much lower. This article aims to analyze the evolution of textile and garments sector in Romania, which ranked among the top three manufacturers in the field at European level, highlighting the political and economic changes that have occurred and influenced the economic indicators of the industry.

Sydney: Puncher & Wattmann, 2017, 210 pp., ISBN 978-1-9221-8694-2.The meanings of dress, clothing and fashion are so intermingled nowadays that it is hard to speak about one without inferring the others. Dress is mainly about appearance, the visual, while fashion includes the social meanings and functions of dress. Clothing occupies a central place in contemporary dress and fashion, but clothing is also a technology with properties and functions unrelated to dress and fashion. For these reasons, the overlap between dress and clothing can create problems when considering questions of origins.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ian Gilligan•  21  Archaeology, Anthropology, Art History, Fashion designSupply chain influences on new product development in fashion clothingPurposeThis study sets out to focus on the textiles and fashion clothing supply chain with the objective of identifying factors that constrain company activities and inhibit competitiveness.Design/methodology/approachThe methodology for... morePurposeThis study sets out to focus on the textiles and fashion clothing supply chain with the objective of identifying factors that constrain company activities and inhibit competitiveness.Design/methodology/approachThe methodology for this research involves multiple case studies involving UK companies.

In this paper, methods used for classification of everyday activities like walking, running, and cycling are described. The aim of the study was to find out how to recognize activities, which sensors are useful and what kind of signal processing and classification is required. A large and realistic data library of sensor data was collected. Sixteen test persons took part in the data collection, resulting in approximately 31 h of annotated, 35-channel data recorded in an everyday environment. The test persons carried a set of wearable sensors while performing several activities during the 2-h measurement session. Classification results of three classifiers are shown: custom decision tree, automatically generated decision tree, and artificial neural network. The classification accuracies using leave-one-subject-out cross validation range from 58 to 97% for custom decision tree classifier, from 56 to 97% for automatically generated decision tree, and from 22 to 96% for artificial neural network.

This model will take into account ease allowance and silhouette, and will be used to propose a size-changing method. Design/methodology/approach – The authors used two real garment bodices with a surface suitable for pattern development. The garments were fitted to a designated dummy body and scanned. Using the scanned data, the authors made those upper garment basic models suitable for 3D pattern making. Using one model, the authors produced two bodice patterns, one with the original seam lines and the other with seam lines that differed from the original ones, and then compared them with the original jacket bodice. To construct garment models that were different in size from the basic model, the authors calculated multiplication factors of cross-sectional dimensions (in the front, back and lateral directions) between the basic garment and the actual garment shape wor...Save to LibraryDownloadby Masayuki Takatera•  13  Engineering, Textiles, Apparel Marketing, Textile EngineeringActivity Classification Using Realistic Data From Wearable SensorsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ilkka Korhonen and +1J.

Regarding these results, this study investigated the effects of jersey color during a combat situation on fighters&#39; physical parameters of strength and heart rate. An artificial, experimental combat situation was created in which the color of sport attire was assigned randomly. Fourteen pairs of male athletes matched for weight, height, and age had to fight each other: once in a red jersey and once in a blue. Heart rate (before, during, and after the fight) and strength (before the fight) were tested wearing the blue and the red jerseys. Participants wearing red jerseys had significantly higher heart rates and significantly higher pre-contest values on the strength test. Results showed that participants&#39; body functions are influenced by wearing red equipment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bernd Strauss and +1Dennis Dreiskaemper•  11  Education, Sport And Exercise Psychology, Muscle strength, SportsNextLast »Related TopicsGeological Mapping Structural Geology NeotectonicsFollowFollowingHydrocarbon BiodegradationFollowFollowingFashion,textile and clothingFollowFollowingProduction OptimizationFollowFollowingIranian politics and historyFollowFollowingHistory of clothing and fashionFollowFollowingFashionFollowFollowingIgneous and Metamorphic PetrologyFollowFollowingEthiopian HistoryFollowFollowingQajar PersiaFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
