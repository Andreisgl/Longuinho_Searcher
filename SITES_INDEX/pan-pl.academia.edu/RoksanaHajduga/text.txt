The fieldwork was concentrated on uncovering the earliest occupation strata from the 1st/2nd century CE. Two mud-brick buildings were fully excavated, along with contemporaneous occupational horizons, yielding, among others, unique bell-shaped decorated vessels, a copper plate, and a female clay figurine. Storage jars used as ovens and cooking places were present in all phases and can be considered as a characteristic furnishing of the explored households. Moreover, an archaeological reconnaissance extended the boundaries of the settlement eastward, providing new data for studies of the settlement plan and its various stages of development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This group come from the same context, in the S2/1/2010 storehouse and the most prominent building within the settlement. This paper focuses on selected impressions of thirty-one seals found on sealings and discusses them mainly in terms of iconography. Motifs from the sealings are both figural and non-figural. They reflect Meroitic beliefs, culture and politics. The catalogue and description of individual sealings, complete with photographs and drawings of stamp impressions, provide a firm base for preliminary observation regarding religion, symbols used by administrations and political propaganda, as well as allowing one to trace external influences and adaptation of foreign patterns.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
