The concern that farmers use excessive amounts of pesticides leading to health hazards to consumers and pollution of environment through accumulation of excess chemicals in soil and water bodies is common among environmental groups in Sri Lanka too. The objectives of this study were to study trends of pesticide use by vegetable farmers and to understand perceptions and attitudes of urban vegetable consumers on the impact of pesticide use on their health and their awareness on potential remedial measures. Data from seasonal reports of cost of cultivation of agricultural crops were used to analyze changes in pest and disease control practices by farmers. Trends of input use related to pest and disease control were studied using aggregate farm budgets. A primary survey was conducted among 150 semi-urban households ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPapers SubmittedEthiopia (Food Access) Food Security, Livelihoods and Options for Organic Agriculture In EthiopiaIngrid  HartmannDownload Free PDFView PDF… Environment Program for …Impact of Agro-Chemical Use on Productivity and Health In Vietnam1999 • Tran Duong Tri ThienIn recent years, the use of agrochemicals increased considerably.

Responsibility to feed the growing population has brought remarkable changes in the way we produce food. The green revolution, also known as conventional farming system, although is known to produce more, is criticized for its high energy and input use, disregard for the environment and health of living beings, and disparity of its benefits across the world. This has now questioned the sustainability of such practice. This chapter discusses about the social, economic, and environmental aspect of organic farming in the light of sustainability of a farming system. Based on literature review, it shows how organic farming can achieve these three dimensions of sustainability, which mostly has to do with the local context. The global scenario shows that organic farming is indeed in a growing trend. While South Asian countries’ organic sector is mostly export oriented, its loc...Download Free PDFView PDFImpact of AgroChemical Use on Productivity and Health in Vietnam by Nguyen Huu Dung, Tran Chi Thien, Nguyen Van Hong, Nguyen Thi LocTrinh Le huuDownload Free PDFView PDFAssessment of Pesticide Usage in Up-Country Vegetable Farming in Sri LankaMohamed AheeyarPesticides have become inevitable ingredients in vegetable cultivation with green revolution technologies. However indiscriminate use of pesticides causes health hazards to humans and long lasting bad effects to the environment. The cost of pesticides imposed damage has to be borne by the society as a whole. Upcountry vegetable farming is one of the intensive cultivated farming systems which consumes a high volume of pesticides and fertilizers, especially due to short duration of crops and highly favourable humid conditions for rapid spread of pests and diseases. The major objective of this study is to estimate the level of pesticide (insecticides, fungicides and herbicides) use and to investigate the factors affecting overuse/misuse. Primary data for the study was collected from 240 farmers randomly selected among potato, beans, cabbage and leeks cultivators from selected areas in the Badulla and Nuwara eliya districts. According to the findings of the study, about five percent of ...Download Free PDFView PDFVegetable Crops - Health Benefits and CultivationHarnessing Technologies for Vegetable Cultivation: A Panacea for Food and Nutrition Insecurity in GhanaPatrick OforiVegetable plays a key role in food and nutrition security in Ghana as the country’s food system shifts from food quantity to diet quality and health benefits. This chapter looks at the role vegetables play in the diets of humans in ensuring food and nutrition security. Traditional locally available underutilized vegetable crops as well as exotic vegetable crops could be utilized to improve nutrition and health. One of the strategies for promoting vegetable production is the development and adoption of innovative and modern technologies to address major challenges impeding the advancement of vegetable production in Ghana. These challenges include lack of improved varieties, nonfunctional seed systems, poor infrastructure for storage and processing, uncontrolled use of agrochemicals, etc. Genetic manipulation, soil and water management as well as integrated pest and disease management have been harnessed with significant achievement to boost vegetable production.
