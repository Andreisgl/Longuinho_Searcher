From 
                                            Party Game to Serious Sport
Nearly anyone can pick up a lightweight 
                                            badminton racket and hit the shuttlecock 
                                            over the net. Because it’s an 
                                            easy game for beginners, badminton 
                                            remains popular at picnics and parties. 
                                            But badminton is deceptive. It is 
                                            the fastest of all the racket sports. 
                                            A powerfully hit shuttle can travel 
                                            as fast as 200 miles per hour. At 
                                            the elite levels, the game requires 
                                            amazing speed, strategy, leaping ability, 
                                            power and quickness. A player can 
            run as much as a mile during a match.
As the best players 
      moved from the lawns and salons to 
      competitive courts, they naturally 
      wanted to compete against other top 
      athletes. The All-England Championships 
      gave them this opportunity. By 1938, 
      players from other countries began 
      to compete in this tournament. An 
      American woman, Judy Hashman, won 
      17 all All-England titles—the 
      most of any player in history.
More tournaments
      and competitions became available
      as the sport continued to attract
      more competitive players. In 1939,
      Sir George Thomas donated the Thomas
      Cup, a trophy to be awarded at the
      International Badminton Championship
      for the top men’s singles players.
      (Badminton can be played by men or
      women in singles and doubles competition,
      and by teams of mixed doubles.) Thomas
      was a British lawn tennis champion
      who switched to badminton and won
      90 tournament titles over 24 years.
      Thomas was also the first president
      of the IBF.
In
      1949, the Thomas Cup became a men’s
      world team championship competition
      much like the Davis Cup in tennis.
      In 1956, the Uber Cup competition
      was created for women. Betty Uber
      of England, one of badminton’s
      top doubles players, donated the
      trophy. See a list of Thomas and
      Uber Cup winners below. Initially,
      the Davis and Uber Cup Competitions
      were played every three years. Since
      1982, international team championships
      have been every two years—in
      even-numbered years. In odd-numbered
      years, individuals compete for international
      honors.

Today, the world’s 
                                      very best badminton players compete professionally 
                                      for prize money. Television contracts and 
                                      sponsorships have dramatically increased 
                                      the winnings available on the pro badminton 
            circuit.
Asia Dominates the Sport
                                      Though England birthed the sport of badminton, 
                                      it has been Asia that adopted it as its 
                                      own. China and Indonesia are the two dominant 
                                      nations in international badminton competition. 
                                      Matches in these nations draw crowds of 
                                      more than 15,000. These two countries together 
                                      have won an astonishing 70 percent of all 
                                      IBF events. Asian countries have claimed 
                                      all 23 Thomas Cups that have been awarded. 
                                      In Uber Cup competition, Asian nations have 
                                      won the last 15 titles. 
The Olympics have been 
                                      another showcase for Asian badminton prowess. 
                                      Badminton was played as a demonstration 
                                      sport at both the 1972 and 1988 Olympic 
                                      games. In 1992, medal competition began 
                                      in men’s and women’s singles 
                                      and doubles. Mixed doubles was added in 
                                      1996. Of the 61 medals awarded in Olympic 
                                      badminton, Asian countries have won all 
                                      but seven. The chart below clearly shows 
            their dominance.

 Outside of Asia, the Scandinavian 
                                      countries have the strongest badminton programs. 
                                      Six times, Denmark has finished second in 
                                      Thomas cup competition. Interest in badminton, 
                                      primarily in these two parts of the world, 
                                      make it the world’s second most popular 
                                      sport behind soccer.
