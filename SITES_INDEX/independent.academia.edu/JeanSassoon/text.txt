Each month begins with the appearance of the new crescent moon while each year begins in April with the onset of the rains. This calendar regulates all Pokot activities ranging from the economic to the ceremonial. Their intimate knowledge of the stars has led to the recognition of the difference between stars and planets, the shaping of constellations out of stellar patterns and the invention of stories about them which relate to their own particular way of life.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

If on the left ... more The cicatrices on this man's right shoulder show that he has killed a male enemy. If on the left they would show that he had killed a female enemy. This small beaded hide apron is not, as may be supposed, a little girls pubic apron. The clue to its use is to be found in the small piece of hairy skin attached to it. The Eastern Pokot of Kenya are pastoralists who augment the food obtained from their livestock by foraging for wild plant foods and by hunting. Boys learn to hunt at an early age and hunting is regarded as the best way of learning the skills necessary for engaging in raiding and warfare. Encouragement to hunt is provided by the girls and young unmarried women. Young boys from the age of 8-9 years must prove that they can successfully hunt something. The girls of their age-group make garlands of ​ kingisia (Secamone punctulata). A boy going hunting asks a girl he admires for a ​ kingesia necklace. That girl must never be his sister and must be a girl with whom sex and marriage are forbidden. The boy wears the ​ kingisia necklace ​ when hunting. If, with his arrows, he manages to shoot a hare or a dik-dik he attaches the tail and/or the ears to the necklace and can then partake in a dance which is held in his honour. This procedure by young boys and girls imitates the giving of the above miniature apronSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
