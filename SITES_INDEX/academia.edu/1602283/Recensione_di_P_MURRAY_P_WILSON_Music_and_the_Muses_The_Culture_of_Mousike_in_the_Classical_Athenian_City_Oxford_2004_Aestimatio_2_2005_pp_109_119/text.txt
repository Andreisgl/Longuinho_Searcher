Among other passages, Ar. Th. 120-2 and Tim.

Convergences in Greek Poetic Imagery between Textile and Musical Terminology. An Overview on Archaic and Classical Literature2017 • Giovanni FanfaniThis paper explores instances of terminological interaction between the technical lexicon of textile crafts (in particular weaving) and the language of instrumental music in archaic and classical Greek poetry. Such a sustained pattern of convergence is favoured by perceived similarities in technology, craft, and in the auditory sphere: in both literary and iconographical sources the technique of striking the strings of a lyra or kithara with a plectrum is assimilated to the act of hitting and strumming threads on a loom with a weft-beater. More broadly, it is possible to observe the long-standing association in ancient Greek musical imagery between the craft of weaving and the craft of playing (mainly stringed) instruments, with cases of appropriation of the technical lexicon of weaving by emerging discourses on musical innovation in Greek poetry. This pattern of terminological interaction is then positioned within the wider area of textile imagery for poetry-making, in turn part of the larger system of Greek craftsmanship imagery for poetic creation.Download Free PDFView PDFBravi, Lomiento, Meriani & Pace (eds), Tra lyra e aulos: Tradizioni musicali e generi poetici, pp. 327-354.Dionysiac strings ? Towards an iconographic reassessment of late 5th and early 4th century Athenian perceptions of mousikēTheodor E Ulieriu-RostásThis paper puts forward a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the iconography of chelys-lyres and barbitoi associated with satyrs and Dionysos in late 5th and early 4th century Attic vase-painting, in an attempt to confront independent visual evidence with the textually-driven narratives on musical hierarchies and polemics in Classical Athens. The author identifies a coherent lineage of vase-painters which introduce the lyre in the semantics of Dionysiac iconography in the late 5th and early 4th century BC, escaping the musical polarizations associated with the critics of New Music – thus illuminating a largely invisible segment within the Athenian society in a time of political and socio-cultural turmoil.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
