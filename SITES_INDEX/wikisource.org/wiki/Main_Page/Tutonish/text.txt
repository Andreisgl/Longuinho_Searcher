Tutonish (10 pages)
Tutonish is the name of a series of constructed, zonal germanic or pan-germanic auxiliary languages by Elias Molee from the 1900s to the 1910s.
Apart from the constructed languages, Molee in the English chapters of his books uses his own innovations in abbreviations and ortography, as "e" for "the", "b" for "be", and no capital letters.
Texts[edit]
