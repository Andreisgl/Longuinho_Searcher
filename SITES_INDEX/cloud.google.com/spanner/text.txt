Features
Write and read
                    scalability with no limits
Spanner decouples
                    compute resources from data storage, which makes it possible
                    to transparently scale in and out processing resources. Each
                    additional
                    compute capacity can
                    process both reads and writes, providing effortless
                    horizontal scalability. Spanner optimizes performance by
                    automatically handling the sharding, replication, and
                    transaction processing.

Automated maintenance
                  
Reduce operational
                    costs and improve reliability for any size database.
                    Synchronous replication and maintenance are automatic and
                    built in. 100% online schema changes and maintenance while
                    serving traffic with zero downtime.
PostgreSQL interface
Combine the scalability
                    and reliability of Spanner with the familiarity and
                    portability of a
                    PostgreSQL interface.
                    Use the skills and tools that your teams already know,
                    future-proofing your investment for peace of
                    mind.

Automatic database
                    sharding
Never worry about
                    manually resharding your database again. Built-in sharding
                    automatically distributes data to optimize for performance
                    and availability. Scale up and scale down without
                    interruption.
High-performance,
                    workload-isolated query processing
Cloud Spanner Data Boost
                    enables users to run analytical queries, batch processing
                    jobs, or data export operations faster without affecting the
                    existing transactional workload. Fully managed by Google
                    Cloud, Data Boost does not require capacity planning or
                    management. It is always hot, ready to process user queries
                    directly on data stored in Spanner's distributed storage
                    system,
                    Colossus.
                    This on-demand, independent compute resource lets users
                    easily handle mixed workloads and worry-free data
                    sharing. 
Strong transactional
                    consistency
Rely on
                    industry-leading
                    external consistency without
                    compromising on scalability or availability.

Single-region and
                    multi-region configurations
No matter where your
                    users may be, apps backed by Spanner can read and write
                    up-to-date strongly consistent data globally. Additionally,
                    when running a multi-region instance, your database is
                    protected against a regional failure and offers
                    industry-leading 99.999% availability.
Real-time change data
                    capture and replication
Use
                    Datastream
                    to deliver change data from Oracle and MySQL databases into
                    Spanner for up-to-date information. Use
                    Spanner change streams
                    to capture change data from Spanner databases and integrate
                    it with other systems for analytics, event triggering, and
                    compliance.

                    granular instance
                    for only $65/month and scale it based on your needs without
                    downtime and with no need for re-architecting.

Relational interface
Everything you would
                    expect from a relational database—schemas, SQL queries, and
                    ACID transactions—at any scale. Use Google Standard SQL or a
                    PostgreSQL interface.

How It Works
                          Cloud Spanner instances provide compute and storage in
                          one or more regions. A distributed clock called
                          TrueTime guarantees transactions are strongly
                          consistent even across regions. Data is automatically
                          "split" for scalability and replicated using a
                          synchronous, Paxos-based scheme for availability.

Common Uses
User profile and entitlements
Manage critical
                              user data securely at any scale
 User profile management is a
                              critical function that requires Spanner's
                              scalability, availability, and global consistency.
                              It is the entry point for players across games,
                              platforms, and regions. Similarly financial
                              services companies manage customer information and
                              product offerings using Spanner.

FAQ
Cloud Spanner is a highly scalable database that
                              combines unlimited scalability with relational
                              semantics, such as secondary indexes, strong
                              consistency, schemas, and SQL providing 99.999%
                              availability in one easy solution. Hence, it’s
                              suitable for both relational and non-relational
                              workloads.
Cloud Spanner provides two ANSI-based SQL
                              dialects over the same rich set of capabilities:
                              GoogleSQL
                              and PostgreSQL. GoogleSQL shares syntax with
                              BigQuery for teams standardizing their data
                              management workflows. The PostgreSQL interface
                              provides familiarity for teams who already know
                              PostgreSQL and portability of schemas and queries
                              to other PostgreSQL environments. For more
                              information about the Cloud Spanner PostgreSQL
                              interface, see
                              our documentation.
                            
Migration to Spanner can vary widely depending on
                              a number of factors like source database, data
                              size, downtime requirements, application code
                              complexity, sharding schema, custom functions or
                              transformations, failover and replication
                              strategy. The recommended tooling comprises open
                              source tools like
                              HarbourBridge
                              for Schema and Data migration, and third party
                              tools for assessments like migVisor. Learn more
                              about the migration process in

Spanner is a fully managed database so it
                              automatically provides comprehensive
                              infrastructure management features, but there are
                              some application-specific management actions that
                              may be required depending on your workload. You
                              will need to make sure that you have set up proper
                              alerting and monitoring and that you are watching
                              those closely to ensure production is always
                              running smoothly. You need to understand what
                              actions to take when traffic grows organically
                              over time, or if there is peak traffic expected,
                              or how to handle data corruption due to
                              application bugs, and last but not least, how to
                              troubleshoot performance issues and understand
                              what components are responsible for increased
                              latencies.
