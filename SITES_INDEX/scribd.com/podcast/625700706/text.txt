O.W.L.s were approaching and although no one else seemed inclined to study or care about them at all, she knew it was best to start early.She used her time on Prefect rounds to review. There was so much silence around the castle by this time in the evening – now that Umbridge had begun with her “decrees” – that she would go insane if she didn’t have something else to occupy herself. She’d asked Ron if he wanted to patrol with her, but of course, since his day for rounds was Tuesday, he’d abruptly declined.“Why would I go twice?” he’d mumbled around pudding at the dinner table.Released:May 10, 2021Format:Podcast episodeTitles in the series (40)The Right Thing to Do, All the Wrongs Things, and The Auction by Lovesbitca8.
