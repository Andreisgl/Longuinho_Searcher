However, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated public health restrictions on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) has largely been overlooked. Not only do people with IDD have a greater risk of severe complications and death from the virus as shown in large-scale studies, but they also face significant short- and long-term consequences of COVID-related public health measures on their mental health and well-being. At a time when this vulnerable population is already feeling undervalued, ignored, and forgotten, it is imperative that the risks facing adults and children with IDD—as well as their families and caregivers—are recognized, valued, and addressed through a disabili...Download Free PDFView PDFFACETSRestoring trust: COVID-19 and the future of long-term care in CanadaCarole EstabrooksThe Royal Society of Canada Task Force on COVID-19 was formed in April 2020 to provide evidence-informed perspectives on major societal challenges in response to and recovery from COVID-19. The Task Force established a series of working groups to rapidly develop policy briefings, with the objective of supporting policy makers with evidence to inform their decisions. This paper reports the findings of the COVID-19 Long-Term Care (LTC) working group addressing a preferred future for LTC in Canada, with a specific focus on COVID-19 and the LTC workforce. First, the report addresses the research context and policy environment in Canada’s LTC sector before COVID-19 and then summarizes the existing knowledge base for integrated solutions to challenges that exist in the LTC sector. Second, the report outlines vulnerabilities exposed because of COVID-19, including deficiencies in the LTC sector that contributed to the magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis. This section focuses especially on the ...Download Free PDFView PDFFACETSSupporting Canada’s COVID-19 resilience and recovery through robust immigration policy and programsNatalya Brown, naomi alboimCanada has been seen globally as a leader in immigration and integration policies and programs and as an attractive and welcoming country for immigrants, refugees, temporary foreign workers, and international students. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed some of the strengths of Canada’s immigration system, as well as some of the fault lines that have been developing over the last few years. In this article we provide an overview of Canada’s immigration system prior to the pandemic, discuss the system’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities revealed by the pandemic, and explore a post-COVID-19 immigration vision. Over the next three years, the Government of Canada intends to bring over 1.2 million new permanent residents to Canada. In addition, Canada will continue to accept many international students, refugee claimants, and temporary foreign workers for temporary residence here. The importance of immigration for Canada will continue to grow and be an integral component of the country’s po...Download Free PDFView PDFFACETSEasing the disruption of COVID-19: supporting the mental health of the people of Canada—October 2020—an RSC Policy BriefingMarie Claire BourqueThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of the people of Canada. Most have found it challenging to cope with social distancing, isolation, anxiety about infection, financial security and the future, and balancing demands of work and home life. For some, especially those who have had to face pre-existing challenges such as structural racism, poverty, and discrimination and those with prior mental health problems, the pandemic has been a major impact. The Policy Briefing Report focuses on the current situation, how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated significant long-standing weaknesses in the mental health system and makes specific recommendations to meet these challenges to improve the well-being of the people of Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on mental health of people in Canada but the impact has been variable, impacting those facing pre-existing structural inequities hardest. Those living in poverty, and in some social...Download Free PDFView PDFCorrectional Services During and Beyond COVID-19Correctional Services During and Beyond COVID-192021 • Rosemary RicciardelliCorrectional services, both institutional and within the community, are significantly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown those living and working in correctional facilities are particularly susceptible to exposure to potential contagions. Canadian correctional institutions, like prisons in many other countries, are affected by high population turnover, “overcrowding and restricted movement, inaccessible or poor health care, […] high prevalence of chronic disease and comorbidity, and an aging custodial population [which] exacerbate […] risks” and fears of contagion among staff, officers, and incarcerated persons (Pyrooz, Labrecque, Tostlebe, & Useem, 2020np; see also Akiyama, Spaulding, & Rich, 2020; Maruschak, Berzofsky, & Unangst, 2015; Novisky, 2018). The pandemic also poses acute challenges and agonizing decisions for correctional administrators whose responsibilities now include challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well for those working in communit...Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal Public HealthPolicy responses to COVID-19 present a window of opportunity for a paradigm shift in global health policy: An application of the Multiple Streams Framework as a heuristicDilani LoganDownload Free PDFView PDFFACETSRemembering is a form of honouring: preserving the COVID-19 archival recordShelley SweeneyCOVID-19 presents an opportunity to preserve a rich and diverse historical record—one intended to honour all experiences and voices and in recognition of ongoing systemic inequalities shaping the pandemic. But policy changes are necessary in three key areas: how memory institutions are funded and supported, the gaps in our capacity to preserve the digital records that reflect how we communicate with one another today, and how to preserve and make accessible valuable scholarly research into the societal impact of COVID-19. Our goal is to begin a conversation about priorities for archival preservation, the need for greater equity and justice in our preservation practices, and ways to safeguard the existence of historical records that will allow us in future to bear witness, with fairness and truth and in a spirit of reconciliation, to our society’s response to COVID-19.Download Free PDFView PDFSearching for New Welfare ModelsThe Welfare State: Will It Stay or Will It Go?Rolf  SolliDownload Free PDFView PDFFACETSThe limits of our knowledge: tracking the size and scope of police involvement with persons with mental illnessLaura HueySignificant public discourse has focused recently on police–civilian interactions involving with persons with mental illness (PMI). Despite increasing public attention, and growing demands for policy change, little is actually known about the myriad of ways in which Canadian police encounter PMI in the context of routine police work. To assist policymakers in developing evidence-informed policy, this paper attempts to shed light on present difficulties associated with addressing fundamental questions, such as the prevalence of mental health related issues in police calls for service. To do this, we attempt to map the size and scope of police calls for service involving PMI, drawing on both the available scientific data and the limited knowledge to be gleaned from available police reports. Our focus is on two broad categories of police interactions with citizens: public safety concerns (wellness checks, suicide threats, missing persons, mental health apprehensions) and crime preventi...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Sociology and Social WelfareNext Steps on the Road to Basic Income in Canada2016 • James MulvaleDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
