Apoptosis of antigen pre- senting cells (APCs) is known to be an innate mechanism of the 47 host to fight infections. M. tuberculosis induces apoptosis in APCs 48 through TNF-a, toll like receptors (TLRs), Fas or by altering the 49 expression of Bax/Bcl-xL via an oxygen dependent pathway . Virulent strains of M. tuberculosis have been known to develop 51 mechanisms that resist host apoptotic cell death , however 52 they are capable of inducing necrotic cells death, which helps in bacterial multiplication and dissemination . On the other 54 hand non-virulent strains like Mycobacterium bovis BCG and 55 Q5 M. smegmatis fail to induce necrosis of the host cells , sug-56 gesting that the factors released by the virulent strains interfere with the host cell death machinery for their release and 58 subsequent infection...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersVirulenceVirulence factors of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex2013 • Julia SabioDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of ImmunologyMycobacterial Secretion Systems ESX-1 and ESX-5 Play Distinct Roles in Host Cell Death and Inflammasome Activation2011 • Wilbert Bitter, Nicole van der WelDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of ImmunologyThe ESX-5 Secretion System of Mycobacterium marinum Modulates the Macrophage Response2008 • Wilbert BitterDownload Free PDFView PDFNature Reviews MicrobiologyType VII secretion — mycobacteria show the way2007 • Joen LuirinkDownload Free PDFView PDFBiochimieThe< i> PE/PPE</i> multigene family codes for virulence factors and are a possible source of mycobacterial antigenic variation: Perhaps more?2011 • Yusuf  Akhter, Seyed HasnainThe PE/PPE multigene family codes for approximately 10% of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome and is encoded by 176 open reading frames. These proteins possess, and have been named after, the conserved proline-glutamate (PE) or proline-proline-glutamate (PPE) motifs at their N-terminus. Their genes have a conserved structure and repeat motifs that could be a potential source of antigenic variation in M. tuberculosis.
