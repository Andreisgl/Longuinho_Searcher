A diagram of the typical relationships developed by a Wikipedian in Residence
Wikipedians (or Wikimedians) in Residence are Wikimedians who dedicate time to working in-house at an organization. Wikipedians in Residence are usually financially compensated by the institution or by a Wikimedia chapter, but they may also be volunteers. The Wikipedian in Residence is not simply an in-house editor: the role is fundamentally about enabling the host organisation and its members to continue a productive relationship with the encyclopedia and its community after the Residency is finished. The Wikipedian in Residence model was first piloted by the GLAM initiative, but has since been adopted by other types of organizations.

Core characteristics of a Wikipedian in Residence[edit]
Serves as a liaison between the organization and the Wikimedia community to promote a mutually beneficial cooperation.
Promotes understanding of Wikimedia among staff at the organization through workshops and events.
Works with organizational staff to digitize, compile, and organize resources that can be shared with the Wikipedia community.
Facilitates the improvement of content by the Wikipedia community, rather than directly editing articles as a core goal.
Coordinates events, such as Hack-a-Thons, Edit-a-Thons, or Backstage Passes, that bring Wikipedians on-site to work with staff on content creation and improvement.
Formally coordinated by the institution, allowing the resident to work closely with staff for various projects.
Ultimately, a residency lays the foundation for a more lasting partnership between the Wikipedia community and an organization.
Types of projects carried out by residencies[edit]
Activities organized by Wikipedians in Residence are broad and varied. Some of these projects include:
Facilitating content improvement in partnership with curators and the Wikipedia communities
Coordinating image or multimedia donations
Organizing visits/events (e.g. "backstage passes" for Wikipedians)
Organizing challenges and competitions that promote article improvement
Teaching about Wikipedia practices and values, etc.
Including sister projects (Wikimedia Commons, Wikisource, Wikivoyage, etc)
How to find a resident[edit]
The best way to locate a potential Wikipedian in Residence is to connect with your local Wikimedia chapter (if one exists) and/or via the talk page of an appropriate WikiProject on Wikipedia. Often these can be found through WikiProjects associated with your city, state, province, or country. Check the WikiProject Geographical Directory to get started. You can also contact us or send an email to glamwikimedia.org.
Essential Criteria[edit]
On-site attendance, "in residence" means being physically based in the organisation for all or part of the time; and being seen as a member of the staff team, not a visitor.
Working for mutual benefit while upholding the policies of both the institution and Wikimedia.
Enabling of community interaction in both directions.
Avoiding conflict of interest, especially when editing articles about the institution itself.
Teaching ability - to GLAM professionals about Wikimedia and vice versa.
Recommended experience and skills for success[edit]
Knowledge of the profession
Charisma to encourage a group of volunteers to support the project.
Presentation skills, and the patience to explain free-licenses/Wikipedia... frequently.
Understanding of Open and Volunteer Communities -- though many Wikimedians in Residence will be established Wikimedians, less experienced Wikimedians can fill WIR roles when supported by Wikimedians
Recommendations for the institution[edit]
On-staff "champion" who supports the project officially from within the organisation.
Clearly defined role for the project - not mixed with other social media/web management.
Sample job description[edit]
The National Archives seeks applicants for a Wikipedian in Residence for Summer 2011. The Wikipedian in Residence is a student intern role. The Wikipedian in Residence will work as a community coordinator and strengthen the relationship between the Archives and the Wikipedian community through a range of activities.
This may include:
promoting participation in new or existing WikiProjects related to the holdings of the National Archives;
adding content to the Wikimedia Commons and Wikisource sites from digital copies of the holdings of the National Archives;
assisting with the digitization and online posting of archival materials;
working with Archives staff to explain Wikipedia’s practices;
organizing special events, such as backstage pass tours or editing challenge days, for the Wikipedian community; and
sharing the experience with the Wikipedian community and the public via videos, newsletter articles, or blog posts on our NARAtions blog or other blogs.—National Archives and Records Administration (April 2011)
