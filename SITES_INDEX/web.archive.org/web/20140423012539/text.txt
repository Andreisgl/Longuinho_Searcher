British rock legends get their own music title for  PLAYSTATION®3 and PlayStation®2
2 FEBRUARY 2009 — Rock  fans will be able to recreate the excitement and magic of Queen’s iconic  stadium concerts in their own living rooms from March, with the launch  of SingStar® Queen, the first music video game based entirely on the  music of the seminal British band.
SingStar Queen will be  available this March on both PLAYSTATION 3 (PS3™) and PlayStation®2,  with individual Queen tracks available for download from SingStore™ on  PlayStation Network, the place to download some great individual tracks  for your SingStar Party.
The deal to produce SingStar Queen was put together by Martin Hewett  at Sony Computer Entertainment, Queen manager Jim Beach, Chris Jones and  Nick Oakes at EMI Music Publishing and Hywel Evans at EMI Music.
The  tracklisting features many of the classic songs that enabled Queen to  sell more than 300 million albums worldwide. Fans will be able to use  SingStar Queen to sing along to hits including Bohemian Rhapsody, We  Will Rock You, I Want To Break Free, Another One Bites The Dust and Don’t Stop Me Now.
EMI Music Publishing UK President  Guy Moot commented: “The Queen catalogue is undoubtedly one of the  jewels in EMI Music Publishing’s crown, and we’re delighted that we’ve  been able to help bring their music to the SingStar platform. Video  games are an increasingly important part of our business now, and I hope  that these fantastic songs help introduce yet another generation to the  incredible music written by one of Britain’s greatest ever bands.”
Rafael  McDonnell, EMI Music’s Vice President – Brand Partnerships, Licensing  & Synchronisation for Europe said: “We’re always looking to work  with partners who can help us introduce our artists’ music to consumers  in new and exciting ways. SingStar is a great, fun way for fans to  interact with their Queen favourites as well as bringing the band’s  fantastic and seminal catalogue to a new audience.”
