We'll soon be closing our live coverage, but here's a quick recap before we go:
      India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is the first to ever land near the lunar south pole, a completely unexplored part of the Moon
    
      The control room at India's space agency ISRO went wild, with scientists cheering and punching the air as the craft touched down
    
      Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared "India is now on the Moon!" and "the sky is not the limit" as he followed the launch by video link from South Africa where he is attending the Brics summit
    
      The lander has already sent back images of the Moon's surface - next, all going well, a six-wheeled rover will roll out of its belly and roam around the rocks and craters gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis
    
      With this, India joins a select group of countries – the US, Soviet Union and China  – that have successfully landed a spacecraft on the Moon

strewn with boulders and pitted with giant craters, sees little sunlight.But there are riches to be had there.It’s thought to hold important minerals - and some are
eyeing the polar region as a site for future mining.But its most important resource is its water. The huge
craters - permanently in shadow - hold ice.And not only would this be vital for human visitors - Nasa’s
Artemis mission is eventually aiming for a moon base here - but water when it’s
split into hydrogen and oxygen could be used as a future fuel for hopping off
to other parts of the solar system.But the water also holds some scientific treasures too.It’s thought that water on the Moon comes from space rocks
that crashed into the lunar surface early in its history – and it’s been
preserved, frozen in time.And studying it could give us new insight into the
beginnings of the solar system.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 16:39 23 Aug16:39 23 AugPutin sends 'heartfelt congratulations' to IndiaReutCopyright: ReutLavrov and Modi are currently in South Africa, attending the Brics summitImage caption: Lavrov and Modi are currently in South Africa, attending the Brics summitRussian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have offered their congratulations to India for its successful soft-landing on the Moon, days after the Russian attempt spiralled out of control and crashed.Putin sent his "heartfelt congratulations" to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and said the success was a "testament to the impressive progress made by India", Russia's state-owned news agency Tass quoted the Kremlin as saying.Lavrov told his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar: "I salute you.

Data from Nasa's LCROSS satellite, which crashed into a crater near the Moon’s south pole in 2009, also showed water ice in the plume kicked up on impact. Scientists have lab analyses of lunar samples (Apollo, Luna missions) and meteorites which show elevated levels of water in some parts of the sample like volcanic glass beads."All of the above could be explained by water or hydroxyl on the Moon, controlled by temperature differences - but the different data sets do not always correlate neatly," Prof Barber says.NASACopyright: NASAAn undated handout from Nasa with an illustration depicting water trapped in the lunar surface, alongside the craft that found itImage caption: An undated handout from Nasa with an illustration depicting water trapped in the lunar surface, alongside the craft that found itThe importance of lander missions such as Chandrayaan-3 is that
they will provide "ground truth" for all of these remote measurements -
providing detail at the very local scale.But the main caveat is that neither Chandrayaan-3 nor the doomed
Luna-25 had payloads "optimised" for the detection and measurement of water
ice, Prof Barber says."They will provide unique information, but we still need
dedicated instruments to be landed on the Moon to make more precise
measurements."Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 15:39 23 Aug15:39 23 AugNew images of Moon's surface taken by landerIsroCopyright: IsroThese Images, taken during the Chandrayaan-3

"This is a validation of many of the advanced technologies that the space agency has developed," Rajagopalan says.When India's space programme began, interplanetary or deep space missions were not part of the goals, but the development of its capabilities has established it as a global space power."India's attempt is not duplicating what others have done, but complementing it: we want to expand humanity's understanding of the lunar surface," she adds.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 15:09 23 Aug15:09 23 AugWhere spacecraft have landed on the MoonOnly four countries have successfully landed a craft on the moon - the US, the former Soviet Union, China and now India.

Literally. After that, panels on one of its sides will open and a ramp will be deployed to enable Pragyaan, the rover, to slide down to the surface.It will then begin the Moon walk - moving at a speed of 1cm per second, it will roam around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images. Pragyaan will only communicate with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.The
landing coincides with the start of a lunar day – a day on the Moon equals 28
days on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of
sunlight to charge their batteries. Once night falls, they will discharge and
stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the
next lunar day starts.The lander and the rover are carrying five scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it.

This is less than half the $200m cost of Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft which crashed on Sunday. India’s previous Moon and Mars missions were also carried out at a modest cost, according to reports by Indian media.They attribute this to Isro's efforts to prevent “wastage of products”.Explaining why India’s Mars mission cost less than its US counterpart, UK space scientist Prof Andrew Coates told the BBC that India restricted the payload of the Mangalyaan craft to 15kg, which kept the successful mission “small”.India’s launch costs could go lower still as the country plans to build a new spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, senior Isro scientists told BBC Tamil. The port with an ideal launch location will reduce transportation costs.Reported by the BBC's Nikhila Henry in DelhiArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 13:31 23 Aug13:31 23 AugA look back at India's space programmeZoya MateenBBC News, DelhiWhen the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) was founded in 1969, its primary goal was fairly simple - to design and launch satellites for forecasting storms, mitigating floods and bolstering telecommunications in the country.Now the space agency has made history after its Chandrayaan-3 became the first space mission to land near the south pole of the MoonIt’s a huge moment, especially for a country which operates on a fraction of what others spend on space exploration.But behind the milestone mission, dubbed at the most ambitious yet for India, lies years of effort.In the beginning, India space missions were carried out with the help of other countries and it wasn’t until the 1990s that Isro began to design and launch satellites on its own.Since then the country has achieved significant milestones to emerge as a leader in space missions.Getty ImagesCopyright: Getty ImagesIn 2009, India sent a robotic orbiter called Chandrayaan-1 to the moon, which helped discover that water ice can exist on the lunar surface.In 2014, India successfully put a satellite into orbit around Mars, becoming the fourth nation to do so.And in 2017, India created history by successfully launching 104 satellites on a single mission, overtaking the previous record of 37 satellites launched by Russia in 2014.The journey has been hardly easy - and yet here we are.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 13:23 23 Aug13:23 23 Aug'This is the work of a generation of scientists'An overjoyed S Somnath, the chief of Isro, addressed a gathering

his "endless support and faith" in the space agency's work"I also want to thank each and every person who prayed the
mission is a success," he told a beaming crowd."This is not our work alone, this is the work of a

them up the space superpower list.Landing on the Moon
is far from easy – as Russia’s attempt this week highlighted – and many
missions have failed, including India’s first attempt.But it was second
time lucky, and India now joins three other nations - the US,
the former Soviet Union and China - who’ve successfully touched down on the
lunar surface.And they’re now ready to explore an area where no
other spacecraft has been – the lunar south pole.There’s growing scientific interest here. The
craters in this region are permanently in shadow and contain frozen water.This would be a crucial resource for future human
exploration - Nasa’s Artemis mission, which is sending astronauts to the Moon,
is targeting this region too.Water would also be crucial for propelling us
further out into the solar system. Splitting it into its constituent parts of hydrogen
and oxygen could provide a potential fuel for exploring places like Mars and
beyond.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.to-topLatest PostPage 1 of 4rewindpreviousNavigate to the next pagenextNavigate to the last pageforwardBack to topRelated StoriesThe race to unravel the mysteries of Moon's south pole Related StoriesIndia's Moon lander searches for safe landing spot Related StoriesIndia's latest Moon mission sends first photos Related StoriesHistoric India Moon mission lifts off successfully Related StoriesRussia's Luna-25 spacecraft crashes into Moon Related Stories
