A Wikivoyage Expedition is a special project for Wikivoyage articles or images. (Sure, we could call them "projects", but what fun is that?) Expeditions help Wikivoyagers collaborate and organize around certain subjects, be they based on shared interests, geography, or shared skills.

Starting a new Expedition[edit]
If you have a good idea for a new Expedition, here are the steps necessary to organize it.
Make sure that the Expedition complies with Wikivoyage's goals. Will the Expedition help us reach our mission of creating a free, complete, up-to-date and reliable world-wide travel guide? Or is it a slippery slope into non-travel-oriented distraction?
Propose the Expedition in the travellers' pub and get some feedback from other Wikivoyagers.
Create a page in the Wikivoyage namespace called "Name of expedition Expedition" (note capitalization). On that page, give a rationale for why the Expedition is needed, and define the concrete goals of the Expedition.
If additional pages are needed for the Expedition — for example, template pages — link to them from the Expedition page.
