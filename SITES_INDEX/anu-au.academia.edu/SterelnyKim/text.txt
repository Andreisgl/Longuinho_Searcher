One is the Clark–Chalmers model, extended further by Clark and others. The other derives from niche construction models of evolution, models which emphasise the role of active agency in enhancing the adaptive fit between agent and world. In the human case, much niche construction is epistemic: making cognitive tools and assembling other informational resources that support and scaffold intelligent action. I shall argue that extended mind cases are limiting cases of environmental scaffolding, and while the extended mind picture is not false, the niche construction model is a more helpful framework for understanding human action.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cumulative Cultural Evolution and the Origins of Language Introduction: Aims and AssumptionsIn this article, I present a substantive proposal about the timing and nature of the final stage ... more In this article, I present a substantive proposal about the timing and nature of the final stage of the evolution of full human language, the transition from so-called ''protolanguage'' to language, and on the origins of a simple protolanguage with structure and displaced reference ; a proposal that depends on the idea that the initial expansion of communicative powers in our lineage involved a much expanded role for gesture and mime. But though it defends a substantive proposal, the article also (perhaps more importantly) defends and illustrates a methodological proposal too. I argue that language is a special case of a more general phenomenon—cumulative cultural evolution—and while we rarely have direct information about communication, we have more direct information about the cumulative cultural evolution of technical skill, ecological strategies, and social complexity. These same factors also enable us to make a reasonable estimate of the intergenerational social learning capacities of these communities (on which rich communication depends) and of the communicative demands these communities face. For example, we can, at least tentatively, identify forms of cooperation that are stable only if third party information is transmitted widely, cheaply, and accurately. So we can use these more direct markers of information accumulation to locate, in broad terms, the period in our evolutionary history during which we became lingual.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I distinguish three mechanisms of cultural evolution: niche construction leading to cultural group selection; the vertical flow of cultural information from parents to their children, and the replication and spread of memes. I further argue that both cultural group selection and the vertical flow of cultural information have been important. More conjecturally, I identify a potential role for meme-based cultural evolution in the explanation of the 'human revolution' of the last 100 000 or so years, and defuse an important objection to that explanation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The same is true of many experimental projects, as these typically impose food acquisition task on their experimental subjects. (ii) That neglect is important, because inno- vations often pose collective action problems; the hominin species were technically innovative because they were also socially adaptable as well; (iii) in part for this reason, there remains a disconnect between research on hominin innovation and research on animal innovation. (iv) Finally, the paper suggests that there is something of a disconnect between the theoretical work on innovation in hominin evolution (based on theories of cultural evol- ution) and the experimental tradition on human innovation. That disconnect is largely due to the theoretical work retreating from strong claims about the proximate mechanisms of human cultural accumulation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It does not defend a global claim about the overall contingency of history. Rather, it aims to identify and explain the difference between robust and fragile historical trajectories. It does so by considering a set of contrasting cases and by identifying critical differences amongst the cases. The analysis shows that one important source of contingency is the historical emergence of command-and-control institutions; one important source of robustness is the existence of population-level processes structured by relatively stable institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From Signal to Symbol: The Evolution of Languageby Ronald Planer and Sterelny KimMIT Press,  2021From Publisher (MIT Press) website: 
"In From Signal to Symbol, Ronald Planer and Kim Sterelny p... more From Publisher (MIT Press) website: "In From Signal to Symbol, Ronald Planer and Kim Sterelny propose a novel theory of language, proposing that modern language is the product of a long series of increasingly rich protolanguages evolving over the last two million years. Arguing that language and cognition coevolved, they give a central role to archaeological evidence and they attempt to infer cognitive capacities on the basis of that evidence, which they link in turn to communicative capacities.Countering other accounts, which move directly from archaeological traces to language, Planer and Sterelny show that rudimentary forms of many of the elements on which language depends can be found in the great apes and were part of the equipment of the earliest species in our lineage. After outlining the constraints a theory of the evolution of language should satisfy and filling in the details of their model, they take up the evolution of words, composite utterances, and hierarchical structure. They consider the transition from a predominantly gestural to a predominantly vocal form of language and discuss the economic and social factors that led to language. Finally, they evaluate their theory in terms of the constraints previously laid out."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
