No senior should have to overpay for life-saving drugs to pad Big Pharma’s pockets. My Administration is announcing the first 10 Medicare Part D drugs selected for price negotiation.  We're ending the days of deciding between buying your medicine or putting food on the table.  If you're one of the people who will get some breathing room after prescription drug costs go down, text me at (302) 404-0880 and let me know what this means for you and your family.
 
Earlier this week, before Idalia made landfall, I approved an Emergency Declaration at the request of Governor DeSantis and directed FEMA to pre-deploy resources so we could respond in the hurricane’s aftermath as quickly as possible.  As we continue to monitor the storm, teams are on the ground to work with the first responders in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, get people to safety, and begin to recover from the storm’s impact.
 
I spoke with Govs. DeSantis, Kemp, McMaster, and Cooper to reiterate my Administration's support for response and recovery in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina as Idalia makes landfall.  We'll keep working with personnel on the ground as the storm progresses.

Today, on the 60th Anniversary of the March on Washington, we commit to continue walking towards our nation’s founding promise.  Reminded of how far we’ve come. And where we need to go.

I came to office determined to change the economic direction of this country and to move from trickle-down economics to my middle out, bottom up vision:  Bidenomics.
 
Ahead of Labor Day, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule that would ensure more workers receive the pay and benefits they deserve.
 
 
Under President Biden’s economic plan, our economy has remained strong even as we continue to make progress on inflation.
 
This was the front page of UNC-Chapel Hill's Daily Tar Heel.   No student, no parent, and no American should have to send texts like these to their loved ones as they hide from a shooter.   I'll continue to do all I can to reduce gun violence and call on Congress to do the same.
