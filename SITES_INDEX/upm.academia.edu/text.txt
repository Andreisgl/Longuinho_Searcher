This is the first study aims to explore the association between three factors; noise, work stress and coping strategies and sleep quality among manufacturing workers. This study employed cross-sectional study design involving 140 cable manufacturing workers who were recruited via simple random sampling. The Malay-version Stress Overload Scale (SOS) was used to measure stress overload. Coping strategies was assessed via Coping Strategy Indicator (CSI) and sleep quality was estimated by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). All respondents were male and most of them were Malay, married and working as machine operator. Results showed that at least 50% of the subject were exposed to the noise level of more than 86.83 dB (A).

Data was obtained by daily inspection of 85 Aedes mosquito potential breeding point at 15 dengue outbreak hotspot localities with at least one mosquito predator present at the locality and the VEKPRO programme used in the monitoring of dengue cases in Malaysia. The mosquito predators identified were dragonfly, dragonfly nymph, gambushia fish, tadpole and frog. The study was done at the district of Petaling from 4th January, 2015 to 4th July 2015.

A specific amount of phosphine gas (PH3) released from the CaC2 reaction with moisture is known to be toxic to respiratory system. This study was carried out to evaluate the potential risk of the CaC2 and PH3 among mango farmers and fruit sellers. The sample size was 200 respondents recruited by universal sampling in Perak, Kedah and Perlis. The procedure to perform chemical health risk assessment (CHRA) was based on the Use and Standard of Exposure of Chemical Hazards to Health Regulations 2000. The permissible exposure limit for PH3 is 0.3 ppm 8. The average TWA for carbide wrapping and ripening in the farm (C) and at the fruit stall (D) was 0.033 ppm while for sales activities at the fruit stall (E) was 0.017 ppm. Thus, the magnitude rating for C and D was ≥ 0.1 O.E.L but &lt; 0.5 O.E.L and for E was &lt; 0.1 O.E.L.

Examining Nursing Fatigue Levels and Antecedents: An Integrative Literature ReviewInternational Journal of Nursing and Health Care Research,  2021The existing literature demonstrates that work related fatigue can impede the delivery of quality... more The existing literature demonstrates that work related fatigue can impede the delivery of quality nursing care. There is a need to document and develop fatigue mitigation strategies to protect nursing and patient safety. There is therefore a need to explore and investigate the different types of nursing fatigue, their antecedent factors, and the ideal fatigue management strategies. The focus on nursing fatigue is on their level and prevalence of lethargy and tiredness both on shift and while off shift. The study rationale was to devise strategies and avenues through which fatigue cannot only be mitigated but also proactively addressed. In developing the study, secondary data was used. This was through examining peer-reviewed articles. These were 630 form SCOPUS, 970 from CINAHL), and 247 MEDLINE.After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, only 36 of the articles were retained. Of these 36 articles, A majority were quantitative with the rest being either qualitative or adopting a mixed methodology design. Besides additional findings, the study demonstrated that some of the antecedents to nursing fatigue involve work structure and shift patterns, the nurses&amp;#39; gender, culture, and personal attributes. There are three types of fatigue chronic, acute, and inter-shift. The occurrence and levels of fatigue for the three types was reported as varying from moderate to high. Regarding mitigation, there are three levels, namely the organization, team leader, and individual nurses where intervention is recommended. All stakeholders should contribute in managing and coping with nursing fatigue. Tweetable Abstract Nursing fatigue rise exposes the nurses, their patients, and the public to increased health and safety risks. Contribution of the Paper What is Already Known about the Topic? • Nurses fatigue index impacts on their professional working • Nurse&amp;#39;s fatigue has an impact on patients care quality What the Paper Adds • The paper demonstrates the need to mitigate nursing fatigue as a tool for promoting patients and public safety. • Demonstration of the need to create awareness among nurses as personal and individual level initiatives are core in coping with nursing fatigue.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
