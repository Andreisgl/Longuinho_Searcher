Bigipedia given second series
Bigipedia given second series

BCG can exclusively report today that Radio 4 sketch show Bigipedia has been given a second series.
Creator, co-writer and co-star of the show, Nick Doody, told us via Twitter that a second series lasting four episodes has been commissioned.
The series is based on (fake) website Bigipedia, a parody of Wikipedia and other similar 'informative' websites. Bigipedia contains annoying pop-ups, information overloads, strange disambiguation pages and a range of unusual articles. These including the true origins of The Teddy Bears' Picnic and a series of disturbing Uruguayan health and safety adverts.
The first series, broadcast in 2009, came second for the award for Best British Radio Sketch Show in BCG's Comedy.co.uk Awards. That Mitchell & Webb Sound took first place.
