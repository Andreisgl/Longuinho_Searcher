       Grammys winners: full list

It was Adele's year. The artist heads the Brit Awards winners' list for 2012, with 21 selling a copy every seven seconds - and has just won a clutch of Grammys too. Someone Like You has now been seen more than 85m times on YouTube and sales of 21 are already at 17m and expected to top 20m. 
The awards have been going since 1977, when the Best British solo act was Shirley Bassey and the Beatles when a prize for Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - already a decade old then. Now the prize is the major award for British music acts, competing only with the Mercury Award for best album. So, how does the 2012 winner's list compare?
Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran shared the honours – also winning two awards, for best British male solo act and best breakthrough act.

   What a Brit looks like  
Best British single, voted for by the public, was won by One Direction for What Makes You Beautiful. Rihanna – who performed on the night – took home best international female award and singer-songwriter Bruno Mars was named best international male solo artist.
Lana Del Rey was international breakthrough act, after the huge success of her single Video Games.
Older groups also succeeded. The Foo Fighters were named best international band while Coldplay took home the prize for best British group. And Blur won the award for outstanding contribution. 
The awards have changed a lot since 1977. In that year, there were only seven categories - now there are 13. Each awards reflects the industry of the time, at least recently. Last year, the winners were Take That and Mumford and Sons; in 2005 it was Joss Stone, the Scissor Sisters and Robbie Williams. Some of the older awards appear to be a little more, er, mainstream: in 2000, Tom Jones won Best British Male Solo Artist. 
The full data is below. What can you do with it?
