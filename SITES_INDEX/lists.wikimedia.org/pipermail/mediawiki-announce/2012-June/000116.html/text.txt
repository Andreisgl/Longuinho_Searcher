I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.17.5. One security issue
was discovered.
Both Chris Steipp and Formafix discovered that the uselang http parameter
was vulnerable to XSS.
For more details, see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36938
Chris Steipp also improved the blacklisting of bad elements in SVG files.
This includes catching known
hostile files, and also disallowing the upload of svg files that include
remote resources.
This is work is part of an on-going effort to prevent exploits being hidden
in uploaded SVG files.
