Texts pertaining to divination appear already at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE and the tradition continued up until the very end of cuneiform culture. But the lifespan of Mesopotamian divination is much longer than two millennia. It gestated in the 3rd millennium and remnants live on to this day in astrology and astronomy. This volume is dedicated to the sources from the 1st millennium. They are rich and varied, consisting of technical and theoretical works, explanatory texts, commentaries as well as ephemeral sources for the practical use of divination in the life of king and commoner. From being the preserves of a very few specialists, divination has become an important topic of study with new text editions and studies appearing every year, this book provides a survey of the sources, as well as an introduction to the history, theory and practice of the various divination genres.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Or was his method fundamentally different?To answer this I would ask: Is his diagnostic handbook and procedure divinatory in nature at all? Does the āšipu’s diagnosis answer questions usually answered by divination? Does the diagnostic procedure, as illustrated by Babylonian/Assyrian diagnostic texts, contribute to healing in the ways divination does, according to recent anthropological research?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

If "real" time was indeed perceived of as moving forward in a line, in divination the link between sign and event in time moved both ways depending on whether the process was diagnostic or prognostic, at the same time, time itself was to some extent suspended during the ritual. This paper will attempt to apply cognitive perspectives to elucidate the concept of time as attested in Mesopotamian divinatory practices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
