People, living their lives the very best they can. Struggling. Dreaming. Striving. Hoping to provide for families, and run errands, and live their lives....  But when there is a need, when an individual is in pain, when someone regardless of their differences is in need of help, people step up.  Turns out, during times of adversity our own arrogance and selfishness and political leanings fade as we realize we are all in the same family.  And we do care.  My friends, this too shall pass, we’re truly in this together and the best is yet to come. The struggles of the world won’t fade, but you’ll be inspired and empowered to joyfully move forward, together.Released:Nov 10, 2020Format:Podcast episodeTitles in the series (40)Expected to die, today he’s inspiring others to truly live.
