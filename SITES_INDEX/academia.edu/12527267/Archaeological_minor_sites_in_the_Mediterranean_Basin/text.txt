Intermediate Bronze Age/Early Bronze IV, Middle Bronze shaft tombs, and at least two major Iron II burial caves (Tomb A7 and the Barmil's Tomb) excavated by the Palestinian MOTA-DACH in an Iron Age cemetery allow to draw up a renewed picture of Bethlehem and its environs and give the opportunity to re-appraise its long history.Download Free PDFView PDFA Guide to PalestineHamdan  TahaA Guide to Palestine is a simple tourist guide to the Palestinian Occupied Territory of 1967, presenting the main tourist attractions, including cities, archeological sites, historical monuments, religious sites, culture, flora, fauna and cuisine.

The Committee emphasized the exceptional universal value of Palestinian heritage and decided to provide financial and technical support to establish an inventory of cultural and natural heritage in Palestine. The inventory consists of 20 cultural and natural sites that reflect the cultural and natural diversity of Palestine. The sites were selected by the Palestinian Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities through a consultative process that involved a national team of Palestinian experts from different public and private institutions with the financial support of the World heritage Fund and the technical assistance of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre and the UNESCO Ramallah Office. It is noteworthy to mention that the “Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls” was inscribed on the world heritage list in 1981. The first English edition was published in Ramallah in 2005 and submitted to the World Heritage Committee in its 29th session in Durban, South Africa for formal endorsement. In 2006 the Arab League for Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ALECSO) published the first Arabic edition of this inventory in Tunis. In 2009 a second edition of the inventory was published in Ramallah in both Arabic and English languages.Download Free PDFView PDFINTRODUCING OLIVE CULTURE IN PALESTINEmaissoun sharkawiDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Heritage StudiesUrban Regeneration/Heritage Tourism Endeavours: The Case of Salt, Jordan ‘Local Actors, International Donors, and the State2005 • Rami DaherDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal:  Traditional Dwellings & Settlement Review / Paper Title:  Gentrification and the Politics of Power, Capital and Culture in an Emerging Jordanian Heritage IndustryGentrification and the Politics of Power, Capital and Culture in an Emerging Jordanian Heritage Industry1999 • Rami DaherDownload Free PDFView PDFIsraeli Archaeological Activity in the West Bank 1967 - 2007: A Sourcebook2009 • Raphael GreenbergDownload Free PDFView PDFJOURNAL OF TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENTTourism Impacts in the Site of Umm Qais: An OverviewMairna MustafaDownload Free PDFView PDFBeit Sahour and its Aramaic areas names Beit Sahour Research for the meaning of its areas names2020 • Adeeb GhanemThe city of Beit Sahour is one of the ancient cities of Palestine and is located east of Bethlehem. It is where the angels announce to the shepherds the birth of Jesus Christ. Beit Sahour is about two kilometers away from the Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem. It is noticeable that the name of Beit Sahour and the names of the others ancient heritage places is due to the Aramaic language that prevailed in Palestine at the time of Jesus Christ, and the people of Beit Sahour still keep these names and circulate them among themselves to this day even now their language is ArabicDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
