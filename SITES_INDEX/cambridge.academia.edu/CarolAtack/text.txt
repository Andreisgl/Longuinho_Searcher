Lectured on Thucydides and the West.Current research is focused on fourth-century BCE Greek political thought, especially temporality and change in Greek political thought. I am preparing a monograph on the temporality of Plato's dialogues. I'm also interested in Xenophon's ethical thought, and in new approaches to the history of democracy.My first monograph, The Discourse of Kingship in Greek Political thought, develops work begun in my PhD thesis, 'Debating kingship: models of monarchy in 5th and 4th century BCE Greek political thought'. It investigates the continuing interest in the idea of monarchy in Greek political thought during the classical period in democratic Athens. I explore the use of monarchy across different literary genres, and for different argumentative and rhetorical purposes, and track changing responses to the idea of monarchy in changing political and historical contexts. Monarchy provides a privileged lens for viewing the relationship between individual and polis, and ways of calculating the balance between parts and whole of the city. Ancient critiques of monarchy as a form of rule help to show that democracy is not the only form of constitution that receives a negative evaluation from early theorists. This builds on work begun in my 2010 MPhil dissertation, ‘Ancestral constitutions in fourth-century BCE Athenian political argument: genre and re-invention’, which examined the role of ‘ancestral constitution’ arguments in fourth century BCE Athenian responses to democracy.My broader interests lie in ancient political philosophy, the history of political thought (particularly the reception of ancient political thought within 20th century and contemporary political thought), the history of democracy, historiography and the philosophy of history.Supervisors: Paul Cartledge and Malcolm SchofieldAddress: Newnham CollegeCambridgeCB3 9DFless561 Followers228 FollowingTotal Views ;FollowFollowingCVall6 Books11 Papers8 Book Reviews3 Talks1 Conference PresentationsMore  1 Blog postsBooksA Cultural History Of Democracy, Volume 1, AntiquityThe origins of democracy can be traced in a general way to the earliest civilizations, beginning ... more The origins of democracy can be traced in a general way to the earliest civilizations, beginning with the early urban societies of the Middle-East, and can be seen in cities and communities across the Mediterranean world and Asia. In classical Athens, male citizens enjoyed full participation in the political life of the city and a flourishing democratic culture, as explored in detail in this volume. In other times and places democratic features were absent from the formal structures of regimes,but could still be found in the participatory structures of local social institutions. This volume surveys democracy broadly as a cultural phenomenon operating in different ways across a very wide range of ancient societies throughout Antiquity. It examines the experiences of those living in democratic communities and considers how ancient practices of democracy differ from our own. Each chapter takes a different theme as its focus: sovereignty; liberty and the rule of law; the “common good”; economic and social democracy; religion and theprinciples of political obligation; citizenship and gender; ethnicity, race, and nationalism; democratic crises, revolutions and civil resistance; international relations; and beyond the Polis. These ten different approaches to democracy in Antiquity add up to an extensive, synoptic coverage of the subject. Paul Cartledge is A.G.

Anachronism and AntiquityBloomsbury Academic,  2020This book is a study both of anachronism in antiquity and of anachronism as a vehicle for underst... more This book is a study both of anachronism in antiquity and of anachronism as a vehicle for understanding antiquity. It explores the post-classical origins and changing meanings of the term 'anachronism' as well as the presence of anachronism in all its forms in classical literature, criticism and material objects. Contrary to the position taken by many modern philosophers of history, this book argues that classical antiquity had a rich and varied understanding of historical difference, which is reflected in sophisticated notions of anachronism. This central hypothesis is tested by an examination of attitudes to temporal errors in ancient literary texts and chronological writings and by analysing notions of anachronistic survival and multitemporality. Rather than seeing a sense of anachronism as something that separates modernity from antiquity, the book suggests that in both ancient writings and their modern receptions chronological rupture can be used as a way of creating a dialogue between past and present. With a selection of case-studies and theoretical discussions presented in a manner suitable for scholars and students both of classical antiquity and of modern history, anthropology, and visual culture, the book's ambition is to offer a new conceptual map of antiquity through the notion of anachronism.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It also discusses kingship in Greek philosophy: the Socratics’ identification of an ‘art of kingship’, and Xenophon and Isocrates’ model of ‘virtue monarchy’. In turn, these allow a rereading of explorations of kingship and excellence in Plato’s later political thought, seen as a critique of these models, and also in Aristotle’s account of total kingship or pambasileia, treated here as a counterfactual device developed to explore the epistemic benefits of democracy.This book offers a fascinating insight into the institution of monarchy in classical Greek thought and society, both for those working on Greek philosophy and politics, and also for students of the history of political thought.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

PapersThe shepherd king and his flock: paradoxes of leadership and care in classical Greek philosophyParadox and Power in Caring Leadership: Critical and Philosophical Reflections,  2020When Xenophon, the fourth-century BCE Athenian soldier and writer, and once one of Socrates’ stud... more When Xenophon, the fourth-century BCE Athenian soldier and writer, and once one of Socrates’ students, tried to explain the nature of leadership, in his extended case study and biography of Cyrus the Great, king of Persia in the sixth century BCE and founder of its empire, his Cyropaedia, he turned to a familiar image, that of the king or leader as shepherd. For Xenophon, Cyrus provided a model of how to lead and inspire troops, and how, after the campaign was over, to set up a stable government in the conquered territory. Xenophon explores what qualities enabled Cyrus to rule more successfully than others. But when he invokes the image of the king as shepherd, Xenophon opens a set of questions about the consequences of the unequal and asymmetric relationship between leaders and those they lead, as well as emphasising the centrality of care to ideas of what constituted good leadership. Like other thinkers of his time, the image of the ruler as shepherd enables a debate on the paradoxes of leadership and care (Brock 2013: 43-52).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Tradition and Innovation in the Polis-Kosmos AnalogyCosmos in the Ancient World,  2019Published in Cosmos in the Ancient World, edited by Phil Horky, Cambridge University Press, 2019.... more Published in Cosmos in the Ancient World, edited by Phil Horky, Cambridge University Press, 2019. The analogy between the divine order of the kosmos and the human order of the polis was well established in Greek thought, and the basis of a persistent but evolving political cosmology that attempted to link human and divine. The analogy is well attested in literary evidence, although the use of kosmos-derived terms in archaic political structures from several Greek cities in some cases pre-dates the repurposing of kosmos language by early philosophers. These developments in the scope of kosmos language meant that this analogy underwent substantial change in the classical period, as philosophical ideas of nature and the divine challenged traditional formulations of one side of the analogy, and the development of the polis, and particularly radical Athenian democracy, challenged the other. Although the analogy is one that is fundamental to Greek thought, as Geoffrey Lloyd has shown, its origins lie much more firmly in the human end of the analogy, in the arrangement of forces by military leaders and in the anthropomorphism by which Greek gods were seen in terms of human leadership. One established view of the polis-kosmos analogy in Presocratic thought is that its use of the language of human justice, with the forces of the kosmos conceptualised in terms of retribution and repayment, and with an emphasis on equality between such forces, imbued it with a democratic tinge. For example, Anaximander (DK 12 A9-11) in early testimony for this new usage of kosmos language, describes the heavens and the world(s) within them as subject to such forces. 5 But perhaps some caution should be exercised in assimilating Presocratic cosmology to the politics of democratic Athens, rather than to broader models of political change operating in a world with multiple possibilities for types of rule, and multiple models of justice. A broader examination of the use of kosmos language in political contexts, both in literary texts and in documentary sources, shows that the analogy could be applied in many differing forms and in different political contexts, but had a strong association with archaic and aristocratic world-views. This chapter will therefore show that the kosmos-polis analogy was contested, with a more democratic version briefly visible in the fifth-century BCE eventually losing out to a less democratic version, more evident in both fourth-century texts and in political nomenclature that persisted into the Hellenistic era. I will argue that, as the polis became less aristocratic, alternative formulations of the analogy, such as those found in Aristophanes' comedies, repositioned it in a democratic context. But the relationship of the comedic, democratic version to philosophical investigations into cosmology and cosmogony is not straightforward.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Beyond the insights that using such theories as a lens can provide, I want to argue that Xenophon himself with his focus on appearance (phainomai) and performance (epideiknumi) exemplifies an ancient performative turn, exemplified in the description of his appearance at the royal procession and its effect on his friends. Further, connecting Xenophon’s focus on Cyrus’ performance as king and exemplar with Aristotle’s ethical thought on habituation could reposition Xenophon as a resource for virtue approaches to ethics and epistemology,Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the many works of his long career show a continuing engagement with Athenian political culture and the education of its political class, and his assessment of Sparta is significant for both of these. He imagines and explores the struggle for hegemony between Athens, Sparta and other Greek poleis, before the rise of Macedon reshaped the Greek political landscape, and does so through a series of works that aim to create and modify Athenian political identities, and to examine claims to lead any Panhellenic project, through his novel use of literary discourse.

Aristotle's pambasileia and the metaphysics of monarchy, Polis (2015) 32:2, 297-320Aristotle’s account of kingship in Politics 3 responds to the rich discourse on kingship that per... more Aristotle’s account of kingship in Politics 3 responds to the rich discourse on kingship that permeates Greek political thought (notably in the works of Herodotus, Xenophon and Isocrates), in which the king is the paradigm of virtue, and also the instantiator and guarantor of order, linking the political microcosm to the macrocosm of the universe. Both models, in separating the individual king from the collective citizenry, invite further, more abstract thought on the importance of the king in the foundation of the polity, whether the king can be considered part of, or separate from, the polis, and the relationship between polis and universe. In addressing these aspects of kingship theories, Aristotle explores a ‘metaphysics of monarchy’, part of the long-running mereological problem of parts and wholes in the construction of the polis, and connectinghis account of kingship to his thought on citizenship and distributive justicewithin the polis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article explores the transition from drama to history as a vehicle for these stories, and the exploitation of this transition in Isocrates’ political rhetoric, conflating myth and history. While Euripides’ democratic king Theseus represented an idealised active citizen, Isocrates retold Athenian myth to show that the good qualities of Athenian democracy depend on their origins in the city’s political foundation by Theseus, and that citizens shouldachieve the good life through imitating virtuous monarchs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
How to be a good king in Athens – manipulating monarchy in the democratic political imaginaryThe depiction of monarchy in Athenian drama has puzzled many commentators, who have argued that t... more The depiction of monarchy in Athenian drama has puzzled many commentators, who have argued that the figure of the ‘democratic king’ is an anachronism. Other critics have taken a historicising approach, and interpreted the presence of the democratic king in tragedy as the retrojection of debate about the quality of contemporary democratic political leaders such as Pericles into the mythical environment of tragedy.However, I shall argue that the tragedians manipulate Athenian foundation myths to present the city’s mythical monarchs, Theseus and Erechtheus, as the focus and origin of political power, and to question the democracy’s claim to political legitimacy. The mythical king is reconfigured to query the legitimacy of the Athenian constitution and the construction of Athenian ideology.The role of the good king in the Athenian political imaginary seems to be to represent and embody the political unity of Athens, and the city’s orderly relationship with the gods and cosmic order. Their narratives show the difficulties in maintaining this order, specifically in handling crises such as supplication by outsiders whose religious or political status is problematic; good kingship is demonstrated by making the correct responses to military, political and religious challenges to the order and unity of the city, such as the arrival of Oedipus, the Heracleidae, and the Argives. Should Euripides’ and Sophocles’ manipulations of myths be read as authorising the transfer to democracy, or undermining its claims to power?Tragedy clearly rejects the ‘bad’ form of single-person rule, tyranny; the audience at the City Dionysia could assess potentially tyrannical rulers (such as Creon in Sophocles’ Antigone and other Theban plays) against the recognised (though contested) category of tyrant.In contrast, the tragedians create the category of good kingship through linking monarchy to Athenian democratic political values, a sophisticated manipulation of the political imaginary. As the fifth century BCE reaches a close, and Athenian democracy falters, the values exhibited by the good king begin to match those idealised by the struggling city (for example in the public funeral speeches) as democracy’s opponents gain ascendance in Athenian political debate.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The practices of ancient democracy, such as greater citizen participation, and selection for office by lot, have attracted contemporary campaigners for political reform (David Reybrouck, 'Against Elections'; Brett Hennig, 'The End of Politicians'). Should Athenian democracy be treated as one case study among many, or does it deserve to be treated as an exceptional case? Johanna Hanink's 'Classical Debt' shows one problematic way in which Athenian history has been used, and offers a cautionary model for retelling the history of democracy. (Final manuscript available via hcommons.org - see link)Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Greek Democracy Now, ARGO, Aut/Winter 2016Our anxieties about democracy – what counts as democratic practice, what constitutes acceptable p... more Our anxieties about democracy – what counts as democratic practice, what constitutes acceptable public speech, what kinds of institutions we expect to be 'democratic' – have rarely been so pressing and explicit. While political philosophers and historians have long debated these questions, the electoral tumult of 2016 has made them even more urgent, as events appear to spiral into what political philosopher Jürgen Habermas once labelled a 'legitimation crisis', in which the authority of institutions and government itself is challenged. But can the ancient world, with its very different political systems, and particularly the radical participatory democracies of classical Athens, offer any insights or solutions to our current problems? Frequent appeals to Athens and its practices might suggest so. Newspaper opinion pages have been full of classical comparisons, often between America's Donald Trump and Athens' Cleon, often decorated with allusions to Plato's Republic or Thucydides' account of Athenian democracy during the Peloponnesian War. Athenian direct democracy, in which individual citizens played an active role in decision-making, has a complicated relationship with modern democracy, invoked as an emblem if not necessarily a template; its appeal has often been to radicals rather than to conservative idealists, unlike the more easily assimilated Roman republic. Would our democracy be more authentic, more acceptable, if it were more like the Athenian model, delivering the 'wisdom of the multitude' identified by Aristotle, or would it, as other ancient commentators such as Plato and Thucydides suggested, be led into disaster by demagogues, encouraging the folly of the masses as they vote for their own destruction? With established models of modern representative and even technocratic, bureaucratic democracy losing their appeal, campaigners have looked to features of ancient democracy – selection of officers by lot rather than election, the emphasis on scrutiny and audit of officials – to restore the missing sense of legitimacy and authenticity. As our perspectives change, it's time for a new look at the history of democracy. Our knowledge of the Athenian past has also changed; while there have been no literary discoveries to equal the nineteenth-century publication of the recovered Aristotelian Constitution of the Athenians, new finds and advances in the interpretation of material evidence – better dating of the inscriptions that are a particular feature of Athenian democratic culture, and better understanding of ancient economic activity through the analysis of coin finds – mean that it's not just because of changing cultural fashion that we should revisit the history of Athenian democracy. We can ask harder questions of literary sources such as Thucydides and read them less naively. We can acknowledge the limitations of ancient political practice, the exclusion of women from political activity, the dependence of Athens on its slave economy and economic migrants (and perhaps now we can acknowledge that slavery, migration and the incorporation of previously excluded voices remain troubling and unresolved in modern democracies, despite our histories of reform and enfranchisement). One thing that is much more clear now than in earlier accounts is that democracy has a history marked by change and discontinuity, even during the classical period. While Thomas Mitchell restricts his Democracy's Beginnings: the Athenian story to Athens up to 323 BCE, he emphasises the gradual development of democracy throughout that period and, perhaps the hallmark of current thought on Athenian democracy, that the fourth-century restored democracy was more stable and even democratic than its radical fifth-century predecessor.

Tradition and Innovation in the Polis-Kosmos AnalogyCosmos in the Ancient World,  2019Published in Cosmos in the Ancient World, edited by Phil Horky, Cambridge University Press, 2019.... more Published in Cosmos in the Ancient World, edited by Phil Horky, Cambridge University Press, 2019. The analogy between the divine order of the kosmos and the human order of the polis was well established in Greek thought, and the basis of a persistent but evolving political cosmology that attempted to link human and divine. The analogy is well attested in literary evidence, although the use of kosmos-derived terms in archaic political structures from several Greek cities in some cases pre-dates the repurposing of kosmos language by early philosophers. These developments in the scope of kosmos language meant that this analogy underwent substantial change in the classical period, as philosophical ideas of nature and the divine challenged traditional formulations of one side of the analogy, and the development of the polis, and particularly radical Athenian democracy, challenged the other. Although the analogy is one that is fundamental to Greek thought, as Geoffrey Lloyd has shown, its origins lie much more firmly in the human end of the analogy, in the arrangement of forces by military leaders and in the anthropomorphism by which Greek gods were seen in terms of human leadership. One established view of the polis-kosmos analogy in Presocratic thought is that its use of the language of human justice, with the forces of the kosmos conceptualised in terms of retribution and repayment, and with an emphasis on equality between such forces, imbued it with a democratic tinge. For example, Anaximander (DK 12 A9-11) in early testimony for this new usage of kosmos language, describes the heavens and the world(s) within them as subject to such forces. 5 But perhaps some caution should be exercised in assimilating Presocratic cosmology to the politics of democratic Athens, rather than to broader models of political change operating in a world with multiple possibilities for types of rule, and multiple models of justice. A broader examination of the use of kosmos language in political contexts, both in literary texts and in documentary sources, shows that the analogy could be applied in many differing forms and in different political contexts, but had a strong association with archaic and aristocratic world-views. This chapter will therefore show that the kosmos-polis analogy was contested, with a more democratic version briefly visible in the fifth-century BCE eventually losing out to a less democratic version, more evident in both fourth-century texts and in political nomenclature that persisted into the Hellenistic era. I will argue that, as the polis became less aristocratic, alternative formulations of the analogy, such as those found in Aristophanes' comedies, repositioned it in a democratic context.

Beyond the insights that using such theories as a lens can provide, I want to argue that Xenophon himself with his focus on appearance (phainomai) and performance (epideiknumi) exemplifies an ancient performative turn, exemplified in the description of his appearance at the royal procession and its effect on his friends. Further, connecting Xenophon’s focus on Cyrus’ performance as king and exemplar with Aristotle’s ethical thought on habituation could reposition Xenophon as a resource for virtue approaches to ethics and epistemology,Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the many works of his long career show a continuing engagement with Athenian political culture and the education of its political class, and his assessment of Sparta is significant for both of these. He imagines and explores the struggle for hegemony between Athens, Sparta and other Greek poleis, before the rise of Macedon reshaped the Greek political landscape, and does so through a series of works that aim to create and modify Athenian political identities, and to examine claims to lead any Panhellenic project, through his novel use of literary discourse.

Both models, in separating the individual king from the collective citizenry, invite further, more abstract thought on the importance of the king in the foundation of the polity, whether the king can be considered part of, or separate from, the polis, and the relationship between polis and universe. In addressing these aspects of kingship theories, Aristotle explores a ‘metaphysics of monarchy’, part of the long-running mereological problem of parts and wholes in the construction of the polis, and connectinghis account of kingship to his thought on citizenship and distributive justicewithin the polis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It shows how the 'patrios politeia' is invoked by authors such as Isocrates and Xenophon as a means of expressing opposition to current democratic practice, and also how the use of such arguments is explored, parodied and rejected by Plato in dialogues such as the Menexenus, Timaeus/Critias, and Laws.

This article explores the transition from drama to history as a vehicle for these stories, and the exploitation of this transition in Isocrates’ political rhetoric, conflating myth and history. While Euripides’ democratic king Theseus represented an idealised active citizen, Isocrates retold Athenian myth to show that the good qualities of Athenian democracy depend on their origins in the city’s political foundation by Theseus, and that citizens shouldachieve the good life through imitating virtuous monarchs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
How to be a good king in Athens – manipulating monarchy in the democratic political imaginaryThe depiction of monarchy in Athenian drama has puzzled many commentators, who have argued that t... more The depiction of monarchy in Athenian drama has puzzled many commentators, who have argued that the figure of the ‘democratic king’ is an anachronism. Other critics have taken a historicising approach, and interpreted the presence of the democratic king in tragedy as the retrojection of debate about the quality of contemporary democratic political leaders such as Pericles into the mythical environment of tragedy.However, I shall argue that the tragedians manipulate Athenian foundation myths to present the city’s mythical monarchs, Theseus and Erechtheus, as the focus and origin of political power, and to question the democracy’s claim to political legitimacy. The mythical king is reconfigured to query the legitimacy of the Athenian constitution and the construction of Athenian ideology.The role of the good king in the Athenian political imaginary seems to be to represent and embody the political unity of Athens, and the city’s orderly relationship with the gods and cosmic order. Their narratives show the difficulties in maintaining this order, specifically in handling crises such as supplication by outsiders whose religious or political status is problematic; good kingship is demonstrated by making the correct responses to military, political and religious challenges to the order and unity of the city, such as the arrival of Oedipus, the Heracleidae, and the Argives. Should Euripides’ and Sophocles’ manipulations of myths be read as authorising the transfer to democracy, or undermining its claims to power?Tragedy clearly rejects the ‘bad’ form of single-person rule, tyranny; the audience at the City Dionysia could assess potentially tyrannical rulers (such as Creon in Sophocles’ Antigone and other Theban plays) against the recognised (though contested) category of tyrant.In contrast, the tragedians create the category of good kingship through linking monarchy to Athenian democratic political values, a sophisticated manipulation of the political imaginary. As the fifth century BCE reaches a close, and Athenian democracy falters, the values exhibited by the good king begin to match those idealised by the struggling city (for example in the public funeral speeches) as democracy’s opponents gain ascendance in Athenian political debate.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The practices of ancient democracy, such as greater citizen participation, and selection for office by lot, have attracted contemporary campaigners for political reform (David Reybrouck, 'Against Elections'; Brett Hennig, 'The End of Politicians'). Should Athenian democracy be treated as one case study among many, or does it deserve to be treated as an exceptional case? Johanna Hanink's 'Classical Debt' shows one problematic way in which Athenian history has been used, and offers a cautionary model for retelling the history of democracy. (Final manuscript available via hcommons.org - see link)Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Greek Democracy Now, ARGO, Aut/Winter 2016Our anxieties about democracy – what counts as democratic practice, what constitutes acceptable p... more Our anxieties about democracy – what counts as democratic practice, what constitutes acceptable public speech, what kinds of institutions we expect to be 'democratic' – have rarely been so pressing and explicit. While political philosophers and historians have long debated these questions, the electoral tumult of 2016 has made them even more urgent, as events appear to spiral into what political philosopher Jürgen Habermas once labelled a 'legitimation crisis', in which the authority of institutions and government itself is challenged. But can the ancient world, with its very different political systems, and particularly the radical participatory democracies of classical Athens, offer any insights or solutions to our current problems? Frequent appeals to Athens and its practices might suggest so. Newspaper opinion pages have been full of classical comparisons, often between America's Donald Trump and Athens' Cleon, often decorated with allusions to Plato's Republic or Thucydides' account of Athenian democracy during the Peloponnesian War. Athenian direct democracy, in which individual citizens played an active role in decision-making, has a complicated relationship with modern democracy, invoked as an emblem if not necessarily a template; its appeal has often been to radicals rather than to conservative idealists, unlike the more easily assimilated Roman republic. Would our democracy be more authentic, more acceptable, if it were more like the Athenian model, delivering the 'wisdom of the multitude' identified by Aristotle, or would it, as other ancient commentators such as Plato and Thucydides suggested, be led into disaster by demagogues, encouraging the folly of the masses as they vote for their own destruction? With established models of modern representative and even technocratic, bureaucratic democracy losing their appeal, campaigners have looked to features of ancient democracy – selection of officers by lot rather than election, the emphasis on scrutiny and audit of officials – to restore the missing sense of legitimacy and authenticity. As our perspectives change, it's time for a new look at the history of democracy. Our knowledge of the Athenian past has also changed; while there have been no literary discoveries to equal the nineteenth-century publication of the recovered Aristotelian Constitution of the Athenians, new finds and advances in the interpretation of material evidence – better dating of the inscriptions that are a particular feature of Athenian democratic culture, and better understanding of ancient economic activity through the analysis of coin finds – mean that it's not just because of changing cultural fashion that we should revisit the history of Athenian democracy. We can ask harder questions of literary sources such as Thucydides and read them less naively. We can acknowledge the limitations of ancient political practice, the exclusion of women from political activity, the dependence of Athens on its slave economy and economic migrants (and perhaps now we can acknowledge that slavery, migration and the incorporation of previously excluded voices remain troubling and unresolved in modern democracies, despite our histories of reform and enfranchisement). One thing that is much more clear now than in earlier accounts is that democracy has a history marked by change and discontinuity, even during the classical period. While Thomas Mitchell restricts his Democracy's Beginnings: the Athenian story to Athens up to 323 BCE, he emphasises the gradual development of democracy throughout that period and, perhaps the hallmark of current thought on Athenian democracy, that the fourth-century restored democracy was more stable and even democratic than its radical fifth-century predecessor. But even this limit would be rejected by many Argo Greek DemocracySave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

‘I found a court full of stasis’: political and historical argument in biographical lettersMuch interesting recent work on ancient letters has concentrated on their literary form and has a... more Much interesting recent work on ancient letters has concentrated on their literary form and has artfully shown the fictional plot structures that underlie the narratives contained in collections of letters.  One risk of such illuminating approaches is that the emphasis on the assimilation of the letters to fiction may start to obscure their other generic affiliations. Seeing them as self-contained units may also de-emphasise connections between collections. I’d like to redress this by reading the letters as political theorists do, as political speech acts that tell us about their speakers, and as a conversation between intellectual rivals. This opens up the problematic distinction between history and fiction, with these authorless texts where one can’t easily appeal to authorial intention, an important aspect of Hellenistic historiography.  There’s also the complicated relationship between autobiography, where a first person narrator examines the past, and history.  Is there a tension or a collapse between the letters’ claimed status as historical documents and as historical narratives? Does the historical argument within the letters complicate or play with this? First I’d like to consider the relationship between historiography and letters, and air some methodological and theoretical worries. Then I shall look at three letters, Isocrates 1 To Dionysius, the letter of Speusippus to Philip and Plato's Seventh Letter, to consider how the construction of identity works as political argument, how historical argument is incorporated in the narrative, and how historiographical themes shape the narrative.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper examines the use of Athenian democracy and Greek political theory made by Moses Finley (Democracy Ancient and Modern, 1973) and Cornelius Castoriadis (Le Contenu du Socialisme, 1979; Philosophy, politics, autonomy, 1991) to argue against the defects of bureaucratic democracy and capitalism, questioning whether their approaches idealise Athenian democracy and fail to address significant difficulties in using ancient democracy in the critique of modern politics. In contrast, Jacques Rancière's critique of democracy's critics begins with an analysis of Plato and Aristotle, with La Haine de la Démocratie (2005) analysing Plato's technocratic arguments from the Statesman and the Laws, and using ancient thought without idealising ancient practice.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Radicalising the Classical Imaginary: Cornelius Castoriadis and the École de ParisThe exchange in early 1960s Paris between the activist and radical political philosopher Corneliu... more The exchange in early 1960s Paris between the activist and radical political philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis and the cultural historians who would form the ‘École de Paris’ was fruitful for all parties, in developing their analyses of the development and importance of Greek thought and the democratic polis which it produced. As Castoriadis’ disenchantment with the manifestations of communism in Eastern Europe, and the economic and historical underpinnings of Marxist theory, grew, Vernant and Vidal-Naquet’s structuralist re-analysis of Greek thought and the polis provided a direction from which he could develop a model of the development of societies free from the economic and historical determinism of Marxist orthodoxy. Castoriadis’ 1950s writings for Socialisme ou barbarie quietly drew upon the Athenian ideal of direct democracy, without making detailed use of the Athenian model. Later, following the collapse of Socialisme ou Barbarie as a political organisation in 1965, his work features a deeper and more explicit exploration of the classical past; the identification of democratic Athens as the first instance of an autonomous social-historical creation becomes explicit in L'institution imaginaire de la société (1975). This politicised concept of the social and collective imaginary underpinned explorations of Athenian culture and ideology by Pierre Vidal-Naquet (Le Chasseur Noir) and Nicole Loraux (L’Invention d’Athènes). The concept of the imaginary was used in various ways by different thinkers including Sartre and Lacan, but in Castoriadis’ version it is most importantly a political and politicised concept working across the collectivity of a society. Cultural historians used this to retain a political focus to their work on Athens, and to explore the collective creation of the identity of the polis, a process documented by Vidal-Naquet in his memoirs of the period.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
