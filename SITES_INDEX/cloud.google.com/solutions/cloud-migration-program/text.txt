Benefits
                          Migrating to the cloud should be fast and easy. With
                          Google Cloud RaMP, it is. 
                          Clarity and road map
Understand your IT environment with data-driven
                            discovery and analytics, and receive a road map with
                            timeline, costs, resources, and risks. Gain
                            confidence with a transparent transition plan and
                            cost proposal.
                          Expertise in execution
Migrate with confidence through best practices
                            delivered by Google Cloud and our partners,
                            including blueprints, governance, security, and
                            training for your personnel and cloud
                            operations.  
                          Reduce cost and risk
Reduce migration costs with flexible proposals that
                            meet your budget, partner funding from Google Cloud
                            to offset costs, and solution-specific discounts and
                            credits. Lower risk with data-driven migration
                            plans.
Why Migrate with Google Cloud RaMP? 
For any large-scale migration, we’ve found the following
                      five best practices greatly increase chances of
                      success. First, there needs to be a business case
                      articulating the “why” that executives across business,
                      IT, finance, security, and operations are aligned on.
                      Second, there needs to be a learning plan tailored to each
                      role so individuals can obtain new skills and neutralize
                      the FUD accompanying changes to how they work. Third,
                      there needs to be a “Cloud Center of Excellence” (CCoE)
                      team that harvests best practices, sets up and maintains
                      the landing zone, sets “principles” and blueprints for how
                      teams will scale usage/migration, and drives the fourth
                      and fifth best practices, which are good program
                      governance and a well-defined set of goals or an OKR
                      (objective and key results) to measure, inspect, and
                      quickly triage progress.  
With RaMP, our goal is to bring our product
                      portfolio and best practices together within a unified,
                      holistic approach. One that helps customers build a
                      business case and drive stakeholder alignment, assess and
                      close gaps on their people, process, and technology
                      readiness, disposition workloads into priority “migration
                      waves” segmented by migration strategy, create a landing
                      zone with adequate financial, security, and compliance
                      controls, decide what tools to use, execute a training and
                      enablement plan, establish a CCoE, set an OKR, pick the
                      right partner(s), and relentlessly manage the
                      migration.

Key features
                        How RaMP works
                        RaMP's cycle of success
Migrations have been occurring in enterprise IT for
                          decades (for example, mainframes to x86 to
                          virtualization), with the migration life cycle
                          remaining largely the same. The key to success? A
                          smart, integrated migration program that flows
                          intelligently and smoothly, represented below by our
                          RaMP flywheel:
                        Opportunity evaluation
Understand exactly what your IT landscape looks like
                          so you can properly map out your cloud-based
                          options. 
                        Foundation and planning
Understand which workloads are ideal for the cloud,
                          how you will migrate them, and then build the
                          foundation you'll need in your cloud. 
                        Migrate and validate
Starting with the workloads that are most ideal for
                          the cloud, begin your migrations. Analyze and evaluate
                          at each step so that you can fine-tune for upcoming
                          migrations. 
                        Optimize and operate
Assess how workloads are performing in the cloud,
                          tune as needed, and cut over fully to cloud-based
                          operations. 
A well run migration program creates a flywheel effect,
                      where learnings and experience gained from migrating
                      workloads compound to refine the business case, bolster
                      the foundation, accelerate subsequent migrations, and make
                      it easier to optimize workloads over time. In other words,
                      any improvement made to the flywheel will accelerate not
                      only that customer’s migration, but all customer
                      migrations if we build the machinery to capture and share
                      these improvements.
