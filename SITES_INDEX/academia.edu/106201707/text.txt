DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism common to plants and animals for regulating gene expression. In this study we show, for the first time in any marine species, significant reduction of global methylation levels during the expansive phase of a pygmy mussel (Xenostrobus securis) recent invasion in Europe (two-year old), while in older introductions such epigenetic signature of invasion was progressively reduced. Decreased methylation was interpreted as a rapid way of increasing phenotypic plasticity that would help invasive populations to thrive. This epigenetic signature of early invasion was stronger than the expected environmental signature of environmental stress in younger populations sampled from ports, otherwise detected in a much older population (&gt;90 year old) of the also invasiv...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersScientific ReportsStress related epigenetic changes may explain opportunistic success in biological invasions in Antipode musselsEva Garcia VazquezDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific ReportsEpigenetic patterns associated with an ascidian invasion: a comparison of closely related clades in their native and introduced rangesBrendon DunphyEnvironmentally induced epigenetic modifications have been proposed as one mechanism underlying rapid adaptive evolution of invasive species. Didemnum vexillum is an invasive colonial ascidian that has established in many coastal waters worldwide. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that D. vexillum populations consist of two distinct clades; clade B appears to be restricted to the native range (Japan), whereas clade A is found in many regions throughout the world, including New Zealand. The spread of D. vexillum clade A suggests that it might be intrinsically more invasive than clade B, despite low levels of genetic diversity compared to populations from the native region. This study investigated whether D. vexillum clade A exhibits epigenetic signatures (specifically differences in DNA methylation) associated with invasiveness. Global DNA methylation patterns were significantly different between introduced clade A colonies, and both clades A and B in the native range.

In this study, we used methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) to assess environmentally induced DNA methylation changes in a globally invasive clonal ascidian, . We tested the effect of increasing temperature (19, 25 and 27 °C) and decreasing salinity (34, 32, 30, 28 and 26 practical salinity units (PSU)) on global DNA methylation, growth and survival rates. Exposure to 27 °C resulted in significant changes in DNA methylation over time. Growth also decreased in colonies exposed to high temperatures, suggesting they were under thermal stress. In contrast, no differences in growth nor DNA methylation patterns were observed in colonies exposed to a decreasing salinity gradient, potentially due to prior adaptation. The results of this study show that ...Download Free PDFView PDFAquatic InvasionsFirst record of the invasive brackish water mytilid Limnoperna securis (Lamarck, 1819) in the Bay of Biscay2012 • Idoia AdarragaDownload Free PDFView PDFTransitional Waters BulletinThe low basin of the Arno River (Tuscany, Italy) as alien species hotspot: first data about Rhithropanopeus harrisii (Crustacea, Panopeidae)2015 • Michele Barbieri1 - Harbours and ports, especially if located in the nearby of brackish-water environments, can provide a significant chance to biological invasions. To date, in the Livorno port, twenty alien species have been recorded, fifteen of which are established. 2 - Presence, abundance, size and sex ratio of the mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii, a newly introduced invasive species, have been assessed in six sampling stations along the brackish-water canals between Pisa and Livorno towns. Samplings were carried out in summer and fall 2013. 3 - R. harrisii appeared fully established in the majority of the sampling stations. Reproduction occurs between May and July and sex ratio varied between reproductive and post-reproductive period, with females more abundant before the reproduction. 4 - Individuals of R. harrisii were more abundant in stations close to Livorno port, whereas they were scarce or sporadic in the northernmost stations, close to the main flow of the Arno River. 5 - Due to the ...Download Free PDFView PDFMarine Pollution BulletinFirst record and distribution of the black pygmy mussel, Limnoperna securis (Lamarck, 1819) in the eastern Adriatic and Ionian seas2016 • Ana GavrilovićDownload Free PDFView PDFMarine pollution bulletinBarcodes of marine invertebrates from north Iberian ports: Native diversity and resistance to biological invasions2016 • Andrés  AriasPorts are gateways for many marine organisms transported by ships worldwide, especially non-indigenous species (NIS). In this study carried out in North Iberian ports (Cantabrian Sea, Bay of Biscay) we have observed 38% of exotic macroinvertebrates. Four species, namely the barnacle Austrominius modestus, the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the pygmy mussel Xenostrobus securis, exhibited clear signs of invasiveness. A total of 671 barcode (cytochrome oxidase subunit I or 18S rRNA) genes were obtained and confirmed the species status of some cryptic NIS. Negative and significant correlation between diversity estimators of native biota and proportion of NIS suggests biotic resistance in ports. This could be applied to management of port biota for contributing to prevent the settlement of biopollutants in these areas which are very sensitive to biological invasions.Download Free PDFView PDFGenesImpacts of Life-Time Exposure of Arsenic, Cadmium and Fluoranthene on the Earthworms’ L. rubellus Global DNA Methylation as Detected by msAFLPLindsay  NewboldThis study reports on the effects of long-term exposure to the metals arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluoranthene on the survival, growth, development and DNA methylation status of the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus. Exposures to the three chemicals were conducted over their whole juvenile developmental period from egg to adult. Significant effects on one or more measured endpoints were found for all three chemicals. Arsenic had no effect on survival, but had a significant effect on growth rates at concentrations of 36 mg/kg or higher and also slowed the rate of maturation. Cadmium significantly reduced juvenile survival at 500 mg/kg, juvenile growth at 148 mg/kg and maturation rates at all tested concentrations. Fluoranthene had no effect on survival or the developmental period, but did significantly reduce growth rates at 800 mg/kg. Effects at these concentrations are consistent with the known effects of these three chemicals on earthworms from pr...Download Free PDFView PDFHorticulturaeGlobal Methylation Analysis Using MSAP Reveals Differences in Chilling-Associated DNA Methylation Changes during Dormancy Release in Contrasting Sweet Cherry VarietiesSoraya BravoDormancy is an adaptive strategy developed by temperate perennial crops to protect overwinter tissues from unfavorable environmental conditions. Sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), a member of the Rosaceae family, requires chilling to overcome dormancy. The time of harvest is directly correlated with chilling requirements in sweet cherries. Consequently, early and late season varieties have low and high chilling requirements, respectively. There is evidence that the expression of dormancy-related genes is regulated by DNA methylation. In this work, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) was applied to study genome-wide DNA methylation changes associated with dormancy in two low-chill varieties, ‘Royal Dawn’ and ‘Glen Red’, and one high-chill variety, ‘Kordia’. Our primary results suggest that the occurrence of progressive DNA demethylation is associated with chilling accumulation during dormancy in the three varieties, independent of their chilling requirements.

Staple crop biofortification is an efficient means to combat such deficiencies in the diets of local consumers. Biofortified lines of sweet potato (Ipomoea batata L. Lam) with enhanced beta-carotene content have been developed in Ghana to alleviate Vitamin A Deficiency. These genotypes are propagated using meristem micropropagation to ensure the generation of virus-free propagules. In vitro culture exposes micropropagated plants to conditions that can lead to the accumulation of somaclonal variation with the potential to generate unwanted aberrant phenotypes. However, the effect of micropropagation induced somaclonal variation on the production of key nutrients by field-grown plants has not been previously studied. Here we assessed the extent of in vitro culture induced somaclonal variation, at a phenotypic, compositional and genetic/epigenetic level, by comparing field-maintained and micropropagated...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
