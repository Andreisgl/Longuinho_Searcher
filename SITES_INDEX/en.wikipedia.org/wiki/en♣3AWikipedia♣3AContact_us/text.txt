You've got mics, we've got voices.
If you are a member of the press looking to contact the Wikimedia Foundation, our press department can be contacted at presswikimedia.org , or by phoning +1 415-839-6885. We also have international contacts, some of whom work for various affiliated organisations and some of whom are editors. Our press room contains more information, along with materials about Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and other projects it hosts.
If you work for an organisation that is interested in a cultural partnership with Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, or one of its affiliated bodies, there is an outreach page on cultural partnerships where you can propose new ones or get in touch with experienced outreach volunteers. For business development opportunities or proposals, please contact businesswikimedia.org .
For general questions about the Wikimedia Foundation or its work, please email answerswikimedia.org .
