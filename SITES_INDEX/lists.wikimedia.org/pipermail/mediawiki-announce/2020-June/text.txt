[MediaWiki-announce] Security and maintenance release: 1.31.8 /1.33.4 / 1.34.2

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.34.2, 1.33.4 and 1.31.8!
These releases also serve as a maintenance release for these branches.
We've noted that this is minor, and as such you don't need to apply them as
quickly as with other security releases, if you're unable to do so, or if
you're not running a private wiki. We therefore decided to continue with
getting the security (and maintenance) release out for this quarter as
planned, even with the global situation as is.
While tarballs have already been uploaded, git tags will follow later on
today.
An "MediaWiki Extensions Security Release Supplement" email will follow
this one.
As mentioned in the pre-release announcement, this will be the final
release of the MediaWiki 1.33 branch, barring any unforeseen issues. If you
are currently running 1.33, you are advised to upgrade to a newer,
supported version of MediaWiki, which as of writing is MediaWiki 1.34 (as
1.35 has not been released yet). MediaWiki 1.34 will be supported until
November 2020. A separate notification of this will be sent out too.
== Security fixes ==
