These olivine-rich rocks are assumed to have crystallized from magmas that have about 28–30 wt% MgO. They are characterized by spinifex texture platy or skeletal crystals of olivine set in a glassy matrix. Chemically, komatiites resemble peridotites and have high MgO but low SiO2, TiO2 (&lt;1 wt%), K2O (&lt;0.5 wt%) and incompatible trace element contents. Most of their compositional variations can be accounted for by olivine fractionation. Komatiites are conventionally considered to be derived from high temperature melts that have eruption temperatures of about 1600EC and are produced by high degrees of anhydrous melting of mantle plumes. The abundance of Archean komatiites, their decrease through the Proterozoic and extreme rarity in the Phanerozoic have been taken as evidence for secular cooling of the mantle.

Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada): a Phanerozoic analogue of a subduction-unrelated Archean greenstone beltScientific Reports,  2019Understanding the formation and evolution of Precambrian greenstone belts is hampered by gaps in ... more Understanding the formation and evolution of Precambrian greenstone belts is hampered by gaps in the rock record and the uncertainty of the tectonic regime that was operating at the time. Thus identifying a modern analogue of a Precambrian greenstone belt can be problematic. In this paper we present geological, geochemical and petrological evidence outlining the case for Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada) as a modern example of a greenstone belt. Haida Gwaii is comprised of two rift-related volcano-sedimentary sequences. The older (Early Triassic) Karmutsen volcanic sequence consists of subaqueous ultramafic-mafic volcanic rocks that are capped by marine carbonate and siliciclastic rocks. The younger (Paleogene) Masset bimodal volcanic sequence consists of tholeiitic and calc-alkaline basalt along with calc-alkaline silicic volcanic and intrusive rocks that are capped by epiclastic sandstones. The Karmutsen and Masset volcanic rocks have indistinguishable Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes demon...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Petrogenetic evolution of Late Paleozoic rhyolites of the Harvey Group, southwestern New Brunswick (Canada) hosting uranium mineralizationContributions to Mineralogy and Petrology,  2016The 360 Ma subaerial felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Harvey Group form a belt abo... more The 360 Ma subaerial felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Harvey Group form a belt about 15 km long and 3 km wide in southwestern New Brunswick (Canada) that has been correlated with parts of the Mount Pleasant caldera complex, the site of a significant polymetallic (tin, tungsten, molybdenum, indium and bismuth) deposit. The Harvey volcanic rocks are highly fractionated peraluminous within-plate F-rich rhyolites, which host uranium mineralization. The rocks were modified by late-magmatic and post-magmatic processes. A comparison of the composition of whole rocks and melt inclusions in the quartz phenocrysts shows that some trace elements, including U, were affected by the post-magmatic processes. Their flat REE patterns accompanied by distinct negative Eu anomalies are typical of highly evolved F-rich leucogranites and rhyolites. Nd isotopic ratios (ɛNd(360) = +0.6 to −1.0) are similar to those of the felsic rocks of the Mount Pleasant complex. The Harvey rhyolites were generated by extensive fractional crystallization of andesites of the Mount Pleasant caldera. The melt evolved at the apex of the magma chamber where volatile elements become concentrated. The Harvey rhyolite (with melt inclusions containing ~20 ppm U) had the potential to develop a significant U mineralization. The erupted glassy rhyolite is a favorable U source rock amendable to leaching by post-magmatic hydrothermal and meteoric water. The high Th/U ratios in the Harvey volcanic rocks compared to the low ratios in the U-rich melt inclusions is indicative of such a process.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Geochemistry and petrogenesis of Tethyan ophiolites from northern Argolis (Peloponnesus, Greece)European Journal of Mineralogy,  1991ABSTRACT Tethyan ophiolitic sequences from the northern part of the Argolis Peninsula in northeas... more ABSTRACT Tethyan ophiolitic sequences from the northern part of the Argolis Peninsula in northeastern Peloponnesus (Greece) contain MORB-like basalts and rocks with boninitic characteristics. The former include basalts with enriched to depleted light REE patterns. The boninitic rocks show many similarities to those of Cenozoic age from the Western Pacific - as well as to the low-Ti ophiolites - including high contents of Mg, Ni and Cr and low abundances of Ti and incompatible trace elements. The boninites that are the most depleted in Al, Ca, Ti and heavy REE, display the highest relative enrichment in light REE and Zr. The boninitic rocks were probably formed in a back-arc/inter-arc setting where a rising MORB-source diapir facilitated melting of a progressively more depleted upper mantle peridotite that had been modified by Zr- and light REE-rich fluids. The compositional variations of MORB-like basalts are attributed to dynamic partial melting of the rising mantle diapir. -AuthorsSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mineralogic Reaction Zones at a Calc-Silicate/Metapelite Interface: An Example of Trace Element Mobility in a Metamorphic EnvironmentMineralogical Magazine,  1994Metasomatic interaction on a cm scale between calc-silicate pods and the enclosing sillimanite + ... more Metasomatic interaction on a cm scale between calc-silicate pods and the enclosing sillimanite + biotite + tourmaline gneiss at Partridge Breast Lake, northern Manitoba, Canada, led to the development of an inner (by calc-silicate rock), hornblende-rich reaction zone and an outer, biotite-rich zone. The boundary between the reaction zones is interpreted as the original calc-silicate/metapelite interface. Compared with its metapelitic protolith, the biotite zone shows a two- to twenty-fold depletion in the concentrations of incompatible trace elements (notably the light rare earths, U, Th, Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf). In contrast, the relative concentrations of trace elements remained nearly constant during the mineralogical transformation of the calc-silicate rock to the hornblende zone. The depletion of trace elements in the biotite zone is attributed to the dissolution of accessory phases (e.g. monazite). Although stable at the metamorphic conditions (∼600–650°C at ∼ 4.5 kbar) prevalent du...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The site of the drill was selected at the periphery of the Devonian South Mountain batholith, which contains important mineralization of tin and uranium. The drill hole intersected texturally uniform megacrystic biotite granodiorite, which does not display any pronounced primary vertical zonation. At depth, the drill core contains zones of alteration, fracturing, and brecciation. The alteration is mainly due to fluid flow along the fractures. Some fractures are mineralized and contain galena, sphalerite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, hematite, quartz, and carbonate minerals. Common occurrence of alteration zones in the hole suggests that such zones are widespread in the batholith and point to abundant hydrothermal activity deep within the massif. It is inferred that the potential for hidden economic mineral deposits within th...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Oceanic Island Volcanism I: Mineralogy and PetrologyGeoscience CanadaOceanic islands tend to occur at the young ends of hotspot trails because they record the passage... more Oceanic islands tend to occur at the young ends of hotspot trails because they record the passage of oceanic plates over rising convection cells (plumes) in the mantle, or the propagation of cracks in the lithosphere. Basaltic volcanism on oceanic islands is generally unexplosive and, although potentially destructive, poses less threat to human life than volcanism in other tectonic environments. However, the possibility of giant tsunamis from the catastrophic gravitational collapse of islands is of real concern for major cities surrounding the ocean basins. Two series of magmas are recognized in oceanic islands. Tholeiites form at lower pressures than alkali basalts, from higher percentages of decompression melting. The former contain a low-Ca pyroxene and the latter can crystallize nepheline. Furthermore, minerals common to both series (chromite, olivine, augite, plagioclase, magnetite and ilmenite) are compositionally distinct reflecting fundamental chemical differences between the two magma series. Mineral compositions vary as magmas evolve in sub-volcanic, lithospheric magma chambers by assimilation and differentiation. Magmas assimilate wall rocks in these chambers. Timescales for differentiation (mostly crystal fractionation) are generally less than a few thousand years. Early olivine, pyroxene, chromite and immiscible sulfide formation cause compatible elements (e.g., Ni, Co, Cr) to decline rapidly as differentiation proceeds. Plagioclase dramatically removes Sr at intermediate stages and alkali feldspars sequester Ba and Rb as late-stage trachytes and phonolites form in alkaline magmas. The high-field-strength elements are generally incompatible but locally decline reflecting apatite (P) and Fe-Ti oxide (Ti, Nb, Ta) removal. Studies of layering in individual lava flows suggest that rising volatiles may effect mass transfer of complexed ions during differentiation in magma chambers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These rocks are interpreted to have undergone extensive fractional crystallization from an alkali basaltic magma, although their different geochemical signatures indicate that the rhyolite was not derived from the trachyte via continuous fractional crystallization. The rhyolite is highly enriched in incompatible trace elements including uranium (up to ca. 20 ppm). Cumberland Hill peralkaline rhyolite suggests that a potentially economic source of uranium exists in the basin, based on the elevated uranium concentrations and high potential for remobilization into surrounding sedimentary units.
