1 June 2023
We've successfully launched Release 7.3.0 (2242) (T337792). In this new release, we've made improvements to the user interface and the overall performance of the iOS app. 
To ensure smooth navigation and usability, we've adjusted the interface to present a warning for semi-protected pages earlier in the process before edit mode (T313772).The following are designs for two scenarios:
Editor taps to edit a fully-protected page:
 
Editor taps to edit a semi-protected page
 
Editing screens open with an alert
 
Tapping 'Ok' brings the editor to the editing screen that is disabled
 
Tapping on the 'X' icon takes you back to the article
Editor that is blocked tries to edit a semi-protected page:
 
Blocked editor taps to edit a semi-protected page
 
Block message appears
Editor that is blocked tries to edit a semi-protected page
Enhancements have been made to the Picture of the Day and Top Read widgets, which now fetch data independently from Wikifeeds, ensuring consistent performance and data availability (T327554, T327556).
We've created guidelines to standardize the colors used across the app, resulting in improved UI consistency and accessibility (T299793).
We've addressed theme switching issues that surfaced in the user talk revision history and the Link editor, ensuring that these elements now adapt correctly to all theme variations (T330320, T326207).
We've also optimized the app's launch time. This was achieved by simplifying the state restoration process and reducing the number of navigation modals, thereby significantly enhancing the user experience (T337073).
We also introduced a new feature flag in the client app for the watchlist feature. This provides a safeguard for rollback without affecting other work. Flag checks are in place at key points including the watchlist, diff view, and article view entries (T336200)
This month we also examined design component patterns with emphasis on theming, font application, automatic updates for dark mode/dynamic type changes, and integration with UIKit and SwiftUI. After finalization, we provided guidelines for design requirements, focusing on defining inputs and outputs (T329329).1 May 2023
In May, our team successfully rolled out version 7.2.2 of the application, which included performance improvements ( T335077, T335075, T335134). We released 7.3.0 to Beta testers which includes performance improvements to widgets and the last of our edit notices work (/T337792#8935018) .
We've also been investigating and testing a solution for a bug that can cause our app to freeze, potentially due to outdated offline reading code (T336804). The fix will go out in release 7.3.1.
Further, we're enhancing our native source editor to facilitate full page source editing (T331936).1 April 2023
We fixed some issues with background crashes and long app launch times. These will be released in version 7.2.2 in May. Extra thanks to all of the users who helped us troubleshoot this! T335077 T335075 T335134We worked on technical debt surrounding widgets, to make them more stable. T327553We worked on a native wikitext editor to improve editor performance and prep for supporting full page article and talk page editing. T331936 T331935We started work on supporting images in talk pages. T329843 Image viewWe also started preparations for building Watchlist. T334212 check the Watchlist's project's page.1 March 2023

As we ended July with a successful testing round of user testing for the basic ability on talk pages, during August we are working on our initial Talk UI implementation phab:T301824 and usability testing script phab:T315571 for new contributors to test a beta version of the user talk and article talk features.

A new screen to request to vanish your Wikipedia account phab:T300080.
A new tool to export your data library for technical debugging purposes phab:T258212.1 July 2022
The third round of user testing was successfully ran to see whether participants understood the content and could complete tasks that test the basic usability on talk pages, which included opening a topic, using the ‘find in page’ to search for a word, replying to a comment, creating a new topic, opening all threads and subscribing to a topic. The tasks were successfully completed by all participants and the feedback from the participants helped improve some of the components and change the way the threading was presented.
You can find more information about this particular usability test and read through all of the user research done for talk pages. Now with the research phase over our engineers are starting to build talk pages.18 May 2022
Notifications now available in the store! After many conversations and deep development the iOS app now supports editing notifications. You can now see you notifications and alerts in our in app Notification Center and right on your homescreen. As with all notifications on iOS, you choose how you’ll be notified and where, whether you want your @pings on your device homescreen, your digest or only when you open the app.We shared a survey of ideas with existing editors to gather input for our talk improvements. See context here. We're digesting all the feedback and will post our learnings soon.29 March 2022
The iOS team has been working hard on finishing support for Notifications, but we’ve been remiss in keeping this wiki page and our on wiki conversations. We plan to post regular updates for our Notifications and upcoming Talk page work on a regular basis going forward.
We are getting very close to our initial beta release of Notifications. We need your help! You can sign up to test it here.
For our Notifications work, we concluded a multi-week diary study with long time editors. The results and follow up changes can be seen on our iOS Notifications MediaWiki page.
The iOS team is starting Talk page improvement investigations, looking at lots of research and past community consultations, what Android and Editing teams have been doing, in particular. We will start testing ideas for threading soon.21 April 2021
The iOS team has been working on notifications in the app to let users better interact with other editors. You can see phab:T274404 for the main Phabricator task and phab:T274305 for how this could look. See also Wikimedia Apps/Team/iOS/Notifications for more information.
