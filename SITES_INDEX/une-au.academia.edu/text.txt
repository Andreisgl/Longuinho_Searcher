Part of his doctoral research was undertaken at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialised UN agency in London. Additionally, he assisted undergraduate students as Academic Coordinator at Earle Page College.Supervisors: Dr Karin von Strokirch, Dr Tony Lynch, and Dr Cameron MoorePhone: +61 4 1348 0878Address: 1 Matthews MewsKensington, VIC, 3031Australialess55 Followers47 FollowingTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall2 Papers2 Drafts3 Talks1 Thesis ChaptersPapersTroubled waters: European and Australian approaches to maritime migration during Tony Abbott's tenureProtecting Australia from an 'invasion' of irregular maritime migrants was one of the key policy ... more Protecting Australia from an 'invasion' of irregular maritime migrants was one of the key policy objectives of Tony Abbott's government from September 2013 to September 2015. Restricted to this specific period, this article compares Australia's approaches to irregular maritime migration with the actions taken by the European Union (EU). By mirroring the journey of maritime migrants, the comparative analysis is structured around the 'departure' place, the 'transit' at sea, and the 'arrival'. Under Abbott, Australia cut humanitarian aid to source and transit countries, intensified military deterrence against maritime migrants and sustained punitive offshore detention camps. Despite problematic factors for the EU such as the proximity of conflict zones, the sheer numbers of refugees, and the vexed issue of burden-sharing between member-states, it advocated a humanitarian approach to the migration crisis. By providing a stark contrast between Australian and EU approaches to a humanitarian crisis, this article contends that the Abbott Government took exceptionally cruel measures to curtail the flow of people travelling to Australia by boat to seek refuge.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Oligarchs in the United States form an exceptionally small proportion of the total population, but control a vast amount of the financial resources. These financial resources allow the oligarchs access to high-ranking government officials, but those same resources can also be used to influence political decision-making through 'think tanks', contributions to political campaigns or by employing the services of professional lobby agents. This paper will first, though briefly, examine the contemporary energy crisis caused by the depletion of finite natural resources. Then it will look into the history and process of hydraulic fracturing, before turning to the environmental impacts, with a particular focus on the local communities and the social impacts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Aspects of maritime security are being outsourced to non-state actors in three areas: Maritime Migration; Piracy; and Illegal fishing. This brief talk, part of the 3MT, gives an overview of my research in this area.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This thesis argues that this is certainly not true when it comes to key areas of concern for international maritime security. NSAs here may employ the traditional tools of advocating and lobbying that leave neorealists unimpressed, but they do more than this.  Increasingly they have forced policy changes by assuming roles that states cannot or will not perform at sea. In making this argument, this thesis draws on three different case studies; irregular maritime migration, piracy, and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. In each of these cases we find that the actions of NSAs at sea have a direct and contributory effect on the way states are or are not responding to the security concerns in international waters.  This capacity is clearly bound up with the absence of sovereign control over the high seas.  The long-standing ‘freedom of the seas’ doctrine opens a space for conflicts between the state-centric conceptions of security and national interests of states on the one hand, and (human) security, trade and environmental concerns on the other, that NSAs are well placed to fill.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
