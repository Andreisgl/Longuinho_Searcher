By adopting the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework, we developed an extended TPACK scale, including two sub-constructs, i.e., a) the Educational Context and b) teachers’ self-assessment of TPACK abilities. The analysis of the results showed that the participants appear to believe that they have a good level of knowledge with regards to the primary TPACK domains, i.e., content, pedagogy and technology.However, most teachers perceived them separately and were not able to integrate their TPACK knowledge in order to design and implement meaningful ICT-based interventions in their classroom practice. Statistically significant differences were recorded in relation to teachers’ factors, i.e., gender, teaching experience and training about ICT in education. Finally, the findings showed that teachers’ efforts to implement ICT-based interventions in their classrooms could be affected by factors related to the educational context in the Greek primary schools.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
MOOCS for teacher professional development: exploring teachers’ perceptions and achievementsby Nikolaos Koukis and Athanassios  JimoyiannisInteractive Technology and Smart Education, 16(1), 74-91,  2019This paper aims to report on a study concerning a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), designed to ... more This paper aims to report on a study concerning a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), designed to support Greek-language teachers in secondary-education schools in implementing collaborativewriting activities with Google Docs (GDs) in their classrooms. The design framework of the particular teacher professional development MOOC was determined by the connectivist principles and addressed three main dimensions of teachers’ active participation: a) individual engagement; b) peer interaction and mutual support; and c) collaborative creation of educational scenarios and artefacts. The analysis used a mixed method that combines data from teachers’ active engagement through the MOOC platform records and quantitative and qualitative data from their responses to a post-survey questionnaire. The analysis of the research data provided supportive evidence that the design framework was effective towards promoting teachers’ active engagement, peer interaction and support and development of learning design abilities to integrate collaborative writing with GDs in their classrooms. The findings showed that the majority of participants conceptualized this MOOC as an efficient environment to enhance their pedagogical knowledge and classroom practices and to support continuous professional development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Secondary education students' difficulties in algorithmic problems with arrays: An analysis using the SOLO taxonomyby Evripides  Vrachnos and Athanassios  JimoyiannisThemes in Science and Technology Education, 10(1), 31-52,  2017Developing students' algorithmic and computational thinking is currently a major objective for pr... more Developing students' algorithmic and computational thinking is currently a major objective for primary and secondary education in many countries around the globe. Literature suggests that students face at various difficulties in programming processes, because of their mental models about basic programming constructs. Arrays constitute the first data structure students have to cope with in introductory programming courses. This paper presents the results of an empirical study on secondary education students' misconceptions and mental representations of the array data structure. Students' responses to written tasks regarding short code segments were mapped to the different levels of the SOLO taxonomy, in order to identify how students use arrays to solve programming problems. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of the students tended to manifest responses assigned to the lower SOLO levels, i.e. prestructural, unistructural and multistructural. The findings indicate that many students in the sample had incomplete or faulty representations of the array concept, which seem to be connected to their misconceptions about the programming variable concept.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In addition, it proposes a new organizational and analysis framework of students’ constructive and collaborative activities in wiki-authoring projects.Design/methodology/approach – The key notion, around which the present conceptual and research framework was built, is that a wiki integrates a content space and a social (discussion) space both considered in collaborative manner. The analysis of student contributions to their wiki was organised along two dimensions: a) interaction and refection posts were analysed using the framework of Community of Inquiry (CoI); b) content contributions to the wiki pages were classified into five categories: (1) creating a new page, (2) content expansion, (3) content reorganization, (4) content enrichment (with video, images or hyperlinks), and (5) editing and grammatical corrections.Findings - The analysis of the research data revealed important information that could help to depict an overall representation of individual interactions and contributions, students’ collaborative performance within wiki groups as well as the overall evolution of the wiki content. The findings showed that properly designed wiki projects can be effectively introduced in higher education with the aim to support students to improve their authoring and collaborative skills through critical thinking, peer interaction and reflection.Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study are limited by the specific sample and the context of implementation. Future research will be directed to various educational contexts and to include in the analysis students’ experiences and learning outcomes of wiki-authoring activities.Practical implications –The results provided supportive evidence that successful wiki-based projects in higher education depend on the way students’ individual and collaborative authoring contributions are interwoven. Effective wiki-based interventions should consider students’ learning as the outcome of both, individual and collaborative work, determined by self and peer reflection in wiki groups.Originality/value - The originality and the significance of the present study are justified by the conceptual framework proposed which can guide both aspects of students’ learning presence within self-directed wiki-authoring projects, i.e. research and educational practice (design and monitoring).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, literature review on educational blogging revealed a lack of a complete and consistent framework for studying and assessing students' engagement and the impact of blogging on students' learning. This study reports on the application of an analysis framework for evaluating blogging learning activities, based on two well-documented models, those of Community of Inquiry (CoI) and Social Network Analysis. The framework proposed is examined through an empirical study involving 21 K-9 students, coming from two classes, in Greece. This investigation shed light into the different ways of students' engagement in a blog-based project, namely their social and cognitive presence that supported the development of a CoI and learning. The results suggest that the students, through their different roles in the blog, achieved higher thinking and cognitive levels.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, literature review on educational blogging revealed a lack of a complete and consistent framework for studying and assessing students' engagement and the impact of blogging on students' learning. This study reports on the application of an analysis framework for evaluating blogging learning activities, based on two well-documented models, those of Community of Inquiry (CoI) and Social Network Analysis. The framework proposed is examined through an empirical study involving 21 K-9 students, coming from two classes, in Greece. This investigation shed light into the different ways of students' engagement in a blog-based project, namely their social and cognitive presence that supported the development of a CoI and learning. The results suggest that the students, through their different roles in the blog, achieved higher thinking and cognitive levels.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.Since its formal introduction as a theoretical concept, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowled... more Since its formal introduction as a theoretical concept, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) has been transformed into a robust framework to support ICT integration in practice by allowing instructional designers, teachers and teacher educators to focus upon the connections among Technology, Content, and Pedagogy in real instructional-learning contexts. Web 2.0, on the other hand, has received in the last decade intense and growing educational and research interest. The key idea, upon which the educational Web 2.0 is built, is the wide range of affordances incorporated that transform both Pedagogy (Pedagogy 2.0, e.g. self-directed, reflective and community learning) and Content (Content 2.0, e.g. shared and learner-generated content). This chapter presents TPACK 2.0, as a promising framework a) to guide learning design and teacher preparation programs and b) to promote Web 2.0 integration in curriculum and classroom settings by harnessing their learner-centered, participative and social networking characteristics.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper reports on teachers’ performance in the context of two on-line communities with different organizational-functional characteristics, an open and a semi-structured one. The conceptual and operational dimensions of the teacher community design framework are presented in detail. The findings presented revealed important information regarding a) critical community indicators, e.g. participation, engagement, interaction, creativity and cohesion, and b) the role of community structure. The results provided supportive evidence that the structured community framework was effective towards promoting teachers’ engagement, interaction, ideas interchange, collaboration and knowledge sharing and co-creation. On the other hand, open community turned out to be centralised and evolving around the coordinator’s initiatives; the participants exhibited low rates of interaction and community presence.

The Erasmus+ funded RU EU? project aims to develop an innovative online game, the RU EU? game, that will help students across Europe to develop a better understanding of their own National and European identity and values, as well as those of others, and to challenge them about their attitudes and prejudices by tackling problem solving dilemmas relating to identity. It is hoped that the game will provide an engaging platform for young Europeans to confront some of the complex and confusing issues surrounding National and European identity at a time of change and increasing tension across Europe. This paper describes the early stages of the game design and focuses on characterizing the learning outcomes and game mechanics for the RU EU? game and bringing these together.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The content and commentaries postings of the blog were analysed using a combined framework, combining the model of Community of Inquiry and the representation of Learning Mapping, aiming to reveal students’ engagement in blogging activities. The analysis shed light into the different patterns of participation students showed and their gradual evolution of learning presence which supported the development of a community of inquiry. The results suggested that properly designed blog activities can help students to achieve higher cognitive levels through enhancing their collaboration skills and critical thinking. Findings showed that the proposed framework could be of value for the design of blog-based instructional practices and ongoing research in the field.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The main objective is to sketch out the education, training, role, competences,  competencies and challenges faced by a particular cohort of ICT educators participated in the study, in order to further understand how they conceptualize themselves and their role in this specific educational context, and the ways in which their educational praxis has been shaped as a result. The analysis presented draws upon the findings from interviews with eight adult educators teaching ICT in the context of four case study Second Chance Schools (SCS) in Greece, a project funded by the European Commission and the Greek government aimed at combating social exclusion of individual adults through education. The latter consist of a population with special characteristics and traits regarding the teaching and learning of ICT. The study reported, harnessing a qualitative case study approach within an interpretative paradigm, focuses on the ICT educators’ beliefs, experiences and perceptions. From the analysis, a number of themes have emerged that proved to have shaped the profile of the ICT educators in SCS; a) the lack of adequate education and effective preparation and training· b) educators’ undefined role along with their competences, skills, personal characteristics and abilities, and the impact of the above on their educational praxis· c) their previous experiences at typical secondary schools· and d) the need for lifelong training and professional development. The issues raised and the implications of the study might be helpful in future attempts to develop an integrated national framework for the specification of the education, training, competences and competencies of the ICT adult educator aimed at improving learning and teaching in SCS.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
