Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change)
Edit
Israeli Hebrew is a spoken language, 'reinvented' over the course of the twentieth century. It has responded 
   to the social demands of the newly emerging state, as well as to escalating globalization, with a vigorously 
   developing lexicon, enriched by multiple foreign language contacts. In this detailed and rigorous study, the 
   author provides a principled classification of neologisms, their semantic fields and the roles of source languages,
   along with a sociolinguistic study of purists' and ordinary native speakers' attitudes towards lexical enrichment.
   His analysis of the tension between linguistic creativity and the preservation of a distinct language identity 
   takes the discussion beyond the case of Israeli, through innovative comparisons with Revolutionized Turkish, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Yiddish, Estonian, Swahili, pidgins and creoles, and other languages.
At the beginning of the third millennium, our world is characterized by worldwide communication and the vast
   distribution of technological and 'talknological' devices. The mobility of the word respects no borders and the extent of that mobility may not be paralleled even in future (less heterogeneous) generations. The study of 
   the modes and dynamics of language contact could hardly be more timely.

Reviews
   '...this is the first time that anyone has drawn attention to the extent to which 'phono-semantic matching' applies in word formation...a most important contribution to the study of Israeli Hebrew word formation in particular and of language change in general.' - Shmuel Bolozky, Professor of Hebrew, University of Massachusetts
'This book will interest not only researchers and graduate students in the topic but also Hebraists. Moreover, any layman who loves words will find it absorbing and entertaining... it is both scholarly and original [and] an outstanding contribution to the science of etymology.' - Professor Geoffrey Lewis, St Antony's College, Oxford
'..fascinating and multifaceted... a paean to linguistic creativity. It is especially timely in the present historical context of rapid globalization and linguistic inter-influence.' - Professor James A. Matisoff, Department of Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley
'The volume is extremely impressive. Zuckermann demonstrates a mastery of European and Hebrew lexicography... In addition to developing a rigorous analytical framework, he offers many detailed word (and compound) histories and carves out a well-defined position on issues of much significance.' - Professor Jeffrey Heath, University of Michigan
'The book is an outstanding piece of scholarship which undoubtedly represents a milestone in the field of lexicology. Zuckermann's attention to details has made the work a mini-encyclopaedia, much in the tradition of Jewish scholarship. Generally, his etymologies are well thought out and set a standard for current and future research.' - Joseph T. Farquharson, Linguistlist
