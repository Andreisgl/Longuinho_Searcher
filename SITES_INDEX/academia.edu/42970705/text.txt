Akkadian turns out to be the first empire language which was only later replaced by Latin, Greek, and Arabic. Such empire languages are required for governance and regular trade over a wide area. Alphabetic Akkadian texts range in date from 1460 BCE to 300 CE and are distributed from the Levant to Italy and likely beyond. Its word definitions are cross-referenced to over 45 texts translated according to the strict scholar's standard. Alphabetic Akkadian words have no inner vowels so their definitions represent Akkadian root meanings. Alphabetic writing began as a memory aid device for working people such as traders, mercenaries, and local priests. It did not originate in the scribal tradition. Alphabetic Akkadian texts have been mislabeled as Paleo-Hebrew, Aramaic, Moabite, Phoenician, Etruscan, and even early Greek (texts prior to 480 BCE).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMediterranean and Alphabetic Akkadian Lexicon 2 nd Edition -February 2021David OlmstedThe existence of Akkadian in the Mediterranean is due to the commercial trade which developed during the Bronze Age. Such trade required a common written language in order to function. Translations of archaeological texts using the strict scholar's standard show that this first Mediterranean wide language was Akkadian before it was replaced by Greek and Latin. Due to differing writing materials, cuneiform Akkadian was used in Mesopotamia while a linear form was used in the Mediterranean. The alphabet developed out of the Minoan Akkadian writing tradition (Phaistos disk, Linear A) which began around 1800 BCE after their contact with Assyrian trading colonies in Anatolia. Consequently, this lexicon traces the history of the alphabet. This second edition is the result of completing 20 additional final translations which now provide a broad, if sparse, outline of Akkadian writing in the Mediterranean. These texts range from the Minoan Phaistos Disk and Linear A to texts formally labeled as Etruscan, Early Greek, Philistine, Phoenician, and Paleo-Hebrew. Most of the texts covered by this lexicon have not been translated before. Where earlier translations were attempted in either Hebrew or Greek, the translation papers show where those attempted translations are seriously flawed. When combined these texts also show that a common Pagan religious culture once existed between the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia with only minor variations between the different letter style groups. This common religious culture is traced back to its Mesolithic roots using archaeological finds.Download Free PDFView PDFHumanities CommonsMediterranean Akkadian Lexicon 3rd Edition -20222022 • David OlmstedThis third edition of Mediterranean Akkadian is bigger and better with more words and more refined word definitions based upon a larger number of translations. Linear (letter-like) Akkadian writing first appeared in the Mediterranean at the start of the Bronze Age on Minoan Crete around 1800 BCE. This first writing was used by temple/palace complexes for organizing economic activity brought about by the expanding international trade which characterized the Bronze Age. Such commercial level trade would not have been possible without a common means of communication such as that provided by a common written language. Priests also quickly adopted writing to preserve their religious debates. The Minoans borrowed Akkadian writing from Assyrian traders then active in Anatolia but they simplified the writing from the syllabic used in cuneiform (like "dab, da, d") to phonetic ("da" and "d"). During the Bronze Age the demands of trade further simplified the script to alphabetic in which consonants could be followed by any vowel (Like "d*" and "d"). The users of linear writing were working people like traders, mercenaries, and entrepreneurial priests and not professional scribes. Consequently, its grammar is simple and based mostly on word placement in a way similar to English. Akkadian thus became the common written language of both Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean prior to the rise of Latin and Greek. The idea that the Bronze Age consisted of many isolated written languages is false. Texts labeled as Etruscan, Early Greek, Philistine, Phoenician, Paleo-Hebrew, and Punic are all really Alphabetic Akkadian.Download Free PDFView PDFPhoenician Penptah (Tabnit) Sarcophagus Text from Sidon Blames Astrological Powers for Great Bonze Age Drought (1170 BCEDavid OlmstedThis Phoenician style text dating to 1170 BCE was written in the empire language of Alphabetic Akkadian/Aramaic. Phoenician like all other alphabetic writing derives from the Minoan writing tradition but is a separate lineage from the similar letter tradition of the Philistine/Israelites further south and the Etruscan/Carthaginians of the western Mediterranean. This text provides an almost complete summary of the Ancient Pagan Paradigm. It is blaming the astrological powers for the drought which ended the Bronze Age. Deities referenced are Yahu, Utu, Atu (and his sun form Hu), crescent moon goddess Ayu, and full moon god Su. Also mentioned are owls and eagle-vultures and network editors. This text distinguishes between the "enclosed region" as the night sky under the earth plane where ancestral souls reside from the night sky as the source of astrological motion powers due to its moving planets.Download Free PDFView PDFAkkadian Translation of Israelite Gezer Tablet (Calendar) Blames 840 BCE Elijah Drought on AstrologyDavid OlmstedThis early (northern) Israelite student teaching text blames the cause of the 840 BCE Elijah drought on the astrological powers of the Ancient Pagan Paradigm. It shows a Pagan Israel just prior to the Yawist revolution by referencing the gods Hu as the Healer, Su as the shepherd corresponding to the full moon, and the goddess Utu as the Opener of invisible platonic forms. It is similar but narrower in blame for a drought to the Philistine student teaching text found at Izbet Sartah which talks about the earlier 980 BCE drought. The Pagan Israelite text does not blame the drought on the emotional state of the people as do other Pagan texts. The Gezer tablet is written in the empire language of Alphabetic Akkadian (textual Aramaic).Download Free PDFView PDFHumanities CommonsDan Stele Translation in Alphabetic Akkadian (840 BCE2021 • David OlmstedThis fragmentary text is a debate about the cause of a drought between a Phoenician magic crafter devoted to the motion power class of the Ancient Pagan Paradigm and an Israelite life priest devoted to the life-growth powers. Each side blames the drought on the ineffectiveness of the other. Because the stele fragments were used as fill for or in a pavement dating to 800 BCE, it must have been composed at the start of the 840 BCE drought associated with Elijah as mentioned in the Hebrew scriptures. Deities mentioned are the moon god Su, the life source god Alu, and the life form manifestation god Yahu in several linguistic variants. Also referred to the epithet "Opener" is the manifestation gate goddess Utu. All large alphabetic steles so far examined around the Mediterranean are debates of this type including texts like the earlier Moabite stele (Olmsted May 28, 2021), the Sidonian Penptah (Tabnit) Sarcophagus (Olmsted June, 24 2021), the contemporaneous Jerusalem tablet (Olmsted June 13, 2021). Not surprisingly, the letter style of the Dan Stele is most similar to that of the Jerusalem tablet. Alphabetic Akkadian was the common trading and empire language of the Mediterranean and Middle East prior to the rise of Greek and Latin.Download Free PDFView PDFHumanities CommonsThree-Way Debate of the Jerusalem (Jehoash) Tablet in Alphabetic Akkadian Proves it is Authentic (980 BCE2021 • David OlmstedThis tablet was declared a fraud my many because it could not be translated from Hebrew yet this paper proves the tablet is authentic because it can be translated from Alphabetic Akkadian, a script unknown when the tablet was discovered. This tablet was once stored in a treasury room in Jerusalem's royal palace or first temple as evidenced by microscopic fire deposited gold droplets on its surface. Its text is a three-way debate about the cause of a drought between a Phoenician magic crafter, a Jewish life-priest, and a Greek Island (Philistine) priest. Consequently, this tablet was likely taken to Jerusalem from some early temple to the south near the border between Philistia and Judah. The tablet's letter style is most similar to that found on the 980 BCE Moabite Stele and like the Moabite stele its Jewish author blames the astrological powers for the drought. In this they are similar to the later 840 BCE Gezer tablet but having a different letter style (Olmsted, Sept 9, 2020) but are opposite to the 980 to 900 BCE Philistine and Phoenician el-Khadr spearheads (Olmsted January 17, 2021). Deities mentioned are Yahu, Hu, Atu, the Shepherd (Su), and the Gatekeeper (Ayu). Significantly, the spelling for "Yahu" (IH, YH) is the same which is found in the Hebrew scriptures. The long form of Yahweh is not used as it is in the Moabite stele.Download Free PDFView PDFOfficial Text at Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai References Thera Eruption (1620 BCE)Official Text at Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai References Thera Eruption (1620 BCE2020 • David OlmstedTwo early and still readable linear texts were found carved on the walls of turquoise mine L at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai of Egypt by William Petrie in 1906. They were never properly translated. These texts were inscribed within bas-relief steles indicating they were officially sanctioned texts. These texts reference a dimmed sun which would only have occurred during the 1620 BCE volcanic eruption on the Minoan island on Thera. This interpretation dates the texts to the Hyksos rule of northern Egypt. The existence of 2 Minoan Linear A phoneme signs within these texts indicates that they were composed by Minoan traders. The language of these texts is Akkadian and most of their signs are alphabetic (consonant followed by any vowel sound).Download Free PDFView PDFAlphabetic Akkadian Gravestone Translations from Sidon Show Differing Religious Themes (330 -0 BCE2021 • David OlmstedThese seven alphabetic gravestone texts and one-coin texts from Sidon date to the Hellenistic era based upon their religious themes and their Greek Island letter styles. In contrast, one earlier coin style from Sidon from the Persian period has the Phoenician letter style. Their underlying language is Akkadian which was the empire language of Mesopotamia and Mediterranean regions until it was mostly replaced by Greek and Latin during the latter half of the Hellenistic era. One of gravestone texts has a Latin signature yet its main text is still in Akkadian. These texts demonstrate that the change to Latin and Greek was uneven and happened over a period of time. Significantly, none of the Hellenistic era religious themes exhibited in these texts is Phoenician. One set of themes is Samaritan being Yahu (Yahweh) focused but doing so within the Ancient Pagan framework. The other set of themes was Central Mediterranean emphasizing the non-mixing of the two power classes of the Ancient Pagan Paradigm. The divine powers (deities) mentioned are Yahu (Yah, Yahweh), Hu, Ayu, the Shepherd (Su as the full moon), and eagle-vultures.Download Free PDFView PDFHumanities CommonsInscription on Nestors' Cup (730 BCE) is not Greek but is Alphabetic Akkadian2022 • David OlmstedThe text on Nestor's Cup (750-700 BCE) is not Greek as many claim but is actually Alphabetic Akkadian. Its three-line text is a debate about the cause of a drought. The first line blames the life network goddess Ayu and her eagle vultures while the second line blames emotion magic with its owls (like the Athenian owl). Alphabetic Akkadian was the common writen language for trade and temple used throughout the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age down to the rise of Latin and Greek. Commercial level trade, as evidenced by recent archaeology, is only possible with a common written language. The claim that the text was Greek originated with the early pioneer linguists who wanted to see Homer in everything and who made the letter identifications fit the Greek words they wanted to see. Unfortunately, that claim has never been corrected because the field of ancient linguistics lacks translation standards. The result has been the propagation of the myth that this is one of the oldest Greek texts. Deities mentioned are Alu, Hu, Ayu, and Yahu.Download Free PDFView PDFThree Religiously Themed Philistine Texts in Alphabetic Akkadian (1160-960 BCEDavid OlmstedThree previously untranslated Philistine (Sea Peoples) texts are translated in the empire language of Alphabetic Akkadian/Aramaic. Their script style is in the Minoan lineage which began with the Phaistos Disk and continued on with Linear A. Unlike those texts these texts are now fully alphabetic meaning their inner word signs are consonants followed by arbitrary vowel sounds. These are the earliest readable linear texts of the Iron Age so far discovered. The texts are from Qubur al-Walaydah, Gath (Tel es-Safi), and Izbet Sartah. They all deal with religion indicating that local Pagan temples were responsible for maintaining alphabetic literacy through the dark age of the Bronze Age economic collapse. Izbet Sarteh is discussing the reasons for a local drought around the time Shechem and Shiloh were destroyed suggesting a drought was the root cause of that conflict.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
