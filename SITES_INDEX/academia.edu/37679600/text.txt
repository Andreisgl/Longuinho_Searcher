Abstract: Emotions can be physical experiences. They may cause an unpleasant pressure on your shoulders, contract the skin over your collarbones, or make your arms or chest burn. They can fill your body with aggression, cause a pleasant warmth in your abdomen, or obstruct your breathing. This paper discusses emotions as physical and material phenomena—as matter— and the possibility to understand them as an artistic medium that, comparable to clay, plaster or paint, can determine the character of artworks. To explore emotions as artistic medium, I shall consider art scenes as “emotional communities” structured by systems of feelings (Ahmed, 2004, Rosenwein, 2010, 2002). Such structures prescribe certain relations between a given aesthetic expression and its supposed emotional force in particular settings. One does not have to agree with a system of feelings, or even share its dominant emotions, but within an emotional community it will still bind certain aesthetic gestures to particular emotions. This, in turn, affects inclusions and exclusions, art historiography, and judgements of quality within the community. In this paper, I will analyse three art performances by Anna Linder, Line Skywalker Karlström and Jenny Grönvall, which use the emotion of shame to problematize art scenes as emotional communities, from queer feminist perspectives.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEmotional topographies of performative artistic practices2011 • mojca  puncerAfter the decline of studies with regard to feeling and emotions within the historical context of aesthetics, we can see a revival of interest in this topic from the so-called &quot;affective turn&quot; aspect in art, culture and the broader social reality. In this context, affect becomes the key which unlocks the door towards harmonizing body and emotions. The cultural turn in aesthetics itself brings us an open mind platform, where the historical methods of studying the senses, emotions and feelings embodied in art objects are increasingly substituted by studies of aesthetical processes and performativity. Psychoanalysis, deconstruction of poststructuralism and the establishment of a tighter alliance between theory and the artistic practice itself were the factors which significantly contributed to the evaluation of the latter. Another important contribution in this evaluation sprang from feminist thought concentrating on the body. Aesthetics is in this context returning to its or...Download Free PDFView PDFVisualizing Feeling: Affect and the Feminine Avant-garde2011 • Susan BestThis book has three interconnected aims: to challenge the dominant characterisation of the art of the 1960s and 1970s as anti-aesthetic and affectless, to introduce feeling to the analysis of late modern and contemporary art, and to thereby properly acknowledge the specific contribution of leading women artists to this period. The book focuses on four well-known and highly respected North and South American artists of the period: Eva Hesse, Lygia Clark, Ana Mendieta and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. I show how their work transforms the avant-garde protocols of the period by introducing an affective dimension to late modern art. This aspect of their work, while frequently noted, has never been analysed in detail. "Visualizing Feeling" also addresses a methodological blind spot in art history: the interpretation of feeling, emotion and affect. It demonstrates that the affective dimension, alongside other materials and methods of art, is part of the artistic means of production and innovation. This is the first thorough re-appraisal of aesthetic engagement with affect in post-1960s art.

Book endorsements: "At last, here is, a book that lifts the ban on affect imposed on art criticism and theory by the "anti-aesthetic" school that has been dominating the scene in the last forty years! Taking her clues from four of the best women artists whose work spans the period, Susan Best convincingly demonstrates that if you close the door of the house of art to feelings, they enter through the window. What’s more, this is valid for the supposedly ‘anaesthetic’ art movements - minimal and conceptual art - that form the contextual background of her case studies: they are no less aesthetic than the art of the past or the most recent present." -- Thierry de Duve, Historian and Theorist of contemporary art and Professor at University of Lille "Susan Best's remarkably lucid and paradoxical project begins the process of recovering feeling and emotion in late modern art. Her landmark study of four women artists - Hesse, Clark, Mendieta and Cha - rescues both the feminine and the aesthetic from the ghetto, by an astute combination of psycho-analysis and art history." -- Dr. Ann Stephen, Senior Curator, Sydney University Museums "Visualizing Feeling develops a compelling argument for focusing on precisely the centrality of affect and feeling in any understanding of the art of the 1960s and 1970s, where it seemed that affect no longer had a place. In exploring the work of four powerful and sometimes neglected women artists, she shows how it is paradoxically where affect is consciously minimized that it nevertheless returns to haunt the art work as its most powerful force. Art works affect before they inform, perform or communicate. Sue Best demonstrates that by restoring the question of affect and emotion to the art work, new kinds of questions can be asked about the feminine in art, questions that affirm the personal and political power of these works of art." -- Elizabeth Grosz, Rutgers University, author of Chaos, Territory, Art: Deleuze and the Framing of the Earth, Columbia University Press, 2008 Reviews: Choice, Feb (2012), Art & Australia, 49.4 (2012), Australian and New Zealand Journal of Art, vol. 12 (2012), Cassone, Feb (2013), Parallax (2013).Download Free PDFView PDFHow to Do Things with Affects: Affective Triggers in Aesthetic Forms and Cultural Practices. Ed. Ernst van Alphen and Tomáš Jirsa. Leiden: Brill, 20192019 • Tomáš JirsaThis book develops affect as a highly productive concept for both cultural analysis and the reading of aesthetic forms. Shifting the focus from individual experiences and the human interiority of personal emotions and feelings toward the agency of cultural objects, social arrangements, and aesthetic matter, the book examines how affects operate and are triggered by aesthetic forms, media events, and cultural practices. Transgressing disciplinary boundaries and emphasizing close reading, the collected essays explore manifold affective transmissions and resonances enacted by modernist literary works, contemporary visual arts, horror and documentary films, museum displays, and animated pornography, with a special focus on how they impact on political events, media strategies, and social situations.

Both corporeal feminisms and materialisms propose modes of thought that link bodies and matter to the production of knowledge and the affective acquisition and articulation of meaning. The chapter argues that aesthetics and art‐making are especially significant to a feminist corporeal‐materialist project in that they mobilise materiality, the senses and response‐ability towards engaged and ethical responsibility. A feminist corporeal‐materialist aesthetics moves away from representation towards figuration and thus shifts the methodological ground from reflection to diffraction. In addition to rethinking authorship and intentionality beyond dualism, diffraction as an embodied and enworlded method suggests that art‐making, as a form of material intra‐action, might acquire agency; the subjects and objects of art practices emerge intra‐actively at the point of the agential cut that forms both, over time as well as in space.Download Free PDFView PDFPublicThe Affectivist Manifesto.
