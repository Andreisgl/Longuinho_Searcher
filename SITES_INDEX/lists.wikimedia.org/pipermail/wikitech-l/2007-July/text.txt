 The sensible thing would seem to be to fix up the nice one so it works,
 and then only have to worry about having one. 
Anyways there is one specific problem we need to solve:
How to inject an item into the page caption? Currently this does not seem to 
be possible as every HTML you inject there with an extension gets escaped.
This is not specific to the FlaggedRevs extension. The LanguageSelector 
extension by Duesentrieb also wants to provide an item at this place with the 
LanguageSelectorIntoTitle option.
So there are multiple use cases for the ability to inject an item there.
To your points with multiple GUIs:
Your thoughts aren't wrong but you aren't aware of some problems that made 
this necessary:
* Almost every corner of the GUI in Wikipedia is used either by usual 
MediaWiki features or some custom JavaScript/CSS (and they differ between 
various projects). You simply don't want to touch this and probably b0rk a 
lot of custom stuff. So the remaining options aren't so much and if you have 
more than one option every project can choose the one that causes the least 
adoption problems for them.
* Differrent Wikipedias want different types of FlaggedRevs. de.wikipedia 
wants a super-simple two level flagging with one flag: Every autoconfirmed 
user (of course a custom autoconfirmation with 30 days + 30 edits) can flag 
an article revision at the "ok" level (we used the clumsy "sighted" a
bad 
translation from German into English ;-) and any user that is in the reviewer 
user group can perform the higher "reviewed" degree of the quality flag. 
en.wikipedia in contrast (at least Erik and others) opted for a more 
extensive flagging system with multiple flags that cover certain article 
aspects such as "readability", "completeness"...
* The en.wikipedia approach needs more screenspace cause there is more 
available information. Thus the page caption is not the ideal article status 
display place for the en.wikipedia approach but perfectly for de.wikipedia. 
In contrast the more verbose display option of en.wikipedia is to large for 
the simple de.wikipedia aproach and as screen space isn't infinit you 
necessarily want the smallest possible item size.
So yes you have indeed a very valid point but you can be sure that we did 
think about this a lot (and we are very much aware that there are still 
things that need to be ironed out in the GUI of FlaggedRevs).
