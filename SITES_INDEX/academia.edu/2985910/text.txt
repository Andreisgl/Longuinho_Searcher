Nature-based tourism offers a mechanism to generate substantial benefits from protected areas for both governments and local communities, and ecotourism is increasingly promoted as a sustainable use of protected areas. The extent to which ecotourism offsets the costs of a protected area has rarely been examined. We used financial data from Komodo National Park, Indonesia, and a willingness-to-pay questionnaire of independent visitors to (1) examine the financial contribution of tourism in offsetting the costs of tourism and wider management and (2) assess the effect of hypothetical fee increases on park revenues, visitation patterns, and local economies. Although only 6.9% of park management costs were recovered, visitors were willing to pay over 10 times the current entrance fee, indicating a...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Sustainable DevelopmentWillingness to pay towards the conservation of ecotourism resources at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, West Java, Indonesia2009 • Ahmad  ShuibThe objectives of this study are to determine the visitors&#x27; willingness to pay for conservation of the resources at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park (TNGP), and to determine the satisfaction of visitors towards the use of the ecotourism resources of the park. The dichotomous choice Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was employed to determine the willingness to pay (WTP). A total of 423 respondents were interviewed face-to-face to collect the data.

Natural tourism activities can generate revenue which can be allocated for conservation as well as provide economic benefits for local communities. With the proviso that tourism activities still benefit communities’ economy, then it possibly will increase their awareness and participation in conservation activities. This research aims to determine the contribution of tourism activities for households’ economy and national park management. Particularly, the contribution of Halimun Salak National Park tourism household income sharing, total household expenses, as well as stakeholder perception related to the conservation at HSNP. The results determine the economic benefits of natural tourism for the community. 66% of local household income was generated from natural tourism and tourism income meets 91% of household expenditure of local communities.

Jones, Andrew SeidlProtected areas are key to the conservation of global biodiversity and ecosystem services; however, their success is contingent upon adequate funding. One possibility to increase funding for park management is to “sell” a wider suite of ecosystem services “produced” by protected areas, such as carbon sequestration. We conducted 420 tourist surveys to analyze willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem service benefits via a conservation fee in the Tambopata National Reserve in Peru. We also interviewed eight tour operators about their perceptions of the proposed fee. The average stated WTP was 15 USD. Sixty-six percent of tourists stated they would pay 10 USD or more, which, if actually paid, would have resulted in 318,000 USD for park management in 2015. Most respondents stated they would pay an additional fee if it supported biodiversity conservation or local ecosystem services, such as water, but less than 10% of tourists were motivated by carbon sequestration as a reason to pay the fee. Most tour operators supported the additional fee. Our findings suggest that tourists are willing to pay higher fees to support conservation but that interest in paying for additional ecosystem services from parks may not extend to global and intangible benefits such as carbon sequestration.Download Free PDFView PDFDeterminants of Visitors’ Willingness to Pay for Conservation of Tourism Resources: A Study in the Nameri National Park of Assam2020 • MAYURI DUTTANameri National Park (NNP) is a beautiful place, located in the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas in the Sonitpur district of the state of Assam. For public parks and sanctuaries, the usual market mechanism fails to provide the true appraise of economic value. For proper management and administration of public parks and sanctuaries in the developing countries like India, there is an urgent need to estimate the true economic value of these assets. In the present study we examine the influence of various socio-economic variables of the visitors like age, sex, educational attainment, distance, visitation rate, marital status and level of income on the willingness to pay (WTP) for the conservation of tourism resources of Nameri National Park of Assam. In this study, 145 visitors are interviewed face-to-face using a well-structured schedule. The estimated multiple linear regression model reveals that the tested independent variables sex, educational attainment, distance and income level...Download Free PDFView PDFPerspective on Visitor Fees in Public Protected Areas2016 • Ralf C BuckleyMany public protected areas worldwide charge fees for entrance, overnight camping, and commercial tour permits. These visitor or user fees raise revenue and may also influence visitor behaviour. Many protected areas are forced to charge fees because government funding is inadequate for conservation and visitor management in the face of rapidly rising visitor numbers and demands. Acceptance and effects of fees, however, depend on the historical, political, legal, economic and social context. Two issues are particularly significant: (a) equity between various social groups; and (b) control and use of funds raised.Download Free PDFView PDFTourism ManagementPricing policy in nature-based tourism1996 • HANS GREGERSENDownload Free PDFView PDFECOTOURISM AS A CONSERVATION STRATEGY IN KOMODO NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIAHenning  BorchersDownload Free PDFView PDFWillingness to Pay Towards the Conservation of Ecotourism Resources at Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary, Agusan Del Sur, Philippines2021 • Romell SeronayThis study aimed to determine the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of residents and tourists for the conservation of ecotourism resources at Sitio Panlabuhan Floating Village part of Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS) to establish a basis for collecting a conservation fee. The study used the open-ended contingent valuation method and analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression to reveal WTP. Results revealed WTP of Php. 81.54 and Php. 208.00 for local residents and tourists, respectively. The study suggests a collection increase of entrance or conservation fee as much as Php. 208.00 from Php. 100.00 to increase the integrated protected area fund (IPAF) for the protection and conservation management of AMWS.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Management and BusinessAre There Differences in Willingness to Pay Among Visitors and Non-Visitors of Taman Negara National Park?Khairil  WahidinApproaches such as the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) have helped to assign dollar values to non-use values for non-market goods which, unlike other products, are not traded in the market. This study attempts to put a value on the above non-market values. This study used the CVM, with Willingness to Pay (WTP) as the elicitation method to measure the non-use value among visitors and non-visitors of Taman Negara National Park (TNNP). This study also will answer questions; are there any differences in the WTP of various market segments, based on nationality, gender, age, education and income among visitors and non-visitors? This study found that there was a different between visitors and non-visitors willingness to pay. It also found that visitors and non-visitors market segments such as nationality,, income etc. are differed. Thus, information found in this study can be a fundamental source for park management in directing park pricing policy towards an efficient system.
