While these are important areas of research, the workplace setting itself can also create negative outcomes, suggesting the need to adapt characteristics of this setting. One aspect of this workplace setting includes the dynamics of interpersonal interaction within the workplace. This study reports a multivariate analysis of the relationship between negative workplace interpersonal interactions (generally defined to provide a more holistic assessment of ways in which violence is manifested in the workplace) between workers and service users and between workers themselves and human service worker occupational outcomes. Findings In 2012, data were collected from a sample (n = 674) of human service workers in Alberta, Canada. This study finds a high prevalence of negative workplace interactions between workers, and that these experiences have consequences for worker experience’s with burnout and life satisfaction, and contributes to intentions to leave the workplace. Compounding negative interpersonal interactions between workers are particularly significant across all measured occupational outcomes. Applications These findings suggest the need for a workplace ‘settings-based’ approach to improve occupational well-being among workers. Utilizing a workplace ‘settings-based’ approach would place more emphasis on the processes and structure of day-to-day work within organizations to help alleviate negative occupational outcomes among workers.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBritish Journal of Social WorkWorkplace Congruence and Occupational Outcomes among Social Service Workers2016 • John GrahamWorkplace expectations reflect an important consideration in employee experience. A higher prevalence of workplace congruence between worker and employer expectations has been associated with higher levels of productivity and overall workplace satisfaction across multiple occupational groups. Little research has investigated the relationship between workplace congruence and occupational health outcomes among social service workers. This study sought to better understand the extent to which occupational congruence contributes to occupational outcomes by surveying unionised social service workers (n ¼ 674) employed with the Government of Alberta, Canada. Multiple regression analysis shows that greater congruence between workplace and worker expectations around workloads, workplace values and the quality of the work environment significantly: (i) decreases symptoms related to distress and secondary traumatic stress; (ii) decreases intentions to leave; and (iii) increases overall life satisfaction. The findings provide some evidence of areas within the workplace of large government run social welfare programmes that can be better aligned to worker expectations to improve occupational outcomes among social service workers.Download Free PDFView PDFBook of Procedings of the 10th Conference European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology.Well-being at the workplace: the need for a psychological counselling service – an exploratory case study2012 • Serviço de Psicologia  Universidade da Madeira, Carla Vale Lucas, Filipa OliveiraDownload Free PDFView PDFAdvances in Mental HealthConsumer perspective employment in the psychiatric service system: A Victorian view on safety issues2003 • Cath RoperDownload Free PDFView PDFMental health and Work: Issues and Perspectives Work in the Trenches fear and anxiety in the workplace an exploration2002 • Monica LeonDownload Free PDFView PDFAdvances in Mental HealthRegulation of emotions in the helping professions: Nature, antecedents and consequences2003 • Lorella Lotto, Vanda L.

But personal life factors should also be considered in relation to occupational health and well-being. To better understand this relationship in social work specifically , data from interviews with social workers who reported low to medium levels of overall work and profession satisfaction were analyzed. Respondents noted that personal life factors such as interpersonal relationships and intrapersonal functioning affected their overall subjective well-being, and they highlighted several intersecting factors between their personal lives and professional roles that contribute to overall well-being. The findings have implications for social work education in regard to issues of self-care and the development of inter-and intrapersonal skills to maintain positive occupational health.Download Free PDFView PDFMental health and work: Issues and perspectivesEileen WillisDownload Free PDFView PDFJob stress : causes, impact and interventions in the health and community services sector2006 • Verna  BlewettDownload Free PDFView PDFHandbook of Stress in the  …Occupational stress in social work practice2011 • Nikki Wooten, Camille SabreeDownload Free PDFView PDF2018_Well‑being and Turnover Intentions among Romanian Social WorkersElena-Loreni Baciu, Delia  VirgaSocial work is a profession that aims to improve the social functioning of people in need, by supporting them to overcome difficult situations, therefore it is of utmost importance that the social worker himself functions properly and has an increased level of well‑being. Based on an empirical investigation conducted in 2017 on a national sample of 193 social workers from Romania, the current article answers the following questions: What type of impact do the job and the personal and organizational characteristics have on the well‑being and turnover intentions of Romanian social workers? Which of these characte ristics are the most significant? Three indicators were used to analyze social worker's well‑being: the three‑dimensional construct of burnout, mental health complaints, and physical health complaints. The turnover intention was added as an outcome. The findings of the study suggest that more than the personal characteristics of the respondents or the specific requirements of the job, it is the organizational environment which has a definitive impact on the social worker's well‑being and turnover intention. The most significant among the organizational characteristics observed were: the job pressure, the supervisor support, and the organizational justice. The final section of the article presents some possible lines of action to reduce burnout among social workers, as well as some future research questions that arose from the study findings.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
