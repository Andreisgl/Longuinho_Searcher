Chronological errors and socio-economic misconceptions have been shrouding a clear view on the sequence of events and their interregional consequences. Surprisingly complex metallurgy started already in the middle of the 5th Millennium BC and caused changes in social distinction, exchange systems and ideology. Other technologies were not directly affected, but on the contrary, lithic technique and ceramic styles show great elaboration. In a comparative approach the archaeological record of the Levant is compared to that of Southeastern Europe, and several structural similarities are discussed. It is argued, that the chronological parallelism is an argument against an autochthonous technical evaluation of the Balkan Peninsula, and that the social systems of both areas must have had similarities, which made the new cast metal artefacts very attractive.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersUnveiling Hidden Rituals: Ghassulian Metallurgy of the Southern Levant in Light ofthe Ethnographical RecordIsaac Gilead, Milena GošićThe Ghassulian culture of the Southern Levant (ca. 4500-4000) developed a sophisticated metal-working technology that featured alloying and advanced lost-wax technique. Considering that it was preceded by Neolithic cultures unfamiliar with metal, the Ghassulian not only developed the technology, but also had to integrate it into the social fabric. We argue that this was done through a set of rituals – resulting in ritualized metallurgy. By using the term ritualized metallurgy we imply that the whole production process, from collecting ore to casting objects was carried out in the framework of magical procedures relating to the supernatural. The transformational quality of smelting that relates metallurgy to alchemy and the repertoire of Ghassulian copper objects support this view. In absence of direct archaeological evidence for ritual during smelting and casting on Ghassulian sites, we turn to a wide range of examples known from the ethnographic record, with emphasis on extractive metallurgy and lost-wax casting. Most of these examples come from Africa where numerous studies have been done on indigenous metal-working, but also from India, Siberia, Americas, etc. These examples show that ritualization of metallurgy was widespread prior to industrialization of the craft. Furthermore, while considering the ethnographic examples, one easily notices that remains of such rituals would be very difficult or impossible to uncover archaeologically because they leave either no or scarce material evidence. Although it is not advisable to take ethnographic examples as exact analogies to what Ghassulian ritual looked like, we believe they offer a good idea of the repertoire of ritual behavior that we could expect to be practiced in the past. Acknowledging the existence of such rituals changes our perspective of the past, suggesting new ways of understanding how metallurgical technology might have changed the social structure of late Ghassulian communities such as those in the Nahal Beer Sheva area.Download Free PDFView PDFRemarks on the Early Appearance of Copper Objects in the Northern Region of the Southern Levant.Eliot BraunThis paper suggests possible links between the distribution of copper objects in EB 1 of the northern region of the southern Levant and Gray Burnished (aka Esdraelon) Ware.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Copper Axes Hoard in the Early Bronze IIIb Palace of Batrawy, Jordan. In: Copper and Trade, Edited by Karolina Rosińska-Balik Agnieszka Ochał-Czarnowicz Marcin Czarnowicz Joanna Dębowska-LudwinLorenzo NigroThe discovery in 2010 of a cachette with four copper axes in the Palace of Khirbet al-Batrawy (a 3rdMillennium BC city in North-Central Jordan) and, in the following 2011 season, the retrieval of a fifth additional axe from the Palace, increased the number of copper weapons from Early Bronze III urban contexts of the Southern Levant. A group of copper weapons similar to the Batrawy one was found in Tell el-Hesi in 1891, while the latest retrieval is the hoard found in Pella in 1994-1995. The Batrawy axes were found in the Palace Hall which also gave back a great amount of other valuable finds. Their study shed new light on metal procurement, trade and working, as well as on weapons distribution and use during the earliest urban floruit of Jordan.Download Free PDFView PDFMetal Weapons within funerary contexts in Southern Levant During the Early Bronze Age. A diachronic and typological overviewDaria MontanariThe diffusion of copper tools and weapons during the late 4th and 3rd Millennium BC in the Southern Levant marks a distinct transformation of economy and society of this region since it coincides with the earliest urban experience. This paper provides an overview of copper and copper alloyed weapons brought to light in Palestine and Transjordan, drawing a general picture technology and of functional types of such items.Download Free PDFView PDFCopper and Trade in the South–Eastern Mediterranean.

Four emic categories of ancient Egyptian adzes: an.t, msxt.jw, nwA and dSr.t are defined. The relationship between the tools, model tools and their expression of social status and social relations is herein studied in detail. It is argued that Old Kingdom models are multi-layered symbols of the patron-craftsman dependence. The adzes and model adze blades are products of attached craft specialization and indicate a high level of standardization.Download Free PDFView PDFIn: Link/Peter-Röcher (Hrsg.) · Gewalt und GesellschaftTechnikarchäologische Perspektiven zum Aufkommen spezialisierter Angriffswaffen aus Stein und Kupfer in der südlichen Levante (4.–3. Jahrtausend v. Chr.)Florian  KlimschaThis paper deals with the evolution of specialised assault weapons in the southern Levant from a point of view of technical innovation. Even though many of the technical prerequisites for casting copper swords and Epsilon axes were already available in the Late Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age I, it is not before 3000 BC that we can date the majority of the finds. However, there is both evidence from artefacts, as well as from the logic of technical innovation that the beginning of their production can be traced back to the second half of the 4th millennium BC. The author makes the argument that it is not by chance that this is a horizon in which established concentrations of power in yet unknown dimensions as well as technical innovations as the sailing boat, the wagon or the trade with metal ingots can be found. The weapons are interpreted as being objects of defining the status of a group of people profiting from this new socio-economic relations, either protecting it or being parasitic elements in it.Download Free PDFView PDFAnother Great Transformation: Technical and Economic Change from the Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age in the Southern Levant.Florian  KlimschaDownload Free PDFView PDFStefan Burmeister, Reinhard Bernbeck (eds.) | The Interplay of People and Technologies.

Silenced Consequences of the Introduction of MetallurgyFlorian  KlimschaThis paper discusses the underdetermined changes brought about by the introduction of extractive metallurgy in the southern Levant. It takes a long-term-perspective. The author sums up current perspectives with regard to a modified chronology based on calibrated radiocarbon dates before re-evaluating the interconnections between technical innovation and social change. Arguments in favor and against a Schivelbuschian view on extractive copper metallurgy are discussed as well as a variety of social fields in which changes can be detectedDownload Free PDFView PDFLong-range Contacts in the Late Chalcolithic of the Southern Levant.
