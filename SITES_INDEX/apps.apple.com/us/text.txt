    NASA has been my idol space agency and has driven my desire to see science fiction become reality.
At 50 years old, I grew up in the second great era of our nations’s space agency. The time of that absolutely stunning and beautiful workhorse, “The Space Shuttle”. I fell fell in love with it, mourned with it and always believed in it. That technological marvel, lit the fire within me to believe that one day, maybe even in my lifetime, an average person would be able to reach the stars. Now many years later, I look back on it nostalgically and it makes me smile. I am excited to see what humanity’s future holds with NASA courageously pushing the unknown frontier. Being able to view the earth, from the ISS, which was put in orbit by the “Space Shuttle Program”,  from my handheld touchscreen computer/communicator, while dictating to it as it responds to my queries, was 100% science-fiction when I was 12 years old. With out a doubt, NASA has continuously satisfied my inner desire, to see science-fiction, become reality! This app, being part of that system which makes it all possible, is more than just a link to a technological marvel. It’s a window, into a legacy of great minds, brave explores and heroes, that not only empowered our nation, but has empowered humankind. Thank you, to all The Trailblazers of the past, the present and the future; I can only imagine what the next 50 years is going to bring.

From the beginning of the NASA program we have a new way of exploring our minds of what’s outside our planet. We read that the Babylonians were building a wall to the sky. We learned aircraft’s could adventure above the clouds but through NASA we have went beyond the circle. From the sixties to today many generations have explored greater ideals of planets, moons, and craters. Thank you NASA for satellites, countries uniting, and education in so many forms. When we put the first man on the moon our imagination ran wild. Believing that we would be living as the cartoon “ the Jetsons” or exploring space meeting aliens as Star Trek or Star Wars. Even possibilities as ET introducing their kind to us earthlings. Through NASA we have explored the outer limits of space and many things inside. We have through NASA explored our depths of oceans finding new species that we now know exist. Thank you to NASA for the opportunities for our imagination to go beyond and the education to keep exploring the galaxy and our planet. There is so much more to explore from when NASA started to today and the future generation to add. It’s a galaxy of worlds unexplored also waters of the unknown. Overwhelming opportunities for now and future generations through the world of NASA. Thank You NASA!!
