Half done in 2023
It is mid year and we feel like we are half done with it :-)
After few months of absence of reporting now we summarize most of the first half of 2023.
Following our January presentation at Museum of Contemporary Art we had multiple follow-ups there and at University of Zagreb in Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, but also a meeting at National and University Library with tentative collaborations for 2024 #1lib1ref.
WikiSPORE and work with students
In mid March, we did a lecture and practicum demo in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb, at department of Information and Communication Sciences inside of Virtual Museum program. We were teaching students on Wikimedia ecosystem with insights into Wikidata, Commons and ... Wikispore! As they got informed and practiced basics we look forward to reconnect after exam season is over (individually) and see some again together after summer break in new academic year.
#1 A+F work
Vidljive, MSU Zagreb
On the May 18th we did first outreach and education in the Art+Feminism mode with  the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, as a MeetUp on the opening of the exhibitions of ‘The visible ones’ (Croatian: Vidljive) and later in June on the exhibition of Sanja Iveković: Works of Heart (as hybrid tutorial), focusing on female contemporary artists and their works in collections of institutions, but also how biographical articles are made on different Wikipedias. 
#01 A+F Wikimedia MeetUp
experiments in 20 years of Mi2 and abcDNK.hr
After a several months of on and off experimental work with wikimediating early history of Multimedia Institute in Zagreb, we concluded the first phase and presented the work and related topics on June 14 in hybrid way...with recording and essay available for now (just) in Croatian on abcDNK.hr, where we hope to advance this work.
We also currently try to facilitate *(in consultation with WMDE) for abcDNK.hr to migrate both of its website and archive of independent culture onto MediaWiki and potentially switch from custom solution to either Semantic Media Wiki and/or Wikibase, but considering the early stage of Wikibase.Cloud support we are not progressing fast and far. More updates after the summer!
