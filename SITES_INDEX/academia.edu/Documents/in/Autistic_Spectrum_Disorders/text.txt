Seeking such factors, the focus was on the family environment. Particular attention was paid to parental attitudes towards the child with indicated developmental disabilities and the child's sexuality. The tasks essential for the development of sexuality during childhood and adolescence were described. Possible problems and difficulties that may arise in this sphere in persons with developmental disabilities in the context of negative experiences were analyzed. General guidelines important for supporting parents were outlined, which are important from the perspective of limiting the adverse psychosocial experiences of children.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lifescience Global Canada and +1M.

In many cases, the speech therapist detects coupled difficulties resulting from overlapping pathomechanisms. The high degree of complicacy of symptoms usually stems from disorders in the course of complicated illness complexes of the developmental age. To draw conclusions on the neurobiological mechanisms of speaking difficulties in the context of the still developing brain and other organic systems is a very difficult task. The article presents the specificity of childhood disinte-grative disorders, which are classified as part of the spectrum of autistic disorders. With regard to the clinical picture and dynamism of symptoms, disintegrative disorders are distinguished from other comprehensive developmental disorders and require separate speech-therapy procedures. Using the case study of a 21-year-old patient, the diagnostic-therapeutic management of this disorder has been presented.Save to LibraryDownloadby Logopedia Silesiana•  7  Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Frontotemporal Dementia, Comprehensive Developmental Disorders, Heller’s syndromeThe Science Behind Autism and the 'Developmental Disorders': Tortuous or Tortured?The history of coming to grips with what autism is and its etiology has been tortuous ― if not tortured.

By 1908 the word autism was defined as a schizophrenic who was withdrawn or self-absorbed. Some decades later Leo Kanner decided that autism was based on children with “a powerful desire for aloneness.” In the 1960’s psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, picking up on another aspect of Kanner’s observations, thought autism was simply based upon mothers not loving their children enough. Then came the twin research studies which purported autism to be caused by genetics or biological differences in brain development. Yet the consensus that Autism is from an intrauterine infection had also been growing, bolstered more recently by Patterson’s and Fatemi’s studies. However, the question would still remain: which infection? This, of course, remains unknown. Until 1980 autism in the US is still called “childhood schizophrenia” and in some parts of the world, it still is. By the same token, there has been, for some time, an extensive body of medical literature which ties schizophrenia to chronic infection –some time before when Rzhetsky [5] in 2007, used a proof-of-concept bio-statistical analysis of 1.5 million patient records, finding significant genetic overlap in humans with autism, schizophrenia and tuberculosis. This lends an explanation as to why anti-tubercular drugs such as Seromycin have been so successful in NIH trials treating autism. Tracing the history of autism from John Langdon Down’s children, a subset of which were autistic, to the present, this paper also explains how the stealth pathogen hypothesized to be behind autism has evaded modern day diagnostics..Save to LibraryDownloadby Lawrence  Broxmeyer, MD•  9  Autism, Aspergers, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities and Autism Spectrum DisordersComparativa de las estrategias metodológicas utilizadas en dos escuelas inclusivas con alumnado con Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA)En Cataluña, el alumnado con Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA) escolarizado en escuelas inclusivas recibe apoyo por parte del servicio de apoyo intensivo para la escolarización inclusiva (SIEI), bien en las aulas ordinarias, o bien en... moreEn Cataluña, el alumnado con Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA) escolarizado en escuelas inclusivas recibe apoyo por partedel servicio de apoyo intensivo para la escolarización inclusiva (SIEI), bien en las aulas ordinarias, o bien en un aula específica.No obstante, para los maestros supone un reto acoger al alumnado con TEA, pues se deben desarrollar numerosas estrategiasmetodológicas: utilizar una apertura y un cierre claros, dar ejemplos, utilizar un lenguaje concreto, presentar la información demanera oral con apoyo visual, propiciar actividades de interés y anticipar, por citar algunas. Dada su gran variedad, el objetivo delestudio es identificar qué estrategias metodológicas se usan con los alumnos con TEA en el aula regular, y si difieren de las usadas enel aula SIEI. Se desarrolló un estudio cualitativo y descriptivo a partir de la observación en las aulas y entrevistas con una muestrade dos escuelas de educación primaria. Los resultados muestran que ambas escuelas utilizan múltiples estrategias, aunque algunasno se contemplan, por ejemplo, la generalización. Además, cuando hay un aula SIEI, se tiende a situar al alumno con TEA fuera delaula regular, donde el maestro de apoyo mantiene el rol de tutor. En cambio, dentro del aula regular, el maestro de apoyo destinasu tiempo al alumno con TEA de bajo funcionamiento; mientras que los alumnos con TEA de alto funcionamiento reciben apoyopor parte de los iguales. Finalmente, se observa la necesidad de desarrollar programas formativos para todo el profesorado parafomentar una mayor inclusión.Save to LibraryDownloadby Revista Educación Universidad de Costa Rica•  8  Inclusive Education, Special Education Teachers, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Trastornos del espectro autistaŠpecifiká sociálnej práce s autistickým dietatomSave to LibraryDownloadby sona srobarova•  6  Social Work, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Problems of Autistic Child, Families of Autistic ChildrenJournal of Geriatric Care and Research, 2016, Vol 3, Issue 1Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Geriatric Care and Research (JGCR)•  11  Geriatrics, Dementia, Disaster risk management, Psychiatry of older ageAutistic actors should play autistic charactersSave to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Graham•  11  Film Studies, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Theater and film, Autistic cultureΑυτοδιάλογος: Γνωστικές λειτουργίες, φαινομενολογία και η σημασία του στην ανάπτυξη του ατόμου/ Inner Speech, Self-TalkMaster's Thesis on Inner Speech O Αυτοδιάλογος, γνωστός επίσης και ως αυτό-ομιλία, εμπλέκεται στις θεωρίες της γλώσσας, των εκτελεστικών λειτουργιών του ατόμου, της ψυχοπαθολογίας και της γνωστικής ανάπτυξης.

Παρά το γεγονός ότι οι γνώσεις μας συνεχώς εμπλουτίζονται σε σχέση με την ανάπτυξη, τη λειτουργία και τη φαινομενολογία του αυτοδιαλόγου, εντούτοις οι μελέτες σε σχέση με αυτό το φαινόμενο, ειδικά στην Ελλάδα είναι περιορισμένες.

Although our knowledge is constantly improving regarding the development, function and phenomenology of inner speech, studies on this phenomenon, especially in Greece, are limited. This literature review examines the historical-philosophical background and existing most distinguished theoretical approaches to self-talk, as well as a variety of methodologies that have been or may be used in the future, in addition to their limitations, before listing data on the development and functioning of inner speech in children and adults. We conclude by examining different forms of inner speech in people with developmental and cognitive difficulties or disabilities, in people with psychopathological characteristics and by exploring the prospects for future research in Greece.Keywords: private speech, inner speech, self-talk, covert speechSave to LibraryDownloadby Angeliki G Arvaniti•  20  Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Depression, AphasiaPlichta, P., Jagoszewska, I., Gładyszewska-Cylulko, J., Szczupał, B.

Choć każdy z rodzajów niepełnosprawności wymaga nieco innych oddziaływań terapeutyczno-edukacyjnych, to niektóre zjawiska występujące w przestrzeni szkolnej dotykają wszystkich przedstawianych grup. Jednym z nich jest agresja rówieśnicza i przemoc (bullying). Temu tematowi została poświęcona pierwsza część monografii. Osoby z niepełnosprawnościami niekiedy występują w roli agresorów, ale częściej stają się ofiarami. Znajomość mechanizmów agresywnych realizowanych za pomocą nowoczesnych technologii informacyjno-komunikacyjnych (agresja elektroniczna i cyberbullying), a także zasad i praktycznych wskazówek odnośnie do postępowania profilaktycznego w sytuacji narażenia na przemoc może być pomocna dla pedagogów pracujących z osobami będącymi podmiotem niniejszej publikacji. W książce przybliżone zostały też zagadnienia dotyczące uczniów z niepełnosprawnością intelektualną oraz z zaburzeniami ze spektrum autyzmu. Poruszono problemy wynikające ze specyfiki funkcjonowania tych dzieci, ujawniające się w sytuacji diagnozy, konstruowania indywidualnych programów edukacyjno-terapeutycznych, doboru metod ich edukacji, rehabilitacji i wsparcia. Omówiono również kwestię pomocy rodzinie udzielanej przez szkołę oraz zasady współpracy pomiędzy tymi dwoma rodzajami otoczenia społecznego mającej na celu dobro dziecka. W dalszej części opracowania przedstawione zostały problemy uczniów z wadami wzroku i słuchu w kontekście działań ułatwiających ich edukację. Przybliżono wątki związane ze zmianami w zakresie regulacji prawnych, a także form kształcenia. Wszystkie problemy omawianych grup analizowano w odniesieniu do specyfiki ich funkcjonowania w różnych sferach rozwoju. Warto podkreślić w tym miejscu, że choć w szkołach ogólnodostępnych populacja osób z niepełnosprawnością wzrokową i słuchową jest liczna (zwłaszcza osób słabowidzących i słabosłyszących), to niewiele publikacji przybliża zagadnienia ich potrzeb w zakresie kształcenia i wychowania. Niniejsza monografia uzupełnia tę lukę, ułatwiając zrozumienie funkcjonowania uczniów z zaburzeniami widzenia i słyszenia. W obliczu trudności edukacyjnych może to sprzyjać efektywnemu wykorzystywaniu konkretnych metod postępowania omówionych w tej publikacji, jak też stymulować pedagogów do wynajdywania własnych sposobów radzenia sobie w sytuacjach trudnych związanych ze specyficznymi potrzebami edukacyjnymi uczniów z wadami wzroku i słuchu. W publikacji poruszono również problematykę funkcjonowania dzieci przewlekle chorych w roli uczniów. Choroba przewlekła została tu potraktowana jako sytuacja trudna, wywołująca wiele negatywnych emocji i stanów psychicznych. Jednocześnie podkreślono wartość wsparcia społecznego w minimalizowaniu ograniczeń wynikających z tego rodzaju choroby. Na zakończenie książki ukazano sylwetkę dziecka z niepełnosprawnością ruchową oraz swoistość jego kształcenia i wychowania, ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem konieczności zaspokajania potrzeby wyrażania siebie i porozumiewania się z innymi poprzez alternatywne i wspomagające formy komunikacji.Save to LibraryDownloadby Beata Cytowska and +1Piotr Plichta•  6  School Bullying, Special Educational Needs, Intellectual Disability, DisabilityHealth and social careSave to LibraryDownloadby Cs' Team•  12  Services, Human Resource Management, Health, CommunityFrom Autism Spectrum to Multi-Spectra LivingThis paper troubles the concept of single autism spectrum.

We discuss how the ideology from early medical theory has influenced the conceptualisation of autistic people, professional diagnostic practice and an aspiration to “cure” people of their autistic selves. We critique the idea of a single spectrum and propose alternative appreciations of autistic people as having diverse identities and community memberships, as people who are living fluid, intersectional lives over many axes and different contexts. Multi-Spectra Living problematises the story of autistic people as primarily or only autistic and proposes autistic people are fluid, contextually influenced and contextually responsive.We offer an elaboration on intersectionality by explaining how the practice of splintersectionality foregrounds one characteristic over another to reinforce existing professional and everyday prejudice resulting in social and statutory failures to autistic people. We extend the work of Pillow (2019) to discuss how lenticularity, decolonial attitude and epistemic witnessing can support the development of decolonial practice of Multi-Spectra Living.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gail Simon•  20  Counseling Psychology, Autism, Psychotherapy and Counseling, Autism Spectrum DisordersNeuroimages in AutismThis chapter summarizes findings of the morphological and functional brain changes in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), demonstrated by a growing body of researches that employs diverse neuroimaging methods.

We discuss major anatomical findings from studies in ASD utilizing structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We also explore findings from functional MRI (fMRI) studies, including task-related activation studies and functional connectivity. Regional changes in brain metabolism are examined using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and nuclear medicine techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). Finally, we highlight directions for continued research in neuroimaging of ASD at a network level using graph theoretical approaches.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gerry Leisman•  6  Spectroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Positron Emission TomographyBehavior Modification Techniques for Autism: A Case Exploration‘Autism’ or ‘Autism Spectrum Disorder’ is a neurological condition characterised by impairments in social interaction, difficulty in communication, and repetitive or stereotypic interest or behaviour patterns that interfere significantly... more‘Autism’ or ‘Autism Spectrum Disorder’ is a neurological condition characterised by impairments in social interaction, difficulty in communication, and repetitive or stereotypic interest or behaviour patterns that interfere significantly with the normal functioning of an individual. There has been a wide variety of treatment approaches on the road to practice, yet behaviour therapy remains to be one of the key foundations of psychological care and management for children or adults diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Behaviour modification techniques could be used effectively for regulating the behaviour patterns of young children in order to enhance their future life conditions.

Así, se ha diseñado un EGA que aprovecha las oportunidades de la realidad aumentada para activar la competencia socio-comunicativa en alumnado con Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA). Se sustenta en un entorno digital que secuencia las distintas actividades apoyadas en una narrativa gamificada propia, que da coherencia al periplo del alumnado en el entorno. Se integran aplicaciones y recursos de RA que invitan a la interacción y ejecución de las misiones propuestas a través de retos y desafíos que incluyen las mecánicas y dinámicas propias de la gamificación. Concretamente, en el presente estudio se describe el EGA De Grumete a Capitán: en busca del tesoro perdido, identificando la estrategia de gamificación adoptada en las actividades que integra y las aplicaciones de realidad aumentada que propician el aprendizaje inmersivo. Se presenta la narrativa que sustenta la aventura del jugador, donde se simula un escenario marinero en el que distintos personajes invitan al alumno a colaborar en la búsqueda de un tesoro perdido. Por un lado, el sistema de gamificación adoptado en el entorno inmersivo, señalando: a) sus mecánicas, objetivo, misiones, fórmula de asignación de puntos, niveles, obtención de premios y regalos; y, b) dinámicas, personajes y narrativa, reglas del juego, elementos que propician la implicación emocional: asunción de distintos roles, logro del objetivo, visibilización del avance de juego y status alcanzado.

This paper investigates the existence of a probable link between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and the birth of autistic children. We propose that the possibility of transfer of paternal mitochondrial DNA by this or other techniques is a condition to be taken into account in the alteration of Ca++ homeostasis that has been detected in some autistic individuals. Using Hempel’s nomological-deductive method as a guide, complemented by transcursive logic, we can scientifically explain the phenomenon that would hypothetically occur in the case where, after the use of the ICSI technique, an autistic child is born.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dante Salatino•  6  Autism, Psychiatric Disorders, Assisted Reproductive Technology, Autistic Spectrum DisordersAutistic Communication Support QAM Report 2014-2019The "Autistic-Led Innovation on Autism Communication Support Programs 5-year Report for 2014-2019" was received by California Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo (AD-51) We projected an increase to an 85% employment rate within 5 years.

Sports activities are known to prevent the negative symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The Badminton sports branch has a positive effect on the individual's object control, ball focus, and attention, reaction, perception and coordination characteristics. For this reason, racket sports are considered to be an important tool in reducing the lack of attention in individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder.Aim: The aim of this study, Investigation of the effect of simplified Badminton exercises on attention focus development of individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and is the assessment of the level of retention of an acquisition.Material and Method: The study group was randomly selected 3 out of 6 children who are not mentally retarded and responded to commands among 10 children aged 12-14 years in Isparta Gülşen Önal Autistic Children Education Centre. The mean age of children was 12.6 ± 1.15 years, height was 154,3±5,13 cm and weight was 52±3 kg. Benton Visual Memory Test, Bourdon Visual Attention Test and Stroop Effect Test were used as the measurement tool. Children were performed adaptation exercises for 2 weeks and from simple to difficult badminton exercise drills for 10 weeks. For each individual, 3 studies were performed at different times and 60 minutes per week. Tests were performed at 3 different periods, to be 10 weeks Badminton exercise process before and after and also retention test after 8 weeks interval. The obtained data were evaluated by Wilcoxon test.Results: According to the results of all measurement instruments of the students participating in the research, there is a numerical rise between pre - test and post - test values. When the results of the retention test with the last test are evaluated, there was no decrease in the two participants according to the Benton visual memory test results, but the other participant had also decline, although not at the beginning level. Burdon attention test and Stroop effect test showed that there was no return to baseline in all participants despite a numerical decrease.Conclusion: We can say that Badminton exercise program has a positive effect on attention level. Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder can be said to have a positive influence on the development of eye contact, long-time focus of objects and attention level development. Badminton exercises can be offered as a model to improve attentiveness to children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder if the duration of participatory study is increased.Save to LibraryDownloadby Open Access Publishing  Group•  23  Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Badminton, Autism (Education)Leon EisenbergLeon Eisenberg, M.D., D.Sc.

This article outlinesa PCP model of autism, based on a wide variety of recent research findings andwritings, including those of autism sufferers themselves. Autism is considered inthe light of Kelly’s fundamental postulate and 11 corollaries as well as Procter’s(1978) group and family corollaries. It is argued that Kelly’s theory provides anintegrative framework for considering this complex set of disorders with implicationsfor further research in autism and the early development of social cognition aswell as for therapeutic and educational intervention in helping people strugglingwith autistic spectrum disorders.Save to LibraryDownloadby Harry Procter•  13  Sociology, Psychology, Clinical Psychology, ConstructivismArchaeological Test Pit Excavations in Swaffham Bulbeck, Cambridgeshire, 2012This report presents the results of the ‘Time Detectives’ programme of archaeological excavation of 10 1m2 ‘test pits’ in the Cambridgeshire village of Swaffham Bulbeck in spring 2012.

The programme was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and was intended to enable schools pupils and adults affected by autism engaging with local charity Red2Greento work together to explore their local heritage. Over three days, more than 50 people took part in the excavations which provided new evidence for the development of the area nowoccupied by the village from the prehistoric period onwards. This appears to have been lightly used by humans in the prehistoric and Roman period until the late 9th century ADwhen a small settlement appears to have developed near the site of the present church. This settlement expanded north in the 12th-14th centuries, when a new planned extension,Newnham End, was founded. This period of growth ceased in the 14th century, when the new settlement may have been at least partly abandoned. Revival did not take hold untilperhaps the 17th or 18th centuries. By successfully involving adults affected by autism, local primary and secondary schoolpupils and local residents in organising and undertaking the excavations, the ‘Time Detectives’ excavations enabled participants to find out more about autism and about theirlocal heritage, and showed how effectively archaeological excavation can bring diverse people together.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alex  Pryor and +1Carenza Lewis•  10  Archaeology, Public Archaeology, Medieval History, Pottery (Archaeology)Health and social careSave to LibraryDownloadby A.

These are characterized by damages or delays in development of functions closely associated with the biological aging of the central nervous system. Neurodevelopmental disorders include speech and language disorders, learning disorders, motor and divisive disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Aiming to explore the various phenotypic characteristics of these disorders as well as their co-morbidity or coexistence, an emerging body of studies stressed the importance of both early multidisciplinary assessment and intervention in the framework of these disorders. Due to the complexity of neurodevelopmental disorders there should be specific diagnostic groups so as to apply timely and multifactorial diagnoses. Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations (ESSENCE) are considered as an assessment concept that could contribute to multifactorial early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Early, adequate, and comprehensive diagnosis conduces to early, effective, and well adapted to individual’s needs intervention programs. In the current study, the ESSENCE framework was used as the key diagnostic approach for both definitive and multifactorial diagnosis of a 3-year-old infant with a wide range of impairments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Open Access Publishing  Group and +1Victoria  Zakopoulou•  13  Special Education, Special Educational Needs and Transitions, Special Educational Needs, Early Childhood Special EducationSCOPE HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT IN AUTISM Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr Rangadhar Satapathy•  5  Autism, Homeopathy, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Autistic Spectrum DisordersARID MENTAL LANDSCAPES AND AVID CRAVINGS FOR HUMAN CONTACT: BECKETTIAN AND ANALYTIC NARRATIVESThis paper focuses on states of mind in which a psychic void predominates, characterized by a deep sense of meaninglessness and formlessness, and on the various survival strategies and protective shells employed in the attempt to "a-void"... moreThis paper focuses on states of mind in which a psychic void predominates, characterized by a deep sense of meaninglessness and formlessness, and on the various survival strategies and protective shells employed in the attempt to "a-void" this experience/state. At one pole, through a clinical case, I will illustrate the use of excitation envelopes and rebirth phantasies, as main pacifiers of the psychic void; at the other pole, through a discussion of Beckett's short play “Rockaby”, I will elaborate on overly rhythmic, controlled maneouvers that are devoid of aliveness, but protect against the awareness of such depleted states of mind.  In both cases, one can notice the oscillation between the defense employed and the ever-pulsating need for human contact, however faint it may be. The seemingly paradoxical contradiction between the psychic void and the overly structured literary text that embodies this void is frequently encountered in texts that express and give form to otherwise formless experiences through the structuring and ordering aspects of the text. These structures simultaneously express both something of the defense against the experience of fragmentation and dissolution and something of the experience that is being defended against by the protagonist.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alina Schellekes•  13  Samuel Beckett, Hypochondria, TIME, Autistic Spectrum DisordersMANAGEMENT OF AUTISTIC CHILDRENPsychologists, therapists and other professionals that are concerned in the wellbeing of all creation are in the business of promoting and maintaining good health.

The paper titled “Management of Autistic Children’’ discussed how Autistic individuals and their parents can be helped with the emotional and psychological problems they are passing through. The paper highlighted the concept of Autism, its obvious characteristics in communication, social development and repetitive behaviour. Furthermore, it discussed how best to improve the management of Autistic individuals. The roles of parents and guidance Counsellors in the management of Autistic Children were highlighted. It was recommended that there should be testing of Autistic individuals to ascertain the particular learning style he/she is best suited for. Individual counseling of parents of the affected ones would also be of great help and encouragement to them.Save to LibraryDownloadby Open Access Publishing  Group and +1Jacob Filgona•  15  Education, Special Education, Autism, Autism Spectrum DisordersOtizm Spektrum Bozukluğu İle Dikkat Eksikliği Ve Hiperaktivite Bozukluğu Arasındaki İlişkinin Regresyon Analizi İle İncelenmesiABSRACT Although Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been classified as two separate neuro-cognitive disorders and cannot be codiagnosed according to DSM IV, in the literature there... moreABSRACTAlthough Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been classified as two separate neuro-cognitive disorders and cannot be codiagnosed according to DSM IV, in the literature there are convincing amount of evidence indicating comorbidity of these two disorders (Ames and White, 2011; Rao and Landa, 2014). According to DSM-V, both neuro-cognitive disorders can be diagnosed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between ADHD and ASD. In order to understandthis relationship, how scores obtained from Conners Teacher Rating Scale-Revised Short (CTRS-RS) predict the Autism Index Scores (AIS) obtained from Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-2 (GARS-2) were analyzed. The data were collected from school teachers about 50 students with ASD. The predictive power of CTRS-RS subscales on GARS-2 AIS measured via standard multiple regression analysis. The subscales of CTRS-RS and ADHD indices revealed moderate and significant relationship with AIS obtained from GARS-2.ÖZETOtizm Spektrum Bozukluğu (OSB) ile Dikkat Eksikliği ve Hiperaktivite Bozukluğu (DEHB), birbirlerinden ayrı olarak tanımlanan nöro-gelişimsel yetersizliklerdir ve DSM-IV'e göre eş zamanlı tanılandırılmamaktadırlar.

Despite of their capability to solve mathematical problems, they can be seen or hear as beautiful as the nature. For example, if an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) appears in pixel and color, it looks like a visual artwork. Thus, they can be used in psychology and medical rehabilitation (like autism) purposes. This paper presents a method to show the ICA algorithm in colorful pixels to communicate with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) person for rehabilitation purposes. Moreover, depth image is used to calculate the distance between subject and sensor (Kinect V.2). Face detection employs Viola and Jones algorithm and face recognition uses SIFT features along with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier for fast recognition. As there are no more than just 5 subjects, system works fast and precise using subject's pre-learned face images. System works in a communicative manner between computer and the subject (ASD person) along with an autism psychologist to estimate the rehabilitation percentage (positive or negative) in each experiment on 5 ASD children. This communicative manner relation between human and computer is called, Human Computer Interaction (HCI). System performance is validated using 5 aesthetic measures as objective function for ICA. Proposed evolutionary art returned perfect results on making art works and also in validation part. System is tested with 5 aesthetic measures as fitness function. After finding proper pattern, it is possible to use this system in an applicable method even in real time systems.Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Software Engineering & Intelligent Systems•  7  Human Computer Interaction, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Evolutionary Algorithm, Visual Art WorksPrevalencia de los factores de riesgo perinatales en los Trastornos Generalizados del Desarrollo* Prevalence of Perinatal Risk Factors in the Pervasive Developmental DisordersSave to LibraryDownloadby Camila Villegas Muñoz•  6  Development, PDD/NOS, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, AetiologyThe Neurological Understanding of Surrogate Healing in Autism#Autism #AutismTreatment #AutismSurrogateHealing #IntentHealing #NonVerbalAutism What is Surrogate healing in Autism ?

This article outlines a PCP model of autism, based on a wide variety of recent research findings and writings, including those of autism sufferers themselves. Autism is considered in the light of Kelly's fundamental postulate and 11 corollaries as well as Procter's (1978) group and family corollaries. It is argued that Kelly's theory provides an integrative framework for considering this complex set of disorders with implications for further research in autism and the early development of social cognition as well as for therapeutic and educational intervention in helping people struggling with autistic spectrum disorders.Save to LibraryDownloadby Harry Procter•  13  Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, Education, Development StudiesArchaeological Test Pit Excavations in Swaffham Bulbeck, Cambridgeshire, 2012This report presents the results of the ‘Time Detectives’ programme of archaeological excavation of 10 1m2 ‘test pits’ in the Cambridgeshire village of Swaffham Bulbeck in spring 2012.

The programme was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and was intended to enable schools pupils and adults affected by autism engaging with local charity Red2Green to work together to explore their local heritage. Over three days, more than 50 people took part in the excavations which provided new evidence for the development of the area now occupied by the village from the prehistoric period onwards. This appears to have been lightly used by humans in the prehistoric and Roman period until the late 9th century AD when a small settlement appears to have developed near the site of the present church. This settlement expanded north in the 12th-14th centuries, when a new planned extension, Newnham End, was founded. This period of growth ceased in the 14th century, when the new settlement may have been at least partly abandoned. Revival did not take hold until perhaps the 17th or 18th centuries. By successfully involving adults affected by autism, local primary and secondary school pupils and local residents in organising and undertaking the excavations, the ‘Time Detectives’ excavations enabled participants to find out more about autism and about their local heritage, and showed how effectively archaeological excavation can bring diverse people together.Save to Libraryby Carenza Lewis•  10  Archaeology, Public Archaeology, Medieval History, AutismA CONTRIBUIÇÃO DO MODELO SOCIAL DA DEFICIÊNCIA PARA A COMPREENSÃO DO TRANSTORNO DO ESPECTRO AUTISTA THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE SOCIAL MODEL OF DISABILITY TO UNDERSTANDING AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDERRESUMO O objetivo deste artigo é o de identificar contribuições do modelo social da deficiência para a compreensão do Transtorno do Espectro Autista, considerado, hoje, no Brasil, uma condição de deficiência.

O estudo se caracterizou como uma pesquisa de cunho bibliográfico e de caráter conceitual. Para tanto, utilizou-se principalmente de referências da área da Educação, Psicologia e Sociologia que permitiram fomentar o debate sobre a compreensão do autismo. Os resultados do estudo apontaram que o modelo social da deficiência pode contribuir significativamente para repensar o conceito de deficiência e as práticas voltadas a essa população em várias áreas como Arte, Educação, Psicologia, dentre outras. O entendimento da deficiência como uma variação humana, o questionamento acerca dos processos de normatização e homogeneização vivenciados pelas pessoas com deficiência, a ênfase na singularidade e interseccionalidade dessa experiência e a defesa do direito de participação em igualdade de condições são alguns pontos de destaque. Palavras-chave: Modelo Social da Deficiência. Transtorno do Espectro Autista. Estudos sobre Deficiência.

The study was characterized as a bibliographic research of conceptual character. Therefore, is used mainly references from the fields of Education, Psychology and Sociology, which allowed instigate the discussion about autism comprehension. The results of the study indicated that the social model of disability can contribute significantly to rethink the concept of disability and the practices aimed at this population in different areas such as Art, Education, Psychology, among others. The understanding of disability as a human variation, the questioning about the standardization processes and homogenization experienced by people with disabilities, the emphasis on singularity and intersectionality of this experience and the defense of the right of equal conditions of participation are some highlights.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marivete Gesser•  3  Disability Studies, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Social Model of DisabilityExperiencia y cuerpo animado en el espectro autista.

Unfortunately, lack of satisfactory acoustical performance in most healthcare buildings worldwide has led to unfavorable prevailing conditions such as extremely noisy environment, irritation, disturbance, deterioration of a patient's health, and increase in likelihood of being readmitted into hospitals. This paper presents a case study on a diagnostic clinic targeted for autistic individuals in Mohammedpur, Dhaka as an attempt to investigate prevailing conditions of acoustical performance in healthcare facilities of Dhaka city. Questionnaire survey on users, instrumental survey on background noise levels and observations were conducted to obtain quantitative and qualitative data on acoustical performance. Instrumental survey results indicate that noise levels inside the specified clinic ranged from 59.5 to 76.5 dBA-exceeding the allowable limits of local and international standards. Questionnaire survey results also signify users' dissatisfaction with existing noise conditions and thus a poor acoustical environment. This study is expected to develop awareness on current unacceptable acoustical conditions of healthcare facilities and provide tentative propositions to commence effective initiatives for developing design criteria for healthcare buildings in general, and those for autistic group in particular.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anika Tabassum•  4  Child and adolescent mental health, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Architectural Acoustics, Noise PollutionUsability inquiry of a gamified behavior change app for increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in adults with and without autism spectrum disorderThe purpose of this study was to conduct the first usability inquiry of a gamified, behavior change theory-guided mobile app PuzzleWalk for increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in adults with and without autism... moreThe purpose of this study was to conduct the first usability inquiry of a gamified, behavior change theory-guided mobile app PuzzleWalk for increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in adults with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Se adopta una metodología cualitativa, concretada en la revisión sistemática de investigaciones (N=26) -a través de meta-análisis-, publicadas durante 2012-2020 en revistas de impacto, desarrolladas en tres contextos: educativo, experimental-psicológico y tecnológico. Los resultados reflejan que en su mayoría son estudios de caso. Destacan los estudios de índole tecnológico, ligados al diseño e implementación de recursos con RA en ámbito clínico. Asimismo, los asociados a intervenciones en contextos educativos incorporan la RA como recursos didácticos en ámbitos escolares. Los desarrollados en contextos experimentales-psicológicos describen intervenciones con RA y analizan el comportamiento de los sujetos en diversos ámbitos. Se observa unanimidad al subrayar el impacto positivo de las app o sistemas de RA para estimular la interacción social. Sin embargo, no especifican las fases de intervención ni utilizan app o recursos comerciales o accesibles, limitando su extrapolación a otros contextos.

Students were grouped as 8-10 aged, 11-13 aged, 14-16 aged. For measuring the students’ physical features height, age, weight and improved Eurofit tests for the disabled (25m sprint test, flamingo balance test, test of touch to the disks, flexibility, standing long jump, paw force, 30sec. shuttle test, 30 sec. push-ups vertical jump, 10x5m shuttle run test) were used. Pre-tests for each student were performed to get the information about the physical properties. According to these tests, 24 weeks special movement training program was prepared to improve the weak physical characteristics. Two volunteer students of sport science faculty recreation department were appointed to each student for applying the program. Volunteer students were educated with giving seminars about movement training, behavior to autism and children. Required exercise and game materials for training (various sizes and softness of balls, various sizes of pilates balls, targets, various heights of boards and obstacles, colorful balls and targets, various weights of dumbbells, various weights of medicine balls) were prepared. 40-60 minutes trainings were done 2 days in a week. Tests were done again in 6th, 12th and 18th week of training with saving. At the end of the 24th week, selected tests were done as a last test with comparing the other test results and evaluated. The obtained data were evaluated with interpreting and tabulated. The research results were interpreted with analyzing according to the age groups.Findings: As a result of the work done, it is seen that 8 students (2 female + 6 male) of 8-10 aged group have significant development in student’s feature of balance, flexibility, long jump and vertical jump, 5 students (2 female + 3 male) of 11-13 aged group have significant development in student’s features of 25m run, balance, flexibility, vertical jump and 5 students (2 female + 3 male) of 14-16 aged group have significant development in student’s features of 25m run, balance, flexibility, vertical jump, right handed paw force, 30 sec. shuttle and push-up.
