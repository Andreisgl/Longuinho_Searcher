This kind of dosing pattern may result in constantly changing, unpredictable plasma concentrations. Drugs can be delivered in a controlled pattern over a long period of time by the controlled or modified release drug delivery systems. They include dosage forms for oral and transdermal administration as well as injectable and implantable systems. For most of drugs, oral route remains as the most acceptable route of administration. Certain molecules may have low oral bioavailability because of solubility or permeability limitations. Development of an extended release dosage form also requires reasonable absorption throughout the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Among the available techniques to improve the bioavailability of these drugs fabrication of osmotic drug delivery system is the most appropriate one. Osmotic drug delivery systems release the drug with the zero order kinetics which does not depend on the initial concentration and the physiological factors of GIT. This review brings out new technologies, fabrication and recent clinical research in osmotic drug delivery. __________________________________________________________________________________________Download Free PDFView PDFOsmotic Controlled Drug Delivery Systems: An OverviewAjit JadhavOsmotic controlled drug delivery systems utilize the principles of osmotic pressure for the controlled delivery of active agent. The delivery rate of zero-order is achievable with these systems. The release rate from these systems is highly predictable and can be programmed by modulating the release control parameters. The drug release from these systems is independent of gastric pH and hydrodynamic conditions. A high degree of in vivo-in vitro correlation (IVIVC) is obtained with osmotically controlled drug delivery systems. In this review various types of osmotic systems, basic components, patent literature and commercially marketed osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFOSMOTICALLY CONTROLLED ORAL DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS: A NOVEL APPROACH Naisarg PujaraDownload Free PDFView PDFAn Overview on Osmotic Controlled Drug Delivery SystemInternational Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)This paper reviews constructed drug delivery systems applying osmotic principles for controlled drug release from the formulation. Osmotic devices which are tablets coated with walls of controlled porosity are the most promising strategy based systems for controlled drug delivery. In contrast to common tablets, these pumps provide constant (zero order) drug release rate. When these systems are exposed to water, low levels of water soluble additive is leached from polymeric material i.e. semipermeable membrane and drug releases in a controlled manner over an extended period of time. The main clinical benefits of oral osmotic drug delivery system are their ability to improve treatment tolerability and patient compliance. These advantages are mainly driven by the capacity to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, independent of the drug chemical properties, of the patient’s physiological factors or following food intake. This review brings out the theoretical concept of drug delivery, history, advantages and disadvantages of the delivery systems, types of oral osmotic drug delivery systems, factors affecting the drug delivery system and marketed products.Download Free PDFView PDFFormulation aspects in development of controlled porosity osmotic pump tabletDurgesh R ParakhThe development of oral controlled release system has been a challenge to formulation scientist due to their inability to restrain and localize the system at targeted areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Various physical and chemical approaches have been applied to produce a well characterized dosage form that controls drug input into the body within the specifications of the desired release profile. This is generally accomplished by attempting to obtain " zero-order " release from the dosage form, i.e., the rate of drug release is independent of the drug concentration. Controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet; which is an extension of elementary osmotic tablet, utilizes the principle of osmotic pressure for the delivery of drugs and avoids the expensive laser drilling for creation of delivery orifice on the tablet coat. They do not have any aperture to release the drugs; drug release is achieved through the pores, which are formed in the semi permeable wall in situ during the operation. The advantages of controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet are mainly driven by the capacity to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, independent of the drug chemical properties, patient's physiological factors or concomitant food intake. However, access to this technology has been restricted by the crowded patent landscape and manufacturing challenges. The present review highlights the principle of osmosis, formulation variables, factors affecting drug release, recent researches, marketed products and the evaluation parameters of controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet.Download Free PDFView PDFOSMOTIC PUMP DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM: A NOVAL APPROACHJillian ChangDownload Free PDFView PDFAn overview of Osmotic Drug Delivery System: An update reviewhiren patelThe pharmaceutical industry has faced several marked challenges in order to bring new chemical entities (NCEs) into the market over the past few decades. Various novel drug delivery approaches have been used as a part of life cycle management from which Osmotic drug delivery systems look the most promising one. After discussing the history of osmotic pump development, this article looks at the principles, advantages and disadvantages of osmotic drug delivery systems. Then, the basic components of osmotic pump and factors affecting the design of oral osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed in detail. In the later part of the manuscript, various types of osmotic pumps available in the market and evaluation methods for osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed in detail.Download Free PDFView PDFI IN ND DO O A AM ME ER RI IC CA AN N J JO OU UR RN NA AL L O OF F P PH HA AR RM MA AC CE EU UT TI IC CA AL L S SC CI IE EN NC CE ES S FORMULATION AND EVALUATION OF ELEMENTARY OSMOTIC PUMP DOXOFYLLINEEditor iajpsIn the present study elementary osmotic pumps (EOP) of Doxofylline were formulated and evaluated. The target release profile was selected and different variables were optimized to achieve the same. Formulation variables like nature and concentration of plasticizer (0-20% w/w of polymer) osmogens comparission and role of osmogen concentration, aperture diameter and coat thickness were found to affect the drug release from the developed formulations. Doxofylline release was directly proportional to the level of plasticizer and osmotic pressure generated by an osmotic agent. Drug release from developed formulations was independent of pH and agitation intensities of release media. Burst strength of the exhausted shells increased with increase in coat thickness but decreased with increase in level of hydrophilic plasticizer.Download Free PDFView PDFBansode, SarvananAshwini S BansodeDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
