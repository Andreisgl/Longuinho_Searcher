About myself[edit]
I was born in Aretxabaleta and I'm currently living in Madrid, studying for Aerospace Engineering. As you can see on the right side, my mother tongues are Basque and Spanish, and I also know a little bit of English and French. Yeah, I started learning Esperanto :P My main contributions to Wikipedia are in the Basque edition, with some collaborations on the English and Spanish versions too. My main interests are airplanes and science in general, but the English version has such a good information that it's almost impossible for me to improve anything there, so what I mostly do is create and fix interwiki links.
You can see my user pages in Wikipedia by using the proper links. You can contact me in any of those, though if it's anything about images or pictures, of course, you would prefer to contact me here in Commons.
My contributions[edit]
I started contributing in Commons with some diagrams for the Carnot cycle, because of the lack of proper figures. Since then, I have uploaded some pictures, but not many. With time, I'll continue uploading more photos, always trying to contribute with nice and informative pictures.
You can see my images here.
Besides images and photos, I'm trying to translate the relevant Help and Information pages into Basque.
My equipment[edit]
I have a Nikon D50 camera, with the kit-lens 18-55, and lenses Nikon 24-120 VR and Nikon 70-210, though this last one is my mother's. I'm planning to buy a Macro lens (the Sigma 105 f/2.8) so I can finally make better pictures of insects and plants.
