Waugh2009, Neighborhood watch : early detection and rapid response to biological invasion along US trade pathwaysThe growing pace of international commerce has created an increased risk of invasion by alien species, which often take root and thrive in their new environment, often at great costs for the local biota and economy. The risk of introduction of harmful organisms into the United States is increasing exponentially, with costs to the American economy measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. This report offers recommendations to improve biosecurity measures at US ports, as well as a possible funding mechanism based upon the polluter-pays principle.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersI3N Risk Assessment and Pathway Analysis: Tools for the Prevention of Biological InvasionsAnnie Simpson, Elizabeth Sellers, Gary Ervin, John D .

From early detection by forecasting the next invasion and improved surveillance through automation, to tools to improve rapid response, the next generation of management tools for a national EDRR program could integrate advances in technologies including the small size and ubiquity of sensors, satellites, drones, and bundles of sensors (like smartphones); advances in synthetic, molecular, and micro-biology; improved algorithms for artificial intelligence, machine vision and machine learning; and open innovation and citizen science. This paper reviews current and emerging technologies that the federal government and resource managers could utilize as part of a national EDRR program, and makes a number of recommendations for integrating technological solutions and innovation into the overall Federal Government respon...Download Free PDFView PDFBiol InvasionsSaving camels from straws: how propagule pressure-based prevention policies can reduce the risk of biological invasion2008 • Laura  MeyersonDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological ApplicationsBIOLOGICAL INVASIONS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY AND MANAGEMENT2006 • David Andow, Richard Mack, Keith HayesDownload Free PDFView PDFInvasive Species, Agriculture and Trade: Case Studies from the NAFTA Context2003 • Carroll MuffettDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological InvasionsTechnology innovation: advancing capacities for the early detection of and rapid response to invasive species2019 • Shah SelbeDownload Free PDFView PDFHalting the Invasion: State Tools for Invasive Species Managementchristina  kennedyNon-native invasive species, invasives, significantly threaten the ecological integrity of our nation’s natural systems. The economic and ecological harm caused by the prolific spread of invasive species has captured national attention, particularly in recent years. However, despite such increased awareness, current U.S. federal law offers limited protection from this menacing problem. Multiple federal laws and programs address invasive species in a fragmented manner and primarily focus on the impacts to our natural resource-based industries, particularly agriculture; thus, they fail to adequately cover invasive species that cause widespread damage to our natural areas. Federal resources currently devoted to this national catastrophe simply do not reflect the severity of the problem—neither its economic impacts nor its impacts to the nation’s biological diversity and biological integrity. Even though many invasive species are not regulated or controlled federally, states have passed a wide array of laws designed to address invasive species problems. As with the federal invasive species programs, state programs are varied and dispersed within and between multiple state agencies and organizations. There are many opportunities, however, to utilize existing state laws to address the problem of invasive species at a more local level. This report analyzes the current legal tools available at the state level to combat invasive species in the United States.Download Free PDFView PDFEPPO BulletinRisk maps for targeting exotic plant pest detection programs in the United States2011 • D.

We provide an overview of information management needs for enacting EDRR and discuss challenges to meeting these needs. We then review the history of relevant US policy directives for advancing invasive species information systems and provide an overview of federal invasive species information system capacities, including current gaps and inconsistencies. We conclude with a summary of key principles and needs for establishing a national invasive species information framework.

Many introduced plants that have become established outside of cultivation are benign (so far). However, some introduced species with free-living populations pose a threat to the biodiversity of natural areas and/or diminish the production capacity of managed or agricultural ecosystems. In the United States, 16 federal agencies have formed the Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds (FICMNEW). This committee has developed a National Strategy for Invasive Plant Management. Goals of the national strategy are: weed prevention, weed control, and restoration of degraded lands. Research, education, and partnerships are critical to the success of the strategy. Regulatory strategies to protect the United States and other countries from invasive plants include: production of weed-free commodities in exporting countries; preclearance of risk com...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
