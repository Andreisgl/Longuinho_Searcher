Abstract
                    Since early in the development of the project, Wikipedia editors have been concerned with overcoming "systemic biases" in coverage of the world's knowledge, especially those rooted in forms of social marginalisation. Major campaigns within the Wikipedia community attempt to reverse these disparities, largely by focusing on addressing "gaps" in the demographics of Wikipedia editors and by writing new articles about people and topics overlooked by the encyclopedia. However, many Wikipedia editors and observers have argued that the systemic biases of Wikipedia are inherent to current global distribution of knowledge production, and can only be overcome by changing the encyclopedia's standards of inclusion.
