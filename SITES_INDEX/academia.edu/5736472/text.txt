(the early Neo-Babylonian period) reveal an emergent use of family names among the elite inhabitants of many of southern Mesopotamia's traditional cultic centers. In Sons and Descendants the author applied a structuralist approach to examine this phenomenon. Less developed were the related questions of to whom were the urban elite projecting their identities and why had it become advantageous to claim such identities. The current work will address these questions by examining cultural contacts between the urban elite, the Assyrian empire, and the Aramean and Chaldean tribal groups present in southern Mesopotamia, and by considering to what degree the use of family names represented a nascent form of Babylonian national consciousness among the urban elite.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Two Dynasties of Assyria, in S.

Previous Assyrian rulers who had control over Babylonia were recognized as kings of both polities, but Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's father, Esarhaddon, had decided to split the empire between two of his sons, giving Ashurbanipal kingship over Assyria and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn the throne of Babylonia. As a result, Šamaš-šuma-ukīn is an intriguing case-study for how political, familial, and cultural identities were constructed in texts and interacted with each other as part of royal self-presentation. This paper shows that, despite Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's familial and cultural identity as an Assyrian, he presents himself as a quintessentially Babylonian king to a greater extent than any of his predecessors. To do so successfully, Šamaš-šuma-ukīn uses Babylonian motifs and titles while ignoring the Assyrian tropes his brother Ashurbanipal retains even in his Babylonian royal inscriptions.Download Free PDFView PDFAramean Origins: The Evidence from BabyloniaBill T.

This essay, delivered as a preliminary paper in Helsinki, was completed while three articles, organized in a specific series on the topic of ethnicity in the Neo-Assyrian empire through the lens of the nisbe, were in course of publication: Fales 2013, Fales 2015, and Fales 2017. It may thus be read as explicitly presenting a bird’s-eye view of the results given in much greater detail therein, although it also offers a number of new additions in the footnotes and the bibliography.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
