Of particular interest is the extent to which for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals obtain different results from the adoption of IT systems. We find that the marginal effect of IT on for-profit hospital productivity is to reduce the number of days supplied, while in not-for-profit hospitals the marginal effect of IT is to increase the quantity of services supplied. This resulting effect is consistent with the differing objectives of not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals and demonstrates the positive marginal value of IT as a sustainable and prudent investment.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Healthcare EngineeringPrevalence of Electronic Health Records in U.S. Hospitals2015 • Martin  GaynorDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Trillion Dollar Conundrum: Complementarities and Health Information Technology2012 • Avi GoldfarbDownload Free PDFView PDFHealth Information Technology: A Multiple Perspective AnalysisLucy DadayanHealth Information Technology (HIT) has become an important and necessary vehicle for various stakeholders, including medical doctors, nurses, patients, health care administrators, managers, providers, insurers, researchers, professionals, and the public in general. The past decade has seen the rapid advancement, development, adoption and diffusion of HIT. In general, Health Information Technology is a broad concept and encompasses various functions (i.e., clinical, administrative, managerial) and various goals (i.e., improving efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of the health care system; reducing medical errors; interconnecting clinicians and health care professionals; reducing health care costs; decreasing paperwork; and facilitating the speed of health care delivery). Therefore, the study of HIT is inherently challenging as it involves many facets that are often interconnected. The rapid advancement and proliferation of HIT in the last decade has stimulated an increased interest among academicians in understanding the key drivers of HIT adoption and diffusion. The focus of this dissertation is to assess the value, significance and adoption patterns of HIT at both micro (i.e., physician) and macro (i.e., hospital) levels using alternative theoretical lenses and methodologies. The overall results indicate that the adoption of HIT in its current form at the macro level is not necessarily dependent on organizational, financial or environmental characteristics of hospitals but is more a reflection of targeted policies for facilitating HIT adoption among the late majority hospitals. With the passage of time, the importance of hospital characteristics in terms of HIT adoption is diminishing; particularly for the long-existing HIT applications. On the contrary, the adoption of HIT at the micro level is at least partially driven by organizational factors, such as social and financial influence. Therefore, there is a disconnect between drivers and diffusion of HIT adoption at macro versus micro levels. Successful HIT adoption requires bridging the gap between HIT adoption at the macro and micro levels by promoting the potential benefits of HIT adoption and taking into consideration the unique needs of end-users.Download Free PDFView PDFHealth AffairsHealth Information Technology And Patient Safety: Evidence From Panel Data2009 • Stephen ParenteDownload Free PDFView PDFDoes information technology investment influence a firm's market value?

Building an organizational model, I show how the adoption of HIT may improve patient health and may either increase or decrease medical expenditures.Download Free PDFView PDFHealth Information Technology and Patient Outcomes: The Role of Organizational and Informational Complementarities2013 • Stephen Parente, Jeffrey McCulloughDownload Free PDFView PDFQuantifying the effects of modelling choices on hospital efficiency measures: A meta-regression analysis2009 • Kim Huong NguyenDownload Free PDFView PDFThe effect of information technology on hospital performanceThe effect of information technology on hospital performance2016 • Cynthia Williams, Yara AsiWhile healthcare entities have integrated various forms of health information technology (HIT) into their systems due to claims of increased quality and decreased costs, as well as various incentives, there is little available information about which applications of HIT are actually the most beneficial and efficient. In this study, we aim to assist administrators in understanding the characteristics of top performing hospitals. We utilized data from the Health Information and Management Systems Society and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid to assess 1039 hospitals. Inputs considered were full time equivalents, hospital size, and technology inputs. Technology inputs included personal health records (PHR), electronic medical records (EMRs), computerized physician order entry systems (CPOEs), and electronic access to diagnostic results. Output variables were measures of quality, hospital readmission and mortality rate. The analysis was conducted in a two-stage methodology: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Automatic Interaction Detector Analysis (AID), decision tree regression (DTreg). Overall, we found that electronic access to diagnostic results systems was the most influential technological characteristics; however organizational characteristics were more important than technological inputs. Hospitals that had the highest levels of quality indicated no excess in the use of technology input, averaging one use of a technology component. This study indicates that prudent consideration of organizational characteristics and technology is needed before investing in innovative programs.Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the 53rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.Impact of IT Investment on Hospital Performance: A Longitudinal Data Analysis2020 • Giridhar Reddy BojjaWith the enormous investments in Information Technology (IT), the question of payoffs from IT has become increasingly important. In this study, we investigate the impact of IT investments on hospital performance. We consider both financial outcomes such as return on investment and non-financial outcomes such as quality of care. We used longitudinal data that include the IT investments and hospital performance measures collected from over 500 hospitals and conduct a panel data analysis. The results of our study provide evidence for a significant positive relationship between IT investments and hospital performance measures.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
