Forgotten tropical plants rediscovered after 100+ years with the help of community science
Through the collaborative efforts of botanists and citizen scientists, these plants have been rediscovered after decades, some even after more than a century.
PhytoKeys is a peer-reviewed, open access, rapidly published journal, launched to accelerate research and free information exchange in taxonomy, phylogeny, biogeography and evolution of plants. The journal applies cutting-edge technologies in publishing and preservation of digital materials to meet the highest possible standards of the cybertaxonomy era.
PhytoKeys publishes papers in systematic Botany containing taxonomic/floristic data on any taxon of any geological age from any part of the world on the following topics: descriptions of new taxa, taxonomic revisions of extant and fossil plant groups, checklists and catalogues, phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, papers in descriptive and/or historical biogeography, methodology papers, monographs, etc. Extensive floristic overviews on a group in a country or larger region are welcome. Short floristic contributions may be considered if they are based on significant or unexpected discovery.
