Hybrid[edit]
This is a hybrid from original winners file (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikidata-logo-proposal-2s.png) - the original was half morse ("wiki") and half text ("data") bringing the term "wikidata" together. Now the morse code still says "wiki" only which is half of "wikidata". Why did you not change the morse to say whole "wikidata" string?--Kozuch (talk) 09:28, 30 August 2012 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Because it would not have looked good and would have deviated too much from the winning proposal :) --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 10:03, 30 August 2012 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Understand these objections. Thought the taskmaster (Wikidata project) should have the right to alter the winners logo in any way right? I am just saying that current logo does not make any sence (besides it may be visually appealing).--Kozuch (talk) 17:10, 30 August 2012 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Change category[edit]
Please change category "Wikidata" into "Wikidata logo". Thanks

Change the license to {{PD-textlogo}}. User:Armbrust (Local talk - en.Wikipedia talk) 11:06, 7 March 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
 Not done, you can edit the file description page yourself. odder (talk) 11:14, 7 March 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
No, I can't. It says: "This page is currently protected from editing because it is transcluded in the following page, which is protected with the "cascading" option enabled:     Commons:Auto-protected files/wikipedia/de". User:Armbrust (Local talk - en.Wikipedia talk) 14:34, 16 March 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Oups, apologies! Being an admin, I didn't notice that; I knew that I unprotected the page,  and did not try editing it while logged out, I have to admit — in any case, I now added the {{PD-textlogo}} tag to the file description page. Thanks, odder (talk) 14:44, 16 March 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Thanks. User:Armbrust (Local talk - en.Wikipedia talk) 23:27, 23 March 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
May I ask why?  Per WMF legal counsel, this qualifies for protection (sufficient originality, etc) and the original creator licensed it cc-by-sa.  Why the heck would you change it, Odder, particularly with no reason given by the requestor?  Philippe Beaudette, Wikimedia Foundation (talk) 11:30, 23 January 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Note, see also: m:Wikilegal/Copyright_threshold_of_originality_for_logos#Copyrightability_under_American_law.  Philippe Beaudette, Wikimedia Foundation (talk) 11:35, 23 January 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Because the logo does not meet the threshold of originality, it's as simple as that. If you cite WMF legal, let them come here and we'll discuss the thing on its merit, @User:Philippe (WMF). odder (talk) 19:51, 24 January 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Philippe, I'd encourage you to a civil and mellow behaviour; your emphasis above is unwarranted and disturbing. I'm not an expert of this area of Commons, but I know that Template:PD-textlogo is widely used and part of established practices on the matter: these are normal edits, there was a request by a user and another user applied the edit; now, similarly, you've made another edit without pre-emptive consensus. It's not like someone has been assaulted. --Nemo 20:30, 24 January 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Font[edit]
Does anyone know the font used in this logo? --Tobias1984 (talk) 12:19, 8 February 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Tobias1984: It's Gill Sans Bold. odder (talk) 13:31, 8 February 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@User:odder: Thanks! --Tobias1984 (talk) 13:45, 8 February 2014 (UTC)Reply[reply]
