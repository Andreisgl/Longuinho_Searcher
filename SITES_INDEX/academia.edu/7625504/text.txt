It turned out that the "clandestine" local finds of Byzantine coins (the prevailing currency in the area during the so-called dark centuries) outnumbered the officially reported finds, but were of the same order of magnitude. As a by-product, we discovered a small number of Ostrogothic and Carolingian coins, representing the widely neglected Germanic element of Carnuntum's find coins. Thus, our data collection helps to fill some of the gaps in the Carnuntum coin finds spectrum, which still exist for the time of approx. 400-1100 A.D. The results indicate once more the outstanding position of Carnuntum as a trading place-even during the dark centuries.Download Free PDFView PDF(Full text) Living by the coins.

In its heyday as the capital of the province of Pannonia superior, Carnuntum probably covered an area of almost 9 km². The whole site was divided into a military settlement (castra and canabae legionis) and a civil town (municipium/colonia). Through a large-scale archaeological prospection project, this huge area could be investigated and analyzed in great detail using a wide variety of nondestructive prospection methods. One of the main discoveries of the project was observed in the military settlement, where it was possible to identify a previously unknown military camp, interpreted as the garrison of the governor’s guard, the castra singularium. Through the topographic analysis of the immediate surroundings, the Roman fort was determined to be embedded in a large administrative complex related to the governor’s seat in Carnuntum.

After the death of Marcus Aurelius, the place continued to grow in the era of the Severan dynasty in the third century, before being sacked and abandoned late in the fourth century. Today, only a tiny village marks the spot of what has become the largest archaeological site in Austria.Download Free PDFView PDFCoin Finds from the intramural housing in Caričin Grad (Justiniana Prima), in: Numismatica e Archeologia. Monete, stratigrafie e contesti. Dati a confronto, a cura di G. Pardini, N. Parise, F. Marani, Roma 2017, 601-608.Vujadin M Ivanišević, Sonja JovanovićThe interpretation of the coin finds in Caričin Grad represents a particular challenge, as the city was erected ex nihilo during the fourth decade of the 6th century and whose duration can be followed to the initial years of the emperor Heraclius’ rule nearly until the year 615. New excavations in the Lower Town in the area of the intramural housing enlarged our knowledge concerning the circulation of coins in Caričin Grad, as in the Northern Illyricum. On this occasion, 342 specimens, mostly of Early Byzantine coins were unearthed. Within the Early Byzantine horizon, a certain number of Roman coins were discovered, as one Greek bronze denomination. The latest specimens consisted of a token from the 18th century and a Serbian dinar from the 19th century. The coins from the settlement in the Lower Town of Caričin Grad significantly filled in the gap regarding the finds of coins from earlier explorations of the city.Download Free PDFView PDFCarnuntum JahrbuchCoin finds and the Heidentor monument from Carnuntum2000 • Cristian GazdacDownload Free PDFView PDFRoman Ornamental Stones in North-Western EuropeUse and re-use of roman stone monuments in Carnuntum and its surrounding area2018 • Gabrielle KremerDownload Free PDFView PDFThe discovery of a gladiatorial school at CarnuntumWolfgang Neubauer, Michael Doneus, Klaus Loecker, Geert J J VerhoevenDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
