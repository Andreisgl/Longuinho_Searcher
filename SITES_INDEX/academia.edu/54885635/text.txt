Determining the factors that influence individual variation in the magnitude and rate of hippocampal decay may help promote lifestyle changes that prevent such deterioration from taking place.Download Free PDFView PDFEffects of Aerobic Exercise on Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Controlled TrialYim YimgreenDownload Free PDFView PDFAerobic exercise effects on cognitive and neural plasticity in older adults NIH Public AccessMichele LaraOlder adults frequently experience cognitive deficits accompanied by deterioration of brain tissue and function in a number of cortical and sub-cortical regions. Because of this common finding and the increasing ageing population in many countries throughout the world, there is an increasing interest in assessing the possibility that partaking in or changing certain lifestyles could prevent or reverse cognitive and neural decay in older adults. In this review we critically evaluate and summarise the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that assess the impact of aerobic exercise and fitness on cognitive performance, brain volume, and brain function in older adults with and without dementia. We argue that 6 months of moderate levels of aerobic activity are sufficient to produce significant improvements in cognitive function with the most dramatic effects occurring on measures of executive control. These improvements are accompanied by altered brain activity measures and increases in prefrontal and temporal grey matter volume that translate into a more efficient and effective neural system. Brain deterioration and cognitive decline are considered common characteristics of ageing. However, it is clear that not everyone experiences senescence at the same rate or to the same degree. Individual differences in the quality of cognitive and brain function in old age suggest that deterioration and decay are neither ubiquitous nor inevitable characteristics of ageing. This begs the following question: what are the factors that explain some of the individual differences in old age, allowing some people to retain cognitive and brain function, while pushing others into a trajectory of decline and decay? In addition to determining individual difference factors, recent interventions demonstrate that cognitive and brain deterioration is not unalterable and that the older adult brain retains some plasticity that can be taken advantage of in order to reverse deterioration and decay that may already be manifest. In this review we summarise research on the effect of aerobic exercise on preventing and reversing cognitive and brain decay in old age and provide practical recommendations for utilising exercise to take advantage of the brain's natural capacity for plasticity. COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIOURAL RESEARCH Ageing is often characterised by deterioration of both white matter and grey matter tissue in the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices with relative sparing of tissue in other regions such as primary motor and visual cortex. 1 Tissue deterioration is often accompanied by decline in cognitive function, with the greatest deficits occurring on measures of executive controlDownload Free PDFView PDFBrain SciencesPhysical Activity, Cognitive Function, and Brain Health: What Is the Role of Exercise Training in the Prevention of Dementia?2012 • Sara GregoryDownload Free PDFView PDFNeurobiology of AgingCardiorespiratory fitness is associated with atrophy in Alzheimer's and aging over 2 years2012 • Jeffrey BurnsWe sought to describe change in cardiorespiratory (CR) fitness over 2 years in those with early-stage Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and nondemented aging and assess the relationship of CR fitness with cognitive decline, brain atrophy, and dementia progression. Individuals with early-stage AD (n = 37) and without dementia (n = 53) attended clinical evaluations, cognitive and exercise tests, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 2 years later. CR fitness was lower in those with AD over the study period. Lower baseline CR fitness was associated with progression of dementia severity in AD. Declining CR fitness over 2 years was associated with brain atrophy in AD, especially in the parahippocampus. In nondemented participants, there was a trend for lower baseline fitness to be related to cognitive decline. Both lower baseline CR fitness and declining CR fitness over 2 years were associated with regional brain atrophy. We conclude that CR fitness is chronically reduced in th...Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North AmericaCognition, Aging, and Disabilities: Conceptual Issues2010 • Soo BorsonDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of PhysiologyPromoting brain health through exercise and diet in older adults: a physiological perspective2016 • Lauren DrogosThe rise in incidence of age-related cognitive impairment is a global health concern. Ageing is associated with a number of changes in the brain that, collectively, contribute to the declines in cognitive function observed in older adults. Structurally, the ageing brain atrophies as white and grey matter volumes decrease. Oxidative stress and inflammation promote endothelial dysfunction thereby hampering cerebral perfusion and thus delivery of energy substrates and nutrients. Further, the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles contributes to neuronal loss. Of interest, there are substantial inter-individual differences in the degree to which these physical and functional changes impact upon cognitive function as we grow older. This review describes how engaging in physical activity and cognitive activities and adhering to a Mediterranean style diet promote ‘brain health’. From a physiological perspective, we discuss the effects of these modifiable lifestyle behaviours on the brain, and how some recent human trials are beginning to show some promise as to the effectiveness of lifestyle behaviours in combating cognitive impairment. Moreover, we propose that these lifestyle behaviours, through numerous mechanisms, serve to increase brain, cerebrovascular and cognitive reserve, thereby preserving and enhancing cognitive function for longer.Download Free PDFView PDFPsychosomatic MedicineAerobic Exercise and Neurocognitive Performance: A Meta-Analytic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials2010 • Jeffrey Browndyke, Ph.D.Download Free PDFView PDFHuman Brain MappingThe effects of physical activity, education, and body mass index on the aging brain2011 • Oscar LopezDownload Free PDFView PDFAlzheimer S Dementia the Journal of the Alzheimer S AssociationCardiovascular Fitness is Associated with Altered Cortical Glucose Metabolism During Working Memory in ?4 Carriers2012 • Malcolm DickDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
