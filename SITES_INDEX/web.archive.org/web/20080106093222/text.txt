Bookish Britain overtakes America as top publisher
 By Jeffrey Goldfarb LONDON (Reuters) - Readers on both sides of the Atlantic 
Ocean made bestsellers last year of "The Da Vinci Code" and the 
latest Harry Potter adventure, but British publishers for only 
the second time in 20 years churned out more new book choices 
than their American counterparts. U.S. output dropped for the first time since 1999 while the 
number of British titles surged 28 percent, according to new 
data from research firm Bowker. Britain, with one-fifth the population of the United 
States, has long been the world's largest publisher of new 
books per capita in any language, but a steep decline in U.S. 
publication of general adult fiction and children's books 
helped boost the UK's total volume to the top English-language 
spot. UK publishers issued 206,000 new books in 2005 compared 
with 172,000 in the United States, which saw an 18 percent drop 
in production, according to the New Providence, New 
Jersey-based firm's preliminary figures.
 The volume of new books has been steadily increasing since 
the mid-1980s as the popularity of superstores required more 
titles to fill their shelves, and then later the advent of 
online retailers made greater choice even easier to supply. The number of annual new titles from U.S. publishers has 
increased 51 percent since 1995, but the growth may have hit a 
peak. "Common sense will tell you that when you produce 200,000 
new products -- more than any other industry -- the market 
can't digest all of them," Andrew Grabois, a Bowker consultant 
who compiled the data, said on Wednesday. "It's not because it's physically too many, but how do 
people become aware of all of them?" Bowker expects that American publishers will remain 
cautious this year, as well. "The price of paper has already gone up twice this year, 
and publishers, especially the small ones, will have to think 
very carefully about what to publish," Bowker's chief operating 
officer Gary Aiello said. The United States previously had published more books than 
Britain every year for the past 20 years, except in 2001, 
Grabois said. "The question is, will British publishers face a similar 
market correction, or have they figured out how fewer 
publishers can publish more books for even fewer readers?" he 
said. The U.S. output last year was the country's second highest 
total, after the record set in 2004. It was the 10th downturn 
in the last 50 years, Bowker said. Bowker's Books in Print data base represents figures from 
83,000 U.S. publishers. Grabois said he obtained the UK data 
from Nielsen BookScan.Source: REUTERS
