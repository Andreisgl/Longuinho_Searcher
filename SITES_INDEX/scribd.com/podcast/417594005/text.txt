My guest today, Dr. Paul Thomas is neither pro or anti-vaccine. Now, how is that possible? Well, you’re in for a real treat today learning what exactly are safe vaccines.   Growing Up In Africa   Dr. Paul Thomas grew up in a village in Africa since his parents were missionaries. At four years old, he became used to living in a hut with no running water nor electricity. Despite that, Dr. Paul Thomas says his childhood was terrific. Being culturally immersed, he even thought of himself as African.    “Coming from a different culture like that, you are inherently just a little more open to other ideas. One gift my parents gave me was to question authority. That was instilled in me since I was a student in middle school,” recalls Dr. Paul Thomas.   It’s interesting to note that Dr. Paul Thomas even went to high school with the daughters of former president Nelson Mandela. Fast forward years later, Dr. Paul Thomas pursued a medical degree at Dartmouth Medical School in the United States and eventually took his residency in California.    Residency Years   During his residency in the mid-1980s, Dr. Paul Thomas says that’s where he first saw benefits of vaccines. Pediatric hospitals were filled with children who had various diseases, and meningitis was particularly prevalent.    Administering vaccines for meningitis became a routine.  Dr. Paul Thomas said that studies even showed that it was effective. The HIB vaccine added later on to the vaccine schedule, and it was also effective in reducing meningitis. Naturally, it became apparent that those were safe vaccines.   The Fine Line   Dr. Paul Thomas also says doctors are only taught benefits of the vaccines and not the side effects. They see worse cases in hospitals. Hence, they get the mentality that they need to prevent these things. Dr. Paul Thomas says this is also why doctors have a hard time letting go of this “vaccine miracle” concept.    “Honestly if you ask pediatricians today, most will tell you that the most preventative health thing that they can do, gives vaccines. That’s how they are trained,” said Dr. Paul Thomas.    Autism And MMR   So many studies have come out over the years arguing on what are safe vaccines. It’s a never-ending debate. Dr. Paul Thomas has read so many materials on safe vaccines, and one, in particular, intrigued him.   Dr. Paul Thomas across the article by Dr. Andrew Wakefield in 2000, where Dr. Andrew Wakefield wrote about the MMR vaccine and autism. According to Dr. Paul Thomas, Dr. Andrew Wakefield didn’t say the MMR vaccine caused autism. That article which was later on retracted, only suggested that perhaps there might be a link. Dr. Andrew Wakefield was just presenting some case studies in that particular piece.   “I didn’t think vaccines were a part of the problem of autism. In my experience, I saw zero cases of autism in the four years I was at Dartmouth Medical School in the early 1980s,” said Dr. Paul Thomas.   But Dr. Paul Thomas also shares that during his 3-year residency from 1985 to 1988, he did see a couple of cases of PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified).  PDD-NOS is the equivalent of the autism spectrum child today.    Despite that, Dr. Paul Thomas says it was nothing like the severe cases these days where you see a child who is normal about a year of age and then regresses to being non-verbal, miserable and disconnected.    Ideally, Dr. Paul Thomas says that we should only be administered one aluminum-containing vaccine at a timeReleased:Feb 2, 2018Format:Podcast episodeTitles in the series (40)On Learn True Health, Ashley James interviews today's most successful natural healers each week.
