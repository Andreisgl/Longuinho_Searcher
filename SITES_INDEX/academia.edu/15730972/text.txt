My paper presents two pieces of new evidence relating to Margery Kempe’s son and to Robert Spryngolde, her confessor. The first item, a letter prepared for her son in Danzig (modern Gdańsk) in 1431, discloses the son’s name and the reasons for his journey to Lynn. This information, in turn, sheds new light on the account of The Book’s production as given in the Proem. As a result, the discovery of the letter corroborates the theory that the son was Kempe’s first scribe. A second previously unknown document shows the extent of Robert Spryngolde’s ties to Margery Kempe’s family, strengthening his role as the clerical scribe behind much of The Book. Both findings help to anchor the supposedly autobiographical narrative in its immediate historical situation, thereby strengthening the historicity of the work. Finally, I offer a revised explanation for the collaborative model behind the production of this text.Download Free PDFView PDFHistory of Women's Writing, 700-1500Diane Watt, Liz Herbert McAvoyThis volume focuses on women's literary history in Britain between 700 and 1500, a period traditionally marginalized in accounts of women's writing in English. Such marginalization, the editors argue, has been brought about in part by the erroneous assumption that there were no women writers operating in Britain before the emergence of Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The History of British Women's Writing 700-1500 therefore vigorously refutes this premise by focusing on a wide range of texts written by, for, and in collaboration with women from the Anglo-Saxon period through to the beginning of the sixteenth century. By also considering women's writing in the context of the deeply multicultural and multilingual milieu which was medieval 'Britain', it uncovers a wide range of women's literary activity undertaken in Latin, Welsh and Anglo-Norman as well as in the English vernacular and, in so doing, demands a rethinking of the long-established traditions of 'English' literary history – and even the concept of 'writing' itself.Download Free PDFView PDFPerilous Passages: The Book of Margery Kempe, 1534-1934Proym to Perilous Passages2013 • Julie ChappellDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Alleged Illiteracy of Margery Kempe: A Reconsideration of the EvidenceJo  KosterDownload Free PDFView PDFBodies of Parchment: Representing the Passion and Reading Manuscripts in Late Medieval England2010 • Sarah NoonanDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Book of Margery Kempe and the Pre-Tridentine Documentation of SanctityThomas Lawrence LongThe Book of Margery Kempe was an attempt to document sanctity at a time and place where different theories and practices of sanctification had begun to compete openly, though not equally, and that its subsequent commentators and redactors found the document as scandalous as her contemporaries found the woman. To document is to authenticate; and to authenticate her experiences and revelations was required to negotiate interiority and exteriority and the complex canons and principles that Roman Catholicism had established to manage claims of sanctity: Spiritual direction occurred in the internal forum of confession, penitents were permitted only one confessor and had to ask that confessor's permission to seek another, but claims to sanctity--the discernment of spirits--required multiple witnesses for their authentication. Margery Kempe undertook to publicize her life as virtually the only context in which to read her dense interiority. As a result, the Book of Margery Kempe documents one mystic's handling of sin but also her handling of the confessors she sought not simply for sacramental absolution but also for the discernment of spirits and the authentication of her experiences.Download Free PDFView PDFCutting Edge Youth Homelessness and Available Resources: Country Comparison between Brazil and Canada2017 • Mustahid M Husain, Kaitlynd StewartOur research examines the impact of social services on youth homelessness and compares findings from Brazil and Canada, in conjunction with neo-liberal application in these countries. We conducted a qualitative analysis based on literature review and interview data. Our findings suggest that services that directly assist homeless youth should focus on prevention, as well as intervention. We argue that learning about the factors and obstacles that contribute to youths leaving their homes could be more effective in preventing youth homelessness.Download Free PDFView PDFLiterature CompassFrom Translator to Laureate: Imagining the Medieval Author2008 • Anthony BaleToday we largely take it for granted that every text has an author, but what is understood by the term ‘author’ was very different in the Middle Ages. Medieval English ideas of authorship were many and varied, and show some key changes from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. In manuscript cultures, like England before the late fifteenth century, the author has little control over the repetition of his text; in many medieval vernacular texts the author is represented as a craftsman and translator rather than a visionary or virtuoso. Texts in manuscript were inherently open to rewriting and were often anonymous. The role and status of the author was interrogated by poets and scholars, often revealing a remarkably open sense of who, or what, an author could be. In the later medieval period, traditions of depicting real (Geoffrey Chaucer) and imagined (Sir John Mandeville) authors developed, signalling a growing trend of attaching an authorial identity to a text worth reading. The development of mysticism and affective religion brought further transformations in the role of the author, given the anxiety over who has the right and access to represent divine communication; this issue is raised in The Cloud of Unknowing and The Book of Margery Kempe, both of which play with conceits of anonymity. After Chaucer, in particular in the poetry of John Lydgate, we can identify the development of the English ‘laureate’ poet. In the early era of print, especially in the prologues of William Caxton, one discerns the emergence of an author, through the posthumous image of Chaucer, similar to that known today: not only a writer but also a creator, a celebrity and an authority.Download Free PDFView PDFeidr.wvu.eduRhetorics of Pain and Desire: The Writings of the Middle English MysticsMarisa KlagesDownload Free PDFView PDFMedieval Women's WritingDiane WattMedieval Women's Writing is a major new contribution to our understanding of women's writing in England, 1100-1500. The most comprehensive account to date, it includes writings in Latin and French as well as English, and works for as well as by women. Marie de France, Clemence of Barking, Julian of Norwich, Margery Kempe, and the Paston women are discussed alongside the Old English lives of women saints, The Life of Christina of Markyate, the St Albans Psalter, and the legends of women saints by Osbern Bokenham. Medieval Women's Writing addresses these key questions: Who were the first women authors in the English canon? What do we mean by women's writing in the Middle Ages? What do we mean by authorship? How can studying medieval writing contribute to our understanding of women's literary history? Diane Watt argues that female patrons, audiences, readers, and even subjects contributed to the production of texts and their meanings, whether written by men or women. Only an understanding of textual production as collaborative enables us to grasp fully women's engagement with literary culture. This radical rethinking of early womens literary history has major implications for all scholars working on medieval literature, on ideas of authorship, and on women's writing in later periods. The book will become standard reading for all students of these debates.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
