Three wheels and two axles of the wagon covering the grave in a wooden frame were discovered in the burial close to the Merkel village excavated in 1929 in the upper reaches of the Karamysh River, on the territory of the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Some details have shown that few parts of the wagon were placed in the grave in unfinished form. The diary records of the escavations author Paul Rau, which were found in archives, contained important information. The second burial was explored in the early 1970s in the Astrakhan region. Two wheels were preserved in the grave closing the access to the inner chamber. An analysis of the construction of the graves and wagons parts enables to speak about two types of grave structures in which wagons were placed – simple graves, and graves with inner chambers. The simple graves are contained not only of wheels but also o...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These finds have been discovered in burials of the nomadic nobility and date to the first centuries AD when Sarmartian nomads moving westwards came into contact with the Romans, whose empire had expanded onto the north-west shores of the Black Sea. Raev looks at the different types of find and chronology, before discussing the different ways in which these objects came into the possession of the nomads-trade, inter-tribal exchange, diplomatic gifts, payment for services and spoils from raiding.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Horse Frontlet Plates from Novolabinsky Grave 71 and Kurgans Near the Village of Glinoe as an Indicator of Contacts Between the Lower Dniestr Region and the Kuban RegionArchaeology and Early History of UkraineThis publication presents an assemblage from a horse burial excavated in 2011 in the cemetery of ... more This publication presents an assemblage from a horse burial excavated in 2011 in the cemetery of the 4th Novolabinsky settlement in the Kuban region. Six horses placed in a pit, were accompanied by several sets of riding harness. It included one bit with straight check-pieces, C-shaped check-pieces, bridle decorations, breastgirth ornaments and three frontlets, each with a hook, two of them have zoomorphic ends. The closest parallels to the horse frontlets from the Bolshoi Kurgan of Vasyurinskaya Gora allow us to attribute the Novolabinsk grave to the 2nd century BC. A series of eight similar frontlets without zoomorphic dйcor was found in kurgans near the village of Glinoe in Transnistria. The excavators dated the assemblages to the period from the first half of the 3rd century ВС to the first half of the 2nd century BC. Meanwhile, during this period there was a significant gap in 20—30 years when frontlets were not found in the graves.

Sarmatian Graves with Hiding-Holes in the Bottom of Pits in Kurgan Cemeteries of the Lower Volga RegionVestnik Volgogradskogo gosudarstvennogo universiteta. Serija 4. Istorija. Regionovedenie.

The article discusses one of the types of hiding-holes that were made in Sarmatian graves of the Lower Volga region. Hiding-holes as a substantial element of a graves structure are typical for Sarmatian burials of the last century BC and the first centuries AD. They were built in the burial pit, as well as near it, as a rule, in the west soil. In the burial pit, these were usually made as niches in the bottom parts of the walls, though hiding-holes in the bottom of the graves are characteristic only for the Lower Volga region. Methods and materials. There are not very many graves with hiding-holes in the Volga Region – eight in total, and none of them have been found in the neighboring regions, or only single cases are known. Archive data on excavations of the kurgans in the region allows the author to specify some essential construction details of the graves with hidingholes. These holes were dug out in the bottom of the grave pits; they are round in shape, 0.3–0.5 m ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Jh. n. Chr.) im Gräberfeld Walowyj 1 im Niederdon-Gebiet entdeckt worden sind. Höchstwahrscheinlich sind die ersten drei Stücke Nadelknöpfe, die keine bekannte Analogie haben. Doch zeigt die Schmucktechnik, dass diese Nadelknöpfe etwas mit den weiteren Funden aus dem Verbreitungsgebiet des Barbarenemails zu tun haben. Das vierte Stück konnte Bestandteil einer Fibel gewesen sein, die aufgrund ihrer Schmuckart sowie anderer Elemente den Fibeln der Römerzeit gleicht. Die Sarmaten erhielten die genannten Fundstücke, die allem Anschein nach Amulette waren, im Kontakt mit der migrierenden Bevölkerung der osteuropäischen Waldzone. Es waren die osteuropäischen Champlevé-Emailstücke, die in diesem Gebiet in der zweiten Hälfte des 2. Jhs. bis ins 3. Jh. n. Chr. eine Verbreitung finden; doch stammt deren Produktionsweise aus dem westbaltischen Kulturkreis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
