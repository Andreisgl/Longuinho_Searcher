This article explains why the Paralympic team continued to compete in international competition, and particularly why the British government allowed them to compete even as the British were maneuvering Rhodesian exclusion from the Mexico City and Munich Olympics.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSport and Racial Discrimination in Colonial ZimbabweAndrew NovakThe British colony of Southern Rhodesia, later governed by a white settler minority as unilaterally-independent Rhodesia, practiced racial segregation in many spheres, including education, health, and political participation. Though racial segregation tended to exist on a less formal level than in Rhodesia’s neighbor, apartheid South Africa, segregationist policies were nonetheless invasive and virtually complete in some areas. Sport was a heavily contested sphere, in which pockets of black African autonomy and advancement existed alongside near-complete white domination. The realities of racial segregation in Rhodesian sport were complex and somewhat ambiguous. This paper is an effort to develop a working hypothesis of racial discrimination in Rhodesian sport, discrimination that was never as formal or complete as in South Africa, but which nonetheless provided a firm foundation for Rhodesia’s exclusion from international sporting competition in the 1970s.Download Free PDFView PDFSport and Racial Discrimination in Colonial Zimbabwe: A ReanalysisAndrew NovakThe British colony of Southern Rhodesia, later governed by a white settler minority as unilaterally-independent Rhodesia, practiced racial segregation in many spheres, including education, health care access, and political participation. Though racial segregation tended to exist on a less formal level than in Rhodesia's neighbor, apartheid South Africa, segregationist policies were nonetheless invasive and virtually complete in some areas. Sport was a heavily contested sphere, in which pockets of black African autonomy and advancement existed alongside near-complete white domination, largely, but not entirely, free of government intrusion.

Sport reflected the qualities of white Rhodesian society, including its gendered and racialized norms. Rhodesia inherited its sporting ethic from Great Britain, and the British influence on Rhodesian sport remained indelible even as anti-British sentiment flared in the white community as Britain worked to exclude Rhodesia from international sport. This work highlights the irony that Rhodesia adhered to Imperial British social norms on the playing field while trying to assert an independent and anti-British national identity.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of The Royal Society for The Promotion of HealthAccess for all: the rise of the Paralympic Games2007 • Margaret GoldDownload Free PDFView PDFSocial InclusionInclusion through Sport: A Critical View on Paralympic Legacy from a Historical PerspectiveAnne  MarcelliniThrough its commitment to universalism, the inclusion of disabled people has become an increasingly prominent objective of the Paralympic Games. To achieve this, the organisers rely on the notion of legacy, which refers to the expected effects of major sporting events on host countries. This notion was initially founded on material aspects and then took an interest in certain intangible sides that were spotted within the organiser’s goals and studied in literature. Building on the historical literature about the Paralympic movement’s institutionalization, this article shows that this institutionalization took place in a context of tension between disabled communities, depending on their proximity to the Olympic model. What is the impact of this historical legacy in terms of inclusion of the greater number? By shedding light on the historical perspective of the obstacles encountered in the creation of an ‘all-disabilities’ sporting event, this article aims to discuss and challenge th...Download Free PDFView PDFParalympic Sport as a Vehicle for Social Change in Bermuda and GhanaAnjali J Forber-PrattBackground: Sport for persons with disabilities provides health, psychosocial well-being, and quality of life benefits. 1-3 Research has documented the benefits of sport for athletes without disabilities in resource-poor nations. However, less is known about these benefits for athletes with disabilities in nations with an emerging disability sport culture. This qualitative study sought to answer: (1) What are the effects of sport programmes for persons with disabilities on psychosocial development, well-being and quality of life? (2) How has the implementation of sport programmes for persons with disabilities affected the perceptions of disability by the community in these nations? Method: Case study research design, with data collected from unstructured participant observations from researcher field notes, fieldwork, archival media files, and interviews, was used to capture experiences of individuals. One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with athletes, coaches, programme coordinators and parents from Bermuda and Ghana (n=13). Analysis was performed using a modified van Kaam approach. Results: Interviewees reported that participation in Paralympic sport has benefits to one's own perception of self, benefits to others' perception of disability as well as instilling a sense of civic responsibility to continue educating others. Conclusions: Sport participation allowed for athletes with disabilities from Bermuda and Ghana to become contributing members of their society and leaders. These individuals capitalize on showing how sport can be a vehicle to change perceptions and stereotypes about disability.Download Free PDFView PDFParalympic success as a measure of national social and economic developmentIan BrittainDownload Free PDFView PDFThe global reality of the Paralympic Movement:  Challenges and opportunities in disability sportsEliane  Mauerberg-deCastro, Debra Campbellhttp://www.periodicos.rc.biblioteca.unesp.br/index.php/motriz/article/view/11450/pdf The purpose of this study was to briefly illustrate some of the challenges and realities of national and international Paralympic sports. The elite disabled athlete paradigm is still not widely known in the world of regular sports competitions. The winning elite disabled athletes are restricted to a few countries, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, China, and Australia, with limited distribution of disability sport opportunities in other countries. This tendency for the success of a minority of countries reflects global problems of social vulnerability in accessibility (e.g., in dismantling the stigma of disability), political vulnerability (e.g., representative organizations of sports for the disabled do not fully pratice the philosophy of “sport for all”), and economic vulnerability (e.g., lack of opportunities for training, assistive sports technology, and sponsorships). Furthermore, elite Paralympic athletes have become veterans. For example, the participation of Brazilian elite athletes in the 1984 Paralympics marked the beginning of a new generation of athletes (approximately 16%) who returned to the Games in 1988. In both 2008 and 2012, nearly 28% of total participants were Brazilian veterans. Although this picture reveals longevity of athletes in the sport, there are many limitations in sports accessibility, often due to geographical centralization of opportunities in large urban centers. Yet, today, the world of Paralympic sport has been transformed into a sports spectacle, thanks to the exceptional performance of some athletes, to the technology of mas s communication, and to the support of audiences during the Games. These sport “superstars” offer the world new images and new constructs of “ability.” While this forum has helped to bring attention to these “heroes,” other Brazilian athletes (and from other countries as well) are still waiting for their opportunities. Indeed, worldwide, young blind individuals, those in wheelchairs, amputees, or simply the uncoordinated, expect to play, run, swim, and take part in the international model of “sport for all.” They expect sports opportunities to be a part of their daily lives, an option for rehabilitation and the preservation of health, and a basic human right.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
