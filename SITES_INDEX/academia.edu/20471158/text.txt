Most such studies require the surface albedo to be known over a large area with continuous monitoring. Global climate studies naturally require global coverage, which is difficult to attain us-ing airborne or in situ observation methods. Satellite-based surface albedo estimation methods provide both continuous monitoring and fully global coverage from polar orbits.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAtmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsAir pollution slows down surface warming over the Tibetan Plateau2020 • Aolin JiaThe Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a vital role in regional and global climate change. The TP has been undergoing significant surface warming starting from 1850, with an air temperature increase of 1.39 K and surface solar dimming resulting from decreased incident solar radiation. The causes and impacts of solar dimming on surface warming are unclear. In this study, long-term (from 1850 to 2015) surface downward radiation datasets over the TP are developed by integrating 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models and satellite products. The validation results from two ground measurement networks show that the generated downward surface radiation datasets have a higher accuracy than the mean of multiple CMIP5 datasets and the fused datasets of reanalysis and satellite products. After analyzing the generated radiation data with four air temperature datasets, we found that downward shortwave radiation (DSR) remained stable before 1950 and then declined rapidly at a rate of −0.53 W m −2 per decade, and that the fastest decrease in DSR occurs in the southeastern TP. Evidence from site measurements, satellite observations, reanalysis, and model simulations suggested that the TP solar dimming was primarily driven by increased anthropogenic aerosols. The TP solar dimming is stronger in summer, at the same time that the increasing magnitude of the surface air temperature is the smallest. The cooling effect of solar dimming offsets surface warming on the TP by 0.80 ± 0.28 K (48.6 ± 17.3 %) in summer since 1850. It helps us understand the role of anthro-pogenic aerosols in climate warming and highlights the need for additional studies to be conducted to quantify the influence of air pollution on regional climate change over the TP.Download Free PDFView PDFAtmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsImprovements of synergetic aerosol retrieval for ENVISAT2008 • Marion Schroedter-HomscheidtDownload Free PDFView PDFAtmospheric Chemistry and Physics DiscussionsA review of measurement-based assessment of aerosol direct radiative effect and forcing2005 • Graham Feingold, Yves BalkanskiDownload Free PDFView PDFAnnales GeophysicaeUncertainties in satellite remote sensing of aerosols and impact on monitoring its long-term trend: a review and perspective2009 • Ralph KahnDownload Free PDFView PDFAtmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsRadiative forcing in the ACCMIP historical and future climate simulations2013 • Larry Horowitz, Yves Balkanski, Mark FlannerDownload Free PDFView PDFAtmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsValidation of the GRAPE single view aerosol retrieval for ATSR-2 and insights into the long term global AOD trend over the ocean2010 • Elisa  CarboniDownload Free PDFView PDFAtmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsGlobal evaluation of the Collection 5 MODIS dark-target aerosol products over land2010 • S.
