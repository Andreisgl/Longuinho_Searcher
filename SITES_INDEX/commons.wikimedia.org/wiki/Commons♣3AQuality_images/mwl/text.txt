This photograph of a Western Gull (Larus occidentalis) was the first Quality image to be promoted to Featured Picture status
Quality images are diagrams or photographs that meet certain quality standards (which are mostly technical in nature) and are valuable for Wikimedia projects. Unlike featured pictures, quality images must be the work of Commons contributors; they need not be extraordinary or outstanding, but merely well-composed and generally well-executed.
There are currently 329 163 images marked as Quality images, which is roughly 0,34% of the available images (96 668 190).
This page highlights recently promoted images that meet the quality image guidelines. If you think that a particular image meets the criteria, you may nominate it at Commons:Quality images candidates. All Quality images can be found in a category called Quality images. You can browse Quality images by country, subject or user/author.
Quality images are divided into three subgroups. Any individual image may be placed in one or more of these groups:
Pictures with special technical merit. These images can be used as reference tools for teaching and explaining concepts in photography.
Pictures with a particular subject. This group has subgroups such as "birds" and "man-made structures".
Pictures created in a particular manner. For example, animations and pictures created with the use of a microscope.
(Before adding new images to these pages please see Commons talk:Quality images.)
