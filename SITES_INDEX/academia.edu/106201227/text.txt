The exponential growth of the world population, climate variability, and soil degradation are essential factors that require the development of novel agricultural practices to achieve food security. In this context, organo-mineral fertilization has been proposed as a promising approach. Such a concept is based on novel fertilizers formulations combining organic and mineral resources features, which could simultaneously address soil fertility and health issues. The manufacturing processes of organo-mineral fertilizers (OMF) are highly versatile and revolve around the co-processing of organic and mineral matrices. OMF’s peculiarity resides in using systemic methodologies for waste valorization to generate cost-effective and eco-friendly products in alignment with the bio-circular economy. Despite their advantages, OMF adoption by farmers is still not sa...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBiomass Conversion and BiorefineryOverview on agricultural potentials of biogas slurry (BGS): applications, challenges, and solutions2022 • Satyawati SharmaDownload Free PDFView PDFReviews in Environmental Science and Bio/TechnologyValorization of digestates from urban or centralized biogas plants: a critical review2020 • Julie JimenezDownload Free PDFView PDFBiology and Fertility of SoilsThe effect of agroecosystem management on the distribution of C functional groups in soil organic matter: A reviewGeovanna ZaroTo improve soil health and to aid in climate change mitigation, the quantity of soil organic matter (SOM) should be maintained or increased over the long run. In doing so, not only the total quantity of SOC but also the stability of SOC must be considered. Stability of SOC increases as a function of resistance to microbial decomposition or microbial substrate use efficiency through chemical, biological, and physical mechanisms including humification, hydrophobic moieties, molecular diversity, and formation of macroaggregates. One of the mechanisms that enhance stability confers changes in the distribution of C functional groups of SOM. To better understand and quantify how these changes are influenced by agricultural management practices, we collected 670 pairwise data from the body of literature that has evaluated changes in the distribution of C functional groups of SOM measured by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy. The types of agricultural managements discussed herein include (1)...Download Free PDFView PDFIntechOpenAdvances in the Use of Organic and Organomineral Fertilizerz in Sustainable Agricultural Production2023 • ABDULRAHEEM Mukhtar IderawumiTo achieve high production in the current agricultural environment and increase soil quality for the plants, new technologies must be developed. It is becoming more and more important to adopt systems that can deliver higher production along with efficiency in the provision of nutrients in order to achieve sustainable agriculture. Despite improvements and novel techniques in modern agricultural practices, most of the global agriculture sectors still use conventional methods; as a result, it has sustainability and fertility issues. Since many yield-limiting problems are seriously hampering global agriculture, urgent action is needed to rehabilitate these soils; hence, the use of both organic and synthetic fertilizers was decreased by the usage of organomineral fertilizers (OMFs), which worked in concert with one another. When compared to inorganic fertilizers, the OMF improved soil physical qualities, as evidenced by a decrease in bulk density, high temperature, and preservation of soil moisture. The OMF increased soil organic matter, nutrient content, and cation availability compared to inorganic fertilizer. To increase the soil’s nutrient content, pH, and crop nutrient uptake, organic wastes like poultry manure, oil palm bunch ash, cocoa pod ash, kola pod husk, and sawdust ash were successfully blended with inorganic fertilizers for efficient productivityDownload Free PDFView PDFAgronomyAgronomic Efficiency of Animal-Derived Organic Fertilizers and Their Effects on Biology and Fertility of Soil: A ReviewAnkita BhowmikHealthy soils are essential for progressive agronomic activities. Organic fertilization positively affects agro-ecosystems by stimulating plant growth, enhancing crop productivity and fruit quality and improving soil fertility. Soil health and food security are the key elements of Organic Agriculture 3.0. Landfilling and/or open-dumping of animal wastes produced from slaughtering cause environmental pollution by releasing toxic substances, leachate and greenhouse gases. Direct application of animal carcasses to agricultural fields can adversely affect soil microbiota. Effective waste management technologies such as thermal drying, composting, vermicomposting and anaerobic digestion transform animal wastes, making them suitable for soil application by supplying soil high in organic carbon and total nitrogen. Recent agronomic practices applied recycled animal wastes as organic fertilizer in crop production. However, plants may not survive at a high fertilization rate due to the presen...Download Free PDFView PDFScience of The Total EnvironmentRestoration of soil quality using biochar and brown coal waste: A review2020 • Collins Amoah-AntwiDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological and Practical Applications for Sustainable Agriculture2020 • John KorstadDownload Free PDFView PDFVariability of Biochar Performance Among Soil Amendments and Enzymes Activity2021 • Mohammad DawoodIn a randomized complete block design, a field experiment was established with fourteen soil treatments: no mulch control (NM native soil), sewage sludge (SS), horse manure (HM), chicken manure (CM), vermicompost (Vermi), commercial organic fertilizer (Org), inorganic fertilizer (Inorg), and biochar added to NM, SS, HM, CM, Vermi, Org, and Inorg. The main objective was to assess the impact of various soil amendments (SA) and biochar added to SA on soil urease, invertase, acid and alkaline phosphatase activity involved in N, C, and P cycles, respectively. The addition of biochar to Vermi amended soil increased urease and invertase activity by 54 and 50%, respectively compared to soil mixed with Vermi alone (not amended with biochar). CM amended with biochar did not increase alkaline phosphatase activity compared to CM alone. Acid phosphatases activity decreased by about 21% after the addition of biochar to Vermi amended soil. Biochar added to HM and NM soil reduced soil alkaline phos...Download Free PDFView PDFRole of Starch Polymer-Coated Urea in the Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice and Wheat Ecosystems2020 • Dipti GorhThe excessive use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture interferes in natural ecosystem functioning and pollutes the environment through nitrogen leaching, volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. The consumption of conventional fertilizer in the agricultural field has increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, an important trace gas, which is responsible for stratospheric ozone layer depletion and global warming. Alternatively, the use of slow-release fertilizer (SRF) is considered to ameliorate crop nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and yields while minimizing problems related to environment caused by inorganic N-fertilizer. For SRF, the coating of urea particles can be done with various coating materials; thus, nutrients release slowly from coated fertilizer and plant can efficiently use it. The degree of N release to soil depends on the coating material being used. Starch is one type of encapsulating polymer which can be used to coat or encapsulate the urea granule...Download Free PDFView PDFBiomass Conversion and BiorefineryDoes pyrolysis temperature determine soil phosphorus bioavailability and uptake on peri-urban cropland amended with poultry litter biochar2022 • Segun O OladelePyrolysis temperature is a key factor that determines the characteristics of biochar and nutrient availability. However, little is known about how pyrolysis temperature affects phosphorus (P) bioavailability and uptake as well as the underlying mechanism when poultry litter biochar (PB), or its combination with NPK, is applied as a soil amendment on peri-urban cropland. To determine the influence of low and high pyrolysis temperatures on PB and its impact on P bioavailability, uptake and maize yield, we set up a randomized block design field study with the following treatments: (i) No amendment (CK), (ii) NPK mineral fertilization, (iii) biochar pyrolyzed at 300 °C (PB300), (iv) biochar pyrolyzed at 600 °C (PB600), (v) PB300 + NPK, and (vi) PB600 + NPK. Our results demonstrate that differences in pyrolysis temperatures (300 °C)-low and (600 °C)-high at which PB was pyrolyzed had no controlling influence on P bioavailability, uptake, soil microbial biomass P, alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, mycorrhizal fungi components (spores, colonization, glomalin, mycelium density), and maize yield. Similarly, regardless of pyrolysis temperature differences, the combination of PB with NPK (PB300 + NPK and PB600 + NPK) significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil P availability by 24% and 13%, uptake 46% and 42%, soil microbial biomass P 63% and 60%, C 8% and 2%, alkaline phosphatase 58% and 37%, and maize yield 37% and 36%, respectively, compared with NPK. PB + NPK, regardless of pyrolysis temperature, retained more P from total P input, which indicates that PB could be a veritable soil amendment technology for mitigating P leaching and enhancing P use efficiency and recycling on peri-urban croplands.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
