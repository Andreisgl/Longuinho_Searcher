    People are dishonestly misrepresenting why people are disappointed with the game
  
    Why is this false dichotomy being pushed that Starfield could either have boring & tedious planet-to-planet traversal like Elite Dangerous, or fast travel/loading screens that completely trivializes travel & exploration? The problem that people have with the game is that you're literally not travelling anywhere. You're just teleporting to and from different instances that aren't connected to anything, and the fact that you can avoid going to menus for travelling doesn't change that, it just saves you a couple of keystrokes & mouse clicks. People say that the game shouldn't be compared to No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous, or Star Citizen. Ok, so what should it be compared to then, Skyrim? In Skyrim there is an actual world that exists which you traverse to travel to destinations. This does not exist in Starfield. The cities aren't connected to anything. It's not about it not being "No Man's Skyrim." It's a literal regression from their other games. Fans are being dishonest about people's legitimate gripes with the exploration & travelling.
  
    Travelling doesn't exist in the game, because travelling implies a destination. Sure, you can traverse a randomly generated tile, but there is no destination to reach, unless you consider the points of interests destinations (and the POIs will eventually repeat themselves as you continue to generate tiles). You will just eventually hit a border. Going from instance to instance is not travelling, or "exploration." Space itself, and the planets, does not exist in the game. The space that you're in when you exit a planet is only an instance, and, in regards to the planets, only the instances for the cities and designated landing spots exist. For example, Jemison as a planet is an abstraction. You can teleport to the instance that is New Atlantis, any of the designated landing spots, or you can generate a random tile based off of various parameters, but there is nothing connecting those locations together. More proof of this is that the cities themselves don't even have gates that you can exit out of (correct me if I'm wrong). The only way to exit the cities is through your ship, which you're then teleported back to space. The locations on the planets aren't connected, meaning the planets aren't real entities in the game. The star systems themselves don't really exist. meaning that space in this game doesn't exist. That's the biggest issue with this game. If you're fine with the way the game functions that's one thing, but it's dishonest to misrepresent people's gripes as "lol people are upset that they have to spend a couple of seconds in a loading screen."
