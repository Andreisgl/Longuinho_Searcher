Tap to rateWrite a reviewReview must be at least 10 wordsBook previewUltimate Guide to Shopify - Jason R. RichPreface It used to be that if you wanted to start a business selling products to customers, you needed to open a brick-and-mortar retail store. This represented a huge commitment in time and money, not to mention significant risk. Operating a traditional retail store also meant catering to a group of customers from a narrow geographic area while competing with mass-market superstores. In addition to maintaining regular business hours, staffing the store with employees, and typically being required to sign a long-term lease for retail space, if you made any wrong decisions, it could easily lead to the business failing and personal financial ruin. Now, thanks to the internet, just about anyone can start an online business. An ecommerce business can be operated from virtually anywhere (if an internet connection is available), and just about anything that could be sold at retail can be sold online. Most important, you face significantly lower startup costs, less of a time commitment, and far less risk. In fact, with today’s technology, you could theoretically create and launch an online business in days or weeks—not months—and depending on what you plan to sell, the startup costs might be in the hundreds or thousands of dollars, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) needed to open a traditional retail store. Ecommerce platform Shopify published a report in January 2022 titled The Future of Commerce Trend Report: 2022, which noted that businesses have been forced to deal with more change in the past two years than in the previous 20. For the ecommerce business operator, this represents a potential opportunity, because more consumers than ever are now willing and able to shop online. However, Shopify’s report also noted that many challenges and changes still lie ahead, especially when it comes to product shortages, increased shipping times and costs, and higher online advertising costs. It stressed the importance of not just creating a website to sell products, but to build an interactive online community for your customers. This can be done using tools offered by Shopify, as well as various social media platforms. This trend is being referred to as social commerce, as opposed to ecommerce. One of many important lessons that can be learned from this report is that People are more willing than ever to buy from brands that resonate with them because of geography, company values, or sustainability. This makes it more important than ever for an online business operator to build their brand, company, and products around a strong, relatable, and attention-grabbing story that target customers will relate to. We will explore this concept in later chapters of the book. For example, in Chapter 5 Creating Your Online Store, the concept of developing a brand around your business is explained. Some Benefits to Operating an Online Business People of all ages (starting as young as their early teens), from all walks of life, and from all over the world have discovered that operating an ecommerce business can be a highly lucrative part-time or full-time business opportunity with virtually limitless potential. Starting an online business allows you to become your own boss, set your own work schedule, work from your home (or an office), and potentially reach a global audience. Unlike a traditional retail store, an ecommerce business is available to customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, regardless of where they’re located (provided you’re willing and able to ship your physical products to customers located outside your home country). By 2024, eMarketer and Insider Intelligence predict that ecommerce sales worldwide will reach $6.7 trillion. According to Shopify, back in 2019 online purchases represented just 13.6 percent of all product purchases by consumers, but by 2021 the figure had reached 19.5 percent. By 2024, it’s predicted to reach at least 21.8 percent. While online purchasing continues to be used by more and more U.S. consumers, this is a global phenomenon. In 2020, Latin America had the highest growth of retail ecommerce sales, followed by North America, Europe, and Asia. Out of all the countries on earth, however, China represents the largest pool of consumers who shop online. As of 2022, Chinese consumers were responsible for $2.8 trillion in online sales, compared to the U.S., which was responsible for $843 billion. Shopify predicts that by 2024, there will be more than 2.14 billion consumers worldwide who regularly shop online. Obviously, not all these people will be a prospective customer for your business, but even a tiny percentage of them represents a huge potential market that your website can appeal to. Ecommerce Offers Tremendous Opportunity As an online business operator, it’ll be your responsibility to identify a niche target audience for your products out of the ever-growing population that’s willing and able to shop online and then learn how to reach that audience to drive them to your website. It’ll then be your job to convert visitors to your website into paying customers and later convert those customers into repeat customers. A traditional website conveys information to a visitor through text, photos, video, graphics, animations, sound, and other multimedia content. An ecommerce website does much the same thing, but its purpose is to showcase products for potential customers and then offer an interactive shopping cart that allows them to quickly select and pay for them using a credit card, debit card, or electronic payment service. An ecommerce website can be accessed through an internet-connected desktop computer, laptop, smart-phone, tablet, and sometimes other devices, such as a smart watch, smart speaker, or smart TV. As an up-and-coming ecommerce business operator, it’s essential to keep up-to-date on the latest consumer and technology trends. For example, mobile ecommerce continues to experience major growth worldwide. This means that more and more consumers are doing their online shopping from mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. At least through 2024, business research firm Insider Intelligence forecasts that the percentage of consumers who shop online using their mobile devices will increase at a 25.5 percent compound annual rate. Virtually any physical product traditionally sold in a retail store can also be sold online. In addition, an ecommerce website can be used to sell services or digital products (ebooks, audiobooks, videos, NFTs, software, mobile apps, etc.) that get purchased and downloaded by the customer, as opposed to physical products that get shipped to them through the mail. As you’ll discover shortly, however, while just about anything can be sold online by a small ecommerce business operator, not everything will generate sales and allow them to earn a profit. Before you invest the time, effort, and money required to launch an online business, it’s essential that you focus carefully on what you’ll be selling, who you’ll be selling to, what competition already exists, and whether your product ideas are viable. That’s the focus of Chapter 3, What Can Be Sold Online. What makes starting and operating an ecommerce business so attractive to so many people is that if you rely on an ecommerce turnkey solution, you don’t need to become a tech-savvy website designer or programmer to create a professional-looking and highly functional ecommerce website that will appeal to your target audience. If you know how to use email, navigate the web, and use a word processor, you already have the basic skill set you need to create and operate an online business. Shopify Is a Powerful Ecommerce Turnkey Solution As the name suggests, an ecommerce turnkey solution is a set of tools available to online business operators that were created by programmers, website designers, graphic artists, and other professionals to make starting an ecommerce website easy even for nontechnical people. Using an ecommerce website template (or theme), an online business operator simply needs to add details and artwork related to their products and company, often using a drag-and-drop user interface, to create a professional and easy-to-use website, with no programming required. Many companies now offer ecommerce turnkey solutions to online business operators and entrepreneurs. To get started with one of them requires a very small financial investment and no long-term commitment. How much time it’ll take you to create and launch your ecommerce site will vary greatly, however, depending on a wide range of factors that we’ll be exploring shortly. However, creating and operating this type of business involves far less risk than opening and operating a traditional retail store. What Is Shopify? Originally launched in 2006, Shopify has become one of the world’s most popular and successful ecommerce turnkey solutions, offering products, services, and support to more than 1.75 million online business operators of all sizes from about 175 countries. Shopify offers the tools and resources most business operators need to create, launch, market, and manage a successful ecommerce business. Most of these tools and services are highly customizable and relatively easy to use, with a minimal learning curve associated with them. A startup ecommerce business operator can begin using the Shopify platform for as little as $29 per month (as of 2022). For all these reasons, Shopify is considered one of the world’s leading ecommerce platforms, with a U.S. market share of 23 percent as of the end of 2021. However, while Shopify is the primary focus of Ultimate Guide to Shopify, it’s important to understand that this service is not your only option, and that the decision about which ecommerce turnkey solution you choose should be based on a wide range of factors, such as what you’ll be selling, who you’ll be selling to, the scalability you’ll need as your business grows, your level of technical expertise, and the collection of tools and pricing that you require. You should also understand that the author and publisher of the Ultimate Guide to Shopify are in no way affiliated with Shopify. The goal of this book is to offer you an unbiased resource that will include a comprehensive introduction to the Shopify platform and eventually help you launch a successful online business. Keep in mind that technology and consumer buying habits change continuously, and that the Shopify platform continues to evolve and expand, with updates as well as new products and services designed to give online business operators the tools they need to manage a successful ecommerce business. Moving forward, know that people from all walks of life have operated and continue to run successful ecommerce businesses using the Shopify platform. But the more knowledge, education, and experience you have, whether it’s from running a traditional business or an online business, the bigger advantage you’ll have over your competition. As you’ll see, simply creating a professional-looking website that nicely showcases your products is just one piece of the ecommerce puzzle you’ll need to master. Operating a successful online business will require you to juggle a wide range of tasks: bookkeeping, sales, inventory management, customer service, writing/editing, advertising, marketing, promotions, product photography, product shipping, and public relations. You’ll also need to become an expert on whatever it is you plan to sell and learn how to pinpoint, and successfully reach, your niche target audience. Sure, you’ll be able to learn some of these skills as you go. You can also hire experts to help you along the way. But regardless of what you plan to sell, or whom you plan to sell it to, it’s essential to establish a stable foundation for your online business. Thus, the stronger your skill set is at the start, the greater your chances of success will be. 10 Common Issues Related to Running an Online Business As you begin your quest to become an ecommerce entrepreneur and launch your own online business, it’s essential to start off with realistic expectations. The following are just some of the misconceptions people commonly have when they decide to start a business online: Operating an ecommerce business is a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s not! Even if you choose the perfect products/services to sell and create an amazing website, just publishing a website online will not automatically lead to sales, profits, and great wealth. One of the costliest aspects of running an online business (and one that requires a significant time commitment as well) is advertising, marketing, and promoting your business to generate a steady flow of traffic (visitors) to your website. Realistically, it could take weeks, months, or even a year (possibly longer) before your online business becomes profitable. Regardless of what you choose to sell or who you identify as your target audience, you’re going to have a lot of competition from other businesses, both brick-andmortar and online. Operating an ecommerce business is an actual business (not a hobby). It will require a significant time and financial commitment, but you should not quit your existing job until you know your new business can generate the profit needed to sustain itself and provide you with a salary. As a legal business entity, you will need to pay taxes and maintain accurate financial records. Not all online businesses succeed. In fact, many fail. By reading this book, however, you will learn how to avoid many of the most common pitfalls people encounter as they launch and begin operating an ecommerce business using the Shopify platform. While the Shopify platform is powerful, constantly evolving, and widely used, it may not be the right choice for your specific business. No single solution or set of tools is ideal for everyone. Once you determine what you want to sell and who your target audience will be, it’s your job to research the tools that are best suited to your needs, budget, and skill set. Choosing to use the Shopify platform will not replace the need for you to make your own business decisions. There will be plenty of important decisions to make upfront and then moving forward. Mistakes could become time-consuming and costly, and result in the failure of your operation in the long run. As with any business, creating a proper business plan, doing plenty of research, and making sure you don’t cut necessary corners to save time and money will be essential. Online businesses run themselves. No! This is a common misconception! You will need to constantly update and manage your website, promote and advertise your business, keep your customers happy, and handle a wide range of responsibilities that will ensure your business operates smoothly. While you can set your own schedule and potentially run your online business on a part-time basis, it will never become a self-running or fully automated venture. You can’t sell low-cost, imported junk to customers at a high profit margin and expect to grow a profitable business. Whether it’s through social media, product ratings/reviews, business ratings/reviews, or word-of-mouth, if you attempt to rip off consumers, misrepresent or lie about your products, or mislead your customers in any way, your reputation will quickly be tarnished, and you’ll see your sales grind to a halt. As a small business operator, you should offer your customers top-quality products, top-notch customer service, and an overall quick-and-easy online shopping experience. It All Starts with a Great Idea! To become a successful ecommerce entrepreneur, you need a great idea regarding what you want to sell and whom you want to sell it to. As you’ll discover, you need to come up with one or more products or services that are in demand, have a decent profit margin, are easily sourced or manufactured, and do not have an insane amount of competition. Ideally, you also want evergreen products that are not seasonal or fad-based, and that have a growing niche customer base that you can easily and affordably identify and reach. In other words, as a small, independent online business operator, you cannot compete with Target, Walmart, Costco, Amazon, mall chain stores, popular franchises, or any other mass-market seller when it comes to commonly used products or services. Your best chance for success lies in selling unique or unusual items to a niche audience that you can easily target with your marketing efforts. Once you have identified both the products and/or services to sell and the target audience you plan to sell them to, only then should you start designing and planning your ecommerce website. As one of the world’s leading ecommerce platforms, there’s a good chance that Shopify will provide the tools and services you need both now and in the future, which is why reading the Ultimate Guide to Shopify is a good first step toward getting your online business started. In addition to helping you quickly get acquainted with the Shopify platform, this book includes 10 exclusive in-depth interviews with Shopify experts and experienced online business operators who have achieved success using Shopify. In these interviews, you’ll discover real-world advice and strategies that will help you achieve success and learn how to avoid common mistakes that other ecommerce entrepreneurs have made before you. Consider these experts to be your mentors. While you’ll likely never meet or interact with them in person, you can still learn a lot from their experiences as you move forward with your own business venture. In addition to these interviews, this book is full of helpful tips, free (and low-cost) resources, and detailed advice that’ll help you navigate the often-overwhelming world of ecommerce. Especially as the world’s population learns how to navigate the post–COVID-19 landscape, the ongoing reliance people have developed on online shopping over the past few years will not diminish anytime soon. If you can provide your customers with an online shopping experience that’s quick, easy, risk-free, and competitive on price, while offering a superior customer-service experience, top-quality products, and fast shipping, you’ll be well on your way to building a viable and profitable ecommerce business using the tools offered by Shopify. The primary goal of the Ultimate Guide to Shopify is to help you navigate the road ahead, as you develop and flesh out the idea for your online business and then invest the time, energy, money, and resources needed to make it a reality and succeed using the Shopify platform. After reading this book, you should be able to determine whether your idea is viable, understand the steps you need to take to create and manage a successful ecommerce website, determine what additional help you may need, and recognize how Shopify can help you save time and money as you get your business venture off the ground. CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Shopify If you have one or more products you wish to sell online, you’ll need to create a website with ecommerce capabilities, which means that in addition to containing a description and photos of the products being sold, the website will need to be integrated with a shopping cart function, giving it the ability to accept orders and process payments. You have a wide range of options when it comes to creating a professional-looking ecommerce website with all the features and functionality you’ll need. The most costly and complicated option is to create and program a website from scratch, launch it online, and then promote it to your potential audience. This requires you to have web programming and graphic design skills, not to mention the wherewithal to operate a business. An Ecommerce Turnkey Solution Offers an Easy Way to Launch Your Online Business A more cost-effective approach is to take advantage of an ecommerce turnkey solution, using a well-established and reputable service provider. This option requires no programming whatsoever, and while some basic graphic design skills will be useful, they’re not essential. When you use an ecommerce turnkey solution, all the tools you need to create, publish, and manage your ecommerce website are provided to you via an online service. All you need to do is pick a template (or theme) for your website, add the content you need (often using drag-and-drop functionality), and then use the premade tools to publish and manage your site. Because you’re customizing a preexisting website template that was designed by professional programmers and graphic artists, all you need to do is supply the assets that will be featured on your website, such as your company logo, product descriptions, and product photos. (We will discuss how to do this in Chapter 5, Creating Your Online Store.) You will typically have a wide selection of templates/themes to choose from, so you should choose one that complements what you’re selling and to whom you’re selling it. In most cases, you’ll also have access to a vast array of optional features and functions (in the form of apps) that you can add to your ecommerce website Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksE-CommerceFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
