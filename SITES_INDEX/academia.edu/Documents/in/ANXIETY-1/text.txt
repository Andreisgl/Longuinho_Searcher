Confirmatory factor analysis on data from social phobics (n = 108), normal adults (n = 103) and normal adolescents (n = 650) showed that the three original factors were strongly replicated in each sample. The three subscales appeared to have high internal consistency, while data on convergent and divergent validity were satisfactory. In addition, the subscales did very well in discriminating between phobic patients and normals, and were able to detect treatment effects. In the discussion the instrument is compared with other self report measures of anxiety dimensions, like the Cognitive Somatic Anxiety Questionnaire (CSAQ) and the Worry-Emotionality Scale (WES). It is suggested that similar questionnaires, adjusted to the separate anxiety disorders, should be developed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul Emmelkamp•  18  Psychology, Psychometrics, Personality Assessment, AdolescentThe Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS): Normative data and latent structure in a large non‐clinical sampleSave to LibraryDownloadby sriyani rekha•  34  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Demography, PsychometricsThe Three Domains of Disgust Scale: Factor Structure, Psychometric Properties, and Conceptual LimitationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Broman-Fulks•  38  Psychology, Assessment, Anger, PsychometricsNeural and cellular mechanisms of fear and extinction memory formationSave to LibraryDownloadby Caitlin Orsini•  8  Fear, Anxiety, Memory, BrainBuilding Attorney Resources: Helping New Lawyers Succeed Through Psychological CapitalLaw firms seeking a competitive advantage in the marketplace would do well to consider that the positive psychological resources of firm lawyers are just as important to individual and organizational performance as their intellectual... moreLaw firms seeking a competitive advantage in the marketplace would do well to consider that the positive psychological resources of firm lawyers are just as important to individual and organizational performance as their intellectual resources. There is growing evidence from the fields of positive psychology and positive organizational behavior that the resources of hope, optimism, self-efficacy and resilience shape the underlying attitudes and behaviors associated with increased performance. These resources may even buffer lawyers against the occupational hazards of the profession that cut against long-term success – hazards that include depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicide. In this capstone I advocate for traditional law firm associate training programs to be enhanced to include the development of psychological capital (or “PsyCap”), a construct consisting of the components of hope, self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism.

Questions about violence have not been included in health surveys; hence, little is known about prevalence and the consequences for health in the general population. No national study has been conducted in Norway. Aims: To estimate the prevalence of partner violence in Norway and the relationship between victimization and somatic health and depression and anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Methods: Data collection was performed by Statistics Norway. Among a random sample of women aged 20—55 years, 2,407 women returned the questionnaire (63.3%), of whom 2,143 were ever-partnered. Selected demographic characteristics were obtained from registers. Results: In total, 26.8% of 2,143 ever-partnered women had experienced any violence by their partner during their lifetime, and 5.5% in the year before the study.

Data are from participant report and medical records from mothers (n = 580) who completed a domestic adoption placement with nonrelatives at or near birth (Mean placement age = 7 days). We describe a comprehensive measure of perinatal risks, including divergences from previous assessment tools and the incorporation of multiple reporters, and report the prevalence of various types of perinatal risks. The prevalence of each specific risk factor was generally low, although several risks were more prevalent in this sample than estimates from nationally representative publicly available data. Nearly the entire sample (99%) experienced some type of risk exposure.

Although opioids remain unsurpassed analgesics to relieve moderate to severe pain, it has been shown that they also induce latent pain sensitization leading to long-lasting hyperalgesia via N-methyl-D-aspartate-(NMDA)-dependent pronociceptive systems. The present study evaluated the ability of nitrous oxide (N2O), a gas with NMDA antagonist properties, to prevent latent pain sensitization and long-term anxiety-like behavior (ALB) in rats with pain and opioid experiences. On D0, the pro-inflammatory drug carrageenan was injected in one hind paw of rats treated with fentanyl (4x100 microg/kg subcutaneously). Nociceptive threshold was evaluated with the paw pressure vocalization test. Rats were re-exposed to carrageenan or exposed to repeated non-nociceptive environmental stress (NNES) 2-3 weeks later. Rats were also challenged in the elevated plus-maze 2 weeks after fentanyl administration for evaluating ALB. The preventive effects of a single 4 h 50/50% N2O-O2 exposure performed on D0 was evaluated. Fifty percent N2O strongly reduced hyperalgesia induced by a first inflammation and its enhancement by fentanyl, and prevented exaggerated hyperalgesia induced by second inflammatory pain or NNES. Moreover, we provide first evidence that a high fentanyl dose induces long-term ALB 2 weeks after its administration. When associated with fentanyl, 50% N2O prevented such long-term ALB. These results suggest that a single exposure to N2O could improve post-injury pain management and facilitate rehabilitation especially when potent analgesics as opioids have to be used.Save to Libraryby Guy Simonnet and +1Baptiste Bessière•  20  Psychology, Pain, Neuropharmacology, AnxietyPsychological morbidity, illness representations, and quality of life in female and male patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndromeSave to LibraryDownloadby João Winck•  27  Psychology, Depression, Quality of life, AnxietyPilot study of a mindfulness-based, multi-component, in-school group sleep intervention in adolescent girlsSave to LibraryDownloadby Christian Nicholas•  16  Psychology, Adolescent, Group Psychotherapy, AnxietyThe relationship of dental caries and dental fear in Malaysian adolescents: a latent variable approachSave to LibraryDownloadby Gerry Humphris•  19  Dentistry, Health Behavior, Malaysia, ChinaSymptom prescription: Inducing anxiety by 70% exhalationSave to LibraryDownloadby E.

We enrolled 29 children with cardiac defects aged from 8 to 18 years, along with their parents. Both the parents and the children completed measures of expectations for the camp and anxiety. Analyses of repeated measures indicated that levels of anxiety amongst the children decreased significantly at the end of camp when compared to its beginning. Levels of anxiety amongst the children were not statistically different at follow-up. Anxiety amongst the parents concerning the separation from their children also decreased at follow-up when compared to before the camp. Higher levels of anxiety reported by the children prior to the camp were associated with greater anxiety amongst the parents concerning the anticipated separation, more negative parental expectations of the camp, fewer experiences of separation from their children, and lower expectations by t...Save to LibraryDownloadby Katie Devine•  16  Treatment Outcome, Adolescent, Anxiety, Congenital Heart DefectsEffect of Turkish classical music on blood pressure: A randomized controlled trial in hypertensive elderly patientsSave to LibraryDownloadby NİMET OVAYOLU•  16  Psychology, Music, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, TurkeyA validation study of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in different groups of Dutch subjectsSave to LibraryDownloadby Albert M van Hemert•  20  General Practice, Anxiety Disorders, Depression, AdolescentPerceived Partner Support in Pregnancy Predicts Lower Maternal and Infant DistressSave to LibraryDownloadby Christine Rini•  19  Psychology, Mental Health, Depression, ForecastingA Taxometric Investigation of the Latent Structure of Worry: Dimensionality and Associations With Depression, Anxiety, and StressSave to LibraryDownloadby Bradley Green and +2Shawn BergmanKim  Zlomke•  17  Psychology, Anxiety Disorders, Adolescent, AnxietyThe relationships of coping, negative thinking, life satisfaction, social support, and selected demographics with anxiety of young adult college studentsUnderstanding young adults&#39; anxiety requires applying a multidimensional approach to assess the psychosocial, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of this phenomenon.

A hypothesized model of the relationships among coping style, thinking style, life satisfaction, social support, and selected demographics and anxiety among college students was tested using path analysis. A total of 257 undergraduate students aged 18-24 years completed an online survey. The independent variables were measured using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Brief Students&#39; Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale, the Brief COPE Inventory, the Positive Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, and the Cognition Checklist-Anxiety.

Levels of anxiety after the injection were determined via the State Anxiety Scale of State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Both groups showed substantial increases in plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine and heart rate after the injection. However, there were no significant differences between anxious patients and controls on plasma catecholamines and heart rate before or after the injection and post injection levels of State Anxiety. The anxious subjects showed a significant correlation between post injection heart rate and State Anxiety.Save to Libraryby David J Francis•  13  Anxiety Disorders, Anxiety, Humans, EpinephrineThe mental health patient profile: does it change primary care physicians' practice patterns?We conducted a prospective trial randomizing 75 physicians to either a control or intervention arm to evaluate the impact of providing patient-reported information on anxiety and other mental health symptoms and disorders to primary care... moreWe conducted a prospective trial randomizing 75 physicians to either a control or intervention arm to evaluate the impact of providing patient-reported information on anxiety and other mental health symptoms and disorders to primary care physicians. Five hundred seventy-three patients of the study physicians who met entry criteria were randomized to either usual care or usual care supplemented with feedback of patient-reported mental health information to physicians. This mental health information was derived from initial patient-reported questionnaires completed in waiting rooms of physicians contracted to a mixed-model health maintenance organization in Colorado. Main outcome measures included impact of intervention on rates of (1) chart notation of anxiety, depression, or other mental health diagnoses or symptoms; (2) referral to mental health specialists; (3) prescription of psychotropic medications; (4) hospitalization; and (5) office visits during a 5-month observation period....Save to LibraryDownloadby Susan Mathias•  19  Mental Health, Family Practice, Medicine, Anxiety[Gender and age differences in the cognitive, psychophysiological, and behavioral responses of social anxiety in adolescence]The aim of this study was to analyze gender and age differences in adolescents&#39; social anxiety in the factor scores of the Social Phobia subscale from the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SP-SPAI): Social Interactions, Focus of... moreThe aim of this study was to analyze gender and age differences in adolescents&#39; social anxiety in the factor scores of the Social Phobia subscale from the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SP-SPAI): Social Interactions, Focus of Attention, Cognitive and Somatic Symptoms and Avoidance and Escape Behaviors. The sample consisted of 2,543 students of Secondary Education between 12 and 17 years. Results are shown for the general sample (N= 2,543) and for the sample of adolescents classified as high social anxiety group (n= 317). Regarding the first group, girls obtained higher total scores on the Social Phobia scale and on all factors except for Avoidance and Escape (d= .32 - .35). Concerning the high anxiety group, the analyses revealed that boys avoid and escape from social situations more frequently than girls (d= .23). No age differences were found in the factor scores for any of the two samples.Save to LibraryDownloadby Cándido José Inglés Saura•  20  Psychology, Psychological Assessment, Child and adolescent mental health, CognitionPrevalence of mental disorders in Europe: results from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD) projectSave to LibraryDownloadby fausto mazzi•  20  Demography, International Cooperation, Adolescent, AnxietyAre behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence associated with bipolar disorder in early adulthood?Save to LibraryDownloadby Jérôme Endrass•  20  Cognitive Science, Bipolar Disorder, Family, AdolescentEffects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Therapy on Subjective Bother and Neural Connectivity in Chronic TinnitusTo evaluate the impact of a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program in patients with chronic bothersome tinnitus on the (1) severity of symptoms of tinnitus and (2) functional connectivity in neural attention networks.... moreTo evaluate the impact of a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program in patients with chronic bothersome tinnitus on the (1) severity of symptoms of tinnitus and (2) functional connectivity in neural attention networks.
