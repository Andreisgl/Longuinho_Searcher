During the life time of the organisation ENSI often anticipated upcoming themes and new demands and through analyses, reflection, and participative debates drew up an annual working programme to meet these needs.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLambrechts, W.

The project explored the role of the principals in the organisation of sustainable schools. A mixed methods approach to data collection was employed combining quantitative and qualitative methods. This paper presents primary school principals’ perceptions of sustainable development, their views on the characteristics and operation of the sustainable schools as well as factors supporting or impeding the development of such schools in Cyprus. Our analysis reveals that the term ‘sustainable school’ is a concept only vaguely understood by the principals. Education for sustainable development is interpreted loosely as environmental education and sustainable schools’ operation is limited to sustainable development’s environmental aspects. Principals place their emphasis on environmental conservation, for satisfying humans’ needs whereas the notio...Download Free PDFView PDFAnalyse the challenges of implementing EfS in a primary bilingual school in Peru and suggest an alternative approach.Christine Theodore Stayte MSc.EfSAlmost twenty years ago, the Rio Earth Summit’s Agenda 21 (UNCED,1992) brought education and sustainability together on the world stage nominating objectives and activities which were designed to empower education systems as agents of change in the campaign against unsustainable be behaviour. Agenda 21 Chapter 36 focussed on reorienting education towards sustainable development with one suggested activity being that ‘a thorough review of curricula should be undertaken to ensure a multidisciplinary approach, with environmental and development issues and their socio-cultural and demographic aspect and linkages’. Since 1992, progress has been measured and change has been slow. Certainly in the South America context, the suggested curricula review is only now being suggested in less than optional terms and with more determination through the Latin American Heads Conference (LAHC) group. With the Rio +20 Conference in 2012 looming ever closer, it is a time to focus on the limited progress made in the last twenty years and in particular during the United Nations Decade of ESD 2005 – 2015 and to examine why progress has been so limited and what changes are required to remedy the situation. By providing a snapshot of my local context of a bilingual primary school in Peru, some of the challenges faced whilst implementing ESD into the education system might be explored and analysed.Download Free PDFView PDFA Strategy, with a critical rationale, for EfS PDChristine Theodore Stayte MSc.EfSThe development of a strategy, with a critical rationale, for Education for Sustainability (EfS) professional development in San Silvestre School, Lima, Peru.Download Free PDFView PDFChapter 2 – Learning to transform the world: key competencies in ESD2018 • Marco RieckmannThis chapter presents ESD as a form of transformative and competence-based education.

It focuses on the evolving policy context for ESD and explores the extent to which, and the ways in which, countries are committed to integrating ESD in their education systems. It pays particular attention to the actual implementation of ESD policies, initiatives and programs in national education systems and in local schools, especially in the curriculum of primary and secondary education. The paper draws upon peer-reviewed journal articles, policy documents published by UNESCO and other international agencies, and several comparative databases reporting evidence on ESD topics. It also analyses a diverse array of national and regional documents. In primary and secondary education, in particular, indications of increasing policy attention to ESD are apparent. And yet, while policy attention to ESD has strengthened, many countries either lack an ESD policy or a viable one. Limited financial resources, and a weak global economy, have constrained the implementation of national ESD commitments. Support from international donors, NGOs and the private sector is considered critical for the successful ESD implementation. A large and diverse array of ESD initiatives has been implemented in primary and secondary schools around the world since 2005. These initiatives range from large-scale trans-national programs and national reforms to small community projects, from NGO initiatives across many schools to teacher-led projects in individual schools. Many SD initiatives in schools primarily focus on the environmental components of ESD; quite a few emerged from earlier programs in environmental education. Moreover, the coverage, scope and depth of SD issues in school curricula have increased significantly. Recent comparative assessments highlight the variability of student knowledge of, and engagement with, ESD topics, especially in secondary educationDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
