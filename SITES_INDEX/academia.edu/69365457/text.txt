The Osisko urban lake located in Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec, Canada) was used partially as a waste disposal facility for many decades, causing a heavy pollution. The main undertakings of this study are (i) assessing the mineralogical and geochemical properties of lake Osisko sediments, and (ii) studying the pollution that occurred within lake water due to the sediments’ reactivity. Water and sediments across the lake were collected in different sensitive locations. Within the sediment samples, two parts were distinguished: a small layer of black vase over grey sediments. The black vase resembled organic matter while the gray sediment seemed close to clean lake sediments. The collected samples were characterized for their physical (particle size distribution, specific gravity and specific surface area), chemical (minor and major elements as well as total sulfur an...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMineralsDesulfurization of the Old Tailings at the Au-Ag-Cu Tiouit Mine (Anti-Atlas Morocco)Rachid HakkouTailings from the abandoned Tiouit mine site in Morocco are mainly composed of sulfides, hematite, and quartz. They contain 0.06–1.50 wt % sulfur, mostly in the form of pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. The tailings also contain gold (3.36–5.00 ppm), silver (24–37 ppm), and copper (0.06–0.08 wt %). Flotation tests were conducted to reprocess the tailings for Au, Ag, and Cu recovery, and at the same time to prevent acid mine drainage (AMD) generation through the oxidation of sulfide minerals, including pyrite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, galena. The flotation results confirmed that environmental desulfurization is effective at reducing the overall sulfide content in the tailings. The recovery of sulfides was between 69% and 75%, while Au recovery weight-yield was between 2.8% and 4.7%. The test that showed the best sulfur recovery rate and weight-yield was carried out with 100 g/t CuSO4 (sulfide activator) and 50 g/t of amyl xanthate (collector).

However, it has barely benefited from geochemical modeling tools despite their ease of use. Accordingly, this paper aims to strengthen the upstream geochemical assessment via parametric analysis that simulates the effect of various mineral assemblages on leachate quality recovered from weathering cells. The main objective is to simulate the pH in presence of silicate neutralizing minerals and Mn release from carbonates based upon minimal characterization data. The public domain code PHREEQC was used for geochemical kinetic modeling of four weathering cells. The kinetic model utilized a water film concept to simulate diffusion of chemical elements from mineral surfaces to the pore water. The obtained results suggest that the presence of the silicate neutralizing minerals slightly affects the Mn rele...Download Free PDFView PDFMine Water and the EnvironmentAcid Mine Drainage at the Abandoned Kettara Mine (Morocco): 1.

At the field scale, several parameters control sulfides’ oxidation rates and, therefore, the acidity generation. The objective of this paper is to map the acidity and geochemical properties of oxidized tailings within a closed tailings storage facility. Based on systematic sampling, various geochemical parameters were measured within the oxidized Joutel tailings, including the: Neutralization potential, acid-generating potential, net neutralization potential, neutralization potential ratio, paste pH, thickness of oxidized, hardpan, and transition zones. The different parameters were integrated in geographical information system (GISs) databases to quantify the spatial variability of the acidity and geochemical properties of oxidized tailings. The oxidized tailings were characterized by low sulfide (...Download Free PDFView PDFVERSION CORRIGÉE CORRECTED VERSION The influence of kinetic test type on the geochemical response of low acid generating potential tailings2000 • Mathieu Villeneuve, Michel Aubertin, Marcos MonroyThis paper presents a comparison of the geochemical responses of five different tailings submitted to five different kinetic tests. The five kinetic tests were done using column tests, humidity-cells, shaking flasks, modified Soxhlet extractors and mini-alteration cells. The different tailings have all AP values ranging from 23.9 to 178.8 kg CaCO3/t and NP values from 13.9 to 93.9 kg CaCO3/t.Download Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental Science and Pollution ResearchUse of EDTA in modified kinetic testing for contaminated drainage prediction from waste rocks: case of the Lac Tio mine2015 • Mostafa BenzaazouaDownload Free PDFView PDFScience of The Total EnvironmentCharacterization of how contaminants arise in a dredged marine sediment and analysis of the effect of natural weatheringHassan BouzahzahDownload Free PDFView PDFMineralsValorisation of Partially Oxidized Tailings in a Cover System to Reclaim an Old Acid Generating Mine SiteMari TvedtenThe reclamation of acid-generating mine tailings typically involves building cover systems to limit interactions with water or oxygen. The choice of cover materials is critical to ensure long-term performance, and partly determines the environmental footprint of the reclamation strategy. The objective of this research was to evaluate if tailings pre-oxidized on-site could be used in cover systems. Column experiments were performed to assess the effectiveness of a cover with capillary barrier effects (CCBE), where the moisture retention layer (MRL) was made of pre-oxidized tailings with little to no remaining sulfides (LS tailings). The columns were submitted to regular wetting and drying cycles, and their hydrological and geochemical behaviour was monitored for 510 days. The LS tailings showed satisfying hydrological properties as an MRL and remained saturated throughout the test. The concentrations of Cu in the drainage decreased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to non...Download Free PDFView PDFMineralsLaboratory Study on the Effectiveness of Limestone and Cementitious Industrial Products for Acid Mine Drainage RemediationHassan BouzahzahAcid mine tailings may affect several environmental matrices. Here, we aimed to stabilize acid-generated mine tailings using several alkaline and cementitious amendments, which were tested in columns for 361 days. The alkaline amendments consisted of 10 and 20 wt.% limestone, while the cementitious amendments consisted of different binders at a total dosage of 5 wt.% binder. The different formulations for the cementitious amendments were: 50% Kruger fly ash and 50% class F fly ash; 20% ordinary Portland cement, 40% Kruger fly ash, and 40% class F fly ash; 80% ordinary Portland cement and 20% Kruger fly ash; and 20% ordinary Portland cement, 40% Kruger fly ash, and 40% fly ash. Kinetic testing on the amendment formulations showed that the pH values increased from &lt;2.5 to circumneutral values (~7.5). The mobility of various chemical species was greatly reduced. Cumulative Fe released from the unamended tailings was ~342.5 mg/kg, and was &lt;22 mg/kg for the amended tailings.
