Thank you for your visits and comments and faves!  I greatly appreciate them and usually try to answer too. I enjoy taking photos and hope that you will enjoy looking at them. On Flickr, I can see many different kinds of photos and have good ideas also for my work.  I make photos, not politics or propaganda, even if my pictures contain some political and religious material.  My shots are not my personal opinions. They tell you what I see, not what I think. Despite my "war photos" (reconstruction), I am against violence towards people and animals. I am interested in history, traditions, culture and nature. My favourite countries are Russia, Iran, Kenya and France because I have had the opportunity to live and travel in these countries, but I like to visit other areas as well.  Now I am also interested in India, an incredible country. I don't hate or boycott any country, on the contrary, I am happy that there are different countries and cultures in the world.  My equipment: Canon EOS 5D Mark IVThree lenses:Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8 L II USM Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5,6 L IS USM Canon EF 14mm f/2.8 L II USM I take photos in RAW and use Lightroom to edit them, mostly lightly, and occasionally Photoshop and Topaz AI.   I am an amateur photographer, not a commercial, I don't sell photos - so far. Use of my photos, including copy, editing, and publication, is mostly allowed without any special authorization. It is marked "Some rights reserved" (below the picture on the right).  If you want to use them, click on the down-arrow under the individual photo on the right side and you can choose the size. The original hi-res version is the best, but if you don't need a big one for example for the Internet, choose a smaller size. Then you can download and save it. But if possible, credit the photos to Ninara because usually, I am curious to see where my photos are. Some of my pictures are only for private use, marked "All rights reserved". Most of my portraits are for private use.  My photos are usually licensed under CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution). It means that you are free to:Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or formatAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.Under the following terms:Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, (provide a link to the license*) and indicate if changes were made*. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. Some of my photos, especially taken in France, are licensed under CC BY-NC (NonCommercial). There are in France weird copyright restrictions for landmarks, buildings, architecture, art and other intellectual property, and the use of these kinds of photos is not allowed for commercial purposes.  When France gives headaches to photographers, Russia is more accessible, but in Iran and other countries, I ask for permission to take photos, if I am not sure.    Wikipedia is very useful when I need information for pictures. That is why I sometimes upload photos to Wikimedia Commons and Wikipedia. With the CC BY license other people can do it too.  If you download one of my pictures and it disappears after some time, it means probably that I have made some changes to the picture and some details of the link have been changed. Please download it again if you want to keep the picture. Sometimes I edit pictures and reorganize groups. At the same time, the Internet address may change.  It's better to use a copied image than a link because then it won't disappear. I often make changes to pictures. If you want to use my pictures with my real name, please send me a Flickr message.  My most interesting photos on Flickriver:www.flickriver.com/photos/ninara/popular-interesting/ * not necessary for my photos. If you can't provide the link, for example to prints, I do not consider it necessary. But I like to see my Flickr name because I check sometimes where my photos are.  My visited countries Create Your Own Visited Countries Map
