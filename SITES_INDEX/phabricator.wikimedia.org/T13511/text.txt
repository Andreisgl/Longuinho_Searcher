None of the wikis have any content, and there is no point in still keeping the subdomains up.
I do not think it is necessary to gather a consensus to delete these wikis, as they are in no way useful to anyone. If a consensus has to be gathered, then I'm sure that would be no problem.

JeLuF, looks like you've got authorization now. Will you do it, or should this be passed to another shell user?TTO added a comment.Dec 5 2009, 6:53 AM2009-12-05 06:53:16 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsAnybody up for this?

Thanks for fixing, but there's one more thing to do: 'tokipona' and 'tp' should be removed from SiteMatrix - it was part of the request (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Deletion_of_Toki_Pona_Wikimedia_projects). Previously deleted wikis (Klingon and Siberian) were removed from the SiteMatrix too.• bzimport added a comment.Apr 3 2010, 8:00 PM2010-04-03 20:00:21 (UTC+0)Comment Actionsjeluf wrote:
