Cato2011, The ProstateProstate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and a leading cause of death from cancer. Although curative treatment by radical prostatectomy is available for organ-confined tumors, many patients develop advanced metastatic disease. The high mortality rate is mainly based on the fact that no curative option is currently available for this stage of prostate cancer. For a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of prostate cancer development and progression and to initiate the search for new markers for diagnosis and risk assessment and for new treatment options for advanced prostate cancer, differences in gene expression have been analyzed in numerous studies. One of the genes identified to be overexpressed in tumor compared to benign tissue is the anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) gene . Its protein level was found increased in prostate tumor tissue and its expression level was associated with poor survival of prostate cancer patients .See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHuman MutationPutative Prostate Cancer Risk SNP in an AR Binding Site of the Melanophilin Gene Illustrates Enrichment of Risk SNPs in AR Target Sites2015 • Helmut KlockerDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS ONECharacterization of Transcriptional Changes in ERG Rearrangement-Positive Prostate Cancer Identifies the Regulation of Metabolic Sensors Such as Neuropeptide Y2013 • Simone EckerDownload Free PDFView PDFEndocrine Related CancerSOCS2 correlates with malignancy and exerts growth-promoting effects in prostate cancer2014 • Helmut KlockerDeregulation of cytokine and growth factor signaling due to an altered expression of endogenous regulators is well recognized in prostate cancer (PCa) and other cancers. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) is a key regulator of the GH, IGF, and prolactin signaling pathways that have been implicated in carcinogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the expression patterns and functional significance of SOCS2 in PCa. Protein expression analysis employing tissue microarrays from two independent patient cohorts revealed a significantly enhanced expression in tumor tissue compared with benign tissue as well as association with Gleason score and disease progression. In vitro and in vivo assays uncovered the involvement of SOCS2 in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Functionally, SOCS2 knockdown inhibited PCa cell proliferation and xenograft growth in a CAM assay. Decreased cell growth after SOCS2 downregulation was associated with cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

In this study we characterized GHSROS, a human lncRNA gene on the opposite DNA strand (antisense) to the ghrelin receptor gene, in prostate cancer. The lncRNA was upregulated by prostate tumors from different clinical datasets. Consistently, transcriptome data revealed that GHSROS alters the expression of cancer-associated genes. Functional analyses in vitro showed that GHSROS mediates tumor growth, migration, and survival and resistance to the cytotoxic drug docetaxel. Increased cellular proliferation of GHSROS-overexpressing PC3, DU145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines in vitro was recapitulated in a subcutaneous xenograft model. Conversely, in vitro antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of the lncRNA reciprocally regulated cell growth and migration, and gene expression. Notably, GHSROS modulates the expression of PPP2R2C, the loss of which may dri...Download Free PDFView PDFGenes, Chromosomes and CancerLoss of a small region around thePTEN locus is a major chromosome 10 alteration in prostate cancer xenografts and cell lines2004 • Dirk van AlewijkDownload Free PDFView PDFModern PathologyProstate cancer cell phenotypes based on AGR2 and CD10 expression2013 • Erin L MareshDownload Free PDFView PDFFEBS JournalAnterior gradient 2 and 3 - two prototype androgen-responsive genes transcriptionally upregulated by androgens and by oestrogens in prostate cancer cells2013 • Helmut KlockerDownload Free PDFView PDFCell Communication and SignalingCancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate tumor growth and progression through upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesisKarin JöhrerDownload Free PDFView PDFOncology ReportsIncreased levels of DNA methyltransferases are associated with the tumorigenic capacity of prostate cancer cells2012 • Anna D'AlessandroDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of the National Cancer InstituteCholine Kinase Alpha as an Androgen Receptor Chaperone and Prostate Cancer Therapeutic Target2015 • Iain McEwanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
