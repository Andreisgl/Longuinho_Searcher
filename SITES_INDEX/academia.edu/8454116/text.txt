Diotima’s purpose, in discussing the lower lovers, is to critique their erōs as aimed at a goal it can never secure, immortality, and as focused on an inferior object, oneself. By contrast, in loving beauty, the philosopher gains a mortal sort of completion; in turning outside of himself, he also ceases to be preoccupied by his own incompleteness.Download Free PDFView PDFChristopher Grau and Aaron Smuts (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Love, OUPPlato, Socrates, and Love2019 • Iakovos VasiliouGiven the prodigious amount of scholarship on Platonic love, this article explores a different question: the nature of Plato's love for Socrates as expressed in two dialogues, the Symposium and Phaedo, in which Plato depicts Socrates as surrounded by his lovers and disciples. By paying attention to the "outer frames" of the dialogues, that is, the relationship between the text and the reader, it is argued that Plato's love for Socrates is displayed not only in his loving depiction of Socrates but also in Plato's doing philosophy through the character of Socrates; Plato thereby shows what genuine love for Socrates would be like. Moreover, contrasted with the words and actions of other characters in these dialogues, Plato shows himself to be not just one among many of Socrates' lovers, but in fact the best.Download Free PDFView PDFPoetics Today 34:4 Winter 2014 (appeared June 2014)The Poetic Presentation of Philosophy in Leo Strauss' SymposiumMatthew J SharpeDownload Free PDFView PDFPlato´s theory of desire in Plato´s SYMPOSIUM and the REPUBLICMaria Angelica FierroDownload Free PDFView PDFMPhil - The Rites of Love: A Discussion of Platonic Eros with particular reference to the Scala Amoris passage of the SymposiumAnthony HooperDownload Free PDFView PDFPhD - The Memory of Virtue: Immortality and Kleos in Plato’s SymposiumAnthony HooperDownload Free PDFView PDF'The Role of Diotima in Plato's Symposium: The Dialogue and Its Double', in G. Cornelli, ed., Plato’s Styles and Characters, Beiträge zur Altertumskunde, De Gruyter, 2015Christian KeimeThis study investigates the reason why, in Plato’s Symposium, Socrates delivers his lesson on Eros by reporting a dialogue between two characters, Diotima and Socrates when he was younger. I show first that each character of this embedded dialogue can be considered as a mix of the two characters of the framing dialogue (Agathon and Socrates as an accomplished philosopher): Diotima is the dialectician Socrates considered from the point of view of a poet and a follower of the sophists, whilst the young Socrates is Agathon dressed up as a dialectician. Drawing on this description, I argue that the mask of Diotima, and more generally the whole dialogue narrated by Socrates, are literary devices designed to provide, besides a theory of love, a lesson in communication that prompts the reader to interpret correctly the lesson on eros : (1) Plato shows that the dialectician must adapt his lesson to his addressees, (2) he brings out the limits of a lesson on eros delivered in the form of a didactic monologue, and (3) he vindicates the necessity of teaching through reported dialogue, whether orally or in writing.Download Free PDFView PDFIn The Political Theory of Aristophanes: Explorations in Poetic Wisdom Peisetairos of Aristophanes’ Birds and the Erotic Tyrant of Republic IXMatthew MeyerDownload Free PDFView PDFErotic Virtue2015 • Lauren  WareThis paper defends an account of how erotic love works to develop virtue. It is argued that love drives moral development by holding the creation of virtue in the individual as the emotion's intentional object. After analyzing the distinction between passive and active accounts of the object of love, this paper demonstrates that a Platonic virtue-ethical understanding of erotic love—far from being consumed with ascetic contemplation—offers a positive treatment of emotion's role in the attainment and social practice of virtue.Download Free PDFView PDFHypatia 21.2, 2006, 1-27Diotima and Demeter as Mystogogues in Plato's SymosiumNancy EvansDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
