The main focus of the Rast is firmly the analysis of Turkish music including Turkic world, eastern and Islamic civilization. Additionally, RAST provides a forum for cross-cultural investigations and discussions relating to all areas of musicology. Furthermore, Rast is a multidisciplinary journal devoted to issues and practices in music research.Download Free PDFView PDF‘A Greek Ethnomusicologists Doing Fieldwork in the Middle East: Reflections on Encounters and Trajectories in the Greek Academia’. Conference Proceedings. Paper presented at the International Musicological Conference Crossroads:  Greece as an intercultural pole of musical thought and creativity.alexandra balandinaIn this paper I wish to explore my academic journey in the field of ethnomusicology and to ruminate on the reception of ethnomusicology as an academic discipline in contemporary Greek tertiary education. Raising critical questions concerning the role of Greece as a cultural crossroad of musical thought and creativity, I will tackle particular theoretical and methodological challenges that Greek ethnomusicologists face today. In the beginning, by providing autoethnographic accounts, I briefly describe the academic, musical and socio-cultural milieu in the late 1990 in Greece that led me to study ethnomusicology and conduct fieldwork in Iran. Hoping that musicology and ethnomusicology in Greece can maintain fruitful dialogues, I consider the reception of ethnomusicology by Greek music scholars and unravel the dominant musicological discourses that seem to construct future ethnomusicology in Greece. I also re-examine the historically-based bifurcation of ethnomusicology under the light of the anthropological discourses among Greek scholars regarding the distinction between ethnomusicology and anthropology of music. The entry of ethnomusicology in Greek academia in the beginning of the 21st century, especially the kind of ethnomusicology brought in Greece by the young generation of scholars trained abroad, resembles to a degree the history of the arrival of anthropology within the Greek tertiary education in the 1980s. I suggest thus to look at the history of anthropology in Greece and learn from the experiences and difficulties Greek anthropologists encounter when trying to establish their discipline among the Greek scholarly community. This paper aspires to provide platform for dialogue and critical reflection among disciplines engaged in the cultural study of music in Greek tertiary education.Download Free PDFView PDFGroves EthnomusicologyRuy Câmara CâmaraDownload Free PDFView PDFSEM Student NewsSEM Student News, Vol. 7 (Fall/Winter 2013) [Justin R.

The study of migrant culture sat comfortably for a while with a structural-functionalist culture concept emphasizing boundedness and stasis, figured as transitional, adaptive, evidence of modernization or Westernization. An orientation toward hybridity in the 1980s began to shake some of these certainties, even if it kept others (the normative framework of the nation-state) in place. This article argues that work on refugees and diasporas at around the same time departed from them more radically. The current moment is one in which the final vestiges of language about migrant culture as adaptive have been swept away and in which the populist evocation of a migrant crisis at our gates has posed unsettling challenges. This article explores the tensions in the current literature between an emphasis on migrant creativity and survival, mobility and motility, and identity and citizens...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
