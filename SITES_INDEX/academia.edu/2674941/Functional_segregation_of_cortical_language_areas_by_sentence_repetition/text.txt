In Experiment 1, a given sentence was presented every 14.4 s and repeated two, three, or four times in a row.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHuman Brain MappingApplying FSL to the FIAC data: Model-based and model-free analysis of voice and sentence repetition priming2006 • Christian BeckmannDownload Free PDFView PDFLanguage or music, mother or Mozart? Structural and environmental influences on infants' language networks2010 • Teodora GligaUnderstanding how language emerged in our species calls for a detailed investigation of the initial specialization of the human brain for speech processing. Our earlier research demonstrated that an adult-like left-lateralized network of perisylvian areas is already active when infants listen to sentences in their native language, but did not address the issue of the specialization of this network for speech processing.Download Free PDFView PDFLanguage or music, mother or Mozart?

However, the reproducibility, task-dependency, and presence of these brain anomalies in childhood rather than adulthood remain debated. We probed the large-scale organization of ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children using minimal target-detection tasks that were performed equally well by all groups.Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the National Academy of SciencesFunctional organization of perisylvian activation during presentation of sentences in preverbal infants2006 • Sébastien MériauxDownload Free PDFView PDFQuestion/statement judgments: an fMRI study of intonation processing2004 • Laura DilleyAbstract We examined changes in fMRI BOLD signal associated with question/statement judgments in an event-related paradigm to investigate the neural basis of processing one aspect of intonation.Download Free PDFView PDFHuman Brain MappingCombined permutation test and mixed-effect model for group average analysis in fMRI2006 • Alexis RocheDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
