BACKGROUND
 
Trinidad is the larger of the
            two islands which make up the Republic of Trinidad and
            Tobago. Originally inhabited by Amerindians, chiefly
            Tainos, it was visited by Christopher Columbus on his
            third voyage in 1498 and colonized by Spain in the course
            of the following century. It remained a Spanish
            possession until 1797, when it was captured by a British
            expeditionary force under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, and was
            officially ceded to the British crown by the Treaty of
            Amiens in 1802. It remained a British colony until it
            became independent in 1962. Trinidad has hence never been
            French. Why then is a French-lexifier Creole among the
            languages spoken in the island?
The Spanish settlers do not
            seem to have been particularly efficient in their
            management of the resources available, and by the latter
            half of the 18th century, the population, composed of
            Spaniards, the few Amerindians who had survived, and some
            slaves imported from Africa, was decimated by disease to
            the point where the economy was stagnating for lack of
            manpower. To remedy this, in 1783 the King of Spain
            published a cédula de población,
            inviting any catholic subject of a monarch friendly to
            the Spanish crown to come and settle in Trinidad. The
            very favourable conditions set out (grants of land,
            exemption from taxes for 10 years etc.) attracted a large
            number of French colonists, who were ready to leave the
            French islands of the Caribbean following natural
            disasters and to escape from the unrest which was
            beginning to make itself felt. They came with their
            families and slaves, and the latter brought with them the
            language which had developed in the French possessions.
            Trinidad French Creole (TFC) is therefore very similar to
            that of the French islands, especially Martinique, though
            it also developed its own traits, notably in its
            vocabulary.
During the 19th century, TFC
            was in effect the lingua franca of the working population
            of this British colony, spoken not only by the slaves who
            had brought it, but also learned and used by the
            indentured labourers imported from Asia after the
            abolition of slavery in 1838, and picked up from their
            nannies by the children of the French planters. It
            maintained its position into the beginning of the 20th
            century, but then was superseded by Trinidad English
            Creole (TEC), becoming only a very minor element in the
            amazing mosaic of Trinidad linguistic usage, which also
            includes standard English, the standard French of the
            French Creole families, a form of Spanish imported by
            immigrants from Venezuela, various Indian languages and
            Chinese dialects. In the early part of the 20th century,
            there were still monolingual speakers of patois,
            especially in the villages of the Northern Range.
            However, it was stigmatized as 'broken French', even by
            its native speakers, and under increasing pressure from
            TEC. At the beginning of the 21st century there remain
            very few Trinidadians for whom TFC is the natural or main
            means of communication, and it is to be feared that,
            despite the efforts of those trying to revive it as an
            important part of their heritage, TFC may before long
            join the long list of languages becoming extinct. Traces
            of Creole are likely to survive well beyond that time,
            however, in the lexis of TEC (e.g. much of the vocabulary
            of the carnival) and in turns of phrase (e.g. it
            have for 'there is/are').
There is no standard
            orthography for TFC, as it is essentially an oral
            language. In the examples below, the spelling adopted is
            similar to the one proposed for Caribbean French-lexifier
            Creoles by the GERECF (Groupe d'Études et de
            Recherche en Espaces Créolophone et Francophone)
            in Martinique, in which many letters or combinations
            thereof have the same value as in French; however, u
            is used to denote the sound spelled ou in
            French.

            VOCABULARY
As the term 'French-lexifier
            Creole' implies, the vast majority of TFC words derive
            from French. This is not always immediately obvious, for
            a variety of reasons:
The French from which they
               derive was brought to the French West Indian colonies
               in the 17th and 18th centuries, and Creole has
               sometimes kept both forms and meanings which have not
               survived in modern French; e.g.
balyé
'broom'
zen
'(fish)
                           hook'
The people who brought it
               were often from the provinces and used the words
               current in their particular area, which may not have
               come into the standard language:
palaviré
'slap with the
                           back of the hand'
kalòj
'cage,
                           kennel'
The phonetic, grammatical
               and semantic development of TFC (see below) may have
               altered lexical items in such a way as to distance
               them from their Fr. roots:
djòl
'mouth of an
                           animal'
cp.
                           Fr
gueule
dlo
'water'
eau
zyé
'eye'
œil
                           
bèf
'cow, ox,
                           bull'
bœuf
Contact with other languages,
            both in the French islands where Creole first developed
            and after its arrival in Trinidad, has ensured that the
            vocabulary also contains items from other languages:
            
from the Amerindian
               languages spoken by the original inhabitants of the
               islands (though these words have often come through
               the European languages of the colonizers):
lebiché
'cassava
                           sifter'
lanyap
'extra amount
                           given in a sale'
from the mother tongues of
               the African slaves imported to work in the colonies:
               especially words in such areas as food, the human
               body, beliefs and pastimes:
akra
'fritter'
bonda
'buttocks'
wanga
'magic
                           charm'
ninnin
'riddle'
from the languages of the
               Asian people who came as indentured labourers after
               the end of slavery (though very few words have come
               from this source):
hosé
'Indian festival
                           of Hosein'
wéwé
name of an
                           (illegal) Chinese game
from Iberian languages,
               chiefly Spanish:
fanega
'measure of
                           cocoa (100 lbs)'
pastel
'cornmeal dish,
                           boiled in a banana leaf'
Some of the many loan-words
               from English, such as trè 'wooden tray'
               or bokit 'bucket', may already have featured in
               the language when it was imported into Trinidad, as
               they also occur in the French islands, but a great
               number have been borrowed since then, notably terms to
               designate modern inventions such as the
               motoka.

SOUNDS
The inventory of sounds in TFC
            is quite similar to that of French, but it lacks the
            front rounded vowels of French (cp. Fr. puce / TFC
            pis; Fr. peut / TFC pé; Fr.
            peur / TFC pè) as well as the e
            muet (cp. Fr. cheval / TFC chuval). It
            has three nasal vowels similar to those of modern French,
            i.e. nasalized a as in Fr. blanc
            (represented by an in the examples below -- i.e.
            the n does not represent a separate sound),
            nasalizeded e as in Fr. vin
            (represented below by en), and nasalized
            o as in Fr. bon (represented
            by on). (They are rather more frequent in TFC than
            in French, as they occur both before and after nasal
            consonants.) This makes a total of 10 vowels:
a
as in
                        pa
'not;
                        through'
vowel similar to
                        that in Fr.
patte
è
as in
                        pè
'fear'
père
é
as in
                        pé
'can;
                        quiet'
fée
i
as in pi
                        
'pure'
fini
ò
as in
                        pò
'port'
port
o
as in
                        po
'pot'
pot
u
as in
                        pu
'for;
                        louse'
pou
an
as in
                        ban
'bench'
en
as in
                        ben
'bath'
on
as in
                        bon
'good'
TFC has all the consonants of
            the Fr. system apart from the semi-consonant found at the
            beginning of Fr. huit, and three that French
            lacks, viz. tch (as in English church),
            dj (as in English judge) and h;
            e.g.
tchè
'heart'
djèp
'wasp'
halé
'to
                        pull'
The articulation of the 23
            consonants is similar to that in French, except for the
            sound represented by the letter r, which is
            pronounced more weakly than its French counterpart and
            becomes w in certain circumstances, e.g. before
            the vowel u in wuj 'red'.
Differences between French
            words and their TFC equivalents are often the result of
            phonetic developments in TFC (e.g. the tendency towards a
            typical 'consonant + vowel' syllable structure, which
            leads to the loss of consonants at the end of syllables,
            as in maché from Fr. marcher), and
            the result of the forms in use when French was brought to
            the West Indies (e.g. the pronunciation wè
            of what in modern French is spelled oi and
            pronounced 'wa', hence TFC mwen 'I, me, my' where
            French has moi).

                  VOCABULARY
 
 
GRAMMAR
TFC grammar is very
            different from that of French. Here are some examples of
            this.
Nouns are not marked for
            number: 
yon
                        chuval
'a/one
                        horse'
dé
                        chuval
'two
                        horses'
The plural may be (but is no
            necessarily) indicated by the article:
bagay
                        la
'the
                        thing'
sé bagay
                        la
'the
                        things'
There is no grammatical
            gender: 
While there are some
               pairs of nouns distinguishing the sex of human beings,
               e.g.
chaben
'man with fair
                        complexion and frizzy hair'
chabin
'woman with fair
                        complexion and frizzy hair'
               there is no such lexical distinction for animals:
               bef is the term for a cow, a bull or an ox, and
               chat can be a male or a female cat. It is
               possible to indicate the sex of an animal by adding
               manman or fimèl to indicate the
               female of the species, papa or mal the
               male, but nouns referring to things, ideas etc. have
               no gender. As a result of this, and of the lack of
               grammatical marking of number, - 
Adjectives are
            invariable, e.g.
yon bon
                        ripa
'a good
                        meal'
yon bon
                        listwè
'a good
                        story'
anpil bon
                        listwè
'a lot of good
                        stories'
yon bel
                        nonm
'a handsome
                        man'
yon bèl
                        fanm
'a beautiful
                        woman'
Articles behave rather
            differently from French. 
There are two basic
               forms:
1. yon/on 'a, one',
               placed before the noun, e.g.
yon tab
                    'a table'
2. la 'the', placed
               after the noun, e.g.
tab la
                     'the table'
The plural may be indicated
               by combining la with sé placed
               before the noun, e.g.
sé tab la
                     'the tables'.
There is a large number of
               examples in TFC which, to anyone who knows French,
               seem to consist of a noun preceded by the definite
               article, but are in fact cases of what is known as
               agglutination, where what looks like the definite
               article has become an integral part of the noun,
               e.g.
lajan
'money'
lajan
                           la
'the
                           money'
laklé
'key'
laklé
                           la
'the
                           key'
Personal pronouns are as
            follows:
mwen
                        
'I, me,
                        my'
annu
'we, us,
                        our'
u
'you (sing.),
                        your'
zòt
                        
'you (plur.),
                        your'
(l)i
'he, him, his, she,
                        her, it, its'
yo
'they, them,
                        their
As is evident from this
               list, pronouns do not vary according to the function
               they fulfil in the sentence, e.g. 
mwen
                        chanté
'I sing'
u enmen
                        mwen
'you love
                        me'
papa
                        mwen
'my
                        father'
Verbs are invariable,
            i.e. do not have endings to indicate person or tense,
            e.g.
mwen
                        chanté 
'I sing,
                        sang'
zòt
                        chanté
'you (plur.) sing,
                        sang'
li ké
                        chanté
'he/she will sing'
                        
There is, however, a complex
               system of particles which precede the verb to indicate
               tense and aspect:
li ka
                        jwé
'he/she is
                        playing'
li té
                        jwé
'he/she (had)
                        played'
li té ka
                        jwé
'he/she was
                        playing'
li ké/kae
                        jwé
'he/she will
                        play'
li sé
                        jwé
'he/she would
                        play'
Word order is fixed:
            e.g. 
There is no inversion for
               questions, which are signalled only by a change in
               intonation: u las with falling intonation is
               equivalent to 'you are tired', whereas with a rising
               intonation it is 'are you tired?'.
The negative particle
               pa appears before the verb, e.g.
u pa vlé
                  alé lekòl    'you
                  don't want to go to school'
The verbal particles listed
               above also precede the verb. Moreover, if they are
               combined, as in one of the examples, the order is
               fixed: té ka, never *ka
               té.
 
Most of the features described
            seem to imply that the grammar of TFC is simpler than
            that of French. However, the verbal system outlined above
            is not simpler, it is just different; and there are
            aspects of TFC grammar which are more complex than
            French. For example, where French and English have only
            one verb 'to be', TFC has three, distinguishing three
            different functions: e.g.
Nonm la
                        vyé. (no overt verb)
'The man is old'
                        
Tig sé
                        yon bèt fewòs.
'Tiger is a fierce
                        animal.'
Sa sa
                        yé?
'What is
                        that?'
