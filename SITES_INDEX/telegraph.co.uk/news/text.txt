Barack Obama presidency will strengthen special relationship, says Gordon Brown 
The presidency of Barack Obama will strengthen the special relationship between Britain and the US, Gordon Brown has said.
   By Jon Swaine     13 January 2009 • 7:54am 
 
 
 
  
 
 'We both stand for the freedom of people around the world, individual liberty, democracy and for progress,' Brown said. 'I am ready to work, day after day, for the changes in the world we both want. That starts with sorting out the financial turmoil.'  Credit: Photo: GETTY / AP 
 
The Prime Minister said that the President-Elect "shares the values of liberty, democracy and fairness" and that his election "gives us a historic chance to move the clock forward".
"The special relationship will be one so strong, no power on earth can ever drive us apart," he said. 
Mr Brown said that together the British and American governments would lead international efforts to tackle the most serious threats to global stability and prosperity.
"There are historic opportunities which exist over the next period of time to meet the big challenges – of climate change, the financial crisis, energy, security and terrorism," he said in an interview with The Sun.
"There has never been a time that co-operation between the two countries and the rest of the world is more necessary. There has never been so many challenges that can only be met by two people working together." 
He said that alongside Mr Obama, he would aim to invest in treatments for public health problems that blight the world, from malaria, cholera and TB in the developing world to cancer and heart disease in the west.
He said: "Britain and America will work together to make a huge difference in eradicating the diseases of our time.
"President Obama is very deeply concerned about the changes we are talking about. He worries about the effects of the economy on people's lives. 
"He has a big vision of how America can contribute to the long-term prosperity of the world as well as peace. 
"He has a good command of practical detail. Whenever there is a new President and there is someone as big as this – who, 20 years ago could never have been elected by the American people – there are huge opportunities. People will look at America and will say, 'Let's see what the changes are going to be'. 
The Prime Minister said that he and Mr Obama would also work to fight terrorism and guide the international economy out of the economic crisis. 
"We both stand for the freedom of people around the world, individual liberty, democracy and for progress," he said. "I am ready to work, day after day, for the changes in the world we both want. That starts with sorting out the financial turmoil. 
"But it continues with climate change, Afghanistan, terrorism, how we can build a more successful world economy over the next few years."
