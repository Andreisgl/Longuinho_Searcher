A variety of problems, both real and perceived, have been associated with these increases, including impacts to aquaculture, sport and commercial fisheries, natural habitats, and other avian species. Concern is especially strong over impacts to sport and commercial fishes and aquaculture. Because of increasing public pressure on U.S. government agencies to reduce DCCO conflicts, the USFWS is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Wildlife Services (USDA/WS) and state resource management agencies, will develop a national management plan for the DCCO. This assessment will be used to prepare the EIS and management plan. Populations and trends: The DCCO breeding range in North America is divided into five geographic areas.

Alaska has 1/3 of United States federal lands, the bulk of the United States’ intact and wild lands, and over half of the country’s total terrestrial ecosystem carbon on federal lands. Managing Alaska’s public lands for climate and biodiversity conservation purposes over the next 30–50 years would provide meaningful and irreplaceable climate benefits for the United States and globe. Doing so via a co-management approach with Alaska’s 229 federally recognized tribes is likely not only to be more effective but also more socially just. This paper lays out the scientific case for managing Alaska’s public lands for climate stabilization and resilience and addresses three primary questions: Why is Alaska globally meaningful for biodiversity and climate stabilization?

Loss of these assemblages destabilizes natural systems, while their recovery can restore ecological integrity. Here we take an ecoregion-based approach to identify landscapes that retain their historically present large mammal assemblages, and map ecoregions where reintroduction of 1–3 species could restore intact assemblages. Intact mammal assemblages occur across more than one-third of the 730 terrestrial ecoregions where large mammals were historically present, and 22% of these ecoregions retain complete assemblages across &gt;20% of the ecoregion area. Twenty species, if reintroduced or allowed to recolonize through improved connectivity, can trigger restoration of complete assemblages over 54% of the terrestrial realm (11,116,000 km2). Each of these species have at least two large, intact habitat areas (&gt;10,000 km2) in a given ecoregion. Timely integration of recovery efforts for large mammals strengthens area-based targets being considered under the Convention on Biological Diversity.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Insights from this account are more important to understanding the persistence of tigers than the details of rigorous scientific analysis of a single aspect of tiger population dynamics or ecology. Key components of tiger conservation clearly include knowledge of their ecology and behavior and rigorous, scientific techniques for monitoring changes in the vital rates of tigers. However, the primary agents of change in numbers of tigers and tiger habitat quality are humans, so it is equally important to focus our conservation efforts to understand human behaviors that impact tigers and their habitat. For tiger habitats, Nepal&#39;s rapidly developing co-management provide insights that may be helpful in stemming the range-wide decline in tiger numbers and increasing pace of local population extinctions. There is an emerging, alternative view that suggests that when conservation focuses at landscape and ecosystem levels the result is a healthier, intact ecosystem, which in turn better sustains tigers, biodiversity, and human economies at various levels. This chapter reviews the history of tigers in Nepal beginning with the early years of tiger hunting by Nepal&#39;s rulers through the malaria eradication program that permanently altered the tiger&#39;s habitat.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) has specialized on insect prey, particularly termites and ants, and exhibits some characteristics and behaviors that are common among myrmecophagous mammals. We examined whether myrmecophagy has affected its sociobiology. During 1990-1994 we studied a high-density population of sloth bears in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal. We found extensive seasonal overlap among home ranges of adults of the same sex (&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;50%) and between subadults and adults of both sexes (&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;70%). Moreover, overlap zones between adjacent ranges were used in proportion to their area. This, and observations of unrelated bears feeding or traveling in proximity to one another (not at concentrated food sources), suggested a high degree of mutual tolerance in this population. However, subadults and females with young may have temporally avoided other bears by limiting their activity to daylight hours. Predators (which were chiefly nocturnal) may also have affected the activity patterns of these (the most vulnerable) bears, and were probably responsible for the females&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; habit of giving birth in an underground den, fasting for several weeks so as not to leave cubs unattended in the den, and carrying the cubs on their back for 6-7 months after leaving the den. The young left their mother at 1.5 or 2.5 years old (this varied by family) and remained together and (or) later rejoined a sibling or another subadult, possibly to form a coalition against either predators or older bears. We documented few mortalities and no permanent juvenile dispersal in this study, but we also found few subadults in our study area, which indicates undetected mortality or dispersal. We cannot discount the possibility that some aspects of the sociobiology of sloth bears (e.g., cub-carrying, mutual tolerance) are related to myrmecophagy, but the social system and life-history traits of this species seem to fit well within the range observed among other ursids.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Pairing the GDN and the Paris Climate Agreement would avoid catastrophic climate change, conserve species, and secure essential ecosystem services. New findings give urgency to this union: Less than half of the terrestrial realm is intact, yet conserving all native ecosystems—coupled with energy transition measures—will be required to remain below a 1.5°C rise in average global temperature. The GDN targets 30% of Earth to be formally protected and an additional 20% designated as climate stabilization areas, by 2030, to stay below 1.5°C. We highlight the 67% of terrestrial ecoregions that can meet 30% protection, thereby reducing extinction threats and carbon emissions from natural reservoirs. Freshwater and marine targets included here extend the GDN to all realms and provide a pathway to ensuring a more livable biosphere.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although the annual number of attacks on humans is rare compared to livestock depredation, such incidents undermine popular support for wildlife conservation and require immediate responses to protect human life. 2. We used a space–time scan method to perform a novel spatiotemporal analysis of 908 attacks on humans by lions, leopards, and tigers to estimate the risks of further attacks in the same locales. 3. We found that a substantial proportion of attacks were clustered in time and space, but the dimension of these outbreaks varied between species. Lion outbreaks included more human fatalities, persisted for longer periods of time, and extended over larger areas than tiger or leopard outbreaks. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis reveals the typical spatiotemporal patterns of past lion, leopard, and tiger attacks on humans. In future, this technique could be used by relevant agencies to warn local people of risks from further attacks within a certain time and distance following an initial incident by each species. Furthermore, the approach can help identify areas requiring management interventions to address such threats.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
