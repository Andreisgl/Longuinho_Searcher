We aim to investigate whether dispositional optimism is associated with all-cause mortality in adults aged 70 years and older. METHODS Between 2010 and 2014, older adults free of serious cardiovascular disease and dementia were recruited through primary care physicians, and enrolled in the Aspirin Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical trial. Australian ASPREE participants were invited to participate in the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) that was running in parallel to ASPREE. Optimism was assessed at baseline using the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R). The association between optimism, divided into quartiles, and all-cause mortality was assessed using Cox Proportional Hazard models. RESULTS 11,701 participants (mean age: 75.1 years, SD 4.24; 46.6% men) returned the ALSOP Social questionnaire and completed the LOT-R. During the median 4.7 years follow-up, 469 deaths occurred. The fully adjusted model was not significant (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58-1.06). There was evidence that age was an effect modifier of the association between optimism and longevity. Higher optimism was associated with lower mortality risk in the oldest individuals only (77+ years) (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.96). CONCLUSIONS We observed no independent relationship between optimism and all-cause mortality in the total sample, although optimism appeared to be associated with lower risk among oldest old (adults aged 77 years and over).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Loneliness, Not Social Support, Is Associated with Cognitive Decline and Dementia Across Two Longitudinal Population-Based CohortsJournal of Alzheimer's Disease,  2021Background: Poor social health is likely associated with cognitive decline and risk of dementia; ... more Background: Poor social health is likely associated with cognitive decline and risk of dementia; however, studies show inconsistent results. Additionally, few studies separate social health components or control for mental health. Objective: To investigate whether loneliness and social support are independently associated with cognitive decline and risk of dementia, and whether depressive symptoms confound the association. Methods: We included 4,514 participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study (RS; aged 71±7SD years) followed up to 14 years (median 10.8, interquartile range 7.4–11.6), and 2,112 participants from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K; aged 72±10SD years) followed up to 10 years (mean 5.9±1.6SD).

In 2010 it was estimated that the global health expenditure on diabetes was US376 billion (€292 billion), equating to 12% of health expenditure and US1330 (€1031) per person [2]. A separate estimate in 2010 reported that diabetes cost the US US174 billion (€135 billion), with US58 billion (€45 billion) in indirect costs equating to over US2000 (€1551) on average per person with diabetes [3]. The World Health Organization estimates that between 2005 and 2030 the proportion of deaths caused by diabetes will double and global health expenditures associated with diabetes are expected to reach US490 billion (€380 billion) [1,2]. In 2003, it was estimated that diabetes cost Australia AUS6 billion (US6 billion, €5 billion), with AUS21 million (US22 million, €17 million) in indirect costs such as lost workdays and lost productivity equating to approximately AUS35 (US35, €28) per person wi...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

All South Australian first singleton births in 1998-2003 (n = 42 269) were included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis, comparing pre-term births with term births. Risk factors for pre-term birth were found to be: being indigenous, single, a smoker [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.41], age 40 years or older, reproductive technology assistance, threatened miscarriage, antepartum haemorrhage, urinary tract infection, pregnancy hypertension and suspected intra-uterine growth restriction. A previous spontaneous abortion was of borderline statistical significance, whereas a previous induced abortion (AOR 1.25, 1.13-1.40) was an independent risk factor. A dose-response relationship was found with increasing number of previous spontaneous or induced abortions. Population-attributable risks were highest for pregnancy hypertension (12.4%) and antepartum haemorrhage (9.2%). Smoking and previous induced abortion had risks of 4.7% and 2.7%, respectively. Among indigenous women, 51% of whom smoked, 16.4% of pre-term birth could be attributed to smoking. A previous induced abortion and smoking during pregnancy (particularly among indigenous women) are preventable risk factors for pre-term birth. Their population-attributable risks are likely to be under-estimates from under-reporting.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This number is predicted to increase to 82 million by the year 2030, due to the ageing global population. Theoretically, preventing late-onset dementia may seem extremely difficult as the greatest risk factor, age, is unmodifiable. However, it is estimated that a third of dementia cases could potentially be prevented or delayed by removing or reducing modifiable risk factors. Increasing evidence suggests that chronic stress, which may arise from experiencing a traumatic event or daily stress, may be a potential risk factor for dementia. Whilst it may not play a vital role in causing the syndrome, stress may contribute to the progression of cognitive decline, which is the main symptom of dementia. The primary stress hormone, cortisol, may have detrimental effects on cognitive brain regions when its levels are elevated for long durations. Preliminary evidence suggests that...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, there is limited sexual behavior research in older adults, which is often restricted to small samples, to cohorts recruiting adults from 45 years old, and to questions regarding only sexual intercourse. To assess the cross-sectional prevalence of and characteristics associated with sexual activity and physical tenderness in community-dwelling older adults. From the Rotterdam Study, sexual activity and physical tenderness were assessed in 2,374 dementia-free, community-dwelling men and women at least 65 years old from 2009 through 2012 in the Netherlands. Analyses were stratified by sex and partner status. Sexual activity and physical tenderness (eg, fondling or kissing) in the last 6 months. Potential associated characteristics included measurements of demographics, socioeconomic position, health behavior, and health status. The vast majority of partnered participants (men, n = 858; women, n = 724) had experienced physical tenderness in the previous 6 months (83.7% of men and 82.9% of women) and nearly half had engaged in sexual activity (49.5% and 40.4% respectively). Very few unpartnered women (n = 675) had engaged in sexual activity (1.3%) or physical tenderness (5.2%), whereas prevalence rates were slightly higher for unpartnered men (n = 117; 13.7% or 17.1%). Engaging in sexual behavior was generally associated with younger age, greater social support, healthier behaviors, and better physical and psychological health. Findings show that older adults engage in sexual activity. It is important not to assume that an older person is not interested in sexual pleasure or that an older person is unhappy with not having a sexual partner. Offering an opportunity for open discussion of sexuality and medical assistance without imposing is a difficult balance. We encourage health care professionals to proactively address sexuality and extend knowledge about safe sex and sexual function to older adults. Thus far, this is one of the largest samples of sexual behavior assessment in adults older than 60 years. Limitations of this study are common in sexual behavior research, including low sexual behavior engagement among unpartnered older adults and a small sample of unpartnered men, which restricted sex- and age-specific implications. Almost half of partnered older adults engaged in sexual activity and more than two thirds engaged in physical tenderness, but very few unpartnered older adults engaged in these behaviors. The greatest barrier to being sexually active at an older age is lack of a partner, which particularly affects women. Sexuality is an important aspect of active aging.
