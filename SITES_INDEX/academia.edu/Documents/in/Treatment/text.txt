Group therapy formats are appealing because they can be highly effective and have the potential to reach larger numbers of clients. Moreover, TF-CBT group delivery may be particularly valuable in reducing the feelings of shame, isolation, and stigma experienced by youth and their caregivers in the aftermath of traumatic experiences. This article reviews the group TF-CBT research, discusses the therapeutic benefits of TF-CBT therapy groups, and provides clinical and logistical guidance for implementing TF-CBT in group format, including a session-by-session protocol. Future directions for research and clinical work in this area are also discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shannon Dorsey•  10  Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Social Psychology, Developmental PsychologyOn dramatic reality and its therapeutic function in drama therapySave to LibraryDownloadby Susana  Pendzik•  22  Psychology, Play Therapy, Psychodrama, PhilosophyAn empirical test of schema mode conceptualizations in personality disordersSave to LibraryDownloadby Michiel van Vreeswijk•  21  Psychology, Personality, Personality Disorders, TreatmentInvestigation of a reinforcement-based toilet training procedure for children with autismSave to LibraryDownloadby Albert Pfadt•  20  Psychology, Special Education, Behavior Modification, AutismFrom mother tongue to languageSave to LibraryDownloadby Dana  Amir•  20  Psychology, Psychoanalysis, Philosophy Of Language, DepressionSystematic review of herbs and dietary supplements for glycemic control in diabetesSave to LibraryDownloadby Gloria Perez Vera•  15  Research Design, Diabetes, Treatment, Medicinal PlantsEnhancing Well-Being and Alleviating Depressive Symptoms With Positive Psychology Interventions: A Practice-Friendly Meta-Analysis mSave to LibraryDownloadby Martina Tarducci•  6  Clinical Psychology, Positive Psychology, Depression, TreatmentAlcohol dependence treatment in the EU: A literature search and expert consultation about the availability and use of guidelines in all EU countries plus Iceland, Norway, and SwitzerlandSave to LibraryDownloadby Nick Heather•TreatmentEvaluation of demineralised, freeze-dried, irradiated bone allografts in the treatment of osseous defects in the oral cavitySave to LibraryDownloadby astrid lobo Gajiwala•  17  Evaluation, Treatment, Gamma Rays, HumansClinic and radiological improvement of lipoid pneumonia with multiple bronchoalveolar lavagesTo assess the potential role of multiple bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) in the treatment of children with lipoid pneumonia (LP).

This prospective study included 10 children (7 female, 3 male) with LP secondary to mineral oil aspiration. The age ranged from 3 months to 7 years and 1-60 days history of mineral oil intake, with a 6 months clinic follow-up. High-resolution computer tomography (CT) was performed 1-7 days prior to treatment and 2-20 days after the last therapeutic BAL, and reviewed by two experienced chest radiologists. Oxygen saturation was measured with digital oximetry. Therapeutic BAL was performed weekly until BAL fluid was nearly transparent and the cell count returned to normal range values. In all children, the initial CT scans showed multifocal bilateral consolidation involving mainly the dorsal and central regions. The areas of consolidation had foci of decreased attenuation in eight patients. Following a total of 4-10 therapeutic BALs, the CT scans returned to normal in 3 patients, improved considerably in 5, and showed only slight improvement in 2. Oxygen saturation increased from 88.8 +/- 3.4% at presentation to 96.2 +/- 0.8% after treatment (P &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.0001).

Papers... moreThere is considerable argument concerning the number of sentinel node biopsy cases with axillary dissection that surgeons should perform before they are eligible on abandoning axillary dissection in negative sentinel node patients. Papers that (1) address directly or indirectly the subject of credentialing or of learning curve, (2) report on a surgeon&#39;s performance, (3) are reported as feasibility or learning curve studies, or both, (4) discuss the learning curve issue, and (5) express an expert&#39;s opinion on the learning curve. The number of procedures of the learning curve can not be fixed for all surgeons. Only surgeons in specialized breast cancer centers can succeed in meeting current recommendations with 20 to 30 cases. Surgeons from affiliated community hospitals will need more than 30 cases, whereas broad-based surgeons might need as many as 60 cases with their current caseload.
