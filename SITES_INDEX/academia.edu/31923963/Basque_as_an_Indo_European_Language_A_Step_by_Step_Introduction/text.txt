This paper therefore provides a linear, step-by-step introduction to this theory, in four stages: 1. an overview of Pre-Basque, as reconstructed by Michelena and Trask; 2. a gradual illustration of the most secure Indo-European etymologies of Pre-Basque basic lexicon (with intermediate lists of corresponding sound laws); 3. a list of less obvious etymologies; 4. a summary of sound laws. This linear organization of the subject matter should enable scholars to evaluate the theory in a matter of hours, without going through the painstaking details, cross-references and revisions in the JIES paper.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Journal of Indo-European Studies - Volume 41 - Numbers 1 & 2 Evidence for Basque as an Indo-European Language (EXCERPT)2013 • Gianfranco Forni""""This article provides phonetic, lexical and grammatical evidence that Basque is an Indo-European language. It provides a brief history of previous research into the origins of Basque; a short description of the genesis of this article; a description of the methodology adopted for the present research; an overview of Michelena’s internal reconstruction of Pre-Basque; 23 sets of chronologically arranged sound laws linking Proto-Indo-European to Pre- Basque; Indo-European etymologies for 75% of the Basque native basic lexicon, with systematic cross-references to regular sound laws; Indo-European etymologies of some Basque bound morphemes, including case markers; a discussion of the findings; and Indo-European etymologies of 40 additional, non-basic lexical items.""""Download Free PDFView PDFA First Etymological Dictionary of Basque as an Indo-European Language2014 • Gianfranco ForniIn 2013, a detailed research paper by Gianfranco Forni appeared in The Journal of Indo-European Studies, describing a breakthrough finding: the Basque language, whose origins had so far remained obscure, actually is an Indo-European language. The main reason why this fact had escaped previous researchers is that Basque underwent a long chain of phonetic changes, which obscured its ultimate origin. This dictionary is designed to make the origin of Basque easy to understand for a wider audience. The main sound laws linking Proto-Indo-European to Basque are explained in a simple, terse way. Each etymology of Basque basic, native lexicon is accompanied by intermediate reconstructions, an extensive list of cognates, and detailed references to sources. Several indices make this dictionary easy to use as a reference tool. If you are eager to understand how the mystery of the origins of Basque can now be unraveled, this dictionary will guide you through this exciting discovery.Download Free PDFView PDFEvidence for Basque as an Indo-European Language - Addenda et corrigenda to sound laws2013 • Gianfranco ForniMy article “Evidence for Basque as an Indo-European Language” was published in the Journal of Indo-European Studies - Volume 41, Numbers 1 & 2 (2013). In this article, each sound law was accompanied by a list of etymologies that support it. However, the list of supporting etymologies for each sound law was only based on the etymologies of basic lexicon contained in the main body of the article; it did not include the additional etymologies listed in Appendix 4. Such additional etymologies have now been added to each relevant sound law. Changes to sound laws included in my "Reply to the critics" have also been added as corrigenda.Download Free PDFView PDFJIES Volume 41, Number 1 & 2Why Basque language cannot be, unfortunately, an Indo-European language, JIES 41:1-22013 • Joaquín GorrochateguiDownload Free PDFView PDF"Why Basque cannot be, unfortunately, an Indo-European language?"

We shall discuss how different types of marking, such as a nominative or oblique coding of the experiencer, are expressed in different early IE languages. This shall allow us to identify a new syntactic isogloss, whereby the nominative coding of the experiencer prevails in the south and in the east of early IE, in languages such as Hittite, Vedic, Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian and Tocharian. The oblique coding of the experiencer, instead, is more productive in the north and in the west of the IE domain, that is, in Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and Slavic. Moreover, we shall observe that the productivity of oblique experiencers is indirectly proportial to the use of the middle verbal inflection inherited from PIE, which is more faithfully retained in the southeast than in the northwest of ancient IE. This may have diachronic implications and may be relevant not only for the currently debated issue of syntactic change and syntactic reconstruction of argument marking in IE, but also for an integration of areal principles into historical linguistics.Download Free PDFView PDFProto-Vasconic phonological systemMiguel Carrasquer VidalDownload Free PDFView PDFIreland and Armenia: Studies in Language, History and Narrative (JIES Monograph Series 61) .
