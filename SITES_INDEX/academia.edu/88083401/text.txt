However, due to the reduction of wild fish stocks used for FM production, its manufacturing it is now unsustainable. Insect meal represents a valid alternative to FM, due to the low carbon footprint of its production and its high nutritional value. The aim of this study was to investigate the potentials of replacing FM with black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) meal (HIM) in aquafeeds, using zebrafish as the animal model. Four diets were formulated with increasing HIM/FM replacement rate (the control diet contained 20% FM). Mortality rates, growth performances, and feed consumptions were measured, and fish intestine samples were collected for histological and enzymatic analysis. After 49 days, all groups almost tripled their initial body weight (cumulative body weight gain ranged between 143.9 and 155.2 mg), and no statistically significant differences among treatments were observed in relation to growth performa...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAnimalsFishmeal Dietary Replacement Up to 50%: A Comparative Study of Two Insect Meals for Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)FERNANDO ROGELIO GARCIA BARROSOThe demand of optimal protein for human consumption is growing. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has highlighted aquaculture as one of the most promising alternatives for this protein supply gap due to the high efficiency of fish growth. However, aquaculture has been facing its own sustainability problem, because its high demand for protein has been traditionally satisfied with the use of fishmeal (FM) as the main source. Some of the most promising and sustainable protein substitutes for FM come from insects. The present manuscript provides insight into an experiment carried out on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with a 50% replacement of FM with different larvae insect meals: Hermetia illucens (HI), and Tenebrio molitor (TM). TM showed better results for growth, protein utilization and more active digestive function, supported by intestinal histological changes. Liver histology and intermediary metabolism did not show relevant changes between insect meals, while othe...Download Free PDFView PDFAnimalsCould Dietary Black Soldier Fly Meal Inclusion Affect the Liver and Intestinal Histological Traits and the Oxidative Stress Biomarkers of Siberian Sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) Juveniles?Katia VarelloThe trial investigates if a highly defatted Hermetia illucens larva meal (H) at two dietary inclusion levels and a vegetable protein based diet (VEG) influences the normal gut and liver histology and the oxidative stress biomarkers in liver and kidney of Siberian sturgeon juveniles. Fish were fed four diets: one control diet (H0) containing 70% of fishmeal (FM), two diets including 18.5% (H185) and 37.5% (H375) of highly defatted H in substitution for 25% and 50% of FM, and one vegetable protein based diet (VEG). At the end of a growth trial, 12 fish per treatment were sacrificed by over-anaesthesia to collect 12 liver and 5 distal intestine samples for histological analyses, as well as 12 liver and kidney samples for biochemical analyses. The H and VEG diets did not significantly affect the histology of liver and distal intestine, but alterations of the oxidative stress biomarkers were detected at the highest inclusion level of H (37.5%).

Two levels of replacement for H. illucens, 30% and 50% (H30 and H50), and one for T. molitor, 50% (T50), as well as an additional diet with a modified fatty acid fraction (H50M), were investigated in relation to juvenile Sparus aurata growth indices, enzyme activities and gut microbiome. A T50 diet showed similar results to a control (C) diet, with no significant differences regarding morphological indices and minor differences for nutritional indices. Regarding the gut microbiome, H50M was the diet which showed the more similar prokaryotic community to C, which suggests that fatty acid fractions might influence the composition of the gut microbiome. Nevertheless, differences appeared to be related to a redistribution of dominant species, while changes in species affiliation were limited to minoritary species. The positive correlation between some of these minoritary spe...Download Free PDFView PDFMicroorganismsConfiguration of Gut Microbiota Structure and Potential Functionality in Two Teleosts under the Influence of Dietary Insect MealsEfthimia AntonopoulouInsect meals are considered promising, eco-friendly, alternative ingredients for aquafeed. Considering the dietary influence on establishment of functioning gut microbiota, the effect of the insect meal diets on the microbial ecology should be addressed. The present study assessed diet- and species-specific shifts in gut resident bacterial communities of juvenile reared Dicentrarchus labrax and Sparus aurata in response to three experimental diets with insect meals from three insects (Hermetia illucens, Tenebrio molitor, Musca domestica), using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in all dietary treatments. Anaerococcus sp., Cutibacterium sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in D. labrax, and Staphylococcus sp., Hafnia sp. and Aeromonas sp. in S. aurata were the most enriched shared species, following insect-meal inclusion.

Animal proteins from insects may be used as a FM alternative source as long as they do not create adverse effects in fish. Black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) was tested in a 12-week experiment on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Four hundred and twenty (14.77 ± 2.09 g) fish were divided into seven groups and were fed seven diets: control (0% BSFLM-100% FM), and FM replaced by BSFLM at rates of 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. Growth indexes, feed utilization efficiency indices, feed intake, and survival rate were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) between FM and BSFLM fed fish. Values of red blood cell, white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell distribution width, and platelet values were not affected by BSFLM. Skin, mucus lysozyme, and peroxidase activities were improved in BSFLM ...Download Free PDFView PDFAnimalsDietary Fish Meal Replacement with Hermetia illucens and Tenebrio molitor Larval Meals Improves the Growth Performance and Nutriphysiological Status of Ide (Leuciscus idus) JuvenilesNatalia HomskaThe ide (Leuciscus idus) is a native European species of rheophilic cyprinid fish whose wild population status is dependent on conservation efforts, particularly regular restocking. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of including insect meals as a component in the diet of ide juveniles on their growth performance, feed utilization, and nutriphysiological status. Four diets were formulated: three with insect meals, HI–with 20% Hermetia illucens meal, TM–with 20% Tenebrio molitor meal, and ZM–with 20% Zophobas morio meal, and the control group diet, CON–fish meal with no insect component. The effects of the various diets on the efficiency of rearing ide juveniles were assessed based on fish growth parameters, feed utilization parameters, somatic indices, and intestinal and hepatopancreatic histomorphology. The highest increase in fish weight gain and the protein efficiency ratio was observed in the HI and TM groups, while the lowest values were observed in the CON and ZM groups....Download Free PDFView PDFAnimalsGrowth and Welfare of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Response to Graded Levels of Insect and Poultry By-Product Meals in Fishmeal-Free DietsAlberta MandichThis study compared the nutrient-energy retention, digestive function, growth performance, and welfare of rainbow trout (ibw 54 g) fed isoproteic (42%), isolipidic (24%), fishmeal-free diets (CV) over 13 weeks. The diets consisted of plant-protein replacement with graded levels (10, 30, 60%) of protein from poultry by-product (PBM) and black soldier fly H. illucens pupae (BSFM) meals, either singly or in combination. A fishmeal-based diet was also tested (CF). Nitrogen retention improved with moderate or high levels of dietary PBM and BSFM relative to CV (p &lt; 0.05). Gut brush border enzyme activity was poorly affected by the diets. Gastric chitinase was up-regulated after high BSFM feeding (p &lt; 0.05). The gut peptide and amino acid transport genes were differently regulated by protein source and level. Serum cortisol was unaffected, and the changes in metabolites stayed within the physiological range. High PBM and high BSFM lowered the leukocyte respiratory burst activity and ...Download Free PDFView PDFAnimalsPossible Dietary Effects of Insect-Based Diets across Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Generations: A Multidisciplinary Study on the Larval PhaseMatteo ZarantonielloInsects represent a valuable and sustainable alternative ingredient for aquafeed formulation. However, insect-based diets have often highlighted controversial results in different fish species, especially when high inclusion levels were used. Several studies have demonstrated that nutritional programming through parental feeding may allow the production of fish better adapted to use sub-optimal aquafeed ingredients. To date, this approach has never been explored on insect-based diets. In the present study, five experimental diets characterized by increasing fish meal substitution levels with full-fat Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) prepupae meal (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were used to investigate the effects of programming via broodstock nutrition on F1 zebrafish larvae development. The responses of offspring were assayed through biometric, gas chromatographic, histological, and molecular analyses. The results evidenced that the same BSF-based diets provided to adults w...Download Free PDFView PDFInsectsGrowth of Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) Fed on a Diet Including Partially or Completely Defatted Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) Larvae Meal2021 • Atsushi IdoAgainst a background of increased demand for fish meal (FM), black soldier fly larva is a promising alternative feed source for sustainable aquaculture. Yellowtail, the most popular farmed fish in Japan, is a carnivorous fish; therefore, it requires a high proportion of FM in its diet. This study represents the first example of yellowtail fed on a diet including insect meal as a replacement for FM. Partially defatted black soldier fly meal (PDBM) comprised 49.0% crude protein and 23.2% crude fat, while completely defatted black soldier fly meal (CDBM) contained less than 10% crude fat, as the same level as FM was achieved with defatting PDBM using hexane. In feeding trials, growth of the fish was reduced in accordance with PDBM content: 10%, 20%, and 30% in their diet. Although a diet including 8% CDBM (with the same protein composition as 10% PDBM) also resulted in decreased fish growth, growth with a diet including 16% CDBM (with the same protein composition as 20% PDBM) was signi...Download Free PDFView PDFAnimalsEvaluation of an Innovative and Sustainable Pre-Commercial Compound as Replacement of Fish Meal in Diets for Rainbow Trout during Pre-Fattening Phase: Effects on Growth Performances, Haematological Parameters and Fillet Quality TraitsKenan GüllüThe aim of the study was to determine the potential and sustainable use of pre-commercial product ITTINSECT™ APS V1 as a major protein source in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets. A 60-day feeding experiment was conducted to potentially use ITTINSECT as fish meal replacement in the diets of rainbow trout. Five isonitrogenous in dry matter (38% crude protein) and isolipidic (15% crude lipid) diets were produced: a control diet (fishmeal-based) (ITT0) and four experimental diets replacing fishmeal by 25 (ITT25), 50 (ITT50), 75 (ITT75) and 100 (ITT100) %, with ITTINSECT™ APS V1. Triplicate tanks, containing 15 fish each (65.81 ± 1.26 g), were hand-fed to apparent satiation twice every day during the experiment. At the end of the feeding trial, significantly higher growth performance was observed in the group fed ITTM25 and ITTM50 diets. This performance was supported by growth-related gene expressions analyzed in muscle; significantly higher GH and IGF-I genes expression levels...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
