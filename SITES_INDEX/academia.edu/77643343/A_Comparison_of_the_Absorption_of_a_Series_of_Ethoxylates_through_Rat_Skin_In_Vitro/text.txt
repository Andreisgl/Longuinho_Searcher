Different tests can be applied to evaluate the integrity of the skin samples. Here, we compared the pre- or post-run integrity tests (transepidermal electrical resistance, TEER; transepidermal water loss, TEWL; absorption of the reference compounds water, TWF, or methylene blue, BLUE) and additionally focused on co-absorption of a (3)H-labeled internal reference standard (ISTD) as integrity parameter. The results were correlated to absorption profiles of various test compounds. Limit values of 2kΩ, 10 gm(-2)h(-1) and 4.5∗10(-3)cmh(-1) for the standard methods TEER, TEWL and TWF, respectively, allowed distinguishing between impaired and intact human skin samples in general. Single skin samples did, however, not, poorly and even inversely correlate with the test-compound absorption. In contrast, results with ISTD (e.g. (3)H-testosterone) were highly correlated to the absorption of (14)C-...Download Free PDFView PDFToxicological SciencesComparative in Vitro-in Vivo Percutaneous Absorption of the Pesticide Propoxur2000 • Johannes Sandt, Nicole H.p CnubbenIn vitro and in vivo skin absorption of the pesticide propoxur (2-isopropoxyphenyl N-methyl carbamate, commercially Baygon(TM) and Unden (TM); log Po/w 1.56, MW 209.2) was investigated. In vivo studies were performed in rats and human volunteers, applying the test compound to the dorsal skin and the volar aspect of the forearm, respectively. In vitro experiments were carried out in static diffusion cells using viable full-thickness skin membranes (rat and human), non-viable epidermal membranes (rat and human) and a perfused-pig-ear model. Percutaneous penetration of propoxur in human volunteers was measured by analysis of its metabolite (2-isopropoxyphenol) in blood and urine; in all other studies radiolabeled propoxur ([ring-U-(14)C]propoxur) was used. In order to allow for direct comparison, experimental conditions were standardized with respect to dose (150 microg propoxur per cm(2)), vehicle (60% aqueous ethanol) and exposure time (4 h). In human volunteers, it was found that approximately 6% of the applied dose was excreted via the urine after 24 h, while the potential absorbed dose (amount applied minus amount washed off) was 23 microg/cm(2). In rats these values were 21% and 88 microg/cm(2), respectively. Data obtained in vitro were almost always higher than those obtained in human volunteers. The most accurate in vitro prediction of the human in vivo percutaneous absorption of propoxur was obtained on the basis of the potential absorbed dose. The absorbed dose and the maximal flux in viable full-thickness skin membranes correlated reasonably well with the human in vivo situation (maximal overestimation by a factor of 3). Epidermal membranes overestimated the human in vivo data up to a factor of 8, but the species-differences observed in vivo were reflected correctly in this model. The data generated in the perfused-pig-ear model were generally intermediate between viable skin membranes and epidermal membranes.Download Free PDFView PDFCurrent Medicinal ChemistryTransdermal Drug Delivery In Vitro Using Diffusion Cells2012 • Jiri BajgarDownload Free PDFView PDFRegulatory Toxicology and PharmacologyIn vitro predictions of skin absorption of caffeine, testosterone, and benzoic acid: a multi-centre comparison study2004 • Johannes SandtTo obtain better insight into the robustness of in vitro percutaneous absorption methodology, the intra- and inter-laboratory variation in this type of study was investigated in 10 European laboratories. To this purpose, the in vitro absorption of three compounds through human skin (9 laboratories) and rat skin (1 laboratory) was determined. The test materials were benzoic acid, caffeine, and testosterone, representing a range of different physico-chemical properties. All laboratories performed their studies according to a detailed protocol in which all experimental details were described and each laboratory performed at least three independent experiments for each test chemical. All laboratories assigned the absorption of benzoic acid through human skin, the highest ranking of the three compounds (overall mean flux of 16.54+/-11.87 microg/cm(2)/h). The absorption of caffeine and testosterone through human skin was similar, having overall mean maximum absorption rates of 2.24+/-1.43 microg/cm(2)/h and 1.63+/-1.94 microg/cm(2)/h, respectively. In 7 out of 9 laboratories, the maximum absorption rates of caffeine were ranked higher than testosterone. No differences were observed between the mean absorption through human skin and the one rat study for benzoic acid and testosterone. For caffeine the maximum absorption rate and the total penetration through rat skin were clearly higher than the mean value for human skin. When evaluating all data, it appeared that no consistent relation existed between the diffusion cell type and the absorption of the test compounds. Skin thickness only slightly influenced the absorption of benzoic acid and caffeine. In contrast, the maximum absorption rate of testosterone was clearly higher in the laboratories using thin, dermatomed skin membranes. Testosterone is the most lipophilic compound and showed also a higher presence in the skin membrane after 24 h than the two other compounds. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro methodology for assessing skin absorption is relatively robust. A major effort was made to standardize the study performance, but, unlike in a formal validation study, not all variables were controlled. The variation observed may be largely attributed to human variability in dermal absorption and the skin source. For the most lipophilic compound, testosterone, skin thickness proved to be a critical variable.Download Free PDFView PDFBioorganic & Medicinal ChemistrySynthesis, physico-chemical properties and penetration activity of alkyl-6-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)hexanoates as potential transdermal penetration enhancers2010 • Josef JampilekDownload Free PDFView PDFPercutaneous Penetration Enhancers Drug Penetration Into/Through the Skin: Methodology and General ConsiderationsFinite and Infinite Dosing2017 • Keng Wooi NgDue to the popularity of topical and transdermal drug delivery, there is a high demand for reliable skin penetration and permeation data. Compared to in vivo methods, in vitro methods enable these data to be more easily obtained in a shorter time. Two dosing regimens are commonly used to model transdermal drug delivery in vitro, namely, finite dosing and infinite dosing. These dosing regimens are useful in different situations and allow different absorption parameters to be determined empirically. The choice between these regimens depends upon the applicability of the underlying assumptions in a given in-use situation. This chapter provides an overview on finite and infinite dose regimens used in transdermal delivery research, and discuss the advantages and limitations of such regimens.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of DermatologyBarrier function of intact and impaired skin: percutaneous penetration of caffeine and salicylic acid2011 • Laia RubioDownload Free PDFView PDFToxicology Mechanisms and MethodsDose Related Absorption of JP-8 Jet Fuel Hydrocarbons Through Porcine Skin with Quantitative Structure Permeability Relationship Analysis2004 • Nancy A Monteiro-RiviereDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
