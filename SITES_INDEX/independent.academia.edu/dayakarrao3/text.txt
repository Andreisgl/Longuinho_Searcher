Infrared heating conditions (temperature and duration) were optimized using a central composite design. Processing at a temperature of 120°C for 8.5 min was optimum to provide the lowest FFA content (0.03%), lipase activity (15 µeq·mg/h), and peak viscosity (318 BU). Correlation coefficient values (R2) for responses of FFA content (96.24%), lipase activity (97.74%), and peak viscosity (90.87%), derived using experimental data, indicated that the model was a good fit. Infrared heating at 120°C for 8.5 min can be useful for development of shelf stable sorghum flour.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Millets are classified in to major millets and minor millets or small millets. Millets are important crops for dryland farmers; they are highly nutritious and are a climatecompliant crop. But due to drudgery in preparation, overall millet consumption in India has declined over the years. In order to revive the demand of millets in India, there is need to bring all the stakeholders in production to consumption system value chain. The ICAR-IIMR (formerly DSR) has made attempts to innovate technologies that enable in developing sorghum/millet based value added products through NAIP subproject, ‘Creation of Demand throughPCS MilletsValueChain’. In view of decreasing millets consumption, efforts have been made to integrate all the stakeholders to bring them on a common platform so as to create demand for millet cultivation which is popularly known as value chain mode fr...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Subsequently, they contribute 10% to the country&#39;s food grain basket in India, supporting 12 million people. The rich content of nutrients in sorghum has made it most demanding&#39;for animal feed. In Africa and some poorer countries in Asia they are mostly grown for food purpose while in all the major growing countries it is used for poultry and animal feed.Recently it has become the most wanted raw material for ethanol production because of relatively cheaper price and high content of minerals. However millets production in India has been declining for the past 4 decades despite increase in their productivity and development of high yielding improved varieties, owing to lack of remuneration as well as demand for the millets consumption. It has therefore become necessary to reorient R&D efforts on sorghum and millets to gener...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of adding golden apple nectar on the physicochemical and sensory quality of stirred yoghurts from cow&amp;#39;s milk. Yoghurts with 15% and 20% golden apple nectar were more (P&amp;gt;0.01) liked than the control (0% nectar) yoghurt in all sensory attributes. The appearance and body attribute differed (P&amp;lt;0.01) between yoghurts with 15% and 20% nectar. The overall sensory quality of these yoghurts was rated very good to excellent. There were significant (P&amp;gt;0.05) changes, in pH, lactic acid, consistency, colour, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts and moulds on storage at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. By week 4 of storage, yoghurts developed a buttery smell and were less dark and yellow.

Various innovative interventions include, first being farm level backward integration converting domestic cultivation to commercial cultivation for meeting health conscious urban consumer needs. Second, novel intervention was diversification of processing technologies through developing and retrofitting more than 50 machineries suitability to millets from milling, to many semi-processed technologies such as baking, cold extrusion, hot extrusion, flaking, popping, puffing, fermentation, and malting was standardized. More than 200 recipes were developed to suit various regional pallet and circulated among users in local languages. The prototype of various machinery are now being upscaled. The shelf life of processed products were enhanced from less than a month to 8 months thus offering consumers wide and convenient food options to choose for enhancing millet consumption and paving way for commercialization of millet foods. Third, intervention is nutritional evaluation of millets and their value-added products and clinical trials were conducted to substantiate the health benefits through empirical data ably supported by NIN. Thus, the data generated helps in the labeling of the products for commercialization. The key to commercialize the millets lies in creating USP (unique selling proposition) for flagging it as healthy and convenient option. A Successful and sustainable and replicable value chain model has been furnished through innovations by bringing interventions at on-farm level, processing diversification, nutritional evaluation, market building, entrepreneurship development and creating awareness, assuring sustainable food and nutritional security which are beneficial to not only the poor dryland farmer but also health conscious urban consumers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The objectives of this research were to develop an effective process to increase resistant starch content of sorghum flour. Samples of white sorghum flour with different moisture contents (20%, 25% and 30%) were treated at a temperature of 100°C for 4 h. Samples after heat treatments were tested for resistant starch. The sample treated with 30% moisture at 100oC for 4 h had high resistant starch (RS) content (30.2% compared with 24.6% of the native sample). The same heat-moisture treatment on isolated sorghum starch showed high resistant starch (RS) content (10.8% compared with 8.2% of 20% moisture content). In conclusion, heatmoisture treatments were successful in increasing resistant starch content of sorghum flour to retain starch functionality in food product applications.

Most of the decline in area has occurred in kharif sorghum. This warrants critical examination of the changing scenario of kharif sorghum and identification of the reasons thereof. For the macro analysis, secondary data on various aspects of kharif sorghum have been used, whereas the farm survey data have been used to draw the inferences at the micro level with respect to changing scenario of kharif sorghum. The growth rates in area, production and productivity of kharif sorghum have been computed. The Herfindahl index has been computed to find out crop diversification in the sample districts of Dharwad and Belgaun.

In India, sorghum was a major cereal during 1950s and occupied more than 18 million hectares area which has come down to 11.6 million hectares as a result of continuous decline over the last three decades (NRCS, 1998). However, it still plays a key role in the lives of millions of rural people by providing food security in less-endowed regions of India (Kelley et al., 1994). A host of competing crops like rice, oilseeds, pulses, groundnut, cotton, etc., have gained area at the expense of sorghum (Hall, 2000 and Kelley and Rao, 1993).
