The island of Ireland, also joined via a personal union, was incorporated under the 1800 Acts of Union, while Wales had been part of the Kingdom of England since the 16th century. The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid expansion of the British Empire despite the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, and at its zenith in the early 20th century, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw two World Wars seriously deplete the UK's strength and the Irish Republic withdraw from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth of Nations, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The devolved Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1998. The UK was an active member of the EU after its accession in 1973, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. However, motivated in part by frustration at a remote bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the country, UK citizens on 23 June 2016 voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the EU. The UK became the only country to depart the EU on 31 January 2020, after prolonged negotiations on EU-UK economic and security relationships had been hammered out.TipVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.Definitions and NotesGeographyLocationWestern Europe, islands - including the northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland - between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea; northwest of FranceGeographic coordinates54 00 N, 2 00 WMap referencesEuropeAreatotal: 243,610 sq kmland: 241,930 sq kmwater: 1,680 sq kmnote 1: the percentage area breakdown of the four UK countries is: England 53%, Scotland 32%, Wales 9%, and Northern Ireland 6%note 2: includes Rockall and the Shetland Islands, which are part of Scotlandcomparison ranking: total 80Area - comparativetwice the size of Pennsylvania; slightly smaller than OregonArea comparison map:Land boundariestotal: 499 kmborder countries (1): Ireland 499 kmCoastline12,429 kmMaritime claimsterritorial sea: 12 nmcontinental shelf: as defined in continental shelf orders or in accordance with agreed upon boundariesexclusive fishing zone: 200 nmClimatetemperate; moderated by prevailing southwest winds over the North Atlantic Current; more than one-half of the days are overcastTerrainmostly rugged hills and low mountains; level to rolling plains in east and southeastElevationhighest point: Ben Nevis 1,345 mlowest point: The Fens -4 mmean elevation: 162 mNatural resourcescoal, petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, lead, zinc, gold, tin, limestone, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, potash, silica sand, slate, arable landLand useagricultural land: 71% (2018 est.)arable land: 25.1% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 0.2% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 45.7% (2018 est.)forest: 11.9% (2018 est.)other: 17.1% (2018 est.)Irrigated land718 sq km (2018)Population distributionthe core of the population lies in and around London, with significant clusters found in central Britain around Manchester and Liverpool, in the Scottish lowlands between Edinburgh and Glasgow, southern Wales in and around Cardiff, and far eastern Northern Ireland centered on BelfastNatural hazardswinter windstorms; floodsGeography - notelies near vital North Atlantic sea lanes; only 35 km from France and linked by tunnel under the English Channel (the Channel Tunnel or Chunnel); because of heavily indented coastline, no location is more than 125 km from tidal watersPeople and SocietyPopulation68,138,484 (2023 est.)

the United Kingdom is currently considered a high risk to travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV); vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccineObesity - adult prevalence rate27.8% (2016)comparison ranking: 36Alcohol consumption per capitatotal: 9.8 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)beer: 3.53 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)wine: 3.3 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)spirits: 2.35 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)other alcohols: 0.61 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)comparison ranking: total 24Tobacco usetotal: 15.4% (2020 est.)male: 17.3% (2020 est.)female: 13.5% (2020 est.)comparison ranking: total 102Children under the age of 5 years underweightNACurrently married women (ages 15-49)50.7% (2023 est.)Child marriagewomen married by age 18: 0.1% (2020 est.)Education expenditures5.5% of GDP (2020 est.)comparison ranking: 55Literacytotal population: NAmale: NAfemale: NASchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)total: 17 yearsmale: 17 yearsfemale: 18 years (2020)Youth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)total: 13.2%male: 14.6%female: 11.8% (2021 est.)comparison ranking: total 133EnvironmentEnvironment - current issuesair pollution improved but remains a concern, particularly in the London region;

the Gurkhas subsequently were brought into the British Indian Army and by 1914, there were 10 Gurkha regiments, collectively known as the Gurkha Brigade; following the partition of India in 1947, an agreement between Nepal, India, and Great Britain allowed for the transfer of the 10 regiments from the British Indian Army to the separate British and Indian armies; four of the regiments were transferred to the British Army, where they have since served continuously as the Brigade of GurkhasMilitary deploymentsapproximately 1,000 Brunei; approximately 400 Canada (BATUS);

the UK is also a member of the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA), a series of mutual assistance agreements reached in 1971 embracing Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK; the FPDA commits the members to consult with one another in the event or threat of an armed attack on any of the members and to mutually decide what measures should be taken, jointly or separately; there is no specific obligation to intervene militarily in 2010, France and the UK signed a declaration on defense and security cooperation that included greater military interoperability and a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), a deployable, combined Anglo-French military force for use in a wide range of crisis scenarios, up to and including high intensity combat operations; the CJEF has no standing forces but would be available at short notice for UK-French bilateral, NATO, EU, UN, or other operations; combined training exercises began in 2011; as of 2020, the CJEF was assessed as having full operating capacity with the ability to rapidly deploy over 10,000 personnel capable of high intensity operations, peacekeeping, disaster relief, and humanitarian assistancein 2014, the UK led the formation of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), a pool of high-readiness military forces from Baltic and Scandinavian countries able to respond to a wide range of contingencies both in peacetime and in times of crisis or conflict; its principal geographic area of interest is the High North, North Atlantic, and Baltic Sea regions, where the JEF can complement national capabilities or NATO’s deterrence posture, although it is designed to be flexible and prepared to respond to humanitarian crises further afield; the JEF consists of 10 countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK) and was declared operational in 2018; most of the forces in the pool are British, and the UK provides the most rapidly deployable units as well as the command and control elementsthe British Armed Forces were formed in 1707 as the armed forces of the Kingdom of Great Britain when England and Scotland merged under the terms of the Treaty of Union; while the origins of the armed forces of England and Scotland stretch back to the Middle Ages, the first standing armies for England and Scotland were organized in the 1600s while the navies were formed in the 1500s; the Royal Marines were established in 1755; the Royal Air Force was created in April 1918 by the merger of the British Army's Royal Flying Corps and the Admiralty's Royal Naval Air Service (2023)SpaceSpace agency/agenciesUK Space Agency (UKSA;
