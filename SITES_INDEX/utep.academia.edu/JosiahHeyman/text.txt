I am interested in all things that concern borders, and the processes that shape them and pass through them.  My three most recent inquiries are regulation of spatial movement generally (building on, but going beyond borders per se), participant observation of engaged/activist anthropology (and lessons thereof), and unequal territorialization and political ecology of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.  Much of my work centers on the presence of and limits to state power at borders.  This has connected to a specific focus on migration and mobility, state power, apartheid, and exploitation.  It has led to a focus on state workers, bureaucratic work processes, societal power and bureaucracies, etc.  My border and migration work has lead to an active role in public policy, focusing on alternative migration and border policies for the United States, in collaboration with community organizations and national policy organizations.  That, in turn, has lead to a long sequence of works on values, advocacy, and social science (applied or engaged anthropology).  I am also interested in border cultures and complex/dynamic analyses of them, and how such approaches contribute to culture theory generally.  I have also worked for many years on anthropology of work, of working classes, household economies (including unpaid/reproductive work within capitalism), and consumption. I contribute modestly to the nascent field of political ecology, and to political economy within anthropology.  I am a student of, and advocate for, the legacy of Eric Wolf in anthropology, and the social sciences and history generally.Supervisors: Eric R.

The U.S.-Mexico Transborder Region: Cultural Dynamics and Historical Interactions, Edited by Carlos G.

Not a static entity, the transborder region is peopled by ever-changing groups who face the challenges of social inequality: political enforcement of privilege, economic subordination of indigenous communities, and organized resistance to domination.       The book, influenced by the work of Eric Wolf and senior editor Carlos G. Vélez-Ibáñez, centers on the greater Mexican North/U.S. Southwest, although the geographic range extends farther. This tradition, like other transborder approaches, attends to complex and fluid cultural and linguistic processes, going beyond the classical modern anthropological vision of one people, one culture, one language. With respect to recent approaches, however, it is more deeply social, focusing on vertical relations of power and horizontal bonds of mutuality.       Vélez-Ibáñez and Heyman envision this region as involving diverse and unequal social groups in dynamic motion over thousands of years. Thus the historical interaction of the U.S.-Mexico border, however massively unequal and powerful, is only the most recent manifestation of this longer history and common ecology. Contributors emphasize the dynamic "transborder" quality—conflicts, resistance, slanting, displacements, and persistence—in order to combine a critical perspective on unequal power relations with a questioning perspective on claims to bounded simplicity and perfection.       The book is notable for its high degree of connection across the various chapters, strengthened by internal syntheses from notable border scholars, including Robert R. Alvarez and Alejandro Lugo. In the final section, Judith Freidenberg draws general lessons from particular case studies, summarizing that "access to valued scarce resources prompts the erection of human differences that get solidified into borders," dividing and limiting, engendering vulnerabilities and marginalizing some people.       At a time when understanding the U.S.-Mexico border is more important than ever, this volume offers a critical anthropological and historical approach to working in transborder regions. Contributors:       Amado Alarcón    Robert R.

Horton and Josiah Heyman, editors.,  2020This volume focuses on documents as a window onto the power dynamics between migrants and states ... more This volume focuses on documents as a window onto the power dynamics between migrants and states in high-income countries that have been tra- ditional destinations for South-to-North migration. Although we recognize that documents have become an increasingly important site through which states manage South-to-South migration and migration in transit states, we focus on South-to-North migration here due to space limitations.8 Because the new immigration statuses created in the North are only temporary, they have profound, and understudied, implications for migrants’ relationships to state bureaucracies. They more intensively subject migrants to state bu- reaucratic surveillance. That is, migrants must request frequent renewals and meet a battery of requirements to prolong these already-“liminal” legal statuses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Shadow of the Wall: Violence and Migration on the US-Mexico Borderby Daniel E Martínez, Jeremy Slack, Scott  Whiteford, Josiah Heyman, and Murphy WoodhouseMass deportation is at the forefront of political discourse in the United States. The Shadow of t... more Mass deportation is at the forefront of political discourse in the United States. The Shadow of the Wall shows in tangible ways the migration experiences of hundreds of people, including their encounters with U.S. Border Patrol, cartels , detention facilities, and the deportation process. Deportees reveal in their heartwrenching stories the power of family separation and reunification and the cost of criminalization, and they call into question assumptions about human rights and federal policies. The authors analyze data from the Migrant Border Crossing Study (MBCS), a mixed-methods, binational research project that offers socially relevant, rigorous social science about migration, immigration enforcement, and violence on the border. Using information gathered from more than 1,600 post-deportation surveys, this volume examines the different faces of violence and migration along the Arizona-Sonora border and shows that deportees are highly connected to the United States and will stop at nothing to return to their families. The Shadow of the Wall underscores the unintended social consequences of increased border enforcement, immigrant criminalization, and deportation along the U.S.-Mexico border.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This point, albeit important,does not exhaust the lessons to be learned from the US–Mexico border region. It alsodisplays highly unequal power relations. Adjacent, interactive, but profoundly asymmetrical border city pairs are key sites for analyzing unequal relationships between the so-called global South and global North. This social relationality of apparently contrastive endpoints, and the cultural frameworks and practices that mediate the connections, is yet another lesson from the US–Mexico border. Culture occurs in a matrix of often highly unequal social relationships. Culture is made and reproduced at relational meeting points between differentiated positionalities, even when there is an apparently exclusionary border in between.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The future of water in a desert river basin facing climate change and competing demands: A holistic approach to water sustainability in arid and semi-arid regionsby Josiah Heyman, A.

The core question for such settings is: how can water be managed so that competing agricultural, urban, and environmental sectors can realize a sustainable future? We synthesize results from interdisciplinary research aimed at “water futures”, considering possible, probable, and preferable outcomes from the known drivers of change in the MRG in a stakeholder participatory mode. We accomplishedthis by developing and evaluating scenarios using a suite of scientifically rigorous computer models, melded with the input from diverse stakeholders.New hydrological insights for the region: Under likely scenarios without significant interventions, relatively cheap and easy to access water will be depleted in about 40 years. Interventions to mitigate this outcome will be very costly. A new approach is called for based on “adaptive cooperation” among sectors and across jurisdictions along four important themes: information sharing, water conservation, greater development and use of alternative water sources, and new limits to water allocation/withdrawals coupled with more flexibility in uses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Border policies, in turn, shape worker exploitability and division. These two processes are interwoven, but not identical; while they are mutually causative, it is important to sort themout conceptually. We should not lose track of racism in doing a capitalism- focused analysis. This synthetic chapter addresses both the expansion outward across borders of the search for cheap labor in production, and the ambivalent and conflictive politics of migration inward across borders.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I proceed by identifying specific processes and mechanisms by which nation-state borders produce separation. I also address processes of mutual recognition that occur at borders, arguably because borders concentrate people and activities that favor or even require creation frameworks for mutual decision-making and action. This would involve dialogues, decisions, and practical administrative interactions suited to the phenomenon, rather than arbitrarily limited and obstructed by singular bounded state institutions. By creating diverse arenas and spaces of interested participants having shared practical concerns, and by imbuing these with a social imaginary of being a commons, it might be possible to address this problematic effects of bounded nation-states.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

this... more We propose that usable water is becoming more costly and difficult. The term “difficult” inthis phrasing refers to the increased effort needed to access and process water. An example is desalination. “Costly” is a characteristic consequence of resorting to more difficult ways to supply water. These changes occur in the context of climate change, which in some cases reduces river flows. They also occur in the context of fresh groundwater depletion, meaning that nearby, inexpensive resources cannot meet demand. Water will not simply run out in most cases, but rather replacement supplies will be more costly and difficult. Reduced river flows and groundwater depletion as a result of climate change and population growth have increased the effort and difficulty accessing and processing water. In turn, residential water costs from municipal utilities are predicted to rise to unaffordable rates for poor residential water customers. Building on a regional conjunctive use model with future climate scenarios and 50-year future water supply plans, our study communicates the effects of climate change on poor people in El Paso, Texas, as water becomes more difficult and expensive to obtain in future years. Four scenarios for future water supply and future water costs were delineated based on expected impacts of climate change and groundwater depletion. Residential water use was calculated by census tract in El Paso, using basic needs indoor water use and evaporative cooling use as determinants of household water consumption. Based on household size and income data from the US Census, fraction of household income spent on water was determined. Results reveal that in the future, basic water supply will be a significant burden for 40% of all households in El Paso. Impacts are geographically concentrated in poor census tracts. Our study revealed that negative impacts from water resource depletion and increasing populations in El Paso will lead to costly and difficult water for El Paso water users. We provide an example of how to connect future resource scenarios, including those affected by climate change, to challenges of affordability for vulnerable consumers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim is to determine the social evaluation of the skills involved. To retrace the classifications, a total of 114 official documents were examined, establishing a chronological division into three major stages: 1920–1940, 1940–1960 and 1960–1980. The first period (1920–1940 shows efforts toward the initial objectification of working conditions and salary scales, revealing social prejudices and tacit conventions shaping the employment hierarchy, whilethe second one (1940–1960) indicates the extent to which office work stood out over manual work. Finally, the third stage (1960–1980) shows processes of language rationalisation, which entailed attempts to standardise positions based on required skill sets.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One is to relegat... more Contemporary borders have two effects on labor availability and exploitability. One is to relegate large communities of potential labor outside the borders of prosperous countries. There, they are available for high productivity, low-wage work in assembly plants, call centers, and other such industries. Capital and management can move fluidly back and forth across borders to take advantage of such working communities. The other is to impose legal status categories and unequal treatment on border crossers (immigrants and commuters); these impose various conditions of labor exploitability. The best-known case is illegality, but legal migration with various employment, location, and time restrictions is also important. One view of these two effects is that they constitute systematic state control of labor on behalf of capitalism. However, this neglects the importance of racism and relatedly, xenophobia, within concrete historical capitalisms. The chapter suggests that borders be analyzed as processes emerging from complex political struggles between racism, capitalist labor management, and social justice struggles.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Such technologies are applied to a population of millions who largely are racialized as Mexican in the United States. Bowker and Star (2000) explore how technologies of classification and applications stemming from them embody important racial divides in their study of apartheid in South Africa. This article moves the examination of racialized technologies from the micro to the macro scale by looking at the framing of a distinctive region, and the people most characteristic of it, as a surveillance and enforcement target.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Surface waters are declining due to diminishing snowpack in the headwaters in Colorado in the U.S. (Mote et al. 2018) combined with increasing demands for water intensive crops (Booker et al. 2005) and growing urban populations (MacDonald 2010).The region has recently suffered persistent drought; 2000-2018 has been the driest 19-year period since the late 1500s (Williams et al. 2020). Climate projections indicate the region will be prone to more frequent and severe droughts, with declining surface water availability (MacDonald 2010; Townsend and Gutzler 2020). In addition, freshwateraquifer levels are declining and saline waters are intruding (Sheng 2013). These changes threaten both U.S. and Mexican regional economies, water and food security, and aquatic biodiversity (Hoekstra et al. 2012). While a uni!ed view of the entire basin water system is needed, it is largely missing. In view of these issues, it is imperative that scientists collaborate to better understand the situation and assess plausible paths forward. This requires crossing national and state political boundaries, in addition to integrating knowledge across social, biophysical, economic, and engineering disciplines.Such transboundary-transdisciplinary scienti!c collaborations are exceedingly complex and challenging (Cundill et al. 2018; Mathieu et al. 2019; Steger et al. 2021). This article reports on a six-year collaborative scientific research effort, funded by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), that involved researchers from multiple disciplines from the U.S. and Mexico aimed atimproving the sustainability of water resources in the challenging Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although we recognize that documents have become an increasingly important site through which states manage South-to-South migration and migration in transit states, we focus on South-to-North migration here due to space limitations.8 Because the new immigration statuses created in the North are only temporary, they have profound, and understudied, implications for migrants’ relationships to state bureaucracies. They more intensively subject migrants to state bu- reaucratic surveillance. That is, migrants must request frequent renewals and meet a battery of requirements to prolong these already-“liminal” legal statuses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Shadow of the Wall: Violence and Migration on the US-Mexico Borderby Daniel E Martínez, Jeremy Slack, Scott  Whiteford, Josiah Heyman, and Murphy WoodhouseMass deportation is at the forefront of political discourse in the United States. The Shadow of t... more Mass deportation is at the forefront of political discourse in the United States. The Shadow of the Wall shows in tangible ways the migration experiences of hundreds of people, including their encounters with U.S. Border Patrol, cartels , detention facilities, and the deportation process. Deportees reveal in their heartwrenching stories the power of family separation and reunification and the cost of criminalization, and they call into question assumptions about human rights and federal policies. The authors analyze data from the Migrant Border Crossing Study (MBCS), a mixed-methods, binational research project that offers socially relevant, rigorous social science about migration, immigration enforcement, and violence on the border. Using information gathered from more than 1,600 post-deportation surveys, this volume examines the different faces of violence and migration along the Arizona-Sonora border and shows that deportees are highly connected to the United States and will stop at nothing to return to their families. The Shadow of the Wall underscores the unintended social consequences of increased border enforcement, immigrant criminalization, and deportation along the U.S.-Mexico border.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This point, albeit important,does not exhaust the lessons to be learned from the US–Mexico border region. It alsodisplays highly unequal power relations. Adjacent, interactive, but profoundly asymmetrical border city pairs are key sites for analyzing unequal relationships between the so-called global South and global North. This social relationality of apparently contrastive endpoints, and the cultural frameworks and practices that mediate the connections, is yet another lesson from the US–Mexico border. Culture occurs in a matrix of often highly unequal social relationships. Culture is made and reproduced at relational meeting points between differentiated positionalities, even when there is an apparently exclusionary border in between.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The future of water in a desert river basin facing climate change and competing demands: A holistic approach to water sustainability in arid and semi-arid regionsby Josiah Heyman, A.

The core question for such settings is: how can water be managed so that competing agricultural, urban, and environmental sectors can realize a sustainable future? We synthesize results from interdisciplinary research aimed at “water futures”, considering possible, probable, and preferable outcomes from the known drivers of change in the MRG in a stakeholder participatory mode. We accomplishedthis by developing and evaluating scenarios using a suite of scientifically rigorous computer models, melded with the input from diverse stakeholders.New hydrological insights for the region: Under likely scenarios without significant interventions, relatively cheap and easy to access water will be depleted in about 40 years. Interventions to mitigate this outcome will be very costly. A new approach is called for based on “adaptive cooperation” among sectors and across jurisdictions along four important themes: information sharing, water conservation, greater development and use of alternative water sources, and new limits to water allocation/withdrawals coupled with more flexibility in uses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Border policies, in turn, shape worker exploitability and division. These two processes are interwoven, but not identical; while they are mutually causative, it is important to sort themout conceptually. We should not lose track of racism in doing a capitalism- focused analysis. This synthetic chapter addresses both the expansion outward across borders of the search for cheap labor in production, and the ambivalent and conflictive politics of migration inward across borders.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I proceed by identifying specific processes and mechanisms by which nation-state borders produce separation. I also address processes of mutual recognition that occur at borders, arguably because borders concentrate people and activities that favor or even require creation frameworks for mutual decision-making and action. This would involve dialogues, decisions, and practical administrative interactions suited to the phenomenon, rather than arbitrarily limited and obstructed by singular bounded state institutions. By creating diverse arenas and spaces of interested participants having shared practical concerns, and by imbuing these with a social imaginary of being a commons, it might be possible to address this problematic effects of bounded nation-states.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An example is desalination. “Costly” is a characteristic consequence of resorting to more difficult ways to supply water. These changes occur in the context of climate change, which in some cases reduces river flows. They also occur in the context of fresh groundwater depletion, meaning that nearby, inexpensive resources cannot meet demand. Water will not simply run out in most cases, but rather replacement supplies will be more costly and difficult. Reduced river flows and groundwater depletion as a result of climate change and population growth have increased the effort and difficulty accessing and processing water. In turn, residential water costs from municipal utilities are predicted to rise to unaffordable rates for poor residential water customers. Building on a regional conjunctive use model with future climate scenarios and 50-year future water supply plans, our study communicates the effects of climate change on poor people in El Paso, Texas, as water becomes more difficult and expensive to obtain in future years. Four scenarios for future water supply and future water costs were delineated based on expected impacts of climate change and groundwater depletion. Residential water use was calculated by census tract in El Paso, using basic needs indoor water use and evaporative cooling use as determinants of household water consumption. Based on household size and income data from the US Census, fraction of household income spent on water was determined. Results reveal that in the future, basic water supply will be a significant burden for 40% of all households in El Paso. Impacts are geographically concentrated in poor census tracts. Our study revealed that negative impacts from water resource depletion and increasing populations in El Paso will lead to costly and difficult water for El Paso water users. We provide an example of how to connect future resource scenarios, including those affected by climate change, to challenges of affordability for vulnerable consumers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim is to determine the social evaluation of the skills involved. To retrace the classifications, a total of 114 official documents were examined, establishing a chronological division into three major stages: 1920–1940, 1940–1960 and 1960–1980. The first period (1920–1940 shows efforts toward the initial objectification of working conditions and salary scales, revealing social prejudices and tacit conventions shaping the employment hierarchy, whilethe second one (1940–1960) indicates the extent to which office work stood out over manual work. Finally, the third stage (1960–1980) shows processes of language rationalisation, which entailed attempts to standardise positions based on required skill sets.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One is to relegat... more Contemporary borders have two effects on labor availability and exploitability. One is to relegate large communities of potential labor outside the borders of prosperous countries. There, they are available for high productivity, low-wage work in assembly plants, call centers, and other such industries. Capital and management can move fluidly back and forth across borders to take advantage of such working communities. The other is to impose legal status categories and unequal treatment on border crossers (immigrants and commuters); these impose various conditions of labor exploitability. The best-known case is illegality, but legal migration with various employment, location, and time restrictions is also important. One view of these two effects is that they constitute systematic state control of labor on behalf of capitalism. However, this neglects the importance of racism and relatedly, xenophobia, within concrete historical capitalisms. The chapter suggests that borders be analyzed as processes emerging from complex political struggles between racism, capitalist labor management, and social justice struggles.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Surface waters are declining due to diminishing snowpack in the headwaters in Colorado in the U.S. (Mote et al. 2018) combined with increasing demands for water intensive crops (Booker et al. 2005) and growing urban populations (MacDonald 2010).The region has recently suffered persistent drought; 2000-2018 has been the driest 19-year period since the late 1500s (Williams et al. 2020). Climate projections indicate the region will be prone to more frequent and severe droughts, with declining surface water availability (MacDonald 2010; Townsend and Gutzler 2020). In addition, freshwateraquifer levels are declining and saline waters are intruding (Sheng 2013). These changes threaten both U.S. and Mexican regional economies, water and food security, and aquatic biodiversity (Hoekstra et al. 2012). While a uni!ed view of the entire basin water system is needed, it is largely missing. In view of these issues, it is imperative that scientists collaborate to better understand the situation and assess plausible paths forward. This requires crossing national and state political boundaries, in addition to integrating knowledge across social, biophysical, economic, and engineering disciplines.Such transboundary-transdisciplinary scienti!c collaborations are exceedingly complex and challenging (Cundill et al. 2018; Mathieu et al. 2019; Steger et al. 2021).

It in... more This chapter synthesizes the asymmetrical violence on both sides of the U.S.–Mexico border. It includes open violence in Mexico, and hidden violence in the United States. By violence I mean both direct physical violence, including mental health, and so-called structural violence (Galtung 1969). The latter term includes reduction of human capacity caused by broader societal conditions. For example, U.S. refusals of asylum-seekers make them wait in places where violent criminals victimize them; the violence is done by the U.S. government as well as the criminals in Mexico. As Slack et al. (2018: 85–87) point out, so-called U.S. border “security” policy actually makesmany migrants insecure, to deadly effect. Here I build on that insight. I propose that it occurs through processes of hiding of violence in the United States and displacement of violence into Mexico. Both sides are thus implicated in violence. A central argument at the core of my work (Heyman 2017) has been that at the U.S.–Mexico border, safety and wealth accumulate on the U.S. side, and poverty, risk, and insecurity on the Mexican, but they constitute one dynamic whole. This unifying pattern of uneven and combined development (Smith 1984) cuts across specific phenomena: money, drugs, guns, migration, etc.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These articles focus on Latin American borders: the U.S.-Mexico border, the Brazil-Paraguay border, and the Argentina-Bolivia border. These Latin American scholars resist the top-down agenda of seeing threat in everything that has been illegalized, because as they show, many smuggled goods are normalized and present few risks and many benefits to civilians. Yet at the same time, they draw attention to the terrible levels of criminal and state violence that do occur around intensely illegalized commodities. They do not offer a solution, but they do offer insights for progress on this crucial question.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This essay is the first part of the book forum which engages with the ideas within Malini Sur’s book: “Jungle Passports: Fences, Mobility, and Citizenship at the North-East India-Bangladesh Border.”I write from a university on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border. For me, as for readers all over the world, there are valuable ideas and orientations in Jungle Passports. I think it likely that the dominant mental image of borders are rigid physical barriers against the protean human urge to move. There is considerable truth in this. This idea, however, renders borders essentially prohibitive, devices that aim to stop things from happening (migrating, shopping, socializing). But Sur, along with myself and other border scholars, find that borders are generative; beyond obstructing and prohibiting, they motivate important new movements and lifeways, or inflect already occurring peoples and processes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Hueco Bolson aquifer, which is bisected by the United States–Mexico border and where pumping far exceeds recharge, is an apt example. We conducted a binational, multisector, serious games workshop to explore collaborative solutions for extending the life of the shared aquifer. The value of the serious game workshop was building knowledge, interest, understanding, and constituency among critical stakeholders from both sides of the border. Participants also learned about negotiations and group decision-making while building mutual respect and trust. We did not achieve consensus, but a number of major outcomes emerged, including: (1) participants agreed that action is called for and that completely depleting the freshwater in the shared aquifer could be catastrophic to the region; (2) addressing depletion and prolonging the life of the aquifer will require binational action, because actions on only one side of the border is not enough; and (3) informal binational cooperation will be required to be successful. Agreeing that binational action is called for, the serious games intervention was an important next step toward improving management of this crucial binational resource.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Who is privileged – and thus mobile – will be an important social and political question. It might include capitalists and others of wealth, business managers needed for transnational production and trade (which will continue), wealthy tourists and consumers, some academics and maybe some students, and others of that sort. It will also include selected workers, often in managed labor migration programs. On the other hand, commodities and information will be free to move across borders, though they will be registered, tracked, and surveilled there. This seems to be a reversion to nationalist projects of the twentieth century, but the new order will differ in that borders are not aimed to separate and build national economies and polities, but rather to regulate more firmly differentiated and unequal but highly connected economies and societies in a global division of labor.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Is there a bilingual advantage?

It is a sensitive topic because of its relevance for language maintenance, and therefore, for the selective acculturation of immigrants in host societies. In this paper, the effect of non-English language fluency on the occupational attainment of immigrants and natives is analyzed, both in terms of occupational wages and socio-economic status. Results indicate that there is no advantage associated with non-English language fluency, either for natives or immigrants. Rather, a penalty for the specific case of Spanish fluency among immigrants was found. Three explanations from previous literature regarding the benefits of bilingualism in the labor market – human capital, devaluation and discrimination— are discussed in relation to the obtained results. The paper concludes with some recommendations about the recognition of language diversity in the labor market and policies aimed at the integrative acculturation of immigrants.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Bordering a "Crisis": Central American Asylum Seekers and the Reproduction of Dominant Border Enforcement Practicesby Jeremy Slack and Josiah HeymanJournal of the Southwest,  2018On June 5, 2014, the right-wing website Breitbart News released

The headline, “Leaked Photos Reveal ChildrenWarehoused in Crowded U.S. Cells, Border Patrol Overwhelmed,”demonstrates the role of contestation in shaping border policies. Thephotos show dirty cells, full of young children and women, often sleeping on the floor or with standing room only. While the surface messagewas apparently humanitarian, the evident agenda was to mobilize fearabout a migrant invasion at the U.S.-Mexico border (henceforth, the“border”). Although the source of the photos was anonymous, it musthave been taken by someone inside the Border Patrol or Immigrationand Customs Enforcement since photography is not allowed and fewpeople gain access to processing centers (hence, the term “leaked”).Reported by Brandon Darby, a controversial FBI informant who infiltrated the 2008 Republican National Convention and sent two protestors there to jail, the article has limited text, but asserts that “thousandsof illegal immigrants have overrun U.S. border security and their processing centers in Texas.” This publicity sparked an important turn tostrengthening border enforcement and provided a nationally significantpolitical symbol, both at the time and in the 2016 election. Understand ing the full impact of this event and the surrounding maelstrom ofhumanitarian and anti-immigrant responses to the increase in CentralAmerican refugee families requires a holistic and multiscalar analysis ofcontending actors and how they changed and reproduced that whichwe call the “border.”Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Limits of Critical Pedagogy: Teaching About Structural Obstacles to Students Who Overcame Themby Josiah Heyman and Aurolyn LuykxThis article focuses on efforts to critically analyze the social reproductive functions of school... more This article focuses on efforts to critically analyze the social reproductive functions of schooling with a group of pre-service teachers in the US–Mexico border region, and on students’ reactions to these efforts. The students – all female, predominantly Mexican-American – had experienced both educational discrimination and academic success, and heavily invested in the dominant view of schooling as a meritocracy where individual talent and motivation regularly overcome structural obstacles. We argue that the students’ ideologies and experi- ences of class, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and language predisposed them to resist analysis of systemic inequalities in schools; we also examine the implica- tions of this resistance for their future success as teachers. We conclude with recommendations for balancing structural pessimism and strategic optimism in the classroom, and for bringing students’ personal and social histories to bear on the contradictions between schooling’s promise of social mobility and its tendency to reproduce social inequality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, a process for comprehensive and integrative identification, classification, and engagement of all types of water stakeholders for a region or river basin, especially in a transboundary context, is missing for water resources research projects. Our objective was to develop a systematic approach to identifying and classifying water stakeholders, and engage them in a discussion of water futures, as a foundation for a participatory modeling research project to address the wicked water resource problems of the Middle Rio Grande basin on the U.S./Mexico border. This part of the Rio Grande basin can be characterized as having limited and dwindling supplies of water, increasing demands for water from multiple sectors, and a segmented governance system spanning two U.S. states and two countries.

Specific programs such as retinal scanning and vehicle preclearance are analyzed according to the differential effects they generate in terms of risk, rights and speed of movement. These differentiations suggest that individuals and groups will be identified in unequal ways, and that they will in turn experience their mobility differently. In the end, the analysis provided here adds complexity to current theorizations about citizenship and identity: it shows that while individuals make claims to new and different kinds of citizenship, state power also makes claims on individuals that do not always depend on citizenship. In view of the manifest inequalities resulting from the mobility control practices currently in use, rethinking of those practices is warranted, and an emphasis on shared burdens would be more productive.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A secondary analysis was conducted using data for 1,002 Hispanics from El Paso, TX (2009-2010). Logistic regression was conducted for financial barriers by number of chronic conditions and depression/anxiety diagnosis. Interaction models were conducted between number of chronic conditions and depression or anxiety. Depressed/anxious individuals reported more financial barriers than those with chronic conditions alone. There were significant interactions between number of chronic conditions and depression/anxiety for cost, denied treatment because of an inability to pay, and an inability to pay $25 for health care. Financial barriers should be considered to maintain optimal care for both mental and physical health in this population. There should be more focus on the impact of depression or anxiety as financial barriers to compliance.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Class in an abstract sense is the relationship through which labor is mobilized into specific relations of production, But the means through which such labor is categorized and mobilized is historically diverse, and includes nationality/citizenship, race, gender, class in a more superficial sense, and so forth. Thus, class in the setting of the U.S. southwest is enacted through race (Mexican/Anglo) and more recently nationality/immigration status (citizenship). This helps to understand empirical material that borderlanders (most but not all U.S.-side in origin) tend to merge their class understandings of the border into a discourse of labor and poverty being Mexican (as previously documented by Pablo Vila). Yet they do have some penetrations of deep class processes. The notion of a simultaneous view of abstract labor mobilization (abstract class) and empirical, social organization of such labor (surface inequalities) thus enriches the study of intersectionality and consciousness.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article survey... more ABSTRACT A pdf of this chapter is available by request to jmheyman@utep.edu . This article surveys political economy in anthropology with an emphasis on emerging developments and challenges. It looks at how political economy brings the analysis of power into anthropology, but how anthropological political economy also contributes and challenges to other approaches to power, such as Foucaultian perspectives. It argues that the anthropological concern with distinctive cultural frameworks and social relations is central to understanding fundamental political economic arrangements, and cannot be marginalized as addressing the minor, informal, local, complicated, and so forth. To do this, it urges us to revisit Marxist feminism, reproduction, and articulation of relations of production (and reproduction). It also links recent interest in consumption and political ecology to this social-cultural power core. It then asks how we can build from this anthropological core toward middle-range political economy typical of other disciplines, including states and corporations. In the process, it critically reviews the recent fascination with neoliberalism, suggesting that it may just be a recent phase of capitalism as such in which there has been an attack from above on subordinate social groups designed to shift increasing proportions of the social surplus toward the dominant classes. The chapter then considers the relationship of anthropological political economy, normative values, and social struggle, arguing for explicit dialogues over political-ethical values and a stringent self-critique of academic &amp;amp;quot;would be&amp;amp;quot; radicalism.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Political economy is the study of power in human affairs, including politics, economics, and ideology. Three border processes are examined in terms of these three elements. They are border crossing processes, border-reinforcing ones, and, a third category crucial to borders, uneven and combined relations. The latter involve both connections and also the maintenance or reinforcement of differentiation. The border is a subordinate region in the political economy of North America, though also a crucial point of production and exchange due to combined and uneven relations. This is explored through application of the concept of dependency to politics, economics, and ideas. Examples are taken from the domains of migration, smuggling, and industrialization, and the topic of regulated, unequal mobility is explored. Finally, the challenge and possibilities for social justice struggles of this highly unequal scenario of political economy are explored.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mexican Coal Mining Labor in Texas and Coahuila, 1880-1930 (review)Hahr Hispanic American Historical Review,  2002ABSTRACT Hispanic American Historical Review 82.1 (2002) 196-197 Coal mining lasted a short time ... more ABSTRACT Hispanic American Historical Review 82.1 (2002) 196-197 Coal mining lasted a short time in Texas, while Coahuila&amp;#39;s coal mines have endured far longer, stimulating the industrialization of northern Mexico. However, during the 1880-1930 period coal mining in the two states not only coexisted but was closely connected. The goal of this book is to unite histories usually rent asunder by the compartmentalization of scholarship into U.S. or Mexican, indeed North American or Latin American categories. Roberto Calderón succeeds convincingly in that endeavor. The major consumer of coal was railroads coursing through Texas and northern Mexico. (Coahuila coal was also good metallurgical coal while some Texas lignite deposits were used as heating fuel.) Because U.S. investors with Mexican allies developed these railroads and smelters, business networks were heavily interwoven across the international boundary. The mining engineers and their techniques were likewise much the same. Calderón thus offers a unified binational business history in the early chapters of the work. The bountifulness of cheap Mexican labor was one assumption shared by capitalists in both nations. Coahuila was completely staffed by Mexican workers, not surprisingly, but Texas presented a more complex stratification of social race, location, and labor markets. Border coal fields (in the Eagle Pass and Laredo areas) were overwhelmingly staffed by Mexicans and U.S. citizens of Mexican extraction, while the large northern coalfields around Thurber, Texas, combined Mexicans with a large pool of European immigrant and eastern U.S. coal laborers. The easterly lignite mines, being less lucrative and smaller in scale, employed Mexican migrant workers along with local white and black farm populations. Through careful marshalling of evidence from both nations, Calderón writes a unified labor and social history that spans the two sides of the border. This reinforces work by other scholars, including the present author, that suggests that prior to 1929 , we might best think of one single Mexican border working class facing the same arrangement of opportunities and racial-national discrimination in each society. After 1940 such a pattern does not disappear, but subsequent U.S. immigration and citizenship policies prevent it from being quite so cohesive and pervasive. Calderón critiques the racial prejudices of observers of the 1880-1930 era. In doing so, he dispels that epoch&amp;#39;s assumption that Mexicans were disorganized, passive, and grateful for their miserably paid work. He goes beyond the best-known unions and strikes (in this case, the UMWA in the Thurber area) to tease out the hints of collective organization among laborers in the U.S.-side border coalfields, making good use of Spanish-language newspapers. A particularly intriguing topic along the lines of self-determination is the constant churning of migrant miners through the Texas lignite belt, though by its nature this individualistic or small group response leaves only tiny traces. Little is said about labor in Mexico, however. The primary documentary work in Mexican Coal Mining Labor concerns the U.S.-side Rio Grande district coalfields. Unifying the Texas-Coahuila subject matter is an important accomplishment, but the reliance on secondary sources for northern Texas and especially for Coahuila was frustrating. One trusts that Calderón, who manifests evident capability, will continue to deepen and refine his historical labors. The writing is clear but rarely vivid. The book is both inherently limited in scope and packed with meticulous detail, and so is best suited for research and graduate-level work. In sum, the integrated Mexican-U.S. approach is admirable and will serve as an exemplar for future students of both nations&amp;#39; histories. Josiah Mcc.

We seek to investigate whether differences in lifetime mammography exist between Latina border residents by health insurance status and health care site (i.e., U.S. only or a combination of U.S. and Mexican health care). Using data from the 2009 to 2010 Ecological Household Study on Latino Border Residents, mammography screening was examined among (n = 304) Latinas &gt;40 years old. While more acculturated women were significantly (p &lt; .05) more likely to report ever having a mammogram than less acculturated women, ever having a mammogram was not predicted by health care site or insurance status. Latinas who utilize multiple systems of care have lower levels of acculturation and health insurance, thus representing an especially vulnerable population for experiencing disparities in mammography screening.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Guns, Drugs, and Money: Tackling the Real Threats to Border SecurityABSTRACT Link: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/Heyman_-_Drugs_Guns_and_... more ABSTRACT Link: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/Heyman_-_Drugs_Guns_and_Money_091211.pdf The external borders of the United States matter to security, but how and in what ways is neither automatic nor obvious. The current assumption is that borders defend the national interior against all harms, which are understood as consistently coming from outside—and that security is always obtained in the same way, whatever the issue. Some security policies correctly use borders as tools to increase safety, but border policy does not protect us from all harms. The 9/11 terrorists came through airports with visas, thus crossing a border inspection system without being stopped. They did not cross the U.S.-Mexico border. Future terrorists would not necessarily cross a land border. U.S. citizens and residents, and nationals of Western Europe, also represent an important element of the terrorist threat, and they have unimpeded or easy passage through U.S. borders. Fortified borders cannot protect us from all security threats or sources of harm. Moreover, not all border crossers pose security concerns, even ones who violate national laws. The hundreds of thousands of unauthorized migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border each year have not posed a threat of political terrorism, and external terrorists have not traveled through this border. Enforcement of laws against unauthorized immigration is, in the vast majority of cases, a resource- and attention-wasting distraction from sensible national security measures. That does not mean the U.S.-Mexico border is free from risk of harm, such as increasingly violent drug trafficking organizations operating nearby in Mexico. But that issue needs to be addressed in different ways than current enforcement policy does.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
