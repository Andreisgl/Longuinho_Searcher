Part A, Ecological and integrative physiologyOne principle threat prompting the worldwide decline of amphibians is the introduction of nonindigenous amphibians. The African Clawed Frog, Xenopus laevis, is now one of the widest distributed amphibians occurring on four continents with ongoing range expansion including large parts of Europe. Species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools to predict the invasive risk of these species. Previous efforts have focused on correlative approaches but these can be vulnerable to extrapolation errors when projecting species&#39; distributions in nonnative ranges. Recent developments emphasise more robust process-based models, which use physiological data like critical thermal limits and performance, or hybrid models using both approaches. Previous correlative SDMs predict different patterns in the potential future distribution of X. laevis in Europe, but it is likely that these models do not assess its full invasive potential. Based on physiological performance trials, we calculate ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Experimental BiologyProgeny of Xenopus laevis from altitudinal extremes display adaptive physiological performanceNatasha  KrugerEnvironmental temperature variation generates adaptive phenotypic differentiation in widespread populations. We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (∼2000 m above sea level) and low (∼ 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (Topt) had a &gt;9°C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0°C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5°C; cross-bred, 25.9°C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8±0.8°C) than pure-b...Download Free PDFView PDFIntegrative and Comparative BiologyRapid Shifts in the Temperature Dependence of Locomotor Performance in an Invasive Frog, Xenopus laevis, Implications for ConservationJulien  CourantTemperature is a critical abiotic factor impacting all aspects of the biology of organisms, especially in ectotherms. As such, it is an important determinant of the potential invasive ability of organisms and may limit population expansion unless organisms can physiologically respond to changes in temperature either through plasticity or by adapting to their novel environment. Here, we studied the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, which has become invasive on a global scale. We compared adults from an invasive population of western France with individuals from two populations in the native range in South Africa. We measured the thermal dependence of locomotor performance in adults given its relevance to dispersal, predator escape, and prey capture. Our results show significant differences in the limits of the 80% performance breadth interval for endurance with the French population showing a left shift in its limits congruent with the colder climate experienced in France.

They flee when they detect an attacker, and if captured, they vigorously struggle to evade. They spin their body, while spraying the foe with a malodorous mixture of cloacal content and cloacal gland secretions. Ultimately, dice snakes can switch to death-feigning (DF, thanatosis), i.e. tonic immobility in inverted position; usually opening their mouth, protruding their tongue, and sometimes producing bubbles with blood and saliva. However DF is a dangerous option since vital organs, like the liver, are exposed to the predator. We examined antipredator behaviors triggered by human observers, comparing capture-induced DF among five populations. DF prevalence ranged from 6.4% to 31.5%, probably due to different local predator pressures. We found no effects of dorsal coloration pattern or sex on DF frequencies. In Golem Grad population, a large sample (N=1,909) showed that DF frequency increased with body size. This might indicate to protective effect of DF from gape-limited predators. DF was three times less frequent in gravid than in non-gravid females. In another experiment we compared duration of DF in water and on land, after half a minute long standardized manipulation. Snakes released in container with water significantly decreased DF duration comparing to those released on land. Overall, different factors influence the occurrence and duration of DF, suggesting that this “desperate” attempt is under selection.Download Free PDFView PDFMeasey_et_al_2012_BiolInvFrancesco LilloDownload Free PDFView PDFHistorical Perspectives on Global Exports and Research of African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis)lance van sittertDownload Free PDFView PDFPeerJUnequal contribution of native South African phylogeographic lineages to the invasion of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis , in Europe2016 • Thierry BackeljauDue to both deliberate and accidental introductions, invasive African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis) populations have become established worldwide. In this study, we investigate the geographic origins of invasiveX. laevispopulations in France and Portugal using the phylogeographic structure ofX. laevisin its native South African range. In total, 80 individuals from the whole area known to be invaded in France and Portugal were analysed for two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, allowing a comparison with 185 specimens from the native range. Our results show that native phylogeographic lineages have contributed differently to invasive EuropeanX. laevispopulations. In Portugal, genetic and historical data suggest a single colonization event involving a small number of individuals from the south-western Cape region in South Africa. In contrast, French invasiveX. laevisencompass two distinct native phylogeographic lineages, i.e., one from the south-western Cape region and one from the...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
