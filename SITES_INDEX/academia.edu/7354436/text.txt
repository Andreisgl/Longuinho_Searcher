Research findings on typical applications of HSMs have been summarized in this paper, namely liquid-liquid emulsification, solid-liquid suspension and chemical reactions, with an emphasis on the emulsification due to relatively intensive research in this area. The design and control of HSMs as chemical reactors need comprehensive knowledge of both the reactions kinetics and the HSMs hydrodynamics. Therefore, hydrodynamics of HSMs in terms of power draw, flow pattern and energy dissipation are then particularly reviewed from both experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Limited reports on the mass and heat transfer properties in HSMs are also introduced to demonstrate their potential applicability to intensify chemical reaction processes.

Chem. Eng. J., 162 (2010) 7 92-801), this part is a straight continuation and extension of the earlier work. The predictive c apabilities of the used population balance equation model are increased for single stage impel lers and transferred to scale-up procedures of such applications. Therefore different scale-up r les for liquid-liquid systems are tested experimentally and by simulations in two different sized, geometrically similar vessels. The multi stage impellers are tested against comparable single stage impellers in terms of power consumption, mixing time and minimum impeller speed . Especially for high aspect ratios (larger than three), multi stage impellers successf ully compete with the single stage ones. The measured drop size distributions in slim reactor...Download Free PDFView PDFStirred Slim Reactors – Part I: Single Stage Impellers2010 • Sebastian MaaßAlthough investigations in the field of stirred liquid/liquid dispersions have a long history, new questions are still emerging in dealing with the different aspects of industrial applications, such as suspension polymerizations. In this study the influence of physical parameters on drop size and power consumption, like liquid level, stirrer speed, stirrer height and baffle length, were experimentally analyzed. The results were used to determine modeling approaches which are capable of displaying the influence of the named parameters. It was shown that the energy law (dP  ε[1]) using the average energy dissipation only roughly predicts the Sauter mean diameter. The population balance equation (PBE) used with a onezone modeling approach is slightly better in its prediction of results. Very satisfying predictions were obtained by using the PBE with a two-zone model. The overall deviations between calculated and predicted Sauter mean diameter was less than ten percent using this appro...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Chemical EngineeringAdvances in Mixing Technology: Recent Advances in Mixing Research and Development2012 • Shaliza IbrahimMixing has been one of essential unit operations for chemical engineering processes. Among a number of mixers, stirred tanks that are available in a wide variety of tank sizes and impeller shapes are the most frequently adopted to homogenize different substances and to conduct chemical reactions in industrial chemical processes. In addition, there are various technologies for fluid mixing: static mixer, micromixer, unsteady agitation, eccentric agitation, and so on. Recently in various industrial processes, a wide range of operation for stirred tank is required depending on purposes and conditions, and high efficiency on mixing has been strongly required. In addition, the techniques of computer simulation analyses by the use of CFD software have been dramatically developed, which is essential to analyze the mixing mechanism. The main goal of this special issue was to gather contributions dealing with the latest breakthrough of mixing techniques. There is a collection of twelve papers in this special issue focused on mixing fundamental (2 papers), multiphase mixing (3 papers), chemical reactive mixing for metallurgical industry, and biotechnology (4 papers), and new technology of mixing (3 papers) ranging in topic from laminar-to-turbulent mixing by means of both experimental analyses and numerical simulations. The highlights of each paper are introduced as follows. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijce/2012/316891/Download Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering JournalMicro-reactor mixing unit interspacing for fast liquid-liquid reactions leading to a generalized scale-up methodology2018 • Eric MielkeDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
