Kate  McLardyMonash University,  Centre for Archaeology, Ancient History and Classics,  PhD CandidateClassics+12My primary research interest is women's festivals in the ancient Graeco-Roman world, with a focus on the Thesmophoria and the Adonia.less30 Followers12 Following3 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall9 Conference Presentations1 Books1 Edited Books Conference PresentationsThesmophorian Influences in Rome: One, Two or Three Festivals?The Thesmophoria was the pre-eminent women’s festival in Greece, and was celebrated widely to the... more The Thesmophoria was the pre-eminent women’s festival in Greece, and was celebrated widely to the furthest reaches of the Greek world. A festival of fertility in honour of the Thesmophorian goddesses, Demeter and Kore, the extant ancient source material is predominantly in Greek. It was, however, certainly known to Roman authors, and is mentioned in a small number of Latin sources, including Pliny the Elder.  This paper will investigate whether there is any evidence that the Thesmophoria was ever celebrated in Rome under its Greek form. It will also investigate two festivals that modern scholarship has theorised may have been derived from the Thesmophoria, reimagined for a Roman context: the festival for the Bona Dea, and the annual festival of Ceres. Focusing on the evidence for interrelations between these two festivals and the Thesmophoria, I will argue that the similarities are not superficial, and represent a strong influence by the Thesmophoria on both of these festivals. I will also discuss the reason why there might have been multiple festivals influenced by the Thesmophoria co-existing in Rome. Through a consideration of the chronological and geographical provenance of the evidence for each of these festivals, I will show that these two factors may have been the cause of the apparent duplication of Thesmophoria-like festivals in Rome.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the past, research has not focused in this direction, accepting the existence of such effigies as a given without further investigation as to their role and their appearance. This paper will examine the evidence for effigies in the worship of Adonis and Tammuz/Dumuzi. These effigies were associated with the cult and festivals of such deities over a sustained period of time, and over a wide geographical area.  I intend to discuss to what extent it is possible to define the appearance and the composition of these effigies in their various incarnations, given the available evidence. In addition, I will consider the purpose of these effigies, and whether these effigies had analogous or disparate purposes within the contexts of the respective cults with which they were associated.  By so doing, I hope to contribute to the discussion about religious syncretism and cultural influences within the context of ancient women’s ritual, and to steer this discussion in a new direction with a focus on the development and adaptation of the Adonia festival to the needs of the local communities who celebrated it.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Sicilian Thesmophoria: A Unique Example of a Classical Festival?The importance of Kore-Persephone in the region of Sicily during the Classical Period is well att... more The importance of Kore-Persephone in the region of Sicily during the Classical Period is well attested, and there are many literary references linking her mythologically to the region. Amongst the many locations competing for the site of the rape of Persephone, Sicily is a popular contender in ancient source material. Given her important links to Sicily, it would be expected that the Thesmophoria festival, held around the Greek world in honour of Demeter and Kore-Persephone and itself closely linked into the myth of the rape, would have been celebrated in Sicily. In this paper, I wish to consider the evidence for the Thesmophoria festival in Sicily, and whether this indicates a significant divergence from the standard scholarly reconstruction of the festival, which is based primarily on Athenian evidence. Following a consideration of the evidence for the worship of Demeter and Kore Thesmophoros in Sicily and Southern Italy, I intend to focus on the two main points where the literary evidence indicates a disparity between the Sicilian and Athenian festivals; that is, the length of the festival, and the shape of the aidoia cakes offered to the goddesses. The literary evidence will be adumbrated, and archaeological evidence and evidence of the festival from elsewhere in the Greek world will also be taken into account. In so doing, I hope to establish whether modern scholarship has overemphasised the importance of the Athenian model or whether the Sicilian Thesmophoria was indeed a unique version of the widespread festival.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Identity of Isis in the Graeco-Roman World: Immutable or Mercurial?The goddess Isis commanded widespread worship and devotion throughout the ancient world. The iden... more The goddess Isis commanded widespread worship and devotion throughout the ancient world. The identity of Isis provides examples of both continuity and change when she leaves the solely Egyptian sphere and spreads throughout the Graeco-Roman world, interacting with, and being changed by, other divine figures. In this paper, I will investigate, with reference to a number of local incarnations of Isis throughout the Graeco-Roman world, whether some parts of her identity were immutable. In this way, it will be hoped to shed some light on the vexing issue of whether Isis was always considered a ‘foreign’ goddess by the Romans, or whether she had become a Roman goddess – a point on which ancient literary source are conflicted. The identification of Isis worship is a complicated undertaking, and often fraught with difficulties. Therefore, the focus of this paper will be on iconographic representations of Isis, and the way in which these can be used to demonstrate continuity and change in her identity throughout the Graeco-Roman world. Through looking at examples of how Isis was depicted in various time periods and geographical locations, potential changes in the identity of Isis can be contemplated.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A close examination of his works, including not only the Alice in Wonderland books but also his other novels, poetry, riddles, short stories, articles and personal letters, will reveal a plethora of Classical allusions which indicate at the very least an extensive general knowledge, and may indicate a deep and abiding interest in the Classical world. From philosophy, to language, to folklore and to drama, Lewis Carroll reveals flashes of Classical knowledge intertwined into the very fabric of his nonsense worlds. Some of these allusions are well known, but this paper seeks firstly to identify some more obscure examples. It also seeks to consider the effect that Lewis Carroll’s upbringing and early education had in engendering such a strong knowledge of the Classics, and to establish that Lewis Carroll’s knowledge of the Classics is indicative of both a continuing personal interest in the Classics throughout his adult life, and a personal belief that the Classics were an important facet of a good education.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The terminology used by modern scholars to describe the interactions between Roman and local divinities is in desperate need of a reassessment. Terms such as assimilation and syncretism, as well as romanisation more generally, have been the source of much controversy in recent years; solutions range from complete abolition of such terms to denying the existence of a terminological problem at all. This paper seeks to discuss the background of the controversy regarding the terms assimilation, syncretism and romanisation. It will incorporate not just the viewpoints of Classical scholars, but also other strands of the debate, notably the ideas of historians of religions. In so doing, consideration will be given to whether these terms can serve a useful purpose in  modern academic literature. If these terms are no longer appropriate, the question must be asked with what can they be replaced, and this will be considered. Although this is a debate in which a scholarly consensus has not yet be forthcoming, it is important to bring to light the difficulties inherent in the use of these terms, lest careless use bring even greater confusion to the subject.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper surveys the funerary inscriptions of the priestesses of the Cereres to reconstruct elements of the cult. My aim is to establish whether the Thesmophoroi were significantly altered through their conversion to the Cereres.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The focus has traditionally been on the Classical period, albeit with an acknowledgement that the festival probably continued to be celebrated well into the Roman era. My Honours thesis investigates, through a survey of material culture and literary sources, the continuation of this festival in various areas of the Hellenistic and Roman worlds. More specifically, this paper will be presenting three local festivals that share similarities with the Greek Thesmophoria: the Demetria festival celebrated in Egypt (during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), the festival for the Bona Dea and the annual festival of Ceres in Rome. The evidence clearly shows that the Thesmophoria was not only still practiced during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but that it was still being instituted in new cities such as Alexandria. In Egypt and in the festival of Ceres at Rome, the Thesmophoria appears to remain relatively unaffected by the contact with the local cultures and to have retained its particularly Greek characteristics. Conversely, the festival held in honour of the Bona Dea in Rome, while showing close similarities to the Greek Thesmophoria, is a clear example of the process of assimilation of Greek and local customs.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
