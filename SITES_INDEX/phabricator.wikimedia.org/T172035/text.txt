This was done once, when be-x-old.wikipedia.org was renamed to be-tarask.wikipedia.org, but this renaming exposed several issues. Performing any more renaming is not advised until these issues are resolved. This task tracks these issues.

I also believe that the community at both nowiki and nnwiki will accept an intercept of page requests for th no-domain a few years into the future, with a manual rerouting of the request to a nn- or nb-domain.

What other project decides to do I have no strong opinion on.
Slightly of-topic: @jeblad claims " the nowiki community would probably accept a move if old URLs will work for some time. ". This subject has been up many times and no, there is no consensus of moving the project to another language code. (See the last round here https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avstemninger/Prefiks  vote 85 to keep no versus 39 to move to nb).
Remember no.wikipedia.org covers the Norwegian language and since 2005* it has been covering two norms including some 90 % of the usage of Norwegian; bokmål as normed by Språkrådet (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Council_of_Norway) and riksmål, the de facto standard most norwegians follow as normed by Det norske akademi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Academy_for_Language_and_Literature).  We cover the Norwegian language at no.wikipedia.org, and in respect to the nn.wikipedia.org that left us in 2004 or something we do not write nynorsk.
The language situation in Norway is complex and has been a big fighting ground for 100 year. We have a stable situation on the project and it's pity that this has again come up as an issue. We should be writing articles and make no.wikipedia.org better, not handling unneccessary noise like this.
If someone will start a nb.wikipedia.org I suppose that is up to the Foundation to accept. But no.wikipedia.org stays at no.wikipedia.org (until eventually Foundation make a board case on it and force move us to nb. (since they are the owners of the domains)).
Remember there are a lot of reasons why we should not move:

Liuxinyu970226 added a subscriber: Mdennis-WMF.Edited · Oct 8 2017, 12:33 AM2017-10-08 00:33:50 (UTC+0)Comment Actions@Nsaa To answer your list of common aganist reasons, I worked hard on analysing ICANN, IETF, IEEE, ITU, ... resources in the past 8 days, and now (I removed your ref tags since those are shown U+FFFD characters on my browser):
'External links' – nowiki has established a great value of links that link to the page. At present it is up to 1.3 million such links. How will we get external stakeholders to update over 1,300,000 link to us with Yahoo containing no.wikipedia.org?
Maybe this would be a bug regarding SEO.
'Brand' no.wikipedia.org – NO domain coincides with the country code no, and that no has been in use since this wiki was created. Thus, it is advantageous to retain the familiar prefix no, that all Norwegian speakers have a relationship with, versus the totally unknown nb, who barely the most educated language people know.
Again, we use ISO 639, not ISO 3166, are we discussing the SAME ISO standard? "it is advantageous to retain the familiar prefix no" So again that nowikibooks, nowikinews, nowikisource, and potential nowikivoyage are bokmål only?
'Visibility' – All links from articles on no.wikipedia.org will no longer count as much for Google's PageRank algorithm (one can assume) if you do not 'permanent' add correctly redirectkoder the .com domain. The proposal allows for 'remove 301 redirect' after 5 years.
'Visibility and value' – 'Britannica boss' Jorge Cauze say the following on Wikipedia If I were to be the CEO of Google or the Founders of Google I would ask very [displeased] That the best search engine in the world continues two provideh as a first link, Wikipedia,
by those reasons, you're still opposing ALL Wiki-Setup (renaming) requests, and what's the reality of ".com"? How is that important?
'Index and traffic figures' . A switch will 'reduce the main page's importance' . At present, the traffic was 57 & nbsp; 694 hits, it amounts to 5.04 & nbsp;% of traffic on nowiki. Traffic on nnwikis index is pr. Day 1 & nbsp; 496 hits, it amounts to 1.37 & nbsp;% of traffic on nn. Sources: Source nn (archive nn 2009-01-26) source en (archive en 2009-01-26)
This looks rather like a bug (hence ask SEO) than a good argument
'Uncertainty' – Likewise, we have no control over what other search engines and others who follow links do with this kind of redirects and to what extent this has a negative effect.
'Uncertainty' – there is no agreement on what one possibly to do with .no domain afterwards, ergo it is inherent in a great danger that external links will no longer pointing directly to our articles and main compartment.
still, the macrolanguage problem, I believe Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian could also have such problems...
'Brand' – no domain is built up throughout the Norwegian speaking population consciousness as the site of Wikipedia in bokmål and riksmål.
Still, you still still and still not provided which articles are examples on the de facto nowiki which are writting in riksmål, only provided two enwiki articles that about orthography which are nonsense under reviewing resources criteria.
'Technical' – That it is technically a not insignificant job to implement (many bots must clean incredible amounts, one must set things up properly by developers on Wikipedia's servers – we'll use these scarce resources to such policy changes like this?).
I don't believe that you can't search what @Krenair said many times before, the only "hard" thing is renaming database names which is no longer a topic of this, but T83609
'Bias of bokmål / riksmål' – indirectly proposal an attempt to impartiality in distributing languages ​​printed on no (bokmål and riksmål), a language used mainly by the vast majority (In a survey with a sample of over 4,000 people came forward with the following "7.5 % responded that they write only nynorsk, 5.5% that they write about the same amount in both language variants, and 86.3% that they write riksmål / bokmål "oNLY 7 , 5% nyNorsk ( archived 2009-01-09 ). Bottom line then it's over 90% of the population of writing that uses bokmål / riksmål to put that in perspective). It will be quite discriminatory to destroy all the value created on no.domenet already at a relocation simply because a driver with semantic argument that also no-ISO code comprises the entire riksmål.
Now you claim that most nowiki articles can also be considered as riksmål, and bokmål is just riksmål, with those "resources".
'For all eternity .no domain is unusable for other purposes' – With a permanent relocation by. En:301 Redirect avoids possibly some of the problems with external links, but it will make no.wikipedia.org domain busy forever.
But if without renaming domain, the nb.wiki* can be permanently one of 404/405/504, how is 301 a big problem than those three? Just count the number of error codes here.
'ISO code no is more correct than nb for this wiki' – Officially Bokmål is normed by no:Språkrådet, while riksmål normed of no:Det Norske Akademi for Sprog og Litteratur. In ISO description of nb says bokmål and riksmål is not defined in this. no covers the Norwegian language and are therefore both national target and on Bokmål under no-ISO code, but not directly under nb-ISO code, at least not name terms. Thus riksmål and moderate bokmål (since this is not used by the Official Languages ​​Council sticks to radical forms) will be an immeasurably [ http://www.ordnett.no/ordbok.html?search=forfordele&search_type=&publications=23 (in meaning 1)] by moving from uk to nb.
By this claim, I could say that Persian is just Persian, not Dari, no dialects problems, btw an ask.com discussion (I missed the entire URL of it) says that in sometime, the "no" can also contain series of Sami languages, so if you'd love to keep no.wiki*, please include Sami just in those no.*, not creating those on Incubator, Okay?!
'Wikimedia should not not make a change, which entails serious consequences just to satisfy a small minority' – The move does not apply to equate two equal languages. We're not Wikipedia for Norway, but Wikipedia in Norwegian (bokmål, nynorsk, riksmål others). Here we are not official bias of language. 90% of the population uses bokmål/riksmål and then mainly the moderate form. Thus the argument that no recording a domain which should also cover nynorsk correct, but weak. There are many varieties of German, but they just follow the new orthography (not Low German, Swiss German, Austrian German etc.). I think I see that dewiki being accused of discriminating against them.
"not not" = just do it, and please be aware that Swiss German has dialects too, and alswiki contain 4 of em. It would be in case that eswiki will face-to-face dialects of es in many countries problems by the same claim (still, which dialect/orthography the Spanish-Sites are following?).
'Definition Power' – The impact of vertical search engines: The 'relative position' to nn will be improved (ergo choose people nn articles instead nb article to a greater extent). Thus acquires nn more of definition power (Is it called the no:Vedavågen or Veavågen mm)
still, the SEO bugs
(added after poll) 'External links on paper'. There is no one who knows how many (permanent) links that are currently operating pressure and after the proposed five-year period will no longer pointing to that content.
(added after poll) 'External links to papers. By a shift will no longer (permament) links be like. After five years they will probably not pointing to the correct content. This is unfortunate set in an academic perspective (hampers reference check).
copied from my T172035#3613648 above
regarding fix codes on paper materials, I would suggest to get help from some (mainly) Chinese-made stuffs "Correction Tapes (修正带)" or "Correction Fluid (涂改液)"
or just, as deryck said above, doesn't concern the vast majority of requests, because you can just re-print them after domain renaming, only waste a little of inks in ink cartridge/selenium in toner cartridge.
(added after poll, 2011-08-14) 'ownership' to no.wikipedia.org gained by everyone who has helped in no.wikipedia.org on the articles per currently exist. Each of the users has mixed his work into these articles and it will in practice mean that every one of all the user needs to be requested and accepting delivery of this landed right. Presumably, only a Board decision in Wikimedia Foundation that can move the project since it is they who own the domain formally.
@Mdennis-WMF is this really? there's holds up from WMF bords?
(added after poll, 2011-08-14) 'W3C' strongly recommend that you do 'NOT' modify URLs.
W3C also suggests to let browsers support Audio track selection, (likely Video-), MPED-4 ASP, H.265 (surveillance-controller?)... but how are those must be supported on nowadays market-of-browsers?
On the other hand, IETF RFC 1035 implied to suggest to rename that in a necessary period.
(added after poll, 2011-08-14) Adding riksmål under bokmål is very wrong when bokmål covers almost the entire Norwegian written language, even the many nynorsk forms. Riksmål has a unique hundred year history with many of the leading cultural porters of the Norwegian language. To illustrate how remote on Bokmål may be from riksmål we can take this example
You said many times that nowiki articles are riksmål but now you say the opposite to YOUR SELF, psst.deryckchan added a comment.Oct 8 2017, 12:14 PM2017-10-08 12:14:26 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsPlease continue discussions about the merits of renaming particular

If that is possible, then we don't need this task, we can just rename those wikis, even that results a large number of database conflicts.
and then deal with whatever bugs that would appear after the renaming is to be done?
(the main topic of this task)

So if we don't work on those tasks before e.g. 2050, then which "broken" is much more inappropriate to you?

I was suggesting that as an alternate way of T25216, but @Verdy_p doesn't agree it, and still suggests to do somethings on CNAME (which is also stucked per T133548).Verdy_p added a comment.Dec 9 2017, 4:16 PM2017-12-09 16:16:47 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsT133548 is about certificates for HTTPS. if we create a CNAME of a subdomain project to another subdomain, it should have no impact if the certificate allows not just specific subdomains but its parent domain (e.g. wikipedia.org): there are hundreds of subdomains and having one certificate for each one is costly.
But may be there are reasons I don't know why you don't want to use "wildcards" for allowing all subdomains (e.g you have subdomains actually delegated and managed by third parties on their own servers and administrators, but inb my opinion they should not be within *.wikipedia.org but only in *.wikimedia.org; or you want to create distinct subsets of authoritative DNS for several languages for managing the deployments in your server farms, or for legal reasons if some wikipedias follow different copyright policies and need separate trustships with separate certificates or for international issues with some countries that want to block some subdomains)
But may be you could then renew just each certificate by including in them both the old CNAME'd subdomain and the new one. Finally you may not want CNAMEs if they cause issues in your front caching proxies (duplicate cache storage for actually the same page from two distinct subdomains).
Another reason is possibly the configuration of your webservers not accepting different "Host:" in HTTP/HTTPS requests, as your servers actually are used to host multiple virtual web servers and need it to know which site to render.
The advante of CNAME is that it does not force clients to perform sucessive requests to follow a redirect (by HTTP result code at best, or by Javascript at worst): How were subdomains renamed and aliased in the past ?
I'm just curious why then T133548 is blocking also the CNAME aliasing.C933103 added a comment.Edited · Dec 9 2017, 5:02 PM2017-12-09 17:02:51 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsAs mentioned by others, it've been almost a decade since the issue was raised

(There are no workable MTL for yue/nan/etc anyway so CX serve little purpose there, so it's probably only as important as any random widget, but I can't speak for others about the priority on which is more important.) The langlink query things seem to affect more things but its impact can only be determined based on the progress of further increase in reliance on wikidata.

But it has also disadvante, at least that method will still blocks creation of Narom contents under the formal Wp/nrm/*, and so we have to "setup a temporary code" which is at least I don't wanna see. (Please, believe me, until we could have time to do FULLY exporting-and-importing db dumps from nrmwiki dbname to nrfwiki dbname ON THE ACTUAL Machine of s3 we don't yet know how to unlock it, as we don't have a whitelist way of WikimediaIncubator.class.php;c34aeead7cadeedf906247512ea76ec6eacba73a$386.)Verdy_p added a comment.Edited · Dec 15 2017, 2:47 PM2017-12-15 14:47:34 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsNarom is another unrelated problem: "nrm" was an incorrect code for Norman and no aliasing between "nrm" and "nrf" should be kept if we want to have Narom contents.
So it's impossible to preserve the links to Norman contents except transitionally (but this must have an end).
Of course "nrm" must be completely freed to leave space to Narom (however we've still not seen for now any interested community in creating contents for Narom)
And subdomains is not really a blocker for creating contents in Incubator (where the language would only be a path).
All past contents on Incubator for Norman (previously using "nrm") can very easily moved to "nrf". The issue is elsewhere: in templates still assuming "nrm" means Norman, in interwiki links, in Wikidata, and in Translatewiki.net: these must all be changed to free the incorrect "nrm" code they use or assume. And this work cannot be made only by Norman contributors (who don't care about Narom) or by Narom contributors (who don't care about Norman): it has to be done administratively (after approval by the language comity) and taken by contributors in any Wikimedia projects working proactively for this cleanup.
As long as we don't do that, the only way to create Narom contents in Incubator (or later for a localized wiki) will be to use a private use code (such as "x-narom"), meaning that Narom will not be considered a plain language equal to others even if it has equal treatment in ISO 639-3. Such private use code may be acceptable in Incubator (Wp/x-narom, but there may be issues with Incubator templates to recognize it as a valid language code), but certainly not for a localized wiki project and also not for preparing the core UI translations needed in Translatewiki.net that will be needed first before a Wp project is created (and it would not avoid the later needed renaming to use the standard code).
Note: there's an alternative: ISO 639 approved the "nrm" code for Narom but as far as I know it has never been really used. Narom could be alllocated by ISO another distinctive ISO 639-3 code and could then deprecate "nrm" (this has already occured for other languages). If "nrm" is deprecated, then it could remain associated to Norman in Wikimedia (note that "nrf" is really a language code assigned for Continental Normal, and not the 3 major variants for France, Jersey, Guernsey, and Jersey may also requests its own distinctive code for its official language; in that case "nrm" would a legacy macrolanguage, but deprecated, and another standard code could be assigned to the new macrolanguage, leacing "nrm" deprecated and used privately by Wikimedia).
However Wikimedia should not pressure the ISO wroking group like this: it has to do its own local job for cleaning up the situation. For now the use of "nrm" as a subdomain for Norman is conforming (subdomains are not restricted to be language codes) just like the Wikimedia interwiki prefixes. But we know that these Wikimedia interwiki prefixes and domain name labels are not always language codes (e.g. "simple" would then be "en-x-simple" if Wikimedia really conformed to BCP47 standard for these interwiki prefixes and domain names for its own localization purposes).Liuxinyu970226 added a comment.Edited · Jan 18 2018, 1:13 PM2018-01-18 13:13:37 (UTC+0)Comment Actions@Verdy_p
Narom is another unrelated problem
It is the same problem, that you still suggesting a "temporary deprecation", which won't help that Incubator link either
All past contents on Incubator for Norman (previously using "nrm") can very easily moved to "nrf"... in Wikidata, and in Translatewiki.net: these must all be changed to free the incorrect "nrm" code they use or assume.
So leave SIL page as just "Guernésiais"+"Jèrriais" and without "Norman"? How is there having benefit to play double standard game?
meaning that Narom will not be considered a plain language equal to others
Then why don't you consider creating separated wikis for Guernésiais as nrf-gg.wikipedia.org and Jèrriais as nrf-je.wikipedia.org? Still, you're "double standard"ing
ISO 639 approved the "nrm" code for Narom but as far as I know it has never been really used.
Then which language https://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wt/nrm/fa%CA%94 is using?
Narom could be alllocated by ISO another distinctive ISO 639-3 code and could then deprecate "nrm" (this has already occured for other languages).
Changing the ISO codes themselves are simply impossible, if those can even be possible, then we can ask for re-assigning the Wawa (www) to e.g. wwe, so we have no problem between the potential different usages of "www" (but then you have to try distinguishing between World Wrestling Entertainment and Wawa).
If "nrm" is deprecated, then it could remain associated to Norman in Wikimedia (note that "nrf" is really a language code assigned for Continental Normal, and not the 3 major variants for France, Jersey, Guernsey, and Jersey may also requests its own distinctive code for its official language; in that case "nrm" would a legacy macrolanguage, but deprecated, and another standard code could be assigned to the new macrolanguage, leacing "nrm" deprecated and used privately by Wikimedia).
Jèrriais - Language Status: 8a (Moribund) < Narom - Language Status: 6b (Threatened). Still a good comment?
However Wikimedia should not pressure the ISO wroking group like this

[neutrality is disputed] [vague] and [needs update]*"
Your comment is evern more dubious and with completely unnecessary
questions. There's absolutely no dispute about my affirmation except by
you. You seam to not know at all what is a subdomain (initially they have
NEVER been created to be used for language/locale codes, they are just a
hierarchy of labels assigned by separate authorities managing their own
local zone with their own local rules).
They're just labels conforming to the DNS system but can be quite arbitrary
(depending only on registry rules for specific zones, but within each
domain in a zone, each domain owner does what he wants, and so does the
Wikimedia foundation with its own domains. There was not even any
requirement to use any subdomain to create separate wikis, this could as
well have been paths (or parameters in a query string, but more complex to
manage for users). Even Wikimedia Incubator does not need an subdomain, it
uses paths instead (Incubator has enabled Wikis "subpages" to do that at
start of the path, and Meta or Commons are also doing that for pages
created with the translation tool). So where you put the code in an URL is
not relevant at all.
Even "www" is NOT restricted to mean "World Wide Web", it's jsut a common
convention (but now many sites do not even use it or need it). Beside
"www.*" in their domain name, they assign various subdomains for unrelated
things such as "secure.*", "ads.*", "pub.*", "admin*.", "store.*", "buy.*",
"tv.*", "video.*", "mail.*", "int.*" (for some "intranet"), "private.*",
"dns.*", "stats.*", "order.*", "dev.*", "auth.*", "login.*", "map.*",
"to.*" (for redirectors)... some ot them may look like language/locale
codes but are not.
The only relevant question is which language/locale code we must use and
how we can conform to the BCP 47 standard and allow interoperating with
other languages on all wikis to fond documents written in a relavant
language (for now Wikiemdia has not been able to define any standard, and
in fact the situation is more compelx because we handle the case of
multiple languages (including the case of translations hosted on specific
wikis having different default languages, and pages that embed multilingual
contents, or pages with subpages edited separately for specific languages).Liuxinyu970226 added a comment.Jan 22 2018, 4:30 AM2018-01-22 04:30:49 (UTC+0)Comment Actions@Verdy_p then how do you consider informations on Ethnologue, which points that Jèrriais has more bad status than Narom?Verdy_p added a comment.Jan 23 2018, 8:15 AM2018-01-23 08:15:14 (UTC+0)Comment Actions@Liuxinyu970226 the current language "status" does not matter at all for this issue for any language. Do you think that I would be arguing that supporting Narom was not needed in Wikimedia ? Certainly no, I think that Narom should be supported. But which code to use for Jerriais is still not clear (nrf ?) even if it has an official status. But we really need to free the "nrm" code for Narom as it was standardized.. And you're just confirming that need too. So really we don't disagree on this.
However I confirm that "en-simple" is not standard at all, please reread the BCP 47 standard! It would be standard if it had been officially registered as a language variant in the registry. It has been used  in Wikiemdia only for private use by Wikiemdia because of Wikimedia users demand for a specific Wikipedia edition for English learners. But the language is still standard English (a subset of it) as there's absolutely no delimitation line. Also this is not "my" standard like you said, but "the" BCP 474 standard (and not the Ethnologue catalogue, which is not a standard but a repository for some research data).
And you should avoid mixing other concepts (notably your confusion between DNS and BCP47 : the decision to use language/locale codes to tag contents in Wikimedia wikis and to create specific liguistic editions of Wiki projects using subdomains was a private decision of Wikimedia.
As well for the distinct decision of Wikimedia to link these editions using "interwiki" prefixes (there are other interwikis codes that are not at all used for that but used to link to other projects, and as a consequence the private decision of Wikimedia to assign a specific role for the first occurence of ":" in pagenames, which also causes some problems with words of some languages like Swedish, or some known article names (this created debates about "c:" and forced some articles to be renamed using alternate characters instead of ":"). Interwiki prefixes can be tricky so their detetion had to be limited in scope, but the detection turned to be unstable as it was not really formalized (and interwikis had a few other rules because they are fully case-insignicant, while the rest of article names are case-insignificant only on their "first" letter (after the interwiki prefix) but only for some wikis.
All these inconsistencies are purely private to Wikimedia wikis. They're not part of any standard, and should not contaminate other sites or data, because too many people think that Wikimedia is a common standard or perfectly follows standards (which is obviously wrong).Fomafix added a subscriber: Fomafix.Feb 22 2018, 8:42 PM2018-02-22 20:42:14 (UTC+0)Comment Actions

All we need is to support the correct interwikis, and stop polluting Wikidata with fake language codes for its translations (Wikidata should use "en-simple" even for linking to Wikipedia, and it's perfectly possible to alias the domain name). Only a minor modification of known interwiki codes is needed so that it points to the correct domain name even if it's not changed.
Renaming databases is not absolutely necessary. Some pywiki bots will need to be upated to know also the new interwiki alias.
After years, and with other pending renames or creations, we should know now exactly where and how to centralize such maintenance for lists of language codes supported, fallbacks, updates to Translatewiki.net and its import bot.
And so we should also deprecate legacy codes we still use on Translatewiki.net (we should not pollute other non-wikimedia projects hosted there, even if there are now warnings on this site for such legacy private codes, notably on its language portals and their associated categories), as well as all Wikidata entries in properties that are NOT links to Wikipedia. We're reaching the point where complete cleanup can be terminated.

Two word: TOO HARD, see T113461. I'd love to say that unless and until there's kiseki that the RENAME DATABASE command can be back, this can't be done safety.
T133548 is about certificates for HTTPS. if we create a CNAME of a subdomain project to another subdomain, it should have no impact if the certificate allows not just specific subdomains but its parent domain (e.g. wikipedia.org): there are hundreds of subdomains and having one certificate for each one is costly.
Isn't https://en-wp.org faced-to-faced that problem? T190244
And so we should also deprecate legacy codes we still use on Translatewiki.net
