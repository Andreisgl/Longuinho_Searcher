The method essentially describes the scattered radiation in terms of spectral invariants that gives an expression as a series of powers of leaf single scattering albedo. This can then be post-processed to describe the scattering regime for arbitrary leaf spectral functions. The spectral invariant expression is explored to interpret some of its features. Some practical uses of this include the use of truncated ray tracing methods that can be adjusted for unsampled scattering orders by consideration of energy conservation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Comparison of Discrete Return and Waveform Airborne Lidar Derived Estimates of Fractional Cover in an Australian SavannaABSTRACT The advance of commercial airborne lidar systems from discrete-return to waveform record... more ABSTRACT The advance of commercial airborne lidar systems from discrete-return to waveform recording instruments has made repeatable estimates of biophysical variables from these different methods questionable. Using an experimental airborne waveform lidar dataset acquired in an Australian savanna, this study presents a method for the derivation of canopy/ground backscatter coefficients from waveform lidar and a comparison of discrete return and waveform approaches to the estimation of fractional cover. Despite limited validation, the results indicate that waveform estimates of fractional cover can provide consistently higher accuracy than discrete return estimates under varying survey properties. Ongoing work using raw waveform data across larger areas and 3D radiative transfer simulations aims to develop a quantitative understanding of the impact of disparate sensor and survey properties on the detection of change in vegetation structure using commercial lidar instruments.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Strong constraint on modelled global carbon uptake using solar- induced chlorophyll fluorescence data OPENby Philip Lewis and Philip LewisAccurate terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) simulations of gross carbon uptake (gross primary prod... more Accurate terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) simulations of gross carbon uptake (gross primary productivity – GPP) are essential for reliable future terrestrial carbon sink projections. However, uncertainties in TBM GPP estimates remain. Newly-available satellite-derived sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data offer a promising direction for addressing this issue by constraining regional-to-global scale modelled GPP. Here, we use monthly 0.5° GOME-2 SIF data from 2007 to 2011 to optimise GPP parameters of the ORCHIDEE TBM. The optimisation reduces GPP magnitude across all vegetation types except C4 plants. Global mean annual GPP therefore decreases from 194 ± 57 PgCyr −1 to 166 ± 10 PgCyr −1 , bringing the model more in line with an up-scaled flux tower estimate of 133 PgCyr −1. Strongest reductions in GPP are seen in boreal forests: the result is a shift in global GPP distribution, with a ~50% increase in the tropical to boreal productivity ratio. The optimisation resulted in a greater reduction in GPP than similar ORCHIDEE parameter optimisation studies using satellite-derived NDVI from MODIS and eddy covariance measurements of net CO 2 fluxes from the FLUXNET network. Our study shows that SIF data will be instrumental in constraining TBM GPP estimates, with a consequent improvement in global carbon cycle projections. The terrestrial carbon, C, sink remains the most uncertain component of the annual global carbon budget 1. Uncertainty in its strength and location contributes to high terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) spread in future C sink projections between models 2. Accurate net CO 2 flux projections rely on model ability to determine gross C fluxes. However, TBM inter-comparisons have shown strong discrepancies in gross C uptake (or gross primary production – GPP) related to both variability in growing season length and peak season magnitude 3,4. One source of uncertainty in TBM simulations is due to fixed (often uncertain) parameter values. Significant progress has been made in using carbon cycle-related observations to constrain TBM parametric uncertainty via Bayesian data assimilation (DA) methods 5–10. These datasets have included eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) 11 , satellite-derived measures of vegetation dynamics 12–14 , and ground-based atmospheric CO 2 concentration data. However, while there is considerable improvement in the simulation of leaf phenology and/ or NEE in these studies, there is often a remaining model-data discrepancy in the gross C fluxes. Satellite-derived measures of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) offer a promising new direction to constrain simulated GPP at multiple scales 15. SIF is strongly linked to GPP via its association with chlorophyll a absorption in plant photosynthetic machinery. The SIF-GPP relationship has been assessed at multiple scales using both process-based modelling and in situ and satellite observations. Frankenberg C. et al. 16 and Guanter L. et al. 17 were the first to report a linear relationship at global scale between monthly satellite-derived SIF dataSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
