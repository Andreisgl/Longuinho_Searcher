GrafanaLoading GrafanaIf you're seeing this Grafana has failed to load its application files1. This could be caused by your reverse proxy settings.2. If you host grafana under subpath make sure your grafana.ini root_url setting includes subpath. If not using a reverse proxy make sure to set serve_from_sub_path to true.3. If you have a local dev build make sure you build frontend using: yarn start, yarn start:hot, or yarn build4. Sometimes restarting grafana-server can help5.
