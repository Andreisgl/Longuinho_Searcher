An examination of published and archival source material reveals that the negotiations over the drafting of these documents were marked by a total or near-total silence on the mass murder of Jews. The article concludes with an analysis of why during the drafting process the framers of these texts, including Jewish delegates whose family members had been killed in the Holocaust, refrained from invoking the slaughter of European Jewry at the same time as they called attention to other Nazi crimes. [For a more in-depth analysis of the Holocaust origins of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, see my 2012 article in the Journal of Genocide Research]Save to LibraryDownloadby Marco Duranti•  25  Human Rights Law, International Law, Human Rights, Genocide StudiesDeclaración Universal de Derechos HumanosSave to LibraryDownloadby Victoria Díaz•  6  Law, Derechos Humanos, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Antecedentes De La Declaracion Universal De Los Derechos HumanosMary Ann Glendon, 70 años de la Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos, Nuestro Tiempo, 701, 2019, pp. 104-111 (Traducción y edición de Fernando Simón Yarza)Save to LibraryDownloadby Fernando Simón Yarza•  15  Human Rights Law, Human Rights, Derechos Humanos, Universal Declaration of Human RightsLanguage identification of short text segments with n-gram modelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Tommi Vatanen•  6  Language Use, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Text Segmentation, Language ModelInternational Human Rights Law - Course Syllabus (Undergraduate Level)This course is aimed at introducing the students to the main important principles, concepts and categories of contemporary International Human Rights Law (IHRL).

It covers major significant aspects of this crucial branch of International Law including its historical development, its theory as well as practice. This particular course will provide a systemic description of IHRL as it is presently understood by the majority of international lawyers. Starting with the concept of human rights proper, its emergence, historical evolution and philosophical basis (human dignity, freedom, equality), the course will encompass and discuss the following issues: human rights categories and generations, selected individual and collective rights, International Bill of Human Rights, main principles and subjects of IHRL, its key treaty instruments, the United Nations human rights protection system, existing human rights protection mechanisms, remedies for human rights violations, domestic implementation of IHRL as well as relationship between human rights and rule of law. Students will thus be offered a general comprehensive picture of how, at present, IHRL fits into contemporary international legal order as an important tool in ensuring fairness and bringing justice in response to the commission of human rights violations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rustam Atadjanov•  12  Law, Human Rights Law, Human Rights, International Human Rights LawEmerging Areas of Human Rights in the 21st century: 70 years of the UDHRSymposium to celebrate the 70 years of the UDHR, the School of Law has chosen the topic of emerging human rights in the 21st century to examine and reflect on the development of international human rights law since the Declaration’s... moreSymposium to celebrate the 70 years of the UDHR, the School of Law has chosen the topic of emerging human rights in the 21st century to examine and reflect on the development of international human rights law since the Declaration’s inception.

Yet in practice, there remains a significant divide between the two grand categories of human rights: civil and political rights, on the one hand, and economic, social, and cultural rights on the other. To date, few scholars have critically examined how the notion of indivisibility has shaped the complex relationship between these two sets of rights. In Indivisible Human Rights, Daniel J. Whelan offers a carefully crafted account of the rhetoric of indivisibility. Whelan traces the political and historical development of the concept, which originated in the contentious debates surrounding the translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into binding treaty law as two separate Covenants on Human Rights.

Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware" [Quran 49:13].Hence, the talk argued that after 911, in a unipolar world with the United States' defence spending almost half of global military expenditures,, “equality” ought to encompass Americans and non-Americans; i.e. the equality of all humankind. In other words, the mission of The U.S. Department of State that “leads America’s foreign policy through diplomacy, advocacy, and assistance by advancing the interests of the American people, their safety and economic prosperity” ought to take into account the interests of Non-Americans, their safety and economic prosperity. If not, Foreign Affairs decisions flowing from 911 were in the danger of succumbing to hubris. Note: The text in the the poster, other than Title & Abstract, was provided by Auburn University, Alabama.In retrospect, the talk, sponsored by the Breeden Eminent Scholar Fund and the College of Liberal Arts,  is dedicated to the memory of my host Dr. David Edwin Harrell, Jr., Daniel Breeden Eminent Scholar at Auburn University February 22, 1930 – March 15, 2021.

This book  argues that in the second decade of the twenty-first century, individuals, political parties and nations around the world are abandoning the dignity-based culture we established in the aftermath  of two world wars, less than a century ago. Disappointed or intimidated, many turn their backs on the humanitarian, universalistic culture that presumes our inherent human dignity and celebrates it as the basis of  every individual's equal human rights. Instead, people and nations are returning to a much older, honor-based cultural structure. Because its ancient logic and mentality take new forms (such as social network shaming and certain aspects of "victimhood culture") -- we fail to recognize them, and overlook the pitfalls of the old honor-based structure. Narrating the history of honor-based societies, this book distinguishes their underlying principle from the post-WWII notion of dignity that underlies human rights. It makes the case that in order to revive and strengthen dignity-based culture, the concept of human dignity must be defined narrowly and succinctly, and enhanced with the principle of respect. Continuing its historical and cultural narrative, the book discusses contemporary phenomena such as al-Qaeda terrorists, shaming via social network, FoMO, and some features of the emerging "victimhood culture". The book pays homage to Erich Fromm's classic Escape from Freedom.Save to LibraryDownloadby Orit Kamir•  11  Political Philosophy, Theology, Human Rights Law, Second World WarHuman Rights and the Collateral Damage of Neoliberalism.

That same year, Amnesty International(AI) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) both released reportsthat documented and evaluated the civilian deaths during “OperationAllied Force”. Both reports sought to determine whether these deathscomplied with international humanitarian law and could therefore beregarded as “collateral damage”, which HRW, following US militaryusage, defined as “damage to civilian objects and civilian casualtiesthat are incidental to lawful attacks on military objectives.”1 One answer to Asad’s question, ‘What Do Human Rights Do?” is suggestedby the title of Amnesty International’s report on the NATO militarycampaign, “‘Collateral Damage’ or Unlawful Killing”: human rightshas become one language used to define certain forms of killing as‘mere’ “collateral damage”.This is my contribution to the twentieth anniversary edition of Theory and Event. This is how the editors describe the idea: "The first is a look back at the founding of the journal through the implications of the present. What is T&E for younger scholars, academics whose intellectual careers postdate its founding? In other words, we wanted the perspectives of those for whom the journal has always been present.  As a gesture toward (and recognition of) the past, and inspired by a conversation with Wendy Brown and William Connolly about the emergence of the journal, we asked a number of such theorists to select an essay from the first five volumes of the journal and engage its insights and influences.  As the reader will quickly realize, these are neither summaries nor histories, but continued engagements with the persistent issues raised by the original work.  Each scholar’s contentions and critique of ideas from a generation ago continue the intellectual project of the journal."The entire edition is currently free to download here: https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/35735Save to LibraryDownloadby Jessica Whyte•  9  Political Philosophy, Political Theory, Human Rights, HumanitarianismAn introduction to the relationship between Jacques Maritain with the nuclear drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human RightsThis article offers an introduction to Jacques Maritain's relations with the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

I do so in order to resolve the tension between two accounts of Chang’s work: first, that he was a vocal advocate for Confucianism, and, second, (as suggested in passing by Eleanor Roosevelt) that he was a “pluralist.” How can Chang be both a Confucian and a pluralist? What is the significance of his contribution to intellectual history? In this thesis, I argue that Chang’s contribution lay in his approach to problem-solving and understanding global concerns—an approach grounded in his commitment to American pragmatism, not primarily Confucianism. Chang’s comparative, education-focused, pluralist brand of pragmatism evokes the philosophy associated with his doctoral advisor John Dewey, who was himself influenced by Chinese philosophy. Thus, the question of influence with respect to Chang and Dewey defies national boundaries, revealing a complicated, interconnected global sphere of intellectual exchange. My project demonstrates the necessity of taking an “international turn” when approaching the intellectual sources of the Universal Declaration.Save to LibraryDownloadby Henry Li•  8  Pragmatism, Education, United Nations, John DeweyPowers RemonstranceMUST REVIEW!

From employment creation to human development, from security interests to the empowerment of women; energy remains at the heart of all countries’ core interests. However, the statistics are quite alarming. Twenty percent of the world’s population is still without access to electricity; and almost three billion people still rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating.1 A major discussion point that stems from these statistics is that the lack of access to modern energy is a major barrier to addressing basic human rights and building shared prosperity; more specifically, a hindrance to achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Save to LibraryDownloadby Ashvini  Ambihaipahar•  11  Human Rights, Renewable Energy, International Human Rights Law, EnergyThe role of UNESCO in promoting universal human rights.

As the Universal Declaration’s entitlement to universal validity has been contested since it was first announced – by Muslim individuals, organisations and states among others –, Muslim and non-Muslim thinkers have long been discussing if its prerogatives are compatible with Islam, i.e. the sharia. Some of them consider the concept of human dignity a chance for a consensus in the human rights debate, hoping that it “might facilitate a critical mediation between the normative requirements of human rights on the one hand and various religious or cultural traditions on the other” (Heiner Bielefeldt).In this paper we show that as far as the debate of high ranking religious scholars in the Islamic Republic of Iran is concerned, an “overlapping consensus” (John Rawls) between the concept of human dignity as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the idea of human dignity as defined by Shiite scholars in Iran is not achievable. “Dignity” is translated into Persian (and Arabic) as karāmat, a qur’anic term implying a sense of honour that is not compatible with the secular understanding of dignity as the essential equality of all human beings. Additionally, Shiite scholars declare dignity to be directly connected to piety, which, again, is considered an individual, personal merit. An even greater deviation from the concept of “dignity” as propagated in the Declaration of Human Rights is the Iranian Shiite scholars’ belief that the inborn, and in this case God-given, dignity can be forfeited if a person does not fulfill his/her religious obligations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anja  Prof. Dr. Pistor-Hatam and +1Kerstin von der Decken•  2  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Human dignity from the Islamic perspective.Universal Declaration of Human RightsUniversal Declaration of Human RightsUDHRانسانی حقوق کا عالمی منشورSave to LibraryDownloadby Imran Ayaz•  14  Human Rights Law, Human Rights, International Human Rights Law, Comparative Human Rights Law“1793: The Neglected Legacy of Insurgent Universality,” History of the Present.

It announces a politics beyond the state. While the histories of human rights usually give ample consideration to the proto-Declaration of 1789, they do not pay enough attention to the Declaration of 1793. However, the neglected Declaration of 1793 allows us to consider the forgotten history of active struggles—most notably, that of women, the poor, and slaves—a set of struggles that, in their concrete configurations , helped to shape the Declaration's radical claims. Comparing these two declarations by examining their respective contexts and contents, this paper delineates the limits of rights declarations as juridical texts and presents a critique of their universal aspirations. At the same time, however, the paper outlines an alternative conception of universality that the 1793 Declaration brings into view in the very tension between the concepts of citizen and man that it deploys. In contrast to the juridical universalism of 1789, the insurgent universality of 1793 is one that both opens up the political form of the state and introduces possibilities for radical social and political change.Save to LibraryDownloadby Massimiliano Tomba•  6  Human Rights, French Revolution, Haitian Revolution, Universal Declaration of Human RightsMonções - Revista de Relações Internacionais da UFGD - v.7, n.14Dossiê: Direitos Humanos e Relações Internacionais: os 70 anos da Declaração Universal dos Direitos HumanosSave to LibraryDownloadby Revista Monções Relações Internacionais UFGD and +1Matheus De Carvalho Hernandez•  3  Human Rights, United Nations, Universal Declaration of Human RightsHuman Rights, Revolution and the 'Good Society'In this paper, I return to the drafting of the Universal Declaration and trace a spirited conflict about whether or not a society that guaranteed human rights would be, by definition, good.

My focus is on the (partly successful) efforts of the Soviet Bloc delegates to strip the new human rights bill of a proposed 'right to a good social and international order'. By 1947, as the drafting began, Russia’s own revolutionary days were long in the past. Nonetheless, Soviet diplomats continued to argue that a good society would be achieved by workers’ revolutions, not rights declarations. I also argue that this debate about the good society requires us to reconsider the standard story according to which the nascent Cold War saw the Eastern Bloc push for social and economic rights while the Western Bloc sought civil and political rights. I show that Soviet delegates were contemptuous of the belief that declaring economic rights would heal class antagonisms or overcome poverty and economic inequality, and deeply sceptical about the realisation of such rights under capitalism.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jessica Whyte•  10  Political Theory, Human Rights, Critical Legal Theory, Legal TheoryChild Labour and Right to Education: Issues arising out of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Bill, 2012[Adjudged as 2nd Best Legal Essay in 4th Independent Thought National Legal Essay Competition, 2015] The authors, through this essay, have sought to analyse the socio-legal aspects of the employment of children at home and its impact upon... more[Adjudged as 2nd Best Legal Essay in 4th Independent Thought National Legal Essay Competition, 2015]The authors, through this essay, have sought to analyse the socio-legal aspects of the employment of children at home and its impact upon the child’s constitutional right of education with regards to the existing legal framework on the same.

For example, inthe 1990s alone, the UDHR served as the cornerstone document for the WorldConference on Education for All, held in Jomtien, Thailand (1990); the WorldSummit for Children (1990); the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development (Rio, 1992); the World Conference on Human Rights (1993);the International Conference on Population and Development [ICPD] (Cairo,1994); the World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1995); theFourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995); and the formation of theCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW ).This article is designed to look, in particular, at Article 26 of the UDHR—which focuses on the right to education—by tracing its origins and uses viabiographical methodologies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Thalia Mulvihill•  39  Gender Studies, Education, Women's Studies, Democratic EducationA Declaração Universal dos Direitos Humanos e sua Importância na Gênese, Desenvolvimento e Consolidação do Direito Internacional dos Direitos HumanosO presente texto propõe uma reflexão otimista acerca da DUDH, objetivando-se demonstrar que esse extraordinário consenso, que acolhe a universalidade, a indivisibilidade e a interdependência dos direitos humanos tem gozado de uma... moreO presente texto propõe uma reflexão otimista acerca da DUDH, objetivando-se demonstrar que esse extraordinário consenso, que acolhe a universalidade, a indivisibilidade e a interdependência dos direitos humanos tem gozado de uma trajetória não menos extraordinária, especialmente por inspirar incontáveis desdobramentos na defesa e promoção local, nacional, regional e, sobretudo, internacional desses direitos, cristalizando-se como um dos documentos mais influentes da história humana. É nesse contexto que inicialmente são feitas algumas considerações sobre os trabalhos preparatórios da DUDH, sua histórica adoção e proclamação, assim como o seu significado. Na sequência é analisada a celeuma que envolve a natureza jurídica e a força vinculante desse notável e paradigmático documento internacional. Ao final, busca-se elucidar a importância da DUDH para a gênese, desenvolvimento e consolidação do DIDH.This text proposes an optimistic reflection on the UDHR, aiming at demonstrating that this extraordinary consensus, which embraces the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights has enjoyed a not less extraordinary trajectory, especially since it has inspired countless developments in defense and local, national, regional and, above all, international promotion of these rights, crystallizing as one of the most influential documents in human history. It is in this context that initially some considerations are made about the preparatory work of the UDHR, its historic adoption and proclamation, as well as its meaning. Following is analyzed the excitement that involves the legal nature and the binding force of this remarkable and paradigmatic international document. In the end, it seeks to elucidate the importance of the UDHR for the genesis, development and consolidation of the IHRL.Save to LibraryDownloadby Luciano Meneguetti•  16  International Law, Human Rights, International Human Rights Law, United NationsReligious Freedom SeriesIn Christine Schirrmacher's postdoctoral thesis, for the first time one finds reviews of original voices coming from Islamic theology on the topic of religious freedom and apostasy.

Arabic, Eng-lish, French, and Urdu texts have been translated and analyzed and thus made accessible. There are basically three positions which are defended on falling away from the Islamic faith: Complete advocacy of religious freedom, the complete denial of religious freedom with a call for the immediate application of the death penalty for apostates, and the centrist position. The centrist position, however, which allows inner freedom of thought and warns against premature persecution, calls for the death penalty in the case of open apostasy (e.g., in the case of conversion to another faith). Within established Islamic theology, the latter approach is nowadays the most frequent point of view found. These three main positions on apostasy are introduced in this postdoctoral thesis by means of the publications of three influential 20th century theologians: Yusuf al-Qaradawi (b. 1926), Ab-dullah Saeed (b. 1960), and Abu l-A'la Maududi (1903-1979). They all have followings of many millions of people and have political influence at their disposal. The study explains why in many Muslim majority countries there is still today only very limited or sometimes no freedom of religion (in the sense of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948) for converts, critical intellectuals, artists and progressive Quranic studies specialists, journalists and secularists, agnostics and confessing atheists, enlightened thinkers, women's rights and human rights activists as well as adherents of non-recognized minorities.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christine Schirrmacher•  20  Human Rights, Islam and Human Rights, Pakistan, Freedom of ReligionUNITING CHURCH LGBTIQ+ NETWORK SUBMISSION re The Religious Discrimination Legislative Package December 2021 - Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human RightsWe are very disappointed with the lack of time to create a complete submission.

These proposed Bills are creating a system of religious apartheid in Australia. In addition, these bills create a system of State Sponsored Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia and much more in Australia, raised in the 2019 ILGA World report.The Bills go to what Mr Victor Madrigal-Borloz, the UN's Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, has called out as in his 2019 report to the United Nations, "…impacts on their [LGBTIQ people] social inclusion and hinders their access to healthcare, education, housing, employment, political participation, personal security and freedom from violence." Beyond the LGBTIQ Community, these Bills put women, the disabled, people of minor faith communities, and people from other races and others in the Australian society at riskAs Christians, we find this unacceptable.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jason Masters•  14  International Human Rights Law, Australian Human Rights Law, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Religious DiscriminationDeclaración Universal de Derechos HumanosSave to LibraryDownloadby Jose Samuel Sujuy Zamora•  6  Law, Derechos Humanos, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Antecedentes De La Declaracion Universal De Los Derechos HumanosUNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE GOIÁS FACULDADE DE HISTÓRIA PROGRAMA DE PÓS-GRADUAÇÃO EM HISTÓRIA DoutoradoEsta tese analisa os bastidores do processo de elaboração da Declaração Universal dos Direitos Humanos (DUDH), nos anos de 1946 a 1948.

O objetivo da pesquisa é entender qual foi o papeldesempenhado pelos latino-americanos durante a redação de um dos documentos mais importantesdo último século. Para isso, examinamos documentos oficiais das Nações Unidas: as atas e osregistros das transcrições das reuniões do Comitê Preparatório, do Comitê de Redação, daComissão de Direitos Humanos, do Conselho Econômico e Social, do Terceiro Comitê do Plenárioda Assembleia Geral, ou seja, avaliamos as documentações produzidas por todos os órgãos pelosquais passou o esboço da declaração. Além disso, analisamos os projetos de declarações de direitoshumanos enviados por inúmeras instituições e delegações; as Constituições submetidas pelospaíses membros das Nações Unidas; os relatórios oficiais das Comissões; as cartas derecomendações e documentos variados produzidos pela Comissão de Direitos Humanos.Outrossim, escolhemos verificar documentos privados: os diários, as memórias, autobiografias ebiografias dos principais membros que compuseram os Comitês e Comissões responsáveis porelaborar a DUDH. Estabelecemos entre esses dois tipos de documentação o método comparativo,sendo por meio dele que conseguimos captar a rede que entrelaçava os sujeitos, comissões einstituições envolvidos nesse processo de redação. A partir da análise dessa ampla documentação,foi possível perceber que os latino-americanos se destacaram em diversos momentos, assimpudemos contar uma outra história sobre seu papel nas Comissões. Passamos a lidar com ahipótese, então comprovada por esta Tese, de que, mais do que simples participação, taisrepresentantes foram protagonistas na criação da DUDH. Capturou nossa atenção também,compreender o porquê e como esse protagonismo (e seus construtores) foi inviabilizado pelahistoriografia tradicional dos direitos humanos. Nesse sentido, foi possível concluir a partir destapesquisa que: os latino-americanos foram o grupo que mais se esforçou para que após a reuniãoem São Francisco fosse criada uma declaração de direitos; nas reuniões do Comitê Preparatórioforam os que primeiro apresentaram projetos de declarações (cubano, panamenho, chileno); eramo grupo mais articulado e bem preparado, tanto ao já trazerem para as Nações Unidas um textopronto como a Declaração de Bogotá, escrita em convenções regionais anteriores, quanto aocombinarem de votar conjuntamente, já que estavam em maioria (20 delegados latino-americanosde um total de 59 membros). Além disso, suas submissões de emendas e propostas de alteraçõesderam origem a inúmeros artigos da Declaração. Acabamos por tecer uma história, até entãoescamoteada, sobre o papel de destaque desempenhado por esse grupo. Isso foi exposto a partir deuma estrutura organizada em três capítulos. No primeiro capítulo, enfocamos quais foram osprincipais atores e instituições que contribuíram para a escrita da DUDH. No segundoapresentamos como foram estruturadas e organizadas as fases para a elaboração do documento. Eno terceiro, examinamos a escrita de todos os seus artigos e demonstramos a imprescindívelcolaboração dos latino-americanos em todas essas ocasiões. Tudo isso foi feito com o objetivo deresponder nosso problema central: o papel dos países latino-americanos na escrita do textouniversal, não devidamente registrado pela historiografia dos Direitos Humanos.Save to LibraryDownloadby Fernanda Linhares Pereira•  7  History, Direito, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, América LatinaThe Global Politics of Human Rights: Bringing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) into the 21st CenturySave to LibraryDownloadby Miguelángel Verde Garrido and +2Philani MthembuBerlin Forum on Global Politics•  19  International Relations, Human Rights, International Human Rights Law, United NationsTextbooks, Respect for Diversity, and Social CohesionSave to LibraryDownloadby Vincent Greaney•  6  United Nations, Cultural Identity, Social cohesion, Universal Declaration of Human RightsSocial Rights and the Politics of Obligation in HistoryThis pioneering volume explores the long-neglected history of social rights, from the Middle Ages to the present.

It debunks the myth that social rights are ‘second-generation rights’ that appeared after the Second World War as additions to a rights corpus stretching back to the Enlightenment. Not only do social rights extend that far back; they arguably predate the Enlightenment. In tracing their long history across various global contexts, this volume reveals how debates over social rights have often turned on deeper struggles over social obligation – over determining who owes what to whom, morally and legally. In the modern period, these struggles have been intertwined with questions of freedom, democracy, equality and dignity. Many factors have shaped the history of social rights, from class, gender and race to religion, empire and capitalism. With incomparable chronological depth, geographical breadth and conceptual nuance, Social Rights and the Politics of Obligation in History sets an agenda for future histories of human rights.Save to LibraryDownloadby Charles Walton•  11  Gender History, Social Rights, Neoliberalism, Global HistoryNextLast »Related TopicsReligious EthicsFollowFollowingLegitimacyFollowFollowingShariah and LawFollowFollowingEquality and Non DiscriminationFollowFollowingHistory of Human RightsFollowFollowingQuran and Sunnah StudiesFollowFollowingAgonismFollowFollowingRights of Indigenous PeoplesFollowFollowingExportFollowFollowingExportsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
