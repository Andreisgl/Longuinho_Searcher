I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.27.1, 1.26.4, 1.23.15!
These releases fix five security issues in core and one for the extension
PdfHandler. Download links are given at the end of this email.

* (T139565) API: Generate head items in the context of the given title
(CVE-2016-6335)
* (T137264) XSS in unclosed internal links (CVE-2016-6334)
* (T133147) Escape '<' and ']]>' in inline <style> blocks
(CVE-2016-6333)
* (T133147) Require login to preview user CSS pages (CVE-2016-6333)
* (T132926) Do not allow undeleting a revision deleted file if it is the
top file (CVE-2016-6336)
* (T129738) Make $wgBlockDisablesLogin also restrict logged in permissions

* (T115333) Check read permission when loading page content in ApiParse
(CVE-2016-6331)
* (T57548) Remove support for $wgWellFormedXml = false, all output is now
well formed
The following only affects 1.27 and above and is not included in the 1.26
and 1.23 upgrade:
* (T139670) Move 'UserGetRights' call before application of
