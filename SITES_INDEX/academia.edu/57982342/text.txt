However, previous studies show contrasting results for this association between different types of exercise training (i.e., aerobic, resistance, or combined aerobic and resistance training). The aim of this study was to determine which type of exercise training is more effective in increasing HDL-C levels. Forty obese men, age 18-29 yr, were randomized into 4 groups: an aerobic-training group (n = 10), a resistance-training group (n = 10), a combined-exercise-training group (n = 10), and a control group (n = 10). After a 12-wk exercise program, anthropometrics, blood biochemical variables, and physical-fitness components were compared with the data obtained at the baseline. Multiple-regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between different types of exercise training and changes in HDL-C while adjusting for potent...Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of NutritionThe status of plasma homocysteine and related B-vitamins in healthy young vegetarians and nonvegetarians2003 • Yi-Chia HuangDownload Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Clinical NutritionAssociation of plasma B-6 vitamers with systemic markers of inflammation before and after pyridoxine treatment in patients with stable angina pectoris2012 • Oivind Midttun, Ringdal Pedersen, Arve UlvikDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Renal NutritionVitamin B6 and the Immunity in Kidney Transplant Recipients2013 • A.
