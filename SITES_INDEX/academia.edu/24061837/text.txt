NABU 2014/4, note 79.2014 -- The date of Hammurabi's conquest of Larsa. NABU 2014/4, note 79.J.G.  DercksenIt presents us with a confrontation between a Babylon-Nērebtum coalition and a Larsa-Uruk coalition. Ešnunna is forced by the treaty to take the side of the Larsa-Uruk coalition. The pact seems to be result of Sîn-iddinam's aggression towards Northern Babylonia and the Diyala region, as is attested from his 4th, 5th, and 6th year name . Guichard has shown convincingly that we must place the date of the text around 1843-1842 BCE.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers"The Land of Idu: City, Province, or Kingdom ?"

Several stages in the development of the Kingdom of Arpad are identified. In stage 1 Arpad is a relatively independent state. Arame, its second king submitted to Assyria freely in 858 BCE and did not participate in subversive alliances. In stage 2 Arpad was subjugated to Assyria as was the rest of northern Syria and southern Anatolia. In stage 3 Arpad led the opposition to the Assyrian weakened hegemony and became independent from ca. 823 at the earliest. Stage 4 is characterized by the supremacy of Hazael, King of Aram-Damascus from 823 at the earliest and 805 at the latest. In Stage 5 (ca.800 BCE–754 BCE) the rise of the Kingdom of Hamath-and-Lu‘ash in the south and of Urartu in the North influenced the status of Arpad and the Assyrian ability to be involved in the Levant. After a few Assyrian campaigns against Hazrak (capital of Lu‘ash) its hegemony was broken. The Kingdom of Arpad could rise and thrive (stage 6: 754–744 BCE). Now Arpad could incorporate or be in close confederation with Hamath, creating a new entity, which was designated "all Aram". This can be inferred from the Sefîre treaty concluded between Bar-Ga’yah, king of KTK, and Mati‘-ilu, son of ‘Attaršumki, King of Arpad. In the final stage (stage 7) of the history of Arpad, Tiglath-Pileser III campaigned four years against Arpad, the capital of Arpad, (743–740 BCE) until it was conquered and was reduced into a province of the Assyrian empire.Download Free PDFView PDFA New Look at the Chronology of Alalakh Level VII, Anatolian Studies 26 (1976), pp. 129-143.Nadav Na'amanDownload Free PDFView PDFOxford Handbook of the Ancient Near EastThe Middle East after the Fall of Ur – Isin and Larsa2022 • Klaus WagensonnerDownload Free PDFView PDFEsarhaddon's Treaty with Baal and Assyrian Provinces Along the Phoenician Coast, Rivista degli Studi Fenici 22 (1994), pp. 3-8.Nadav Na'amanDownload Free PDFView PDFChronology and History in the Late Assyrian Empire (631-619 BC), Zeitschrift für Assyriologie 81 (1991), pp. 243-267Nadav Na'amanDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Historical Introduction of the Aleppo Treaty Reconsidered, Journal of Cuneiform Studies 32 (1980), pp. 34-42.Nadav Na'amanDownload Free PDFView PDFEsarhaddon's Succession Treaty at Tell Tayinat:  Text and CommentaryJacob LauingerDownload Free PDFView PDFNippur and Dilmun in the second half of the fourteenth century BC: a re-evaluation of the Ilī-ippašra lettersEric OlijdamThree cuneiform letters (BE XVII 88, Ni. 615 and Ni. 641) written by Ilī-ippašra, governor in Dilmun, and addressed to his 'brother’ Enlil-kidinnī, governor of Nippur, have been found at Nippur (Iraq). They were part of a diplomatic correspondence archived at the regional palace in Nippur and deal with the political situation in Dilmun during the reign of king Burna-Buriaš II (1359-1333 BC). A number of new readings and reconstructions based on Goetze's copy are proposed resulting in a fresh understanding of the content of these letters, which if anything make an even stronger case for Dilmun’s politico-administrative incorporation into Kassite Babylonia. These letters present a lively and fascinating insight into the duties and responsibilities of a high Kassite official during an otherwise little-known yet extraordinary period in the history of this region. From the letters it is eminently clear that Dilmun was beset by internal problems caused by Aḫlamû. It is suggested that it was not a dispute with disgruntled (nomadic) agricultural laborers as has been maintained up till now, but a full-blown rebellion by mutinous soldiers/mercenaries, i.e. Ilī-ippašra's power-base. =========================================================================== N.B.: Volume U/W of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (page 45, uḫinnu 1c) offers the following improved reading for lines 20-22 in Ni. 641: bēlū uḫinne kî ērišušunūti ul iddinuni; when I asked the owners of the unripened dates (for some of their produce) they did not give me any.Download Free PDFView PDFin, Thonemann, Peter (ed.), Attalid Asia Minor: Money, International Relations, and the State, Oxford, 83-119The Attalids and the Seleukid Kings, 281-175 BC2013 • Boris ChrubasikDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
