This commentary discusses the framework proposed by Forde et al (2021) in analysing the food industry marketing responses to the Soft Drink Industry Levy (SDIL), implemented in the UK in 2018. We suggest and discuss ways which may help broaden the use of the framework to other relevant policies. This includes widening the framework to cover strategies that may have not come up within the SDIL context but have been studied in other contexts. It would also be important to consider interactions between the strategies and with external factors influencing company decisions. Going forward, comprehensive evaluations of health related policies should consider likely interactions with industry marketing strategies to fully understand potential impacts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Their complex and fragile nature has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of news articles published globally between December 2019 and April 2020 was conducted to describe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the chicken meat system and to identify key vulnerabilities and intervention points to build resilience. Most of the impacts identified were caused by a combination of the different mitigation measures implemented by the system actors such as movement restrictions rather than by the direct effects of the virus, thereby demonstrating the importance of interconnections and coordination in the system. Social media were found to have played a crucial role in amplifying, mitigating or mediating the impact of the pandemic.

A food systems approach and qualitative system dynamics model to reveal policy issues within the commercial broiler chicken system in South AfricaPLOS ONEGlobal broiler production and consumption levels continue to rise. South Africa’s broiler system ... more Global broiler production and consumption levels continue to rise. South Africa’s broiler system is dominated by commercial production and formal retail trade, with competition from cheap imports. Local broiler policies have narrow, production-driven, short-term aims for industry growth and national food security. However, these have unintended consequences that undermine the system’s future sustainability. Using a food systems approach, this study developed a qualitative system dynamics model of the South African commercial broiler system and used it to engage stakeholders in policy discussions within the boundaries of health, nutrition, and environmental sustainability. A problem statement and key system elements were drawn from a previously published qualitative study and were validated by 15 stakeholders via an online questionnaire. From this, a seed model was developed, expanded into a larger model, and shared in a modular format with stakeholders in virtual meetings, on an ind...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We simulate a halving of future palm cooking oil consumption and show that patient incident and premature mortality cases from myocardial infarction and stroke will be reduced by 0.23%-0.24%, and that regional population levels will increase by as much as 8.1 persons per 100,000 inhabitants in the long run. Rural-urban economic equity also improves except for the rural South where reduced oil palm production reduces economic welfare and leads to land reallocation towards crops with less favourable environmental carbon sequestration characteristics. Promotion of oil palm production, with the aim of producing cheap cooking oil for consumption purposes, requires careful...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The dynamically-recursive Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is calibrated on the basis of an adapted 2007 Thailand SAM (NESDB 2010). Nine regional household types are modelled, including Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA) and rural/urban areas of the remaining four regions (North, North East, Central excl. BMA, South), and nutritional exposure of regional household members are modelled through an adapted AIDS demand system with nutritional coefficients derived from national food balance sheets and a 2011 household survey (NSO 2012).

Broiler meat is South Africa&#39;s most affordable meat option, supporting household food and nutrition security. Although considered healthier and less environmentally harmful than ruminant meat, it is not without food safety risks and environmental impacts. This research aimed to present the foremost commercial broiler system narratives in South Africa, around targets of SDG 2, and to discuss key considerations for policymakers. Twenty-nine key informants and stakeholders, purposively selected to cover a wide range of opinions, participated in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts underwent a qualitative framework analysis.

Trading water: virtual water flows through interstate cereal trade in IndiaEnvironmental Research Letters,  2020Cereals are an important component of the Indian diet, providing 47% of the daily dietary energy ... more Cereals are an important component of the Indian diet, providing 47% of the daily dietary energy intake. Dwindling groundwater reserves in India especially in major cereal-growing regions are an increasing challenge to national food supply. An improved understanding of interstate cereal trade can help to identify potential risks to national food security. Here, we quantify the trade between Indian states of five major cereals and the associated trade in virtual (or embedded) water. To do this, we modelled interstate trade of cereals using Indian government data on supply and demand; calculated virtual water use of domestic cereal production using state- and product-specific water footprints and state-level data on irrigation source; and incorporated virtual water used in the production of internationally-imported cereals using country-specific water footprints. We estimate that 40% (94 million tonnes) of total cereal food supply was traded between Indian states in 2011–12, correspon...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
