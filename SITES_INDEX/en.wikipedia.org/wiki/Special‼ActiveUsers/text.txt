The following is a list of active users on Wikipedia with a count of their recent edits after their username. A starting name can be specified.
Accounts with special designated roles on Wikipedia will have their group memberships displayed beside their names within parentheses. The assignment and revocation of some of these roles is logged at Special:Log/rights. Please note that certain individuals may have global rights or may not be actively flagged (due to inactivity, a desire to temporarily step away from the project, etc.).
If the user "Example" were an administrator, the user would appear in the list below as:
Example (talk | contribs) (administrator) [1 edit in the last 30 days]
For a list of all usernames currently in use or those in a specified group, see Special:ListUsers.
