StackR. Bostock2006, Plant DiseaseThe need for biosecurity in our natural and agricultural plant systems can be ascertained by understanding the threats and risks to those systems. Assessments made over the last 10 years have concluded that the threats are real and the risk is moderately high for unintentional introductions of pathogens and pests . Risk assessments include an evaluation of the vulnerability of our plant systems, the probability of introductions, and the severity of consequences resulting from those introductions . Continuing globalization of trade and the large-scale movement of people and goods have greatly increased opportunities for the introduction of pathogens and pests. Current movement of agricultural products is over greater distances in shorter periods of time than at any point in U.S. history. With those products come pests and pathogens. The probability of unintentionally introducing a new pest or pathogen increases with the increasing magnitude of this international transport of...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNational Plant Diagnostic Network: A Record of AccomplishmentRobert McGovernDownload Free PDFView PDFMicrobial ForensicsForensic Plant Pathology2011 • Forrest NutterDownload Free PDFView PDFRecovery Plan For Late Wilt of CornEduardo RodriguezDownload Free PDFView PDFAgricultural Bioterrorism: A Federal Strategy to Meet the Threat Recent titles in the McNair Paper series: 64 The Strategic Implications of a Nuclear-Armed Irans zDownload Free PDFView PDFThe International Plant Sentinel Network: a tool for Regional and National Plant Protection OrganizationsEllie BarhamBotanic gardens and arboreta are valuable but currently under-utilized resources in plant health research. Within their vast collections of living plants, gardens play host to expatriate plant species from across the world. These plants offer unique opportunities to study damaging pest and pathogen threats before their introduction into a region where they would be considered invasive aliens. Through these studies, scientists can determine vital information related to these organisms, which can in turn be used to strengthen understanding, contribute to pest risk analysis activities and put in place appropriate quarantine measures or other management programmes. The International Plant Sentinel Network (IPSN) has been working for the last 3 years to provide the support and resources needed for gardens to contribute to such research. The next phase of the IPSN will be to coordinate this research; it will identify, facilitate and provide the already developed tools to contributing gardens. In this way, the IPSN will provide meaningful and valuable information to plant health experts which could help mitigate, or stop altogether, the damaging impacts of new and emerging invasive alien organisms.Download Free PDFView PDFONE HUNDRED …Report of the Usaha/Aavld Committee on Animal Health Surveillance and Information Systems2010 • Craig Carter, M.

The health and productivity of plant systems is a prerequisite of food security and human health. There are many general threats to plant systems that put plant biosecurity at risk, including global trade of plants and plant products, climate change, population growth and landscape exploitation. Bioterrorism is one more threat to consider when developing a strategy for plant biosecurity. Plant systems are vulnerable to biocrime and bioterrorism. Various lists of threat agents and different approaches to risk assessment have been developed to guide research and policy decisions. Yet an integrated strategy for global plant biosecurity is lacking.Download Free PDFView PDFChapter 11The Role of Surveillance Methodsand Technologies in Plant Biosecurity2014 • Naomi  CoggerDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
