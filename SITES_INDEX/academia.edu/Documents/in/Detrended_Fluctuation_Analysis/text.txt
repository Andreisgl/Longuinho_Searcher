HRV is a tool for indirect investigation of both cardiac and autonomic system function in both healthy and diseased condition. It has been speculated that HRV analysis by nonlinear method might bring potentially useful prognosis information into light which will be helpful for assessment of cardiac condition. In this study, HRV from two types of data sets (normal sinus rhythm and sinus arrhythmia) are analyzed which are stored in MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology – Beth Israel hospital) database, an extended collection of recorded physiological signals. Then two nonlinear methods, approximate entropy (ApEn) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), have been applied to analyze HRV of both Arrhythmia patients and people having normal sinus rhythm. It has been clearly shown that nonlinear parameters obtained from these two methods reflect the opposite heart condition of the two types of subjects under study, healthy and diseased, by HRV measures. Thus, value of the nonlinear parameters found in this work can be used as standard when treating suspected patients for diagnosis of Arrhythmia. Also, by measuring these nonlinear parameter values, heart condition can be understood.Save to LibraryDownloadby umme  mumtahina and +1Nusrat Yeasmin•  12  Rhythm, Databases, Time series analysis, EntropyThe effect of shoe type and fatigue on strike index and spatiotemporal parameters of runningSave to LibraryDownloadby Laurent Malisoux and +2Kenneth MeijerDaniel Theisen•  17  Mechanical Engineering, Running, Fatigue, ShoesApplication of Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to Monthly Average of the Maximum Daily Temperatures to Resolve Different ClimatesDetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is used to investigate correlations between the monthly average of the maximum daily temperatures for different locations in the continental United States and the different climates these locations... moreDetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is used to investigate correlations between the monthly average of the maximum daily temperatures for different locations in the continental United States and the different climates these locations have. When we plot the scaling exponents obtained from the DFA versus the standard deviation of the temperature fluctuations, we observe crowding of data points belonging to the same climates. Thus, we conclude that by observing the long-time trends in the fluctuations of temperature it would be possible to distinguish between different climates.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kasım Koçak•  9  Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Physics, Environmental ScienceNew features of land and sea surface temperature anomaliesSave to LibraryDownloadby C.

Employing the method of rolling window, we find that Shenzhen stock market was becoming more and more efficient by analyzing the change of Hurst exponent and a new efficient measure, which is equal to multifractality degree sometimes. We also study the change of Hurst exponent and multifractality degree of volatility series. The results show that the volatility series still have significantly long-range dependence and multifractality indicating that some conventional models such as GARCH and EGARCH cannot be used to forecast the volatilities of Shenzhen stock market. At last, the abnormal phenomenon of multifractality degrees for return series is discussed. The results have very important implications for analyzing the influence of policies, especially under the environment of financial crisis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rongbao Gu•  8  Law, Stock Market, Financial Analysis, Financial CrisisDetrended fluctuation analysis of music signals: Danceability estimation and further semantic characterizationSave to LibraryDownloadby Perfecto Herrera•Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisIntroduction to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis in matlabFractal structures are found in biomedical time series from a wide range of physiological phenomena.

The multifractal spectrum identifies the deviations in fractal structure within time periods with large and small fluctuations. The present tutorial is an introduction to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) that estimates the multifractal spectrum of biomedical time series. The tutorial presents MFDFA step-by-step in an interactive Matlab session. All Matlab tools needed are available in Introduction to MFDFA folder at the website www.ntnu.edu/inm/geri/software. MFDFA are introduced in Matlab code boxes where the reader can employ pieces of, or the entire MFDFA to example time series. After introducing MFDFA, the tutorial discusses the best practice of MFDFA in biomedical signal processing. The main aim of the tutorial is to give the reader a simple self-sustained guide to the implementation of MFDFA and interpretation of the resulting multifractal spectra.Save to LibraryDownloadby Espen Ihlen•  6  Physiology, Time Series, Wavelet, VariabilityEconophysics of Stock and Foreign Currency Exchange MarketsSave to LibraryDownloadby Marcel Ausloos•  7  Human Factors, Data Analysis, Econophysics, StockRESPONSIVENESS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 TO FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS: UPDATEDThe IPCC carbon budget concludes that changes in atmospheric CO2 are driven by fossil fuel emissions on a year by year basis.

A testable implication of the validity of this carbon budget is that changes in atmospheric CO2 should be correlated with fossil fuel emissions at an annual time scale net of long term trends. A test of this relationship with insitu CO2 data from Mauna Loa 1958-2016 and flask CO2 data from twenty three stations around the world 1967-2015 is presented. The test fails to show that annual changes in atmospheric CO2 levels can be attributed to annual emissions. The finding is consistent with prior studies that found no evidence to relate the rate of warming to emissions and they imply that the IPCC carbon budget is flawed possibly because of insufficient attention to uncertainty, excessive reliance on net flows, and the use of circular reasoning that subsumes a role for fossil fuel emissions in the observed increase in atmospheric CO2.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Munshi•  10  Climate Change, Applied Statistics, Carbon Dioxide, GHG EmissionsFractal analysis of river flow fluctuationsSave to LibraryDownloadby M Movahed•  8  Mathematical Physics, Quantum Physics, Time Series, SeasonalityMultifractal moving average analysis and test of multifractal model with tuned correlationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jan Kantelhardt•  6  Mathematical Physics, Quantum Physics, Time Series, Multifractal AnalysisTime is MoneySave to LibraryDownloadby Kristinka Ivanova•  2  Point of View, Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisSPURIOUS CORRELATIONS IN TIME SERIES DATA: A NOTEUnrelated time series data can show spurious correlations by virtue of a shared drift in the long term trend.

The spuriousness of such correlations is demonstrated with examples. The SP500 stock market index, GDP at current prices for the USA, and the number of homicides in England and Wales in the sample period 1968 to 2002 are used for this demonstration. Detrended analysis shows the expected result that at an annual time scale the GDP and SP500 series are related and that neither of these time series is related to the homicide series. Correlations between the source data and those between cumulative values show spurious correlations of the two financial time series with the homicide series. These results have implications for empirical evidence that attributes changes in temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the surface-atmosphere system to fossil fuel emissions 1 .Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Munshi•  6  Climate Change, Applied Statistics, Time series analysis, Global WarmingAlternans lowers the scaling exponent of heartbeat fluctuation dynamics in animal models and humansSave to LibraryDownloadby samaneh tavakoli•  4  Animal Model, Cardiovascular system, HeartBeat, Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisMultifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of sunspot time seriesWe use multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), to See query 1 study sunspot number fluctuations.

The result of the MF-DFA shows that there are three crossover timescales in the fluctuation function. We discuss how the existence of the crossover timescales is related to a sinusoidal trend. Using Fourier detrended fluctuation analysis, the sinusoidal trend is eliminated. The Hurst exponent of the time series without the sinusoidal trend is $0.12\pm 0.01$. Also we find that these fluctuations have multifractal nature. Comparing the MF-DFA results for the remaining data set to those for shuffled and surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractal nature is almost entirely due to long range correlations.Save to LibraryDownloadby M Movahed•  21  Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mathematical PhysicsIntroducing fractal dimension algorithms to calculate the Hurst exponent of financial time seriesIn this paper, three new algorithms are introduced in order to explore long memory in financial time series.

They are based on a new concept of fractal dimension of a curve. A mathematical supportis provided for each algorithm and its accuracy is tested for different length time series by Monte Carlosimulations. In particular, in the case of short length series, the introduced algorithms perform much betterthan the classical methods. Finally, an empirical application for some stock market indexes as well as someindividual stocks is presented.Save to LibraryDownloadby Manuel  Fernández-Martínez•  14  Monte Carlo Simulation, Brownian Motion, Long Memory Processes, Fractional Brownian MotionCLIMATE SENSITIVITY AND THE RESPONSIVENESS OF TEMPERATURE TO ATMOSPHERIC CO2Detrended correlation analysis of global mean temperature observations and model projections are compared in a test for the theory that surface temperature is responsive to atmospheric CO2 concentration in terms of GHG forcing of surface... moreDetrended correlation analysis of global mean temperature observations and model projections are compared in a test for the theory that surface temperature is responsive to atmospheric CO2 concentration in terms of GHG forcing of surface temperature implied by the Climate Sensitivity parameter ECS. The test shows strong evidence of GHG forcing of warming in the theoretical RCP8.5 temperature projections made with CMIP5 forcings. However, no evidence of GHG forcing by CO2 is found in observational temperatures from four sources including two from satellite measurements. The test period is set to 1979-2018 so that satellite data can be included on a comparable basis. No empirical evidence is found in these data for a climate sensitivity parameter that determines surface temperature according to atmospheric CO2 concentration or for the proposition that reductions in fossil fuel emissions will moderate the rate of warming. 1Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Munshi•  5  Climate Change, GHG Emissions, Global Warming, Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisUnfolding the procedure of characterizing recorded ultra low frequency, kHZ and MHz electromagetic anomalies prior to the L'Aquila earthquake as pre-seismic ones.  …Save to LibraryDownloadby Stavros Nikolopoulos•  9  Geology, Science Communication, Information Theory, Complex SystemKARDIA: A Matlab software for the analysis of cardiac interbeat intervalsSave to LibraryDownloadby Mateus Joffily•  23  Algorithms, Biomedical Engineering, Statistical Analysis, Software DevelopmentMultifractal structure in Latin-American market indicesWe study the multifractal nature of daily price and volatility returns of Latin-American stock markets employing the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis.

Comparing with the results obtained for a developed country (US) we conclude that the multifractality degree is higher for emerging markets. Moreover, we propose a stock market inefficiency ranking by considering the multifractality degree as a measure of inefficiency. Finally, we analyze the sources of multifractality quantifying the contributions of two factors, the long-range correlations of the time series and the broad fat-tail distributions. We find that the multifractal structure of Latin-American market indices can be mainly attributed to the latter.Save to LibraryDownloadby dario perez•  8  Engineering, Time Series, Stock Market, Emerging MarketApplication of detrended fluctuation analysis to monthly average of the maximum daily temperatures to resolve different climatesSave to LibraryDownloadby Levent Kurnaz•  21  Environmental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical PhysicsLONG-RANGE DEPENDENCE IN EXCHANGE RATES: THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEMSave to LibraryDownloadby Sergio Souza•  3  Mathematical Sciences, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Hurst ExponentMultifractal analysis of meteorological time series to assess climate impactsAgro-meteorological quantities are often in the form of time series, and knowledge about their temporal scaling properties is fundamental for transferring locally measured fluctuations to larger scales and vice versa.

However, the scaling analysis of these quantities is complicated due to the presence of localized trends and nonstationarities. The objective of this study was to characterise scaling properties (i.e. statistical self-similarity) of the chosen agro-meteorological quantities through multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). For this purpose, MFDFA was performed with 11322 measured time series (31 yr) of daily air temperature, wind velocity, relative air humidity, global radiation and precipitation from stations located in Finland, Germany, Poland and Spain. The empirical singularity spectra indicated their multifractal structure. The richness of the studied multifractals was evaluated by the width of their spectrum, indicating considerable differences in dynamics and development. In log-log plots of the cumulative distributions of all meteorological parameters the linear functions prevailed for high values of the response, indicating that these distributions were consistent with power-law asymptotic behaviour. Additionally, we investigated the type of multifractality that underlies the q-dependence of the generalized Hurst exponent by analysing the corresponding shuffled and surrogate time series. For most of the studied meteorological parameters, the multifractality is due to different long-range correlations for small and large fluctuations. Only for precipitation does the multifractality result mainly from broad probability function. This feature may be especially valuable for assessing the effect of change in climate dynamics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaromir Krzyszczak•  7  Time Series, Temperature, Multifractal Analysis, Fractals and multifractalsA multifractal approach for stock market inefficiencySave to LibraryDownloadby Benjamin Sarmiento•  6  Mathematical Physics, Quantum Physics, Time Series, Stock MarketClassifying Mood Disordered Patients and Normal Subjects Using Various Machine Learning TechniquesSave to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management Studies [IJARCSMS] ijarcsms.com•  5  Machine Learning, Data Mining, EEG, Lyapunov exponentEmpirical Analysis of Time SeriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Marcel Ausloos•  10  Finance, Time Series, Statistical Physics, Economic SystemFractals for physiciansSave to LibraryDownloadby Georgette Stern and +1Cindy Thamrin•  8  Pediatrics, Complexity, Fractals, HumansFractal analyses for ‘short’ time series: A re-assessment of classical methodsSave to LibraryDownloadby Loïc Lemoine and +1Marina Fortes•  11  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical PsychologyMultifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and local scale exponents of inter spike intervalsABSTRACT The study presents the analysis of detrended fluctuations (DFA) in inter spike intervals (ISI) of neuronal ensemble from cortex of awake behaving macaque monkeys.

The original DFA method was applied to analyze fluctuation of variances from fitted trends of different order. The spectrum of local scale exponent was calculated to investigate the presence of different scaling regions. It was observed that the single scaling exponent is insufficient to describe the firing pattern dynamics, the better fit is achieved using both short-term a1 and long-term α2 scaling coefficients. The validation procedure using phase randomized surrogates provided more reliable local scale exponents&amp;#39; estimates. Generalized DFA analysis revealed the presence of multifractality in ISI time series. Results indicate that multifractality is partly due to the broad probability distribution function and partly due to the presence of long-range correlations. Isodistributional surrogate data were used to test the significance of generalized Hurst exponent spectrum and origin of multifractal behavior. In conclusion, both DFA and its multifractal expansion reveal the presence of long-range correlation in ISI time series indicating the presence of memory in the neuronal firing pattern.Save to LibraryDownloadby Emmanuel Procyk•  25  Engineering, Cognitive Science, Mathematical Physics, Earth SciencesLong-term persistence and multifractality of precipitation and river runoff recordsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jan Kantelhardt•  7  Multidisciplinary, Power Law, Geophysical, Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisLong-range correlation in cosmic microwave background radiationSave to LibraryDownloadby Sohrab Rahvar•  12  Engineering, Data Analysis, Stochastic analysis, Cosmic Microwave BackgroundA multifractal approach for stock market inefficiencySave to LibraryDownloadby dario perez•  6  Mathematical Physics, Quantum Physics, Time Series, Stock MarketRESPONSIVENESS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 TO ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS: A NOTEA statistically significant correlation between annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the annual rate of accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere over a 53-year sample period from 1959-2011 is likely to be spurious because it vanishes when... moreA statistically significant correlation between annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the annual rate of accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere over a 53-year sample period from 1959-2011 is likely to be spurious because it vanishes when the two series are detrended.

We find that the first-digit distributions of both Babylon and England commodity prices follow Benford’s law, indicating that the data represent empirical observations typically arising from a free market. Further, we find that the normalized prices of both Babylon and England agricultural commodities are characterized by stretched exponential distributions, and exhibit persistent correlations of a power law type over long periods of up to several centuries, in contrast to contemporary markets. Our findings suggest that similar market interactions may underlie the dynamics of ancient agricultural commodity prices, and that these interactions may remain stable across centuries in two distinct historical periods.Save to LibraryDownloadby Natalia Romero, Ph.D. and +1Clifford Brown•  7  Complexity Theory, Econophysics, Babylon, CuneiformOn the self-affinity of the electroencephalogram: Evaluation of a whole spectrum of scale coefficients by detrended fluctuations analysisSave to LibraryDownloadby Roberta Carabalona•  5  Temporal Resolution, Electroencephalogram, Spectrum, Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisGlucose series complexity in hypertensive patientsSave to LibraryDownloadby Carmen Lourdes Rodriguez•  19  Adolescent, Spain, Humans, Blood GlucoseWavelet-based estimators of scaling behaviorSave to LibraryDownloadby Jean-françois Muzy and +1J.-f.

Detrended correlation analysis of temperature in five global regions from two different sources did not show that surface temperature is responsive to changes in the logarithm of atmospheric CO2 at an annual time scale. Correlations observed in source data are thus shown to be spurious. We conclude that the empirical Charney Climate Sensitivity function is specious because it is based on a spurious correlation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Munshi•  5  Climate Change, Applied Statistics, Global Warming, Detrended Fluctuation AnalysisA Multifractal Description of Wind Speed RecordsSave to LibraryDownloadby Rajesh Kavasseri•  7  Engineering, Mathematical Sciences, Power Law, Long RangeNextLast »Related TopicsCharacterization of Mn doped ZnS nanocrystalline powder dispersed in polyvinyl alcoholFollowFollowingFRACTAL COSMOSFollowFollowingEconophysicsFollowFollowingStatistical MechanicsFollowFollowingNonlinear dynamicsFollowFollowingPhysicsFollowFollowingBiologyFollowFollowingComputer ScienceFollowFollowingEducationFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
