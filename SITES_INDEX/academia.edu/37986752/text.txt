Location: History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Location: Oudemanhuispoort 4-6, 1012 CN Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Abstract: Goethe’s autobiographical text, Italian Journey, draws a direct parallel between his own revelatory experience of life and the world of art in Venice and a mystical vision recounted in Jacob Böhme’s biography. In the latter, it is said that Böhme came to be enlightened about the “secret nature” of the universe after looking at a polished pewter bowl. This passage in The Italian Journey is the only time Jacob Böhme’s name is explicitly mentioned in Goethe’s entire oeuvre. There are diametrically opposed interpretations as to its significance. Scholars like Ronald Douglas Gray prefer to suppose Goethe extensively reading Böhme’s mystical writings and related authors in 1769 as a 20-year-old. While for more recent researchers like Paola Meyer, any deeper Böhmean impact on Goethe’s writings should be rejected: “Although it is possible that Goethe did read Böhme, there is absolutely no evidence to this effect.” In this paper I argue that evidence for a threefold impact of Böhme’s writings and visionary experience can be immanently found in Goethe’s works. Firstly, Goethe presents a Böhmean conception and instances of a polysemic Adamic language in his Farbenlehre (Theory of Colour). Secondly, the idea of Great Chain of Being, implicit in Böhme’s vision of the polished bowl, is artistically reflected in several examples in Goethe’s poetic writings that are strikingly interrelated with Böhme’s theosophical writings. Thirdly, Goethe consciously interlinked and textually placed his own scientific and artistic epiphanies as forms of initiatory experience into the same tradition of mystical enlightenment recounted in Jacob Böhme’s biography. All this can be summed up by saying: Goethe adopted and modified in a scientific, poetic and biographical manner Böhme’s philosophical doctrine of signatures.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers"The materiality of visionary experiences in the Greek magical papyri.

Descriptions of these visitations - described in the present work as 'visions' - have been found in a wide range of written accounts including materials not traditionally regarded as 'religious', such as philosophy, literature, and those areas of study - alchemy, astrology, theosophy, and various magical traditions - known as Western Esotericism.
