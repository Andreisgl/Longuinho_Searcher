Six surface soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected from different sites in El-Dakhla Oasis. The values equilibrium activity ratio of potassium (AR k o) ranged between 0.0071 (soil 3) to 0.0320 (mol/L) 1/2 (sample no. 1). The labile K (-ΔK 0) values also, varied from 0.020 (sample no. 4) to 0.412 (cmol/kg soil (sample no.1).The values of the potassium potential buffering capacity (PBC K) of soil ranged from 0.964 to 12.86 [(Cmol kg-1 /(mol L-1) 0.5 ]. Generally, the highest value of AR k o , ΔK 0 , PBC K parameters were related in soil sample no. 1[(0.032 (mol/l) 0.5 , 0.412 cmol/kg, and 12.86 [(cmol kg-1 /(mol L-1) 0.5 ], respectively. The AR k o was a negatively significant correlated with exchangeable potassium (r=-0.822), Organic matter (-0.633) and available K (-0.444). A positive highly significant correlation was obtained between the labile K (-ΔK 0)and both exchangeable Ca and Mg (r=0.936 and 0.941, respectively). The PBC K showed a positive significant correlation with clay content, available K and cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), but it was negatively significantSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Available Phosphorus Assessment of Gharb El-Mawhoob Soils, El-Dakhla Oasis, EgyptThirty-four soil samples were collected from Garb El-Mawhob soils, northwest of El-Dakhla oasis, ... more Thirty-four soil samples were collected from Garb El-Mawhob soils, northwest of El-Dakhla oasis, New Valley governorate, Egypt to evaluate the soil available phosphorus and its relation with the properties of these soils. These samples were taken from the surface (0-30 cm) and subsurface layers (30-60 cm) of 17 soil profiles covered the study area. Most of the soil samples had a texture of loamy sand, sandy clay loam and clay. In most cases, the studied soils showed mild alkaline pH (7.4 to 7.8) values. The electrical conductively (EC e) and Ca-CO 3 of these soils varied from low to high levels and ranged from 1.05 to 163 dS/m and from 2.2 to 57.58%, respectively. The soil organic matter content differed from 0.08 to 2.27%. Also, the soluble cations and anions in most of the studied soils followed the order of Ca +2 >Na + > Mg +2 > K + and Cl-> SO 4 = > HCO 3-, respectively. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR e) of these soils were ranged from 6.58 to 57.49 cmolc/kg and from 0.11 to 45.18%, respectively. The NaHCO 3-extractable soil phosphorus of these soils varied from 2.25 to 65.35 mg/kg in the surface layer and from 3.34 to 24.49 mg/kg in the subsurface one. In general, about 50% of the studied soil samples had a low level of available P (< 6 mg/kg), 24% of them showed a medium level (6-10 mg/kg) and 26% of them contained a high level of available P (>10 mg/kg). Moreover, the studied soil samples that had clay and clay loam textures contained a high level of available P than those having other textures. The available P showed highly significant positively correlation, with some soil properties, such as OM, HCO 3-, CEC and silt contents, while it was negatively correlated with EC e , Na + ,CaCO 3 and Ca +2 .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A... more Restoration of shooting range soils is an emerging environmental issue for nature conservation. A large number of shooting ranges is present in Egypt without paying attention to controlling the environmental pollution. The main objective of this research was to investigate the integrated effect of applying biochar (BC) derived from sugar cane wastes for soil fertility improvement and lead (Pb) stabilization. To achieve this goal, sugar cane wastes were collected, and used for producing the BC. A small-scale BC production unit was designed by using double metal barrels; thereafter, sugar cane wastes were placed and burned inside the BC producing unit. The produced BC was used to restore the biological function of a polluted shooting range soil by immobilizing Pb and improving the soil fertility. A surface sandy loam soil was collected from a shooting range site in the Giza Governorate-Egypt and was incubated for 365 days with different application levels (0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 and 30.0% w/w) of BC. The results showed that the addition of BC significantly increased the soil water holding capacity, available nutrients (N and P) and cation exchange capacity as well as stimulated the microbial growth (bacteria and fungi) in the soil. Moreover, the addition of BC led to a significant decrease in the available Pb fraction by 97.0%, as compared to the untreated soil. The phytotoxicity test revealed that the addition of BC significantly increased maize biomass (shoots and roots), especially with applications of 3% and 5% treatments. However, no plant growth occurred on the untreated soil. Furthermore, Pb uptake by maize plants significantly decreased with increasing the level of applied BC. Our findings provide evidence that BC application decreased Pb toxicity by immobilizing Pb and improving soil quality. Therefore, BC can be effectively used for sustainable development and environmental protection.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim of current study is to asses the effect of nitrogen fertilizer types (urea and ureaform) at different levels on soil organic carbon decomposition. Soil organic carbon decomposition percentage (SOCD) is at a minimum amount in the 2 nd week and at a maximum amount in the 7 th week at the recommended urea level-15% (R-15%). The biweekly SOCD % varied from 0.82 and 9.55 % at 70 kg N/fed level (R-30%). SOCD% ranged between 0.16-12.73, 5.14-10.61 and 0.41-8.78% for ureaform level at (R-15%) and (R-30%) less than the recommended one (R), respectively. The amount of soil CO 2 flux from recommended ureaform level treatment was the highest one during the entire growing season. Overall, SOCD% followed the order of R > R-15% > R-30%. The highest values of SOCD % were 8.4 and 8.2 at 2.4 Q 10 value with urea and at 2.7 Q 10 value with ureaform, respectively. The lowest values of SOCD % were 2.3 and 4.4 at 2.2 Q 10 value with urea or ureaform, respectively. Soil C: N raties under all treatments were higher than that of initial state except that under R-30% of urea. The soil C: N ratio was higher at R-15% of urea than that when soil treated by ureaform. The opposite trend is true at R-30%.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rates of SOMW are zero, 10, 20 and 30gkg-1 were mixed with 200g of soil samples and moistened to the field capacity, and then incubated at 30±2ºC for zero, 30, 60 and 90 days. The results indicated that the soil P forms of soluble-P, NaHCO 3-P, NaOH-P, and HCl-P increased with increasing the rate of (SOMW) application, also increases up to 60 days of incubation, then decreased at 90 days. Residual-P form decreased with increasing the rate application, as well as the increase in the time of incubation. The highest of all P forms (except the residual-P one) were obtained at the highest application level. For the soil chemical properties, soil salinity of the studied soil significantly increased. On contrast, the soil pH and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) decreased with increasing both of SOMW level and the time of incubation. Meanwhile, soil organic matter increased with increasing the level of SOMW, and decreased with increasing the incubation time. Dry mater yield and P uptake by wheat plants grown on the soil decreased with increasing the addition of the waste material.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This new book presents leading-edge research fromaround the world.Expert Commentary - Eddy covariance technology has been used for crop water usemeasurements (evapotranspiration, ET) widely because its operation is relatively simple andthe equipment is less expensive than constructing a lysimeter. However, this technology hasenergy closure problems. These problems can be caused by low wind speed, stableconditions, horizontal flux or/and canopy roughness. In addition, wind sensor leveling, airhumidity, and footprint can affect the ET measurement accuracy. This commentary discusseshow to check ET measurement accuracy and how to measure accurate ET using eddycovariance technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
