A History of Free and Open Source - Introduction  ~ by Peter H. Salus
            Monday, March 28 2005 @ 08:46 AM EST
        
Historian Peter H. Salus is writing "A History of Free and Open Source", and I'm delighted to tell you that he is going to be publishing it in serialized form here on Groklaw.  We thought that, with ADTI back with its Grim Fairy Tales, it would be useful to tell the FOSS story truthfully and in a scholarly way, so  readers now and historians in the future can rely on the facts.  Here's the first installment, the Introduction, and I know you will enjoy it.  Look for the next episode on the 6th or 7th of April and every Wednesday or Thursday after that.
Dr. Salus is  the author of "A Quarter Century of UNIX" and several other books, including "HPL: Little Languages and Tools", "Big Book of Ipv6 Addressing Rfcs", "Handbook of Programming Languages (HPL): Imperative Programming Languages", "Casting the Net: From ARPANET to INTERNET and Beyond", and "The Handbook of Programming Languages (HPL): Functional, Concurrent and Logic Programming Languages". There is an interview with him, audio and video,"codebytes: A History of UNIX and UNIX Licences" which was done in 2001 at a USENIX conference. Dr. Salus has served as Executive Director of the USENIX Association.********************************

A History of Free and Open Source
~ by
Peter H. Salus
Preface
The activities of a distributed and unorganized band of scholars 
led to the conceptual revolution that produced the modern world.  
For example, Copernicus (1473-1543) observed the heavens and recorded 
his measurements.  In 1563, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) noted that Copernicus' 
figures weren't quite right, so, from 1577 to 1597, Tycho recorded 
extraordinarily accurate astronomical measurements.  In 1599 Tycho 
moved from Denmark to Prague, where Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) was 
his assistant, until he succeeded him in 1601, when Tycho died.
Copernicus established heliocentricity.  Tycho found that circular orbits 
just didn't work, and devoted decades to better measurements, which Kepler 
later used to determine that the orbits were ellipses, not circles.  (In 
1610, Galileo [1564-1642] pointed out that one could observe phases on Venus, 
and that therefore Venus must be nearer the Sun than the Earth was.)  And, 
Newton (1643-1727) showed us the force (gravity) that held everything  in place.
Poland. Denmark. Austria. Italy. Germany. England.  Despite the Papacy, the 30 
Years' War, turmoil in the Netherlands, in France, and in England, thought moved 
in print and in correspondence.  Though countries were at war and religions 
were in conflict, scientific exchange of ideas and sharing of data persisted.
During the Renaissance it could take months for findings to reach those interested 
in other countries.  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries lengthy epistles 
between scholars were distributed to others beyond the addressees. Scientific journals 
followed. Thanks to the progress of communications media, it now takes seconds 
where it once took decades for an idea or a discovery to proliferate.  The fact 
is undeniable:  Invention and scholarship have been the motor driving the development 
of civilization and culture.
The revolution of knowledge has led us to exploration and discovery.  The computer, 
the Internet, and the Web have led to a similar revolution.  While certainly no computer 
user, Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Isaac McPherson (13 August 1813), wrote:
 If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others 
of exclusive  property, it is the action of the thinking power called 
an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he 
keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself 
into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess 
himself of it. 
My aim is to show how the advent of the computer and the Internet have 
given rise to the expansion of the academic/scholarly notions of sharing, and how 
this in turn has brought us free and open software, which will bring about a major 
change in the way we do business.
This effort is more than a history of Linux, of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), 
the Internet, software licensing, and myriad other topics.  It will contain a number 
of histories within it, which (I hope) will serve as an antidote to the cloud of 
FUD stirred up by those who fear that change will mean that their businesses will 
fail (certainly more a sign of lack of imagination and flexibility than of anything else).
On the contrary:  change yields opportunity.  But change also requires adaptability.  
We are embarking on a new business model, which will change the way we do business as
 much as mass production and global electronic communication did over the 19th and 
20th centuries.
Since 1990, there has been an insistent drumbeat of anti-FSF FUD.  Since 2000,
this has focused on Linux.  Some examples of this are:
On June 1, 2001, Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, told the Chicago Sun-Times: 
"Linux is cancer."
On October 15, 2002, Darl McBride, CEO of The SCO Group, said: "We are more committed 
to Linux than ever before."
On March 4, 2003, Blake Stowell, SCO director of Public Relations, said: "C++ is one 
of the properties SCO owns."
On May 14, 2004, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution issued a press release in which 
it revealed that its Director, Ken Brown, had discovered that Linus Torvalds had not 
"invented" Linux.
On August 26, 2004, Kieran O'Shaughnessy, director of SCO Australia and New Zealand, 
told LinuxWorld: "Linux doesn't exist.  Everyone knows Linux is an unlicensed version 
of Unix."
The remarks are noise.  But though ludicrous, statements like these make businessfolk 
fearful.  They then hug Windows the way a different Linus clutches his blanket. My goal 
here is to show a wider audience just what went into the creation of open source and 
its worldwide network of contributors and users over the past 50 years.
Over four centuries have passed since our static heliocentric universe was replaced by
a dynamic one.  Today, the business model that has persisted since the late eighteenth 
century is being replaced.  Here's how it's happening.

"We are more committed to Linux than ever before."
this is possibly true, but it's what commitment they have to Linux that is the
key....maybe stamping it out or consuming it and claiming it as theirs?

The second to last sentence: "Today, the business model that has persisted
since the late eighteenth century is being replaced."
A lot of things suddenly make so much more sense. Colonialism, emperialism, and
capitalism are all institutions based on a power structure that forces an
authoritarian control over lives or property. 
Open source and globalization are forcing more "cooperative"
behaviors. Maybe we need a new word, because it isn't communism or socialism,
but it isn't cut throat capitalism or facism either.
Cooperatism? 
We are learning -- relearning? -- or is it finally realizing that we can all
work together and still compete, can still be economically viable. This is how
science has worked since the dawn of man. Perhaps more ominously for the pure
capitalists out there, the *only* way in which business can exist in a peaceful
world.[ Reply to This | # ]

This was a time when there was little distinction between church and government

spite of these obstacles, the idea of free exchange of scientific data and

How do user groups figure in?
Authored by: Anonymous on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 10:09 AM EST
DECUS, SHARE, and other computer user groups in the 60's were set up as
clearinghouses for DEC and IBM software, with great success for those
manufacturers.  Terms for software eligible for submittal were slightly
different (DECUS stuff had to be in the public domain, SHARE was slightly more
complicated).  How do these figure into Salus's history of open source?  They
seemed to work pretty well despite the nonexistence of the GPL.[ Reply to This | # ]

new business model only for certain industries
Authored by: LouS on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 10:12 AM EST
First of all, thank you - I look forward to reading the rest of the 
installments.
One minor nit to pick:  This reads as if the new business model will 
happen in all industries, which I don't think you mean.  E.g.,  if I get a 
car's design documents when I buy a car, it does not enable me in any 
practical way to make a revised car, or even to hire someone else to do 
so for me, because it is so expensive to make a "one-off" car from a 
design.  So, an "open design" car movement is unlikely.[ Reply to This | # ]

A History of Free and Open Source - Introduction  ~ by Peter H. Salus
Authored by: Groklaw Lurker on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 10:57 AM EST
Peter H. Salus' book "A Quarter Century of Unix" is one of the most
insightful and interesting books I've ever read. Even after a decade or more, it
occupies a revered place on my bookcase. I can think of no one more likely to
produce the definitive work on the history of FOSS than Dr. Salus. We are
fortunate indeed to have him as the biographer of the FOSS movement.
Thank you Dr. Salus, for the contributions you've already made to FOSS and those
contributions that are yet to come.

Salus repeating FUD
Authored by: Anonymous on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 11:58 AM EST
"Despite the Papacy ..."  This is listed first and foremost as an impediment to
science?  This is a rote repetition of convenient anti-Catholic rhetoric, and
better should be expected of you.
Let's not turn this into a big,
noisy, pro/con Catholic/Christian/religion thread!  But please educate
yourselves a little bit.  See 
this
link for a good, well-researched essay on the Church and Gallileo –
not the Church's best moment, but hardly what it's usually made out to be by
anti-Catholic agitators.[ Reply to This | # ]

A Minor Nit
Authored by: snorpus on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 12:00 PM EST
FUD, FOSS, and other acronyms aren't well known outside the computing community.
Hopefully, the finished product will contain a glossary or other means of
clarifying such terms.
Otherwise, an outstanding beginning; I especially like
the larger historical context. I'll be making the paper (book?) one of the
required outside readings in the Introduction to Information Science
course I'll be teaching this fall.---73/88 de KQ3T ---

Couple of Questions
Authored by: rm6990 on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 03:40 PM EST
Here are a few questions for Peter H. Salus or PJ, whomever wishes to answer
them.
1) Does the Creative Commons license PJ normally use apply to this work? I
wouldn't mind making a PDF of it when it is finished for redistribution.
2) Is it going to be made into an actual book? I wouldn't mind buying a copy if
it is.
3) About how long is this going to be?[ Reply to This | # ]

Licence Terms
Authored by: sjgibbs on Monday, March 28 2005 @ 03:56 PM EST
Would PJ or Dr Salus care to elaborate on the licence terms under which the book
will appear on Groklaw? and the print edition? Can we assume Creative Commons,
per Groklaw?
Also, could you clarify whether this a draft version or a final edit? Some
comments, above, assume the former.

Stowell's quote

On March 4, 2003, Blake Stowell, SCO director of Public Relations, said: "C++
is one of the properties SCO owns."
Wow, he really said that? That's
breathtaking! Does anyone have the source?

Tycho Brahe - fix possibly needed
Authored by: macrorodent on Tuesday, March 29 2005 @ 05:16 AM EST
Copernicus established heliocentricity. Tycho found that circular orbits just
didn't work, and devoted decades to better measurements, which Kepler later used
to determine that the orbits were ellipses, not circles.
But apparently
Tycho Brahe himself did not believe in the heliocentric system! To account for
the observations that did not fit the classical geocentric model, he tried to
patch it:
Tycho developed a system that combined the best of both worlds.
He kept the Earth in the center of the universe, so that he could retain
Aristotelian physics (the only physics available). The Moon and Sun revolved
about the Earth, and the shell of the fixed stars was centered on the Earth. But
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolved about the Sun. He put the
(circular) path of the comet of 1577 between Venus and Mars. This Tychonic world
system became popular early in the seventeenth century among those who felt
forced to reject the Ptolemaic arrangement of the planets (in which the Earth
was the center of all motions) but who, for various reasons, could not accept
the Copernican alternative.
