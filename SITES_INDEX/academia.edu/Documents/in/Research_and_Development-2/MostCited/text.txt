There has been a tremendous increase in BCI research the last years, which might lead to the belief that we are close to a commercially available BCI applications to patients. However, studies with users from the future target group (those who are indeed paralyzed) are still outnumbered by studies on technical aspects of BCI applications and studies with healthy young participants. This might explain why the number of patients who use a BCI in daily life, without experts from a BCI group being present, can be counted on one hand.Save to LibraryDownloadby Femke Nijboer•  25  Engineering, Electroencephalography, Brain Computer Interface, Spinal Cord InjuryThe Google file systemSave to LibraryDownloadby Bahrul Rachmatulloh•  12  Operating Systems, Distributed System, Fault Tolerance, Distributed Data MiningLinked: The new science of networksSave to LibraryDownloadby Eva Jackson•  19  Management, Management Information Systems, Economics, BibliographyDigital image processingThe field of digital image processing is reviewed with reference to its origins, progress, current status, and prospects for the future.

Consideration is given to the evolution of image processor display devices, developments in the functional components of an image processor display system (e.g. memory, data bus, and pipeline central processing unit), and developments in the software. The major future trends include: increased performance through very large scale integration and integral array processors, the use of the optical video disc as an image storage medium, and automatic image analysis.Save to LibraryDownloadby A R•  17  Information Systems, Optical Engineering, Image Processing, Image AnalysisThe Price of Innovation: New Estimates of Drug Development CostsThe research and development costs of 68 randomly selected new drugs were obtained from a survey of 10 pharmaceutical firms.

These data were used to estimate the average pre-tax cost of new drug development. The costs of compounds abandoned during testing were linked to the costs of compounds that obtained marketing approval. The estimated average out-of-pocket cost per new drug is US$ 403 million (2000 dollars). Capitalizing out-of-pocket costs to the point of marketing approval at a real discount rate of 11% yields a total pre-approval cost estimate of US$ 802 million (2000 dollars). When compared to the results of an earlier study with a similar methodology, total capitalized costs were shown to have increased at an annual rate of 7.4% above general price inflation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ibitoye Adeniyi Francis•  20  Health Economics, Drug development, Applied Economics, Cost EstimationAppropriating the Returns from Industrial Research and DevelopmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Nelson S•  2  Applied Economics, Research and DevelopmentA review on machinery diagnostics and prognostics implementing condition-based maintenanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Dragan Banjevic•  13  Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Decision Making, Signal ProcessingPolymer nanotechnology: nanocompositesSave to LibraryDownloadby Smart Kutti•  7  Engineering, Fuel Cell, Polymer, Research and DevelopmentProgress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet--The state of eTourism researchSave to LibraryDownloadby Vrushank Shah•  9  Marketing, Information Technology, Tourism Management, EBusinessProduction of first and second generation biofuels: A comprehensive reviewSave to LibraryDownloadby Kumar Goud•  12  Engineering, Production, Biomass, Environmental SustainabilityA roadmap of agent research and developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Robert Thompson•  7  History, Cognitive Science, Multi Agent System, Autonomous AgentsSupercritical fluid extraction.

Many research and development groups in academia and industry are contributing to the increase of (basic) knowledge/(applied) know-how. However, from a systematic point of view the knowledge gaining process seems not to be coherent. One reason is the lack of a general applicable model which combines the basic principles with measurable sensor parameters. The approach in the presented work is to provide a frame model that deals with all contributions involved in conduction within a real world sensor. For doing so, one starts with identifying the different building blocks of a sensor. Afterwards their main inputs are analyzed in combination with the gas reaction involved in sensing. At the end, the contributions are summarized together with their interactions. The work presented here is one step towards a general applicable model for real world gas sensors.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pravin More•  5  Materials Engineering, Electroceramics, Research and Development, Gas SensorBrain-computer interface technology: a review of the first international meetingSave to LibraryDownloadby marwa el diwiny•  25  Robotics, Algorithms, Biomedical Engineering, Signal ProcessingA survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosisSave to LibraryDownloadby jim shah•  27  Engineering, Microelectronics, Ubiquitous Computing, BiosensorsRelated variety, unrelated variety and regional economic growthSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank van Oort•  11  Human Geography, Regional policy, Economic Theory, Urban And Regional PlanningThe Stock Market Valuation of Research and Development ExpendituresWe examine whether stock prices fully value firms’ intangible assets, specifically research and development (R&D).

Under current U.S. accounting standards, financial statements do not report intangible assets and R&D spending is expensed. Nonetheless, the average historical stock returns of firms doing R&D matches the returns of firms without R&D. However, the market is apparently too pessimistic about beaten-down R&D-intensive technology stocks’ prospects. Companies with high R&D to equity market value (which tend to have poor past returns) earn large excess returns. A similar relation exists between advertising and stock returns. R&D intensity is positively associated with return volatility.Save to LibraryDownloadby abhishek deb•  8  Finance, Stock Market, Developing Country, Research and DevelopmentBeyond high tech: early adopters of open innovation in other industriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Henry Chesbrough•  4  R&D Management, Open Innovation, Business and Management, Research and DevelopmentElaborating a model of teacher professional growthSave to LibraryDownloadby David Clarke•  6  Professional Development, Teacher professional development, Education Research, Teacher LearningFrom visual simulation to virtual reality to gamesSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael  Zyda•  7  User Interface, Video Game, Virtual Reality, Research and DevelopmentConservation agriculture and smallholder farming in Africa: The heretics’ viewSave to LibraryDownloadby Ernst Witter•  20  Adoption, Agriculture, South Africa, No tillageAdvanced Technology Paths to Global Climate Stability: Energy for a Greenhouse PlanetSave to LibraryDownloadby Francesco Garzilli•  16  Climate Change, Wind Energy, Carbon Dioxide, ScienceWhen the Problem Is Not the Question and the Solution Is Not the Answer: Mathematical Knowing and TeachingThis paper describes a research and development project in teaching designed to examine whether and how it might be possible to bring the practice of knowing mathematics in school closer too what it means to know mathematics within the... moreThis paper describes a research and development project in teaching designed to examine whether and how it might be possible to bring the practice of knowing mathematics in school closer too what it means to know mathematics within the discipline by deliberately altering the roles and responsibilities of teacher and students in classroom discourse. The project was carried out as a regular feature of lessons in fifth-grade mathematics in a public school. A case of teaching and learning about exponents derived from lessons taught in the project is described and interpreted from mathematical, pedagogical, and sociolinguistic perspectives. To change the meaning of knowing and learning in school, the teacher initiated and supported social interactions appropriate to making mathematical arguments in response to students’ conjectures.

Ad hoc networking concept is not a new one, having been around in various forms for over 20 years. Traditionally, tactical networks have been the only communication networking application that followed the ad hoc paradigm. Recently, the introduction of new technologies such as the Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and Hyperlan are helping enable eventual commercial MANET deployments outside the military domain. These recent evolutions have been generating a renewed and growing interest in the research and development of MANET. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of this dynamic field. It first explains the important role that mobile ad hoc networks play in the evolution of future wireless technologies. Then, it reviews the latest research activities in these areas, including a summary of MANET’s characteristics, capabilities, applications, and design constraints. The paper concludes by presenting a set of challenges and problems requiring further research in the future.Save to LibraryDownloadby Simon Matabva•  19  Distributed Computing, Wireless Communications, Security, RoutingUltra-wideband communications - An idea whose time has comeSave to LibraryDownloadby Georgios Giannakis•  15  Mechanical Engineering, Signal Processing, Antenna arrays, Research and DevelopmentFloating drug delivery systems: an approach to oral controlled drug delivery via gastric retentionSave to LibraryDownloadby Md.

In many parts of the world, direct solar radiation is considered to be one of the most prospective sources of energy. However, the large-scale utilisation of this form of energy is possible only if the effective technology for its storage can be developed with acceptable capital and running costs. One of prospective techniques of storing solar energy is the application of phase change materials (PCMs). Unfortunately, prior to the large-scale practical application of this technology, it is necessary to resolve numerous problems at the research and development stage. This paper looks at the current state of research in this particular field, with the main focus being on the assessment of the thermal properties of various PCMs, methods of heat transfer enhancement and design configurations of heat storage facilities to be used as a part of solar passive and active space heating systems, greenhouses and solar cooking.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Nadjib•  16  Engineering, Renewable Energy, Heat Transfer, Solar EnergyFuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells: Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st centurySave to LibraryDownloadby Wayne Grant•  19  Engineering, Sustainable Development, Energy Consumption, High Energy Density PhysicsMultisensor data fusionSave to LibraryDownloadby Ankita Jani•  22  Robotics, Algorithms, Image Processing, Pattern RecognitionFuel ethanol production: Process design trends and integration opportunitiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Nwabuebo Okem Romanus•  28  Design, Biotechnology, Biomass, BioenergyMyoelectric control systems—A surveySave to LibraryDownloadby Mohammadreza Asghari Oskoei•  8  Biomedical Engineering, Pattern Recognition, Control system, Medical BiotechnologyEnvironmental and technology policies for climate mitigationSave to LibraryDownloadby Carolyn  Fischer•  19  Environmental Economics, Technology, Climate Change, Renewable EnergyCOFDM: An overviewSave to LibraryDownloadby neha behl•  4  Digital Modulation, Research and Development, Digital television, Electrical And Electronic EngineeringWastewater treatment high rate algal ponds for biofuel productionSave to LibraryDownloadby Andy Shilton•  16  Carbon Dioxide, Biomass, Water Purification, Wastewater TreatmentAn overview of foodborne pathogen detection: In the perspective of biosensorsFood safety is a global health goal and the foodborne diseases take a major crisis on health.

Therefore, detection of microbial pathogens in food is the solution to the prevention and recognition of problems related to health and safety. For this reason, a comprehensive literature survey has been carried out aiming to give an overview in the field of foodborne pathogen detection. Conventional and standard bacterial detection methods such as culture and colony counting methods, immunology-based methods and polymerase chain reaction based methods, may take up to several hours or even a few days to yield an answer. Obviously this is inadequate, and recently many researchers are focusing towards the progress of rapid methods. Although new technologies like biosensors show potential approaches, further research and development is essential before biosensors become a real and reliable choice. New bio-molecular techniques for food pathogen detection are being developed to improve the biosensor characteristics such as sensitivity and selectivity, also which is rapid, reliable, effective and suitable for in situ analysis. This paper not only offers an overview in the area of microbial pathogen detection but it also describes the conventional methods, analytical techniques and recent developments in food pathogen detection, identification and quantification, with an emphasis on biosensors.Save to LibraryDownloadby Catherine  Adley•  24  Engineering, Technology, Food Safety, BiosensorsTrade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A SurveySave to LibraryDownloadby Kamal Saggi•  29  Engineering, Sociology, Economic Growth, Foreign Direct InvestmentFrom content to context: Videogames as designed experienceSave to LibraryDownloadby kurt squire•  16  Game Theory, Epistemology, Education, HeuristicsTransferring R&D knowledge: the key factors affecting knowledge transfer successSave to LibraryDownloadby sha  shaja•  9  Informatics, Knowledge Management, Knowledge Transfer, New Product DevelopmentGATE - a General Architecture for Text EngineeringSave to LibraryDownloadby Yorick Wilks•  16  Cognitive Science, Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Computational LinguisticsNextLast »Related TopicsFinancial DistressFollowFollowingBorrowingFollowFollowingCredit Default SwapsFollowFollowinginternationalization of SMEsFollowFollowingInnovationFollowFollowingWebsite DesignFollowFollowingSystems and Synthetic BiologyFollowFollowingtoksik Logam beratFollowFollowingCytotoxicityFollowFollowingResearch Proposal Writing StyleFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
