Toronto feels like an inadequately air-conditioned museum of its former self, and the same could be said of her life. She dreams of the past, her days as a newlywed, a new mom, a new homeowner gutting the kitchen—now the only novel experience that looms is the threat of divorce.Everything changes when she googles "escape" and discovers the world of amateur lock-picking. Breaking into houses is thrilling: she’s subtle and discreet, never greedy, but as her curiosity about other people’s lives becomes a dangerous compulsion and the entire city feels a few degrees from boiling over, she realizes she must turn her guilty analysis on herself. A searingly insightful rendering of midlife among the anxieties of the early twenty-first century, Breaking and Entering is an exacting look at the fragility of all the things we take on faith.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextLiterary FictionContemporary Women'sFamily LifeLanguageEnglishPublisherBiblioasisRelease dateAug 15, 2023ISBN9781771965248Switch to audiobookStart your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to Breaking and EnteringRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextEspecially the Bad ThingsEbookEspecially the Bad ThingsbyGreg GerkeRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Especially the Bad Things for laterLarge Animals in Everyday Life: StoriesEbookLarge Animals in Everyday Life: StoriesbyWendy BrennerRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Large Animals in Everyday Life: Stories for laterTravelling SprinklerEbookTravelling SprinklerbyNicholson BakerRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Travelling Sprinkler for laterLone Stars: A NovelEbookLone Stars: A NovelbyJustin DeablerRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Lone Stars: A Novel for laterDoom CreekEbookDoom CreekbyAlan CarterRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Doom Creek for laterCeaseless RainEbookCeaseless RainbyDorothy MahoneyRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Ceaseless Rain for laterWalk On The Wild SideEbookWalk On The Wild SidebyNicholas ChristopherRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Walk On The Wild Side for laterZest: Essays on the Art of LivingEbookZest: Essays on the Art of LivingbyIain BamforthRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Zest: Essays on the Art of Living for laterHoot to KillEbookHoot to KillbyKaren DudleyRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Hoot to Kill for laterThe White VanEbookThe White VanbyPatrick HoffmanRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The White Van for laterCelebration: A NovelEbookCelebration: A NovelbyHarvey  SwadosRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Celebration: A Novel for laterInvisible BloodEbookInvisible BloodbyLee ChildRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Invisible Blood for laterHigher EdEbookHigher EdbyTessa McWattRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Higher Ed for laterMaking MusicEbookMaking MusicbyPatrick CotterRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Making Music for laterLamentation: A NovelEbookLamentation: A NovelbyJoe CliffordRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Lamentation: A Novel for laterThe Blue AbsoluteEbookThe Blue AbsolutebyAaron ShurinRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Blue Absolute for laterThe Feast of PanthersEbookThe Feast of PanthersbySean EadsRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Feast of Panthers for laterLong for This World: A NovelEbookLong for This World: A NovelbyMichael ByersRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Long for This World: A Novel for laterCardinal Numbers: StoriesEbookCardinal Numbers: StoriesbyHob BrounRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Cardinal Numbers: Stories for laterA Prison In The SunEbookA Prison In The SunbyIsobel BlackthornRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave A Prison In The Sun for laterTraces of TimeEbookTraces of TimebyLucio MarianiRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Traces of Time for laterAbsolution: 2012 WINNER OF THE SPEAR'S FIRST BEST BOOK AWARDEbookAbsolution: 2012 WINNER OF THE SPEAR'S FIRST BEST BOOK AWARDbyPatrick FlaneryRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Absolution: 2012 WINNER OF THE SPEAR'S FIRST BEST BOOK AWARD for laterDoghouse Roses: StoriesEbookDoghouse Roses: StoriesbySteve EarleRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Doghouse Roses: Stories for laterHouseholdersEbookHouseholdersbyKate CayleyRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Householders for laterAndrew and TobiasEbookAndrew and TobiasbyJ.I.M.

Tap to rateWrite a reviewReview must be at least 10 wordsBook previewBreaking and Entering - Don Gillmorone prologue At night, the street regained its innocence. Everything still and stored away. A few lights were on, mostly for security. The people asleep, the air heavy and unmoving. The sound of air-conditioning units — rattling, wheezing, struggling, a symphony. A few cats moving languidly. The line of cars, dark and foreign. There were so few lawns now. Everyone had prairie grass or Japanese maples or ajuga, straw-coloured and dry. Once inside you saw the furniture, the incomplete set of dishes, the big screen. In the basements were discarded toys and the faint smell of mould. The third floors abandoned, impossible to keep cool in this weather. The shoes lined up near the door, always more than anyone could practically use. The keys in a ceramic bowl they’d brought back from Seville or Istanbul. Coats for every kind of weather except what they had right now, lined up on hooks waiting for fall. On the refrigerators, reminders and clever quotes held by magnetic bumblebees. On the calendars, days circled in red. A week of half-read newspapers (who has the time). Inside the cupboards were well-intentioned juicers and panini makers, idle for a year. You needed to look farther than that. Into the drawers that held vibrating toys, into the hard drives that held plans and bank accounts and fetishes. Into closets containing expensive dresses bought on sale and never worn. Revealing journals and medical histories and old love letters tied quaintly with string. Finally, you had to look into those sleeping heads. Thoughts of adultery, wayward urges. Unnamed panic — standing naked in front of the school assembly (again). Trying to fly but having some trouble, pursued by something lumbering and dangerous. The fear of poverty, of failure, the future. Afraid for their vulnerable children and their suddenly vulnerable parents. And the pragmatic nagging — did I turn off the stove (you did). And finally, a longing that was impossible to name, an ache that starts in your heart and spreads, waves of something, a heavy feeling that brings tears, a mix of nostalgia (Old Yeller getting it in the puss again) and sadness and unmoored memories floating just out of reach. Every house held this. But you only took what was valuable. That was the key. deadish There was a woman in Boston who thought she was dead. Bea had read about it in the morning paper. She had a rare psychiatric disorder — Cotard’s Delusion — where she denied her existence. Faced with overwhelming evidence to the contrary — her husband, daughter, her reflection — she remained unconvinced she was alive. Because of the current heat wave, she thought she was in hell. Her husband showed her their wedding pictures, a mortgage statement, a photo of their daughter’s communion, and she just shook her head, no. And standing in the gallery, looking at Warhol’s Elvis print for perhaps the thirtieth time, Bea wondered if she had a touch of Cotard’s. The gallery was almost deserted. It was still morning, a weekday, just her and the King. There were four Elvises — two in fading black and white, two in lurid colour — all aiming a six-gun straight at her. He was wearing what looked like lipstick, on the right side of the law. If this version could have seen the bloated, sequined version, wobbly on Quaaludes, singing Unchained Melody in his final concert, that smile like a broken boy, what would he have done? Though what would any of us do if faced with their future self? The few people in the gallery may have been there simply to avoid the heat. It was early May and not yet noon, and it was already oppressive. The air was heavy and dirty, the air of August, an anomaly that was dissected every night on the local weather report. Bea lingered in the Henry Moore gallery for a bit, his heroic bronzes splayed out, those solid, sensuous women. Moore had been gassed at Cambrai, one of the few survivors of his unit. As a child he had rubbed liniment onto his rheumatic mother’s bare back. She remembered these tidbits from a course she used to teach — The Aesthetics of Sexuality and Erotic Art, a class that always drew a crowd. Bea walked into the bright light of the galleria and sat at the small café and ordered an espresso and wondered if she had spent too much time in this gallery and not enough in others. What happened to the Prado? The Tretyakov in Moscow? The Picasso museum in Barcelona to witness the great beast of twentieth-century art? Trips that were planned, or at least mentioned, or at least imagined. How much of life is regret? There should be an app that gives you a running tally, like the remaining battery life on your phone. Through the soaring windows she observed the street below. On the sidewalk a bearded man stood rooted, staring up at the sun. If she’d had a sketch pad with her, she might have sketched him. As an art student she’d gone to Florence, and carried her sketch pad everywhere, partly an affectation, hoping people would think: there goes an artist. The city was filled with students, smoking and arguing in cafés as if the future depended on them discovering it. The man across the street hadn’t moved. Bea wondered if this was some kind of performance. In terms of aesthetics, there was a fine line between art student and homeless. The man looked to be in his twenties. Maybe someone was filming it from a vantage Bea couldn’t see and this was part of a school project. It wasn’t the kind of day where you stared at the sun to feel it on your face, enjoying the first rays of spring. This was already a vengeful sun. Bea watched him unbutton his shirt, his face still staring up. He slipped out of his shirt and twirled it over his head like a stripper and let it go. It landed on the roof of a parked car. He was partly obscured by the car, but he bent down and Bea guessed that he was taking off his pants. He came up holding them. He twirled them too and let them go and they landed on the patio of a café behind him. Another dip and he came up with his underwear, which he slingshotted into traffic. It landed on the windshield of an SUV and the wipers came on and immediately swept them onto the street. The man resumed his pose, staring up at the sun, naked, his thin, pasty body shining like a landed trout. People on the sidewalk stopped and crossed the street to avoid him. His eyes were closed. They remained closed when the police car stopped. Two officers got out, a man and a woman. The man had one hand on his hip, ready to pull something out. The woman had her head bent to one shoulder, talking into a microphone fastened to her uniform. They approached the man, talking to him. The man remained impassive, eyes closed, staring up. The woman cop saw his pants on the patio and put on medical gloves then retrieved them. She held the pants up for him. His eyes didn’t open. He didn’t talk. The two cops looked at each other. Whadawe got here. They were probably telling him he had to put on his pants or they’d take him in. An EMS van pulled up and two people got out. They put on gloves. They talked to the cops. One of the EMS guys said something to the guy. No response. Bea sipped her espresso. People had stopped now. It was safe with the police there. Maybe this was part of the art project, to see what would happen after the police arrived and film it. A student short with a title like Adam Discovers the Police State. The sun bleached the street. Approaching noon, high and unyielding, two weeks into a heat wave. The police had sunglasses on. They stood on each side of the man, took an arm, and started to move him toward the police car. Suddenly the man snapped out of his catatonia and thrashed violently. They all fell into a heap on the sidewalk, and Bea couldn’t see what was happening, a car blocking her view. She wanted to both know and not know. But she saw people with their phones out, filming. She could probably find it on YouTube in an hour. The EMS pair ran to their truck and rolled out the stretcher and wheeled it up to the man on the sidewalk. They managed to get him onto the stretcher with difficulty. There was blood on his face. It looked like blood. They strapped him in and wheeled him to the truck and trundled him in. The police got in their car. Both vehicles pulled away. Bea was shaken slightly. Even from this distance, with no real sound, it was disturbing. She looked up and saw the barista was looking at her. It was just the two of them in the vast galleria. City’s full of crazies, he said, shrugging. You think he’s mentally ill? Standing out there, staring at the sun like that. Take off his clothes. I’d say batshit. Bea took the last bitter sip of espresso. She looked at her phone. He might be a sun gazer, the barista said. A sun gazer. So it’s this ancient practice, Mayans and the Aztecs. We studied it in my anthropology class. There are people who stare at the sun, they believe they can achieve photosynthesis, that they no longer have to eat. So no one in Florida has to eat. Yeah, not an airtight theory. There’s a guy claims he hasn’t eaten in twenty years, gets all the energy he needs from the sun. There was a contest. Guys staring at the sun for, like, days. But it turned out someone slipped the winner a Big Mac, which kind of . . . Bea looked at the barista, who was roughly the same age as her son. Early twenties, on the cusp of manhood. It used to be thirteen was the cusp of manhood, but it kept getting pushed up. Would you like another espresso? No, I can only have one this late in the morning or I’m up half the night. He nodded and took out the espresso handle and gave it a sharp crack on the knock box. I work here three days a week, and you should see some of the shit that happens out there. Bea nodded, waiting for the shit that happened. Last week this guy in a Spiderman costume perched on the mailbox for, like, three hours. Saving humanity. There is so much random shit in this world. Random was what life did best, Bea thought. It conferred cancer on the virtuous, drunk drivers on the unsuspecting, it matched noble wives to unfinished men, wickedness to wealth, weakness to power. It dealt from the bottom of the deck, blew up buses, lingered in the shadows with a shiv. Bea got up and gathered her purse. I hope your day doesn’t get any more random, she said as she left. Outside, the air had a surprising weight. It clung to her. The street was an underdeveloped photograph, the colours leached. She was already hot. Two Asian women walked by with umbrellas against the sun. A girl rode by on a bicycle with a filter strapped to her face. It had a vampire graphic, fangs, drops of blood. Ahead of her a coyote loped across the street with something in its mouth. Bea walked east in the unwelcome glare. the gathering She’d been to this dinner party before. Three couples that had had the same conversations, eaten the same salmon teriyaki left just a minute too long under the broiler. Wild salmon, Katherine said when she served it. It would be cheaper to fly to the coast and fish for it myself. Bea lingered for a moment on the social geometry that bound them: Roger and Penelope, Katherine and Philip, her and Sanger, the cross-hatching of friendship and habit and cultivated desire; Roger wanted to fuck her. He wanted to fuck everyone. Philip didn’t want to fuck anyone, especially his wife. Who knew about Sanger? Bea observed her husband with a critical eye that twenty-three years of marriage had sharpened. Sang was toying with his fork, artfully moving things around. Not a man of appetites. Slim, modishly and cautiously dressed, his movements just short of athletic. He was arguing with Roger. You need to see it from his perspective, Roger said. Actually I don’t, Sang said. I don’t need to see it from anyone’s perspective but my own. I think what Roger is trying to say — This was Penelope, always the diplomat. I don’t need a fucking interpreter. This isn’t the UN. Roger pulled the cigarette package out of his shirt pocket and took one out. For a second, it seemed as if he would light it. When was the last time Bea had seen someone light a cigarette inside a house? It had to have been more than a decade, maybe two decades. Perhaps it had been Bea herself. She’d quit twelve years ago, more or less. Everyone had. Except Roger. Roger got up awkwardly and scooped up his wineglass and walked stiffly toward the sliding door. A messy, ursine man, slew-footed, overweight, bearded, an enviable mane that was greying so aristocratically she thought he might be dyeing it. Smoke, he said simply. Close the door behind you, Katherine said. We don’t want the hot air coming in. Or the smoke, said Penelope. Bea watched Penelope watching her husband stand outside blowing smoke toward the stars, taking another deep drink of his wine. Penelope used a small scale she’d bought at Williams Sonoma to weigh her food. She was a size four and worried she could balloon to a six if she wasn’t vigilant. Dark-haired, controlled, a smile that looked as though it came with a set of instructions — Lift both corners of your lips in an upward fashion, careful not to create lines at the eyes. Roger’s taste in pornography was exclusively for amateur eastern European women, middle-aged, a bit zaftig, businesslike, kneeling. This was his current taste, at least. A month from now, who knew? It could be Asian teens. Men were unable to remain faithful even to their fantasies. When Roger came back in, Bea felt the rush of hot air. It was 10:30 p.m. and still oppressive. The air conditioning couldn’t actually cool the house down, could only keep it from being unbearable. Sanger got up to help clear the plates, quickly stacking Penelope’s barely touched plate on top of his own. Sanger, with that exotic name. At least, it had been exotic when they met. But Sang wasn’t exotic. He was a history professor. Even his name was in the past tense. Sing Sang Sung, Roger had once said, one of his sly put- downs. Sang took the plates into the kitchen, making helpful noises. Katherine wasn’t a brilliant cook. Her meals looked more or less like something from a magazine though were oddly bland. One of the reasons Bea had abandoned Facebook was to avoid Katherine’s posts, which were often photographs of her dinners. She was pretty in a finite way, the mother of two sour children. Philip, her husband, was late arriving. He’d been at a conference in Paris and was supposed to be back by seven, and Bea wondered if she’d scheduled the dinner party so that Philip would arrive in the middle of it, evidence of their international lives. Philip finally arrived at eleven, some business at customs. He looked crumpled and itchy. Katherine walked over and kissed him. It was, Bea noted, an awkward kiss, he aimed for her mouth and she turned her cheek. Philip came over and kissed Bea. He trailed that airplaney scent, a thrift shop mixed with microwaved chicken. He sat down and poured a glass of wine and droned on about Paris. Ghastly heat, worse than here. Old people dying in their attic apartments . . . Bea looked at Sang, who was staring at a spot in the middle of the table. She had looked at his face the last time they’d had sex (how many months ago?) and saw that he immediately changed his expression, as if he was trying for something more appropriate. He stuck with it, like a middle-distance runner who knows he’ll finish near the back of the pack. He had stopped going down on her two years ago, and she hadn’t decided if she was offended or relieved. The last time he’d done it, she wasn’t sure he was there. He was there, but it was like a dentist’s drill in your frozen tooth: you know it’s there, but you don’t really feel anything. Forty-two degrees, Philip said. Forty-two. Death Valley. They had to police the public fountains. People jumping in with their clothes on. I can’t imagine that water was any cooler than the air. Roger was swirling wine in his glass, looking at a fixed point somewhere near the fixed point Sang was staring at, both waiting for Philip to put a lid on it. All three men were academics, or at least had been; Roger had left his philosophy job to sell real estate. They had once been garrulous and ambitious and argued theatrically, but their careers were no longer visible, like the outline of the moon on a summer morning, neglected and pale. In the wake of her second glass of wine (limit of three, and only at dinner parties, and only because it was a necessity, something a doctor might prescribe) she forgave them all. Forgave Philip his intellectual bullying and family money, forgave Katherine her prescribed magazine life, forgave Penelope her clenched, tentative engagement with the world, hiding behind the outgoing bulk of her husband. She forgave Roger his enviable and undeserved ease in the world, and forgave her husband though she wasn’t sure what she was forgiving him for. Which only left herself. She hadn’t quite managed that. Not yet. Forgiveness, acceptance. Were these steps on the AA journey? By eleven thirty, it was much hotter inside the house. It was odd. You’d think it would start getting cooler, but it didn’t. That didn’t happen until 4 a.m. or so. The heat captured during the day still building inside. It didn’t help that everyone had gotten so agitated. The Danish film conversation wasn’t going well. I was a fan of nymphomania until I saw Von Trier’s film, Roger said. It takes the Danes to turn you against something like nymphomania. That’s a talent. Maybe that was the point, Katherine said. Not everyone is a fan of a degrading psychiatric condition. Don’t knock degradation, Roger said. It has its place. Our entire faculty is built on the concept, Sang said. Von Trier seems only interested in degradation, Bea said. Tarantino does revenge, Von Trier degradation. What was the one with the Irish pop star? Penelope said. Not Irish. Scandinavian. Björk. The pixie. Right, with what’s-his-name. Is that the one where the son kills himself at the wedding? The son always kills himself at the wedding in Danish films. No, it was a British actor. They’re in everything. Sir . . . They’ve all been fucking knighted . . . Björk doesn’t sing, though. There’s a rape scene . . . There’s always a rape scene. It’s the one, you know it . . . Penelope turned to Roger for help. With what’s-her-name, Australian sort of . . . Nicole Kidman! She gets raped, I think. Is that the one with Tom Cruise? Wrong difficult incomprehensible director. This was how every discussion on film went, Bea thought. No one could remember titles, actors, directors. Lost the plot. They needed the group to piece something together. It was less a discussion than a treasure hunt. There’s a name for his style of filmmaking. Boring. Dogma . . . something something. Dogma 22. Dogme. Dogme 95. I think Willem Dafoe was in the one I saw, with that French woman. She makes purses. Antichrist! This last was said in unison, as if both Roger and Sang were game show contestants, or accusing one another. And that ended the Danish film conversation. Bea, have some of the truffled pecorino, Katherine said, quickly filling the void. It’s from that cheese thug in the village. Vicious prices, Philip said. And they’re going up! Katherine said. Something about a shortage of motivated truffle pigs in Tuscany. Thanks, I’m not feeling brilliant, Bea said. A touch of Cotard’s. Katherine nodded and took a small piece for herself. Things crawled on until after midnight, later than usual. Katherine had been sending subtle signals that it was time to go for almost an hour. Perhaps it was simply the heat. No one wanted to go out and face it. Sang suggested walking a few blocks then flagging a cab rather than calling one. Get some air, he said. I don’t know that you can call it air, Bea said. More like oxygenated soup. There were kisses at the door, and careful, damp hugs. Bea opened the door. The air had a viscosity, it offered resistance. Sang began to tell their hosts a golfing anecdote. It was one of his most irritating qualities, to start a story at a point when everyone wanted the evening to be over. Bea wanted it to be over, and she could see that both Philip and Katherine did as well. None of them golfed, including Sang. He’d golfed once years ago, on a public course where he sliced a ball that hit a city bus going by. Everyone had heard this story, there was no context to introduce a golf story, and they were all hot and tired. As he wound through the familiar curves, Bea could feel a real anger rising. Sang, it’s late . . . He bulled ahead with his pointless story. The air in the house seemed suddenly hotter. Bea leaned on the small table by the door for support while Sang droned on about his six-iron. They finally left, and walked two blocks to Bloor Street, Sang’s forehead already shiny with sweat. They turned east and strolled past cafés and restaurants, the street filled with young people. They would be living in apartments that were too hot to sleep in, waiting for the slightly cooler air, hoping that with enough beer and tequila they could fall asleep at 3 a.m. then wake in the stew of noon with a damp stranger beside them. The madness of the wee hours hovered, the poor decisions, awkward mornings, the exhaustion and regret and smoke that clung to you.
