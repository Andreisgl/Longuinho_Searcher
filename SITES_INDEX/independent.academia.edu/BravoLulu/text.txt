Priorities and challenges for hepatitis B control in the Philippines and the importance of a vaccine dose at birthby Salvacion  Gatchalian, Lulu Bravo, and Tilman RuffThe Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,  2009The Philippines annual birth cohort of over 2 million is the second largest in the Western Pacifi... more The Philippines annual birth cohort of over 2 million is the second largest in the Western Pacific Region; 44% of births occur outside health facilities. With third dose infant hepatitis B (HB) vaccine coverage of 43% in 2006, erratic vaccine supply, and lack of policies or processes for universal HB vaccine birth dose delivery, a substantial burden of preventable chronic HB infection continues to occur. Funding, policy, technical and immunization delivery developments now make substantial progress in HB control in the Philippines possible. These developments can help expand access to trained birth care and essential postnatal care for mothers and their newborn.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The new DTPw-HBV-Hib combination vaccine can be used at the who schedule with a monovalent dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birthby Salvacion  Gatchalian, Lulu Bravo, and C.

There were no clinically relevant differences in the immune response to any component between the mixed and separate administrations. In fact the anti-tetanus GMTs were significantly higher (p=0.002) in mixed administration (3.9 IU/ml) compared with the separate administration (1.9 IU/ml). However although all subjects achieved anti-PRP titers &gt; or = 0.15 microg/ml, higher anti-PRP GMTs were seen in the group receiving the separate administration. Importantly, the addition of Hib did not adversely alter the reactogenicity profile of DTPw-HBV. This report which demonstrates that this novel combination can be used in WHO recommended schedule.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Children aged 6 to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;36 months and 36 to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;72 months received 0.25 mL and 0.50 mL doses, respectively. Immunogenicity was assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (n=2435) on Days 1, 29, 50 and 209. Safety was assessed up to Day 394. After the second vaccination (Day 50), the aTIV group showed significantly higher geometric mean HI titers and seroconversion rates than the TIV-1 or TIV-2 groups against all homologous and heterologous strains. The difference was enhanced at HI titers ≥110. aTIV elicited a faster, more persistent antibody response, with significantly higher titers in the aTIV group after one vaccination (Day 29) and after six months (Day 209) than in either TIV group. aTIV was more reactogenic than were TIV-1 and TIV-2 but rates of severe adverse events were very low for all three vaccines. In infants and young children, the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine induced substantially faster (after one dose), higher, persistent HI titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccines, with consistently higher seroprotection rates at increased threshold HI titers.

This 2-year hospital-based, prospective, surveillance study was conducted at 3 study sites in urban areas of the Philippines to estimate IPD and pneumonia incidence in children and describe the serotype distribution of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Children aged 28 days to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;60 months residing within the 3 surveillance areas presenting with possible IPD were enrolled. Initial diagnosis, history of pneumococcal vaccine receipt and previous antimicrobial treatment were recorded. Blood specimens were collected for S. pneumoniae identification and serotyping. Final diagnosis was determined for hospitalized subjects, subjects whose culture yielded S. pneumoniae and subjects with clinically suspected meningitis. A total of 5940 subjects were enrolled, 47 IPD cases identified. IPD site rates were 33.49 per 100,000, 25.38 per 100,000 and 25.85 per 100,000. Chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia incidence ranged from 633.74 to 1683.59 per 100,000. Highest chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia incidence occurred in those 28 days to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;6 months of age at 2 sites (2166.16 and 3891.94 per 100,000) and those 6-12 months of age at the third site (3847.52 per 100,000). Thirty-five S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped; most commonly identified were serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6B, 14 and 18F. One serotype 14 isolate was erythromycin resistant. Previous antibiotic therapy was documented in 17-53% of subjects; 2 subjects had received pneumococcal vaccine. At 2 sites, one-third of IPD subjects died. IPD is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among urban children in the Philippines. Our data support the expectation that widespread immunization would decrease IPD disease burden.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Randomized Double-Blind Clinical Trial of a Maltodextrin-Containing Oral Rehydration Solution in Acute Infantile Diarrheaby Lulu Bravo and Grace  BattadJournal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition,  1993A double-blind, randomized controlled study was used to compare the efficacy and safety of an ora... more A double-blind, randomized controlled study was used to compare the efficacy and safety of an oral rehydration solution either with minimally hydrolyzed maltodextrins or the standard recommended glucose. One hundred twenty pediatric patients with acute watery diarrhea (60 in each group) were studied, but only 116 patients were included in the final analysis. After rehydration, outcome variables did not differ significantly at p &amp;lt; 0.05. Mean duration of diarrhea was 52.5 +/- 32.2 h for the control group (median, 50.8 h) and 57.2 +/- hours for the study group (median, 45.3 hours). Comparisons of the mean stool output, weight gain, and ORS intake on the 24th h and from admission to discharge were not statistically significant. Differences in laboratory parameters consisting of mean serum sodium, potassium, total CO2, hematocrit, plasma total solids, urine specific gravity, and random blood sugar were likewise not significant. Differences in stool pH and reducing sugars were statistically significant; however, the observed values were still within normal range. All laboratory values improved upon rehydration. Replacement of glucose with maltodextrins did not offer added advantages in reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Children aged 28 days to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;60 months residing within the 3 surveillance areas presenting with possible IPD were enrolled. Initial diagnosis, history of pneumococcal vaccine receipt and previous antimicrobial treatment were recorded. Blood specimens were collected for S. pneumoniae identification and serotyping. Final diagnosis was determined for hospitalized subjects, subjects whose culture yielded S. pneumoniae and subjects with clinically suspected meningitis. A total of 5940 subjects were enrolled, 47 IPD cases identified. IPD site rates were 33.49 per 100,000, 25.38 per 100,000 and 25.85 per 100,000. Chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia incidence ranged from 633.74 to 1683.59 per 100,000. Highest chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia incidence occurred in those 28 days to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;6 months of age at 2 sites (2166.16 and 3891.94 per 100,000) and those 6-12 months of age at the third site (3847.52 per 100,000). Thirty-five S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped; most commonly identified were serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6B, 14 and 18F. One serotype 14 isolate was erythromycin resistant. Previous antibiotic therapy was documented in 17-53% of subjects; 2 subjects had received pneumococcal vaccine. At 2 sites, one-third of IPD subjects died. IPD is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among urban children in the Philippines. Our data support the expectation that widespread immunization would decrease IPD disease burden.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Randomized Double-Blind Clinical Trial of a Maltodextrin-Containing Oral Rehydration Solution in Acute Infantile Diarrheaby Lulu Bravo and Grace  BattadJournal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition,  1993A double-blind, randomized controlled study was used to compare the efficacy and safety of an ora... more A double-blind, randomized controlled study was used to compare the efficacy and safety of an oral rehydration solution either with minimally hydrolyzed maltodextrins or the standard recommended glucose. One hundred twenty pediatric patients with acute watery diarrhea (60 in each group) were studied, but only 116 patients were included in the final analysis. After rehydration, outcome variables did not differ significantly at p &amp;lt; 0.05. Mean duration of diarrhea was 52.5 +/- 32.2 h for the control group (median, 50.8 h) and 57.2 +/- hours for the study group (median, 45.3 hours). Comparisons of the mean stool output, weight gain, and ORS intake on the 24th h and from admission to discharge were not statistically significant. Differences in laboratory parameters consisting of mean serum sodium, potassium, total CO2, hematocrit, plasma total solids, urine specific gravity, and random blood sugar were likewise not significant. Differences in stool pH and reducing sugars were statistically significant; however, the observed values were still within normal range. All laboratory values improved upon rehydration. Replacement of glucose with maltodextrins did not offer added advantages in reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
