As was first detailed in Chapter 4, several emergence-based modeling and research-methodology categories are being utilized in this study in order to foreground the conjectured Sôd stratum. These principally range from E. D. Hirsch’s three investigative criteria (the author’s cultural given, the author’s horizons, and the question of genre), to Husserl’s notions of hyletic-noetic-noematic structure of an “act of consciousness” and Jakobson’s six factor/functions of a literary text, and finally to Ronald Langacker’s cognitive-linguistic “grounds” and Prieto’s semiotic notions of semantic and noetic “fields.” If one has in one’s hands a hard copy of the Pentateuch, perhaps one can visualize simultaneously amassed within it no fewer than six separate continua, or six “worlds of meaning” (including the three hyletic-noetic-noematic “worlds” of the conventional, or literal reading, which however, are all contained within the visible narrative channel within the Pentateuch). As one can see from Figure 5.1, apportioned among and within the three Sôd-related continua are five of the six Jakobsonian factor/functions of a textual communication. The sixth one—the CONTACT, along with its so-called phatic function—is carried by the physical book that one holds, being the actual medium of transmission of Pentateuchal communication. Allotted to the other five factor/functions are, first of all, three separate contexts of the Sôd—designated as Setting, Topic, and Object—representing the Jakobsonian CONTEXT/referential function in the three respective continua. Second are three distinct “grounds,” directed to the ADDRESSEE/conative function. Third is a single ground—the Meta-Ground—where the ADDRESSER, that is, the author(s) of the Pentateuch, is positioned. Fourth is a single factor/functional occurrence of the MESSAGE/poetic function, marked as the poiesis—that is to say, the employment of literary craftsmanship exhibited in the text in question; it is present only in the Noetic-Inferring Continuum. Fifth and finally, the CODE/metalingual function is distributed among the continua, respectively, as “fields” of “inferential signifiers,” “conferential signifieds,” and “deferential referents.”See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersFAQs apropos of A.

In this chapter, I consider contemporary defenses of this conceptual approach to apriority in order to clarify their core commitments. The common thread is a metasemantical picture, which combines a conceptual role model of conceptual competence with a rationalizing interpretation account of the determination of semantic contents. The bulk of the chapter seeks to bring out the controversial assumptions involved in this model of conceptual competence and to sketch an alternative model that fulfills the core theoretical roles associated with concepts. On the proposed alternative model, there is no general commitment to apriori conceptual truth.Download Free PDFView PDFHow detached is technical writing? Teaching interpersonality with NTSB aircraft-accident dockets onlineCarmen Sancho GuindaAircraft-accident dockets are collaboratively written and summarise the circumstances and outcome of aviation mishaps. Those issued online by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are addressed to a broad mixed readership that may be emotionally affected by the facts reported if death tolls and serious injuries are involved. Therefore, interpersonality plays a crucial role in this type of texts, which I use to reflect on how we ESP teachers can raise polytechnical students’ sensitivity towards their audiences. With that purpose I draw on an electronic corpus of 1,673 samples reporting fatal accidents between 2005 and 2012.Download Free PDFView PDFPoliteness in East AsiaHonorifics: The cultural specificity of a universal mechanism in Japanese2011 • barbara pizziconiDownload Free PDFView PDFMind & LanguageCan We Believe What We Do Not Understand?2008 • Francois RecanatiDownload Free PDFView PDFCog-ApprNgân ThuDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
