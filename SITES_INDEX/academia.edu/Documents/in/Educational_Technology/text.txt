The student and faculty perspectives of campus technology are often assessed; however, we rarely understand how technology impacts staff that support student success and academic advising practices. The 2013 Technology in Advising Use in Higher Education survey was designed to learn about how advising staff, faculty, and administrators utilize technologies in their academic advising practices. In cooperation with the Global Community for Academic Advising (NACADA) association and the NACADA Technology in Advising Commission, this study is concerned with how technology is being used and integrated into academic advising practices and services on campus.Save to LibraryDownloadby George Steele•  2  Educational Technology, Academic AdvisingA multiliteracies-oriented project-based assessment for intermediate foreign language Italian courses, Tests that Second Language Teachers Make and Use, 2019This multiliteracies-oriented test is currently being used in intermediate Italian courses at a large public university in the southwestern United States.

It was designed to replace the traditional oral assessments that are question-answer based, during which learners are providing predictable short answers to predictable, predetermined questions. In the multiliteracies-oriented test presented here, students perform tasks designed using the pedagogy of multiliteracies (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009; Kern, 2000; New London Group, 1996). A multiliteracies framework perceives learning as a process of discovery (Paesani, Allen, & Dupuy, 2015, p. 23), and learners are not only preparing for an assessment, but they are also engaging in forethought, design, and reflection while reading, writing, listening, and speaking.Save to LibraryDownloadby Margherita (Maggie) Berti•  9  Multiculturalism, Educational Technology, Computer Assisted Language Learning, Italian StudiesTechnology in professional educationEducational theory is reviewed in context of its implications for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL).

Drawing on theory as well as strategic recommendations for use of TEL in Higher Education Institutions, this study undertook an exploratory study into the use of two educational technologies, namely online lectures and collaborative wiki tools, in a legal professional higher education setting. Research objectives include assessing ELT’s effectiveness in terms of student engagement, collaborative learning and learning outcomes. Results strongly suggest that this two-part online learning environment is appreciated by students, and importantly is associated with increases in perceived learning and critical analysis observations. Findings also indicate that flexibility, and in particular, opportunities for repeated lecture engagement are pivotal to enhanced learning. However, this study also reveals that digital skill gaps and participation inhibition prevent an inclusive learning environment. Recommendations for future research and the teaching profession are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Caroline Coles•Educational TechnologySelf-regulated and Technology-enhanced Learning: a European perspectiveSave to LibraryDownloadby Karl Steffens•  7  European Studies, Education, Educational Technology, Educational ResearchDistributed leadershipSave to LibraryDownloadby Kip Glazer•  6  Educational Technology, Teacher Leadership, Educational Leadership, Teacher leadership, informal social and political networks in schools, cultures and Policy development, School LeadershipSocial Presence and Communication Technology: Tales of Trial and ErrorSocial presence, as evident in the chapters throughout this book, continues to be a hot topic in online education.

When, possibly, that same tool or application is used to enhance the way a learner works and thinks, and as such has effects that reach further than the learning situation in which it is used, then one speaks of learning from the tool or application. This article concentrates on the latter. It zooms in on the use of mindtools in education—computer programs and applications that facilitate meaningful professional thinking and working—because this is the epitome of learning from ICT. Mindtools and cognitive tools help users represent what they know as they transform information into knowledge and are used to engage in, and facilitate, critical thinking and higher order learning.

Rescaling the local: Multi-academy trusts, private monopoly and statecraft in England. Journal of Educational Administration and History, 49 (2), 171-185For the past six years successive UK governments in England have introduced reforms intended to usher in less aggregated, top-down, bureaucratically overloaded models of service delivery as well as secure conditions for greater school autonomy.  Yet the ‘hollowing out’ of local government has not resulted in less bureaucracy on the ground or less regulation from above, nor has it diminished hierarchy as an organising principle of education governance.  In some cases, monopolies and monopolistic practices dominated by powerful bureaucracies and professional groups persist, albeit realised through the involvement of new actors and organisations from business and philanthropy.  In this paper I adopt a governmentality perspective to explore the political significance of large multi-academy trusts (MATs) – private sponsors contracted by central government to run publicly funded schools – to the generation of new scalar hierarchies and accountability infrastructures that assist in bringing the gaze of government to bear upon the actions of schools that are otherwise less visible under local government management.  On this account, it is argued, MATs are integral to statecraft and the invention and assemblage of particular apparatuses for intervening upon specific organisations, spaces and peoples.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Wilkins•  87  Critical Theory, Business, Management, Business AdministrationExamining Indigenous Students' Persistence in a Hybrid Pre-Nursing Transitions EnvironmentTransitions programs to support non-traditional students have been in existence in Canada since the educational reform movement of the 1970s (Malatest & Associates, 2004).

Despite investment in these programs, more than thirty years later there still exists a considerable gap between Indigenous students’ graduation rates and those of their non-Indigenous counterparts, with significant numbers of students dropping out of university programs within the first year (Statistics Canada, 2011).      The goal of this exploratory case study was to determine what attributes of the design and structure of a hybrid learning environment encouraged positive persistence decisions. The case was positioned within the first year of an Indigenous Pre-Nursing Transitions (PNT) program in a western Canadian university. Scholarly literature on persistence and community models such as Tinto’s (1975) Student Integration Model and Wenger’s (1998) Community of Practice were evaluated for their applicability to non-traditional students. Data collection took place over one academic year and consisted of interviews with student and faculty participants, as well as observation of online activities within two required biology courses. The results of this case study demonstrated the complexity of community membership for Indigenous students. Further, the results highlighted the importance of a one-to-one relationship with the instructor and student expectations about this relationship. Other factors that contributed to positive persistence decisions were scale of the environment and structure of course content.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kathy Snow•  5  Educational Technology, Indigenous education, Hybrid Learning, Nursing EducationWill media influence learning?

The article reframes the questions raised by Clark to explore the conditions under which media will influence learning. Specifically, it posits the need to consider the capabilities of media, and the methods that employ them, as they interact with the cognitive and social processes by which knowledge is constructed. This approach is examined within the context of two major media-based projects, one which uses computers and the other, video. The article discusses the implications of this approach for media theory, research and practice.Save to LibraryDownloadby Robert Kozma•  7  Educational Technology, Criticism, Learning theories, Context EffectUsing the Delphi Technique in Educational Technology ResearchAs educational technology practitioners and researchers engage in research in the field, a wide array of research methodologies are available to them.

Yet the emergence of E-approaches to cognition, wherever they sit on the conservative-radical spectrum, represents an undeniably important development for understanding cognition. Educational research and practice should take serious stock of these approaches for the simple reason that questions of how to educate cannot be kept apart from questions about how we think and learn. This chapter reviews empirical findings in the E-cognition domain that lend credence to Shapiro and Stolz’s (2019) claim that, “the emerging research agenda of embodied cognition has much to offer educational practitioners, researchers, and/or policy-makers” (p. 34). This chapter brackets question about the philosophical barriers that may, for some, block the acceptance of E-approaches and how to deal with them. It focuses instead on possible practical outcomes of such acceptance. Taking an imaginative leap, it asks: Assuming one adopted either a more conservative or more radical E-framework, how would that choice matter to one’s thinking about educational research and practice?Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel D.

La question se pose de l'apport du numérique ou de sa perturbation concernant les conditions d'élaboration des apprentissages des jeunes et autres publics. Cet article pointe les éléments de convergence ou de divergence entre les situations d'enseignement et les conditions d'usage du numérique dans les organismes de formation. Il rappelle que le numérique est aussi accompagné par une pression sur les rythmes de travail des formateurs et que les conditions de sa mise en oeuvre, à défaut d'être réunies, engendrent parfois un scepticisme légitime. La diffusion du numérique tend à oublier la finalité de l'apprentissage, les difficultés d'une appropriation instrumentale et s'opère le plus souvent par injonctions fondées sur la croyance en ses vertus. L'article évoque en conclusion les conditions d'une rencontre au bénéfice des individus, de leurs apprentissages et des pratiques des formateurs. Le métier de formateur évolue au gré des évolutions sociales, institutionnelles, culturelles et techniques, auxquelles il doit pour partie sa pérennité. Ainsi, le développement des outils numériques est actuellement évoqué comme un domaine clef de l'évolution du métier. Le "numérique" en effet, associé aux outils et aux techniques, prend aujourd'hui une dimension quasi anthropologique au sens où il affecte toutes les dimensions de la vie. A ce titre, d'aucun évoquent un univers numérique dont il est question dans ce dossier. C'est pourquoi le monde de la formation se trouve aujourd'hui continuellement sollicité. Le numérique est partout, générant des comportements nouveaux : pourquoi n'a-t-il pas envahi, submergé les lieux et les acteurs de la formation ? Pourquoi la migration tant attendue des pratiques sociales vers les pratiques pédagogiques ne s'effectue pas aussi massivement ? En quoi le métier de formateur est-il mis en question par le développement de cet univers numérique ? FORMATIONS ET SOLUTIONS NUMERIQUES : APPUI OU PERTURBATION ? Les outils numériques sont convoqués dans le cadre de cours "présentiels", ou groupe classe ou associés aux nouveaux dispositifs de formation, plus flexibles, connus sous le vocable de FOAD, intégrant également des dimensions d'individualisation et d'autoformation 1. Ils sont souvent évoqués dans leur dimension facilitatrice des apprentissages, selon une vision idéalisée qui oublie la prégnance des contextes et des environnements. 1 Chaque terme mériterait un article à lui, seul, notamment la notion de FOAD et d'autoformation qui sont polysémiques et souvent réduits aux notions de distance et de travail individuel.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul Olry•  3  Educational Technology, Workplace Learning, Vocational TrainingiPads in the Classroom – New Technologies, Old Issues: Are they worth the effort?This paper presents the results of a research project that involved introducing iPads into two elementary school classrooms to support the development of student digital storytelling skills.

This was done because the school jurisdiction wanted to implement technology into grade six classrooms and provide useful support to the teachers and students. This project resulted in many positive learning experiences with the technology, with storytelling and across other components of the curriculum and the community. There are a number of implications of this research, including examining the constructionist theories underpinning the learning behind the creation of educational artifacts. In practice, there are many management issues regarding implementing new technology in classrooms as well as the pedagogical implications of giving students access to technology that can allow them to create their own understandings in classrooms.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nathaniel Ostashewski•  5  Educational Technology, Technology in Teacher Education, iPad, Ipad in the classroomImprovise: Research-Creation of a Framework and Software Prototype for Creative Music Learning with TechnologyIf music education is to respond to the skills and needs of 21st-century music learners, innovative learning paradigms must be explored.

This dissertation reports a research-creation approach for the development of a framework for Creative Music Learning with Technology (CMLT), which emphasizes a process of learning to interact creatively with music. Theoretical analysis of improvisation pedagogy and technology for learning to improvise provide the foundation for creative experimentation. An examination of existing technologies reveals a lack of available tools for cultivating a creative disposition to musicianship. As a result, a prototype application was built for iPad and iPhone based on the principles of the CMLT framework. The software is at once a tool for developing musical understanding and for exploring creative freedom in music. A two-phased study of middle school instrumentalists and expert teachers examined the effectiveness of the prototype. In the first phase, seven expert music teachers and eight middle school instrumental students participated in user testing, revealing that the prototype effectively engaged users in learning many key objectives of improvisation pedagogy. In the second phase, six middle school students reported increased confidence after using the prototype for four weeks. Results suggest there is a strong potential for the framework for CMLT to positively enhance creative music learning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephanie Khoury•  9  Music, Improvisation, Educational Technology, Creativityعلم الحقيقة ALL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 2Save to LibraryDownloadby Ahmad Ibrahim Khaliel (Mallam Bala)•  9  Information Technology, Educational Technology, Science Education, Quranic StudiesTHE EFFECT OF THE SUCCESS IN TEACHING GEOMETRY OF BASIC LEVEL EDUCATION MATHEMATICSThe purpose of this study was to investigate primary and secondary mathematics teachers' candidates' effect of the success in geometry education.

Four research questionswere raised and two hypotheses was formulated to guide the study. The sample consisted of 151 pupilsdrawn from two public primary schools in Jos metropolis. The sample was divided into two groups calledcontrol and experimental groups. Pupils in the experimental group were taught mathematics using CAIwhile the central group was taught conventionally. Data for the study were elicited using a mathematicsattitude scale (MAS) and a mathematics achievement test (MAT) designed by the researchers. The meansscore was used to answer all the research questions and t-test was used to test hypotheses. Resultsobtained showed that the attitude of pupils towards mathematics was negative before the treatment; alsothe pupils were below average in their performance in mathematics. After the treatment, pupils in theexperimental group were found to have a more positive attitude and better performance than those incontrol group. It was recommended among other things that teachers of mathematics should endeavour touse CAI in their teaching of mathematics. The study concluded therefore that the use of educationaltechnology (CAI) is effective in improving the attitude and performance of primary six pupils inmathematics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Research and Statistics Center•  4  Educational Technology, Attitude, Computer-Aided Instruction(CAI), Performance and Teachingالتصورات المختلفة عن تقويم البرنامج التعليمي عبر مراحل زمنية مختلفةتتحدث هذه الورقة عن أبرز الاختلافات القديمة و الحديثة حول تقويم البرامج التعليميةSave to LibraryDownloadby Ghada Ghalib•  5  Educational Technology, Teacher Education, Educational Psychology, Educational ResearchMertala, P.

Technology will continue to be more efficient, more versatile and indeed more abundant in schools and in classrooms. This study explores the views of students and teachers on the effectiveness of ICT in science teaching in terms of (i) levels of enjoyment derived by students, and (ii) usefulness of ICTs to teachers for their teaching. A questionnaire was used to elicit the views of students and teachers in respect of a range of ICT-based classroom activities. Qualitative and quantitative data collected through the questionnaires from 12 teachers and 100 students involved in science teaching and learning at a selected secondary school in Trinidad were analyzed. The results show that students enjoy ICT interventions in their lessons and teachers rank it high in many respects but, both students and teachers agree that ICT loses its appeal when its use is arbitrary and ill-planned.Save to LibraryDownloadby Open Access Publishing  Group•  26  Teaching and Learning, Education, Educational Technology, Teacher EducationZombies in the classroomThe use of video games in the classroom is still a controversial topic in the society.

In this thesis I show results from a research with a high school in the autumn 2014. In this research I followed several classes which used the video game "The Walking Dead" to learn ethics in the classroom. The thesis focuses on gathering relevant information from a number of research fields and shows a holistic view of the pros and cons of video games in the classroom. The study reveals a positive attitude towards video games from both the students' perspective, as well as satisfied educators. The study includes multiple surveys with over 100 students, focused interviews with 17 students and 3 teachers, and statistical data from the school. The results indicate that video games are potentially good tools for educators that wish to use them, and that those who do, should be encouraged to use them. The research also includes the key success factors to implement video games in classroom learning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stig Andreassen•  4  Educational Technology, Teacher Education, Video Games and Learning, Digital GamesTime for a new approach to prepare future teachers for educational technology use:  Its meaning and measurementThe main objective of this study is to develop a self-report instrument to measure pre-service teachers’ perceptions of the extent to which they experience the necessary support and training in order to integrate technology into classroom... moreThe main objective of this study is to develop a self-report instrument to measure pre-service teachers’ perceptions of the extent to which they experience the necessary support and training in order to integrate technology into classroom activities. The questionnaire items of this instrument were drawn up on the basis of a synthesis of 19 qualitative studies (Authors et al., 2012) and were reviewed by experts in the field. In order to study its reliability and aspects of validity, data were collected and analysed consisting of a sample of 688 pre-service teachers in Flanders (Belgium). The resulting scale showed highly satisfactory psychometric properties. Item response theory revealed a good fit of the measurement to a Rating Scale Model for 22 out of 24 items. The results also indicate that the items differ in their degree of difficulty. It seems that helping pre-service teachers to design ICT-rich lessons and providing adequate feedback can be considered more challenging for teacher training institutions. Recommendations are given regarding how the new scale can be useful for both teacher training institutions and schools in developing approaches to equip pre-service teachers with the competencies needed to integrate technology in teaching and learning processes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jo  Tondeur and +1Fazilat Siddiq•  38  Information Technology, Education, Technology, Educational TechnologyUNIT 4: Models of Curriculum DesignSave to LibraryDownloadby Precious May Ramales•  4  Education, Instructional Design, Educational Technology, E-learningAn examination of the use of technology in the teaching of history: A study of selected senior high schools in the Cape Coast metropolis, Ghana Save to LibraryDownloadby Gideon Boadu•  2  Educational Technology, History TeachingLOS DESAFIOS QUE ENFRENTA LA EDUCACION ANTE LA TECNOLOGÍA DE VANGUARDIASave to LibraryDownloadby MARIA A RODRIGUEZ CORDERO•Educational TechnologyIPAD TECHNOLOGY USAGE WITHIN THE ART CLASSROOM GRADES 9 - 12Previous research has provided some data with regard to the use of iPad technology within the classroom environment.

However, there are only a small number that take on the investigation of the visual high school art educators as well as the high school students’ attitudes towards the use of the iPad technology integrated into instruction within the visual art classroom. Quantitative results from high school art teachers indicated that over 70 percent of high school art teacher participants who completed the teacher survey feel that the iPad is useful in a sense that it promotes inquiry among student within the learning process. Additional quantitative results illustrated that over 80 percent of high school students that took the student survey reported that they are happier when their art teachers allow them to use the iPad to complete some art related assignments. Qualitative data collected in the form of written statements from student participants promoted that students find using the iPad within the art classroom to be very useful and helpful. Qualitative data collected in the form of written statements from teacher participants highlighted that the iPads are well received and students enjoyed the technology use within the art classroom. Additional research, within multiple high schools in order to obtain a greater sample of high school students as well as high school art educators who integrate the iPad technology within the art classroom, is recommended to help provide more depth.

Araştırmanın verileri, 18 öğretmenle yapılan yarı-yapılandırılmış görüşmeler üzerinden elde edilmiştir. Araştırmanın verilerinin çözümlenmesinde içerik analizi kullanılmıştır. Araştırma sonuçları, Fatih Projesinin toplumsal eşitliği sağlamaktan uzak olduğu; destek ve yan ürünlerle kendine özgü (bir) piyasa oluşturmaya başladığı, ailelerin teknolojiye dayalı eğitim harcamalarını artırarak ekonomik dönüşüm üzerinde etkili olduğu gözlenmiştir. Eğitimsel dönüşüm bakımından ise pedagojik ve mesleki açıdan tartışmalı sayılabilecek etkilere sahip olduğu belirlenmiştir. Fatih Projesinin öngördüğü siyasal, toplumsal, eğitimsel ve ekonomik boyutlardaki dönüşümlerin etkilerinin uzun süreli boylamsal çalışmalarla ortaya konulmasının gerektiği düşünülmektedir. ABSTRACT This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of the Fatih Project on social, educational and economic transformation. A study group was formed in the study by using the methods of maximum variation sampling and criterion sampling. The data of the study were obtained with semi-structured interviews held with 18 teachers. Content analysis was used in interpreting the data of the study. According to the results of the study, it was observed that the Fatih Project is far from achieving social equality, it started to establish a specific (single) market with supplements and by-products, and it is effective on economic transformation by increasing the technology-based education expenditure of families. In terms of educational transformation, it was determined that it had effects that might be considered questionable in a pedagogic and professional sense. It is thought that the transformation projected by the Fatih Project in political, social, educational and economic dimensions should be investigated in further longitudinal studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arslan Bayram•  2  Educational Technology, Education PolicyUTILIZAÇãO DAS FERRAMENTAS DE UM AMBIENTE VIRTUAL: UM ESTUDO SOB A PERSPECTIVA DA PRÁTICA DOCENTESinteSe: O objetivo central desse trabalho é compreender o comportamento de uso de um sistema de gestão acadêmica em uma Universidade Federal em relação às ferramentas de apoio às atividades docentes.

A escola pública contribui para atenuar a exclusão digital, porém a formação dos professores nestas matérias deve ser considerada prioritária, já que as Tic na educação, bem como a informação por elas disponibilizada, correspondem à descoberta de uma nova dimensão pedagógicaSave to LibraryDownloadby João  Ruivo•Educational Technology¿Mi cerebro?... ¿O mi cerebro más el de ustedes?

Se enfatiza en la influencia que los entornos configuradores de las situaciones de aprendizaje ejercen sobre la persona que aprende, reconociendo a la plasticidad neuronal como un principio rector de nuestro hacer. La era de Internet y lo que en ella sucede, se constituye en un entorno particular que como educadores nos obliga a repensar nuestras prácticas de manera permanente.Save to LibraryDownloadby María Luisa  Bossolasco•  4  Educational Technology, Educational Research, Educación, TICs aplicadas a la EducacionRoberts-Mahoney, H., Means, A., & Garrison, M.

While scholars have offered various critiques of the corporate school reform agenda, the role  of  personalized  learning  technology  in  the  corporatization  of  public education has not been extensively examined. Through a content analysis of US Department of Education reports, personalized learning advocacy white papers,  and  published  research  monographs,  this  paper  details  how  big data and adaptive learning systems are functioning to redefine educational policy,  teaching,  and  learning  in  ways  that  transfer  educational  decisions from public school classrooms and teachers to private corporate spaces and authorities. The analysis shows that all three types of documents position education within a reductive set of economic rationalities that emphasize human capital development, the expansion of data-driven instruction and decision-making,  and  a  narrow  conception  of  learning  as  the  acquisition of  discrete  skills  and  behavior  modification  detached  from  broader  social contexts and culturally relevant forms of knowledge and inquiry. The paper concludes  by  drawing  out  the  contradictions  inherent  to  personalized learning technology and corporatization of schooling. It argues that these contradictions necessitate a broad rethinking of the value and purpose of new educational technology.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark J Garrison•  3  Educational Technology, Privatization, BehaviorismMASS DIE OFF OF HUMANS IN THE PRIME OF LIFE -HERE'S THE SOLUTIONSAVING LIVES IS GOOD FOR YOUR SOUL – SEND THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW.
