New cheap portable video devices (Sony Porta Pak, available in America since 1968) changed that role and allowed the practice of new participatory forms in video art and video activism. The evolution of cheap devices for video production and the expansion of the American cable TV offered new means for the realization of alternative TV programs which integrated viewers as participants. Since the nineties the internet offers video activists new chances for collaborative practices. Activists reacted to the criticism of net conditions and created tools against f. e. data mining and censorship. Different strategies were invented to use video and net tools in actions in the real and digital spaces (January 2004/English translation: June 2004). Published in "IASLonline Lessons in Net Art".

As general aspects of the history of computer art an interface model and three dominant modes to use computational processes (generative, modular, hypertextual) are presented. The "History of Computer Art" features examples of early developments in media like cybernetic sculptures, computer graphics and animation (including music videos and demos), video and computer games, reactive installations, virtual reality, evolutionary art and net art. The functions of relevant art works are explained more detailed than usual in such histories. The German version was completed in December 2012. The last chapter of the English translation was published in June 2014.
