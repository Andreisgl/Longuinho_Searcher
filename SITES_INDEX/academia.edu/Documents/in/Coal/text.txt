The pooled data set included 195 adenocarcinoma cases (169 men and 26 women), 432 squamous cell carcinomas (330 men and 102 women), and 3136 controls (2349 men and 787 women). Occupational exposures to formaldehyde, silica dust, textile dust, coal dust, flour dust, asbestos, and man-made vitreous fibers were assessed with a job-exposure matrix. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for age, study, wood dust, and leather dust, or other occupational exposures when relevant. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression. A significantly increased risk of adenocarcinoma was associated with exposure to formaldehyde. The ORs for the highest level of exposure were 3.0 (Cl = 1.5-5.7) among men and 6.2 (CI=2.0-19.7) among women.

Four 24-channel Geodes were used with a PEG40 accelerated weight drop and 10 Hz geophones at 3 m intervals to shot a 1099 m spread.  The final depth processed section shows some reflectors which are clearly visible and is geologically consistent with borehole information in the area. A strong reflector was found at 25 to 50 m depth, multiple reflections were seen between 70 and 150 m and a strong reflector was seen at 200 to 250 m on the processed seismic section. These were tentatively interpreted as the top of Bunter sandstone, multiple gypsum horizons and the top of coal measures respectively, these observations agreed with the borehole information obtained in the area.  A southwards dipping fault was inferred in the section at approximately 600 m along the line, though this may be an artefact due to acquisition and...Save to LibraryDownloadby Abubakar Maunde•  6  Geology, Coal, Reflection, Key wordsAcid–Base Accounting to Predict Post-Mining Drainage Quality on Surface MinesSave to LibraryDownloadby Jeffrey Skousen•  20  Earth Sciences, Geology, Water quality, Acid Mine DrainageSoil amendments reduce trace element solubility in a contaminated soil and allow regrowth of natural vegetationSave to LibraryDownloadby Pilar Burgos•  32  Soil, Carbon, Biomass, CoalEffects of air pollution on passerine birds and small mammalsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jacint Nadal•  19  Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Coal, Air pollutionTowards the development of a novel construction solid waste (CSW) based constructed wetland system for tertiary treatment of secondary sewage effluentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Xiaochang Wang•  16  Wetlands, Construction Materials, Operations Strategy, CoalRevisiting long-run relations in power markets with high RES penetrationSave to LibraryDownloadby Angelica Gianfreda•  7  Economics, Energy Policy, Coal, MultidisciplinaryVariation in lung cancer risk by smoky coal subtype in Xuanwei, ChinaSave to LibraryDownloadby Linwei Tian•  18  Cancer, Risk, Coal, ChinaMobility of heavy metals associated with the natural weathering of coal mine spoilsSave to LibraryDownloadby Martin Haigh•  14  Physical Chemistry, Coal, Mining, Environmental PollutionUltra Resolution Chemical Fingerprinting of Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids from Manufactured Gas Plants by Reversed Phase Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas ChromatographyUltra resolution chemical fingerprinting of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) from former manufactured gas plants (FMGPs) was investigated using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time of flight mass... moreUltra resolution chemical fingerprinting of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) from former manufactured gas plants (FMGPs) was investigated using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC TOFMS). Reversed phase GC × GC (i.e. a polar primary column coupled to a non-polar secondary column) was found to significantly improve the separation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologues. Sample extraction and cleanup was performed simultaneously using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), with recovery rates between 76% and 97%, allowing fast, efficient extraction with minimal solvent consumption. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the GC × GC data was performed in an attempt to differentiate between twelve DNAPLs based on their chemical composition.

To avoid the discrepancy cultivated by the allocation process and in the interest of transparency the NDA government in 2014 formulated an ordinance (which later became a bill) to auction these blocks. This paper seeks to provide a clear understanding of the process by which coal blocks are auctioned as well as some problems which might arise due to the current process.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anjali Ramakrishnan and +1Swati Dsouza•  7  Energy Policy, Energy Security, Coal, AuctionsCharacteristics of Fly Ash from Thermal Power Plants and its Management along with Settling Pond DesignAbstract— World over for production of power pulverized coal fired boilers are extensively used.

In India also 80% power is produced by pulverized coal fired boilers in National Thermal Power Plants. A very huge amount of ash is produced from these boilers. The quality of ash varies from plant to plant and from coke to coke depending on source of supply and type of combustion. In this dissertation an attempt has been made to categories problems and solutions related to it as given below:For disposal of fly ash various kinds of ash ponds have been discussed, Design and economic aspects have been given. The effect of various type of ash/fly ash on air, land, water, agriculture living creature and human beings have been described. Some solutions have also been suggested. Experimental effect of addition of polymer carboxy methyl cellulose in slurry have been found to increase ash settling rates. For getting optimum ash settling rates 2ppm addition of carboxy methyl cellulose is found to be satisfactory. Utilization of fly ash for production of useful products has been mentioned.Save to LibraryDownloadby Engineering Journal  Publication of Research work•  6  Coal, Polymers, Coal Mining, Fly AshIron and steel: environmental impactThe iron and steel industry was the emblem of the industrial revolution in the 19th and early 20th century United States, playing an important role in shaping the nation’s transportation infrastructure, the industrial specialization of... moreThe iron and steel industry was the emblem of the industrial revolution in the 19th and early 20th century United States, playing an important role in shaping the nation’s transportation infrastructure, the industrial specialization of its cities, and its rise as an economic and military power. Iron is an abundant but generally non-renewable natural resource that must be extracted, concentrated, and processed to create a useable and merchantable product such as pig iron, wrought iron, or steel. All steps in iron and steel production – from mining to smelting - may incur some impact to the environment. The scope and scale of environmental impact of the iron and steel industry in the 19th century mirrored changes in mining technology – from quarry to open-pit mining - shifts in fuels used in ore smelting – from charcoal to coal and coke – and developments in transportation – from wagon roads to canals and railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, government and industry response to air and water pollution by the iron and steel industries spurred the development of agencies and legislation to control industrial pollution.Save to LibraryDownloadby Charles E Williams•  11  Archaeobotany, Environmental Studies, Environmental History, CoalMines, wines and thoroughbreds: Towards sustainability in the Upper Hunter, AustraliaSustainability promotes the perpetuation of environmental quality for present generations, future generations, and other species.

Regions are privileged bounded spaces and a focus for sustainability concerns. This paper explores the notion of sustainable regions by employing a case study of the Upper Hunter, Australia, a region that is a node in material and discursive networks for coal mining, wine making, and thoroughbred breeding.

Because of its great availability and low cost, further possibility of its usage should be investigated. Fly ash from both coal and lignite- acts as a good carrier for bio pesticides. It is used as a conditioner to arrest soil erosion, and to induce plant resistance against diseases. However, several studies proposed that FA can be used to improve physical, chemical and biological properties of the degraded soils and is a source of easily available and cheaper micro, macro-nutrients for crops. Thus use of fly-ash is an effective way of utilization of problematic fly-ash waste in a useful manner. In this study, the review covers the sources, merits and applications of fly ash and fly ash based biopesticides and fertilizers in agriculture.

However, there is little research on why there are comparatively so few men involved in these movements. Using the environmental justice movement in the Central Appalachian coalfields as a case study, we examine the ways that environmental justice activism is gendered, with a focus on how women’s and men’s identities both shape and constrain their involvement in gendered ways. Our analysis relies on 20 in-depth interviews with women and men grassroots activists working for environmental justice in the coalfields of Appalachia. We find that women draw on their identities as “mothers” and “Appalachians” to justify their activism. While women’s shared identities function as “resources of resistance” (Krauss 1993) for their activism, our data suggest that the hegemonic masculinity of the region, which is tied to the coal industry, may have the opposite effect on men, instead deterring their environmental justice activism. We explore the implications of these findings for the future of the environmental justice movement in the coalfields.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shannon Elizabeth Bell•  4  Social Movements, Gender, Coal, Environmental JusticeElectrochemical precipitation of Nickel hydroxideSave to LibraryDownloadby subash Chandra Mallick•  9  Chemistry, Electrochemistry, Metallurgy, Extractive MetallurgyKenyan Iron Ore: Mining and prospects of processingSave to LibraryDownloadby Gilbert Bett•  4  Geology, Coal, Magnetic separation, Iron oreDivest-Invest: A Moral Case for Fossil Fuel DivestmentIn this paper l argue that in order to avoid grave, substantial and unnecessary harm, there is a collective moral responsibility to transition away from fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreements targets of keeping global warming well... moreIn this paper l argue that in order to avoid grave, substantial and unnecessary harm, there is a collective moral responsibility to transition away from fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreements targets of keeping global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels with the aspiration of holding warming to 1.5°C. I use that argument as the basis for the following three distinct but reinforcing moral arguments in favour of divesting from fossil fuels: (1) investing in fossil fuels contributes to grave, substantial, and unnecessary harm and injustice; (2) divesting from fossil fuels helps fulfil our moral responsibility to promote climate action; and (3) investing in fossil fuels morally tarnishes those who do so by making them complicit in the injustices of the fossil fuel industry.  This is a draft chapter for an upcoming collection entitled Climate Justice: Economics and Philosophy, to be published in Oxford University Press, edited by Henry Shue and Ravi KanburSave to LibraryDownloadby Alex Lenferna•  9  Finance, Climate Change, Renewable Energy, CoalCoal Power and the Sundarbans: Subaltern Resistance and Convergent CrisesThis chapter examines the politics of resistance to this contradiction and to the convergence of social, ecological, political and economic crises in play therein.

The chapter focuses on the network form of resistance and interrogates its ideological-political constellation in this instance by contextualizing this development and its resistances both in our current great recessionary conjuncture as well as in the longue durée of the colonial-capitalist world system.  Drawing on the work of Anibel Quijano, Silvia Federici and other theorists of colonial modernity we propose a post-Western Marxist and decolonizing critique and re-situate the local resistance to the power-plant project as also resistance against forest destruction and a neocolonial land grab, a local-global networked multitude’s resistance against accumulation by dispossession but resistance limited by neocolonial accumulated violence.  Crucial to our interrogation of local resistance here is its inability to invent a politics that would address the problem of landlessness and informalization that is interwoven with this instance of development dispossession but remains invisible to the network of national and transnational politics.  This local mode of subalternization holds important movement building lessons for the networked multitude form of social justice environmentalist activism. We take these up in our conclusion.  The chapter begins by providing background on the Rampal coal fired power plant project and the criticisms of it.  We then sketch our decolonizing post-Western Marxist theoretical framework that informs our subsequent analysis of the neocolonial form of power mobilized in Bangladesh’s energy development strategy and of the local resistance to it.  The chapter concludes with our critical engagement with the contradictions of resistance.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sourayan Mookerjea and +1Manoj Misra•  6  Resistance (Social), Coal, Subalternity, Subaltern Agency, BangladeshThe Energy and Fuel Data SheetA compendium of basic data on common hydrocarbon and other fuels.Save to LibraryDownloadby Iain  Staffell•  5  Hydrogen, Energy, Coal, Oil and gasYerli ve Milli Enerji Politikaları Ekseninde Kömür.pdfAnaliz kömürün küresel enerji piyasalarıylaTürkiye’deki yeri ve önemini, kömür kullanımınınçevresel açıdan etkilerini ve söz konusu kaynağınTürkiye’nin enerji politikaları bağlamındakonumunu incelemektedir.Save to LibraryDownloadby İsmail Kavaz•  3  Energy, Coal, TurkeyTreason in the Hills: The William Blizzard trial and the subsequent effect on the West Virginia Mine WarsSave to LibraryDownloadby Caroline Harwell•  4  Coal, Treason, Appalachian History, History of TreasonBATUBARA SEBAGAI NON BAHAN BAKAR (KARBON AKTIF DAN REDUKTOR)Coal utilization technologies currently tend to produce a single product such as only for power generation, liquefied coal, gas city, or briquettes.

Breathing Matters introduces this phenomenon as a forceful potentiality for feminist intersectional theories, politics, and social and environmental justice. By analyzing the material and discursive as well as the natural and cultural enactments of breath in black lung disease, phone sex work, and anxieties and panic attacks, Breathing Matters proposes a nonuniversalizing and politicized understanding of embodiment. In this approach, human bodies are conceptualized as agential actors of intersectional politics. Magdalena Górska argues that struggles for breath and for breathable lives are matters of differential forms of political practices in which vulnerable and quotidian corpomaterial and corpo-affective actions are constitutive of politics. Set in the context of feminist poststructuralist and new materialist and postconstructionist debates, Breathing Matters offers a discussion of human embodiment and agency reconfigured in a posthumanist manner. Its interdisciplinary analytical practice demonstrates that breathing is a phenomenon that is important to study from scientific, medical, political, environmental and social perspectives.Save to LibraryDownloadby Magdalena  Górska•  32  Feminist Theory, Postcolonial Studies, Breath - Body - Voice, Feminist EpistemologyAfrica Energy Outlook - World Energy Outlook Special ReportSave to LibraryDownloadby enzo cursio•  39  African Studies, Renewable Energy, Africa, BiomassRecent history of sediment metal contamination in Lake Macquarie, Australia, and an assessment of ash handling procedure effectiveness in mitigating metal contamination from coal-fired power stationsThis study assessed historical changes in metal concentrations in sediments of southern Lake Macquarie resulting from the activities of coal-fired power stations, using a multi-proxy approach which combines (210)Pb, (137)Cs and metal... moreThis study assessed historical changes in metal concentrations in sediments of southern Lake Macquarie resulting from the activities of coal-fired power stations, using a multi-proxy approach which combines (210)Pb, (137)Cs and metal concentrations in sediment cores.

Gas has been used ever since for commercial, industrial and domestic applications. Gas was first produced from coal and later on from oil until its replacement by natural gas in the mid 1970s. The conventional production of gas from coal is well documented; however, there was also another method of gas production which is less well known, this was called “producer gas”.  Producer gas plants started to become popular in the early 1880 and were in extensive use by 1910. As producer gas plants evolved from the first plant built by Bischof (figure 1) through to their demise in competition in the mid 20th century, many varied types evolved. Following Bischof’s early development of the gas producer the next major development was that of Fredrick Siemens who developed a combined gas producer and regenerative furnace in 1857. This system was gradually improved and introduced to the UK through William Siemens. Producer gas plants provided a great benefit to those industries requiring high and uniform temperatures. This greatly aided those industrial processes which were unable or found it very difficult to use directly fired solid fuel furnaces, it also saved fuel as the gas could be burnt at the exact point required. If you have any specific enquiries on this subject please contact Dr Russell Thomas on thomasru@pbworld.com." usine à gaz, officina del gas, gasværk, gasfabriek, Gaswerk, εργοστάσια αερίου, gázművek, ガス工場, gasskraftverk, gazownia, gasômetro, газовый завод, плинара, plynáreň, plinarn, gasverk, fábrica de gas, havagazı fabrikası, газовий завод, 煤氣廠"Save to LibraryDownloadby Russell Thomas•  14  Engineering, Environmental Engineering, History, GeologyPotential of Clean Coal Technology in India: An SME PerspectiveThis study explores business opportunities in the Indian coal based power value chain for European small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that specialise in clean coal technology (CCT), while also providing a general overview of the Indian... moreThis study explores business opportunities in the Indian coal based power value chain for European small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that specialise in clean coal technology (CCT), while also providing a general overview of the Indian coal based power value chain and its three 'pillars': coal mining, coal logistics and coal power plants.Save to LibraryDownloadby Miha Hribernik•  10  Business, SME, Coal, Clean Coal TechnologiesOverview of the energy sector in South Africa RENEWED PROJECTSGlobally, renewable energy sees by far the fastest growth, with gasification and electrification remaining the main trends.

In addition to this, Eskom did not adhere to the basic law of economics and instead of producing competitive electricity prices  a cumulative increase of 503% from 2008 to 2020 had been observed.Coal fired pants are expected to remain the dominant source for electricity generation, at least till 2030, when Kusile and Medupi are fully commissioned.The depletion of national reserve margins sparked the interest into exploring feed-in tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy, but these were later rejected in favour of competitive tenders. The resulting program, now known as the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), constituted of a public-private initiative on a massive and unprecedented scale helped to stabilise power supply and attempted to reduce South Africa’s dependence on coal and diesel, through the introduction of the use of renewable energy resources onto the national grid.  In monetary terms, the Department of Energy reported that the investments into energy, renewables programme has, by 2017, brought $14-billion of foreign direct investment into the countryThis report highlights the key area’s of progress within the renewable energy sector in relation to South Africa’s developments as well as the current status of non-renewable energy sources, and electrification.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rudí Nel•  16  Renewable Energy, Wind Energy, Hydrogen, BioenergyCombustion Aerosols: Factors Governing Their Size and Composition and Implications to Human HealthSave to LibraryDownloadby John Veranth•  38  Engineering, Air Quality, Atmospheric Chemistry, CarbonCoal development and its discontents: Modes, strategies, and tactics of a localized, yet networked, anti-coal mobilisation in central PhilippinesDeveloping countries need sufficient, reliable, and affordable energy for economic development; yet, the source of this energy remains contested.

In the Philippines, coal-based electricity supplies most of the country's energy requirement. Until the moratorium on new coal-fired power plant development in 2020, the Philippine government aggressively pursued the development of the coal sector, labelling coal projects as nationally significant. With this policy direction, many local governments, including provinces and cities, rallied around coal. Dissent against this fuel, nonetheless, was also prominent, with civil society often leading these mobilizations. This paper discusses one of these movements: a civil society-business-and-ecclesial-led dissent on the proposed coal-based energy system for Bohol province. Using primary data from interviews, supplemented by social media and secondary data analysis, this paper describes the modes, strategies, and tactics of this local coal dissent. Led by a trifecta of actors, including private citizens, businesspeople, and the clergy, the movement employed nonviolent approaches through network-building, letter-writing, and social media-campaigning. As a result of this movement, the provincial government banned future coal-based development in Bohol.Save to LibraryDownloadby Laurence L Delina•  9  Social Movements, Climate Change, Energy, PhilippinesFly ashes from coal and petroleum coke combustion: current and innovative potential applicationsCoal fly ashes (CFA) are generated in large amounts worldwide.

Current combustion technologies allow the burning of fuels with high sulfur content such as petroleum coke, generating non-CFA, such as petroleum coke fly ash (PCFA), mainly from fluidized bed combustion processes. The disposal of CFA and PCFA fly ashes can have severe impacts in the environment such as a potential groundwater contamination by the leaching of heavy metals and/or particulate matter emissions; making it necessary to treat or reuse them. At present CFA are utilized in several applications fields such as cement and concrete production, agriculture and soil stabilization. However, their reuse is restricted by the quality parameters of the end-product or requirements defined by the production process. Therefore, secondary material markets can use a limited amount of CFA, which implies the necessity of new markets for the unused CFA.

Esta escoria nocompatible con el material refractario en servicio encontró puntos de debilidad en elrevestimiento, que permitieron su filtración.Los ladrillos de MgO-C con alto porcentaje de C (>15%) presentan menor resistencia aldesgaste frente a escorias de baja basicidad, debido al fenómeno de la oxidación del C yla consiguiente generación de vacíos entre los granos de periclasa. Por lo tanto, en prácticas operativas esporádicas que puedan implicar escorias ácidas u oxidantes, esconveniente ajustar la basicidad de la escoria.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jorge Madias•  2  Coal, CokemakingNextLast »Related TopicsClean Coal TechnologiesFollowFollowingCoal MiningFollowFollowingCoal GeologyFollowFollowingOilFollowFollowingCombustionFollowFollowingCoal GasificationFollowFollowingCoal bed methaneFollowFollowingGas MarketsFollowFollowingUnderground Coal Gasification (UCG)FollowFollowingEnergyFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
