Commonplace Quotes:  There is no vice so simple but assumes/ Some mark of virtue on his outward parts. William Shakespeare, from The Merchant of Venice  A boat will not answer to the rudder unless it is in motion. The poet can work upon us only as long as we are kept on the move. C. S. Lewis, from his Preface to Paradise Lost  One does not argue about The Wind in the Willows. The young man gives it to the girl with whom he is in love, and, if she does not like it, asks her to return his letters. The older man tries it on his nephew, and alters his will accordingly. The book is a test of character. We can’t criticize it, because it is criticizing us. But I must give you one word of warning. When you sit down to it, don’t be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgement on my taste, or on the art of Kenneth Grahame. You are merely sitting in judgment on yourself. You may be worth: I don’t know, but it is you who are on trial. A. A. Milne Sonnet to the River Otter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge Dear native brook! wild streamlet of the West! How many various-fated years have passed, What happy and what mournful hours, since last I skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast, Numbering its light leaps! Yet so deep impressed Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes I never shut amid the sunny ray, But straight with all their tints thy waters rise, Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey, And bedded sand that, veined with various dyes, Gleamed through thy bright transparence! On my way, Visions of childhood! oft have ye beguiled Lone manhood’s cares, yet waking fondest sighs: Ah! that once more I were a careless child!
