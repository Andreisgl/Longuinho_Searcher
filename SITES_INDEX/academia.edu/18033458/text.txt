In the present study, a combination of approaches was used to investigate the sound-producing mechanism of Oreochromis niloticus. Synchronisation of high-speed video data (500 frames s(-1)) and cineradiographies (250 frames s(-1)) with the sound recordings made it possible to locate the different body parts involved in sound production in territorial males. Sounds are made during a backward movement of the pelvic and pectoral girdles and a forward movement of the second pterygiophore of the anal fin. Various electrostimulation experiments, dissections and observation of histological cross-sections revealed a set of bundles (that we call the vesica longitudinalis) situated in the hypaxial musculature, ventro-laterally to the swimbladder. Contraction of these bundles should result in compression of the rib cage and also of the swimbladder, because of its close asso...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Fish BiologySound production during courtship and spawning of Oreochromis mossambicus: male-female and male-male interactions2003 • Clara AmorimDownload Free PDFView PDFReview: Reproductive biology of CichlidaeChristian LarbiThe Cichlidae family is in the order perciformes. The fish family Cichlidae presents an array of fishes with great diversity. Production of eggs and fry in tilapia are affected by several factors within its environment which includes temperature, day length, density and sex-ratio of broodstock, length and/or weight of breeders, food quality, and stress as well as the water quality (oxygen, salinity, pH etc.) but also the overall spawning capacity of a group. The mating system of the African cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus resembles that of other lekking animals; males defend mating territories where the spawning pits they dig are sites only for mating and oviposition and are not used for rearing offspring.Download Free PDFView PDFHormones and social behavior of cichlid fishes: a case study in the Mozambique tilapia2000 • Adelino V M CanarioThe Mozambique tilapia, Oreachrzlrnis rnossambicus, is used as a case study to illustrate different aspects of the relationship between androgens and social behavior in cichlid fish. First the mating system of 0. mossambicus and its variations is described, namely the occurrence of alternative male mating tactics and male-male courtship, and the influence of social status on mating decisions and mating success.Download Free PDFView PDFThe outcome of male–male encounters affects subsequent sound production during courtship in the cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicusClara AmorimDownload Free PDFView PDFHormones and behaviorIntra-sexual variation in male reproduction in teleost fish: a comparative approach2005 • Albert RosDownload Free PDFView PDFGeneral and Comparative EndocrinologyChemical communication in cichlids: A mini-review2015 • Adelino V M CanarioDownload Free PDFView PDFBehaviourDifferential investment in acoustic communication during social interactions in two closely-related sand goby species2013 • M.
