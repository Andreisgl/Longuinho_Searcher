Being highly dependent on social interaction, the creative industries and art making are among those badly hit-specifically the performing arts sector. The sector's vulnerability is magnified by the onslaught of this crisis, and the industry, in most countries are not given funding priority in the region, especially when the immediate need is to mitigate the spread of the virus. The Philippine government has provided some assistance to the sector, but these will never be enough. The concerns and anxiety of creative workers continues to heighten with these questions: "Will the industry will ever go back to the way it was before COVID? Will the arts retain its patrons and audiences in these times of uncertainty, with limited resources and spending power, and with the looming threat of recession?" This descriptive study intends to solicit the perceptions and behavior of arts audiences in Metro Manila through a quantitative survey conducted from May to June 2020. The insights gathered from this study aims to provide guidance as to how struggling arts organizations will be able to pivot their operations and productions, and transition towards the new normal in presenting the arts in the country.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersArts Management QuarterlyArts Management Quarterly No 134: Generating Revenue Online2020 • Kristin Oswald, Johan  KolsteegAura, experience and being together. For many professionals in arts and culture, these are the central values of analogue cultural formats, which cannot be replaced by digital ones. Unfortunately, this skepticism or contempt regarding digital cultural offerings as well as an unwillingness to pay for them is also being assumed for the audience – without actually asking them about it. Are aura, experience, and being together as valuable to the visitors as they are for us professionals? And are these aspects really pivotal for their visits to cultural institutions? Is it not rather about valuable content, no matter if analogue or digital? Additionally, digital formats and events also mean financial expenses for cultural institutions and artists. So why should they be for free? First and foremost, what it needs to make digital paid formats attractive are new parameters, such as lower prices, creative formats or the principle of shortened availability. As well as a mindset for digital business models for cultural institutions and artists. There are already numerous examples from arts and culture proving that new forms of experience or community are possible in the digital world – and not only in times of limited analogue access.Download Free PDFView PDF"Shookt by COVID-19": The pandemic as lived experience among young people under virus-induced lockdown in the PhilippinesNoella May-I OrozcoDownload Free PDFView PDFMUSEUMS AND THE WEB AT THE TIME OF COVID-19MUSEUMS AND THE WEB AT THE TIME OF COVID-19 In search of lasting museological innovations during the pandemic2020 • Massimo NegriThis project aimed to carry out, in a relatively short period, an overview of new initiatives and emerging trends in the museum sector – with a specific focus on the use of the web - as online tools are already changing the way museums orient themselves to society and the user’s perception of these initiatives. The results have been collected in a database, reviewed, and shared for referential purposes. What are interesting ideas to be picked up by others? How are we to judge what will happen a few years from now? What are some of reactions from the users that could be helpful to orientate future planning?

We found both marginal communities are food insecure. In doing this volunteering, a few questions are raised. What is the state’s responsibility for the marginal people’s food supply? Why does the state ignore their presence? Is there any philosophical reason? How can these people survive? We all decided to answer these questions through the Indigenous research paradigm (IRP). ‘Biopolitics’, ‘Historical ontology,’ ‘Disaster Capitalism,’ ‘Metaphysics of presence’ helped in analyzing, however, we answered—by empirical findings--‘volunteering’ is a practical method for lifesaving—in parallel--a theoretical tool under the ‘Indigenous metaphysics’ of Vine Deloria. We concluded with a recommendation that an ontological turn is essential for policy approaches in the New Normal era.

In contrast, the ‘post normal’ is a paradigm shift that dismisses any claim of a return to the ways of old or the previous state of affairs that people have enjoyed prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Applying the post-modern techniques of Umberto Eco, this paper explores the meanings of both concepts and their implications to everyday life.Download Free PDFView PDFOnCurating - Contemporary Art Biennials - Our Hegemonic Machines in Times of EmergencyContemporary Art Biennials - Our Hegemonic Machines in Times of Emergency2020 • Dorothee I Richter, Dr. Shwetal A Patel, PhD, giulia colletti, Rime Fetnan, Daniela Labra, Henk Slager, Katerina Valdivia Bruch, Nathalie Zonnenberg, Ronald Kolb, Julia  Bethwaite, per gunnar  eeg-tverbakkBiennials are each in their own way a complex constellation of different economical and geopolitical, and representational cultural aspects within its own power relations. With all their underlying deficiencies (canonical, hegemonic, colonialist, hot money-funded, politically influenced, hierarchical), biennials tend to establish international discourse, at best, rooted in local cultural specificities and contexts. With this edition of the journal, we wanted to include a variety of cases and research areas, not ordered along a historical trajectory, but rather, ordered by theme. With a mix of over sixty new contributions and reprints of important articles for the biennale discourse this issue is like a biennale: too much to experience at once.

In Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics Volume 30, Number 6 (August 2020): 284-288.2020 • Christopher Ryan MabolocThe Covid-19 Pandemic manifests the important role of moral leadership in managing a crisis. In the light of the big disruptions to both public life and private enterprise, the need for an ethics of virtue becomes apparent. Most governments usually look into the consequences to the economy but disregard the meaningful role of moral character in making sound judgment. This article is an attempt to look into local experiences and values in contrast to institutional approaches in the West when it comes to the response to the Covid-19 public health emergency in the Philippines and elsewhere.Download Free PDFView PDFEubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics EJAIBVol. 30 (8) October 2020Volunteering as Praxis During COVID-19 Experiences from EJAIB102020.2020 • jahid siraz, haris abd wahabVolunteering’ as Praxis During COVID-19: Experiences from Bangladeshi Migrant Workers in Malaysia and Indigenous Communities of Bangladesh -Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Environmental StudiesCitizen Participation Pedagogy2020 • Mannisi Alban, Bjorn Low, Manoel Antonio Lopes Rodrigues Alves, Camila Moreno de Camargo, Apolonija Sustersic, macarena grossOnce again, the civil society participation in the management and planning of its territory has become a sine qua nun preliminary condition for the Built Environment expertise. Albeit extremely active, the numbers of stakeholders in the revitalization of communities and the management of their resilience are exploding without being able to generate overviews that would facilitate cohesion and efficiency. The foundations of this movement are often overlooked to keep the attractiveness of the vitalist impulse, and the lessons learnt are still poorly analysed and shared within a new generation of Community Designer. The experts’ “return to the city” dynamic to better understand the social capital challenges and aspirations must be accompanied now, after a decade of all-out communication, by an effort of transmission. Based on their involvement in citizen participation initiatives, contributors are invited to formulate lessons that are useful for the future, to expose the teaching of the current, or to draw up a critical and muddled inventory to avoid, which can lead to generate a pedagogical opening. Embodying the "Globalization from the Gassrroots" phenomenon, the contributions of this special edition dedicated to Citizen Participation Pedagogy, testify to the desire of worldwide civil societies to be involved in the management of their common good. The exemplar approaches of 10 different countries over 4 continents: Australia, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Sweden, Spain, and Brazil provide an understanding of the peculiarities and similarities of the diverse cultural landscape. People from different spheres; landscape architect and urbanist, architect, artist, entrepreneur, and community designer among many others, represent the diversity and richness of experts who have the voice of citizens resonate in public debate. Citizen Participation Pedagogy proposes an intellectual geography to envision the genuine mechanisms’ resilience of human and non-human cohesion, offering tools that are currently rediscovered, reinvented, and reimagined.

Humans are resilient beings who have overcome great catastrophes in the past. In this Covid-19 pandemic, I happen to visit a depressed community in Sitio Malipayon (Happy Village) in which people seem to go on with their lives even with the existential threat from the pandemic. At the outset, the prejudices against the poor point to a lack of discipline. Yet, it is critical to understand that a return into the ordinariness of human life may possess the answers that can save modern society in a post-pandemic world.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
