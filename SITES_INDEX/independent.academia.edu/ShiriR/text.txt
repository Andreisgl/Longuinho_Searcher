A nationally representative sample (the Health 2000 survey) comprised 3943 occupationally active Finns aged 30-63. MSD and other chronic disorders were assessed by a physician in a standardized clinical examination, and CMD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Disability pension data for 2000-2011 was retrieved from national pension records. Cox regression was used with censoring for death and pension other than that for disability. Covariate information was based on an interview. The baseline prevalence of CMD was 9.4% and of MSD 31.1%. CMD co-occurred with MSD in 3.3% of participants. The risks inflicted by CMD and MSD were additive. Thirty-eight per cent of the co-morbid subjects, 18% of those with CMD and 19% of those with MSD retired prematurely during the average follow-up of 8.6 years. Compared with those with neither type of disorder, the hazard ratio (HR) for disability pension was 2.4 (95% CI 1.7-2.7) for CMD only, 2.2 (1.8-2.7) for MSD only, and 4.1 (2.9-5.7) for the occurrence of both, allowing for age, gender, other chronic disorders, working conditions, and socio-economic and lifestyle factors. No synergistic or antagonistic interactive effects were observed. The determinants were measured only once and we had no information on incident disorders during the follow-up. It is important to identify subjects with both mental and musculoskeletal complaints in order to efficiently support their work ability.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study will examine whether temporary work modifications at the early stage of work disability are effective in enhancing return to work (RTW) or staying at work among workers with musculoskeletal or depressive symptoms. A single-centre controlled trial with modified stepped wedge design will be carried out in eight enterprises and their occupational health services (OHSs) in nine cities in Finland. Patients seeking medical advice due to musculoskeletal pain (≥4 on a scale from 0-10) or depressive symptoms (≥1 positive response to 2 screening questions) and fulfilling other inclusion criteria are eligible.

The PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched until October 2013. Twenty-seven studies were included in the review and 20 in the meta-analysis. There were no differences in the prevalence of neck pain (pooled OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33), cervical disc degeneration (OR=1.26, CI 0.81 to 1.96), low back pain (OR=0.80, CI 0.47 to 1.38) or lumbar disc degeneration (OR=0.87, CI 0.67 to 1.13) between fighter pilots and helicopter or transport/cargo pilots. Moreover, the prevalence of cervical (OR=1.14, CI 0.61 to 2.16) or lumbar (OR=1.05, CI 0.49 to 2.26) disc degeneration did not differ between fighter pilots and non-flying personnel.

We here estimated the cumulative risk and trends in incidence of prostate cancer in Mumbai, India, using data collected by the Bombay Population-based Cancer Registry from the year 1986 to 2000. During the 15 year period, a total of 2864 prostate cancer cases (4.7% of all male cancers and 2.4% of all cancers) were registered by the Bombay Population-based Cancer Registry. For evaluation of the trend, we applied a linear regression model based on the logarithm of the observed incidence rates. The annual percentage changes were also computed for the evaluation. Cumulative incidence rates percentages were calculated by adding up the age specific incidence rates at single ages and then expressed as a percentage.

For evaluation of the trend, we applied a linear regression model based on the logarithm of the observed incidence rates. The annual percentage changes were also computed for the incidence rates to evaluate the time trend. In males, a statistically significant decreasing trend in the overall age-adjusted incidence rates were observed during the period 1986 to 2000, with an yearly decrease of 1.70%.

Materials and Methods We utilized two large population surveys (the Health 2000 Study and the Finnish Work and Health Surveys), one to construct the JEM and another to test matrix performance. In the first study, information on job demands, job control, monotonous work and social support at work was collected via face-to-face interviews. Job strain was operationalized based on job demands and job control using quadrant approach. In the second study, the sensitivity and specificity were estimated applying a Bayesian approach. The magnitude of misclassification error was examined by calculating the biased odds ratios as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the JEM and fixed true prevalence and odds ratio...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Studies on selected oc... more Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment syndrome. Studies on selected occupational populations suggest an association of CTS with forceful repetitive work and vibration. Only few population-based studies have addressed the role of physical load factors in CTS. The aim of this study was to investigate the relations between exposures to a single or a combination of physical work load factors and CTS. The target population consisted of people aged 30 years or older residing in Finland during 2000-2001. Of the 7977 eligible subjects, 6254 (78.4%) were included in the study. Occupational physical load factors were assessed by interview and CTS by physical examination. The prevalence of possible or probable CTS was 2.1% in men and 5.3% in women. Work tasks with vibrating tools (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9) and handgrip with high forces (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5) were related to an increased prevalence of CTS. There were joint effects between work tasks requiring handgrip with high forces and the use of vibrating tools (adjusted OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.0 to 5.4), between forceful activities (handgrip with high forces or handling of loads) and repetitive movements of the hands (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.9), and between repetitive movements of the hands and the use of vibrating tools (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 4.8). Only exposure in the most recent job was associated with CTS. Work tasks demanding handgrip with high forces or the use of vibrating tools are associated with CTS. The association is stronger if these work tasks are accompanied by repetitive movements of the hand or wrist.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
