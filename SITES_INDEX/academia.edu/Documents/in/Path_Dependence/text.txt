However, despite the fact that pressures on achieving sustainable and carbon-neutral energy continues to mount, the fossil fuel-based energy system remains firmly in place, with over 80% of total primary energy supplied by oil, coal and natural gas. Energy production by means of nuclear energy is increasingly framed as a major policy tool for rapid decarbonisation and prevention of energy pollution deaths. However, despite extensive reframing efforts, global nuclear generation is falling, due to a combination of closures outpacing new build and the low costs and ease of deployment of fossil fuels. This has prompted headlines such as “Nuclear power is dying. Can radical innovation save it?” and “Can sodium save nuclear power?”, with innovation being a common theme in discourse around the absence of a nuclear renaissance as well as in response to public concerns around safety, waste and proliferation. This innovation frame stretches beyond advanced fission concepts, with fusion being pitched as a safer and a less controversial alternative. However, despite this extensive focus on innovation, only limited work has been done on path dependencies acting as barriers for nuclear innovation. This article will set out some of the implications of path dependency in regards to nuclear innovation, as well as an opportunity to reflect on lessons for future nuclear innovation.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Lindberg•  6  Nuclear Engineering, Innovation Policy, Nuclear Energy, Path DependenceRole of ‘corporate persistence’ and ‘environmental support’ in building breakthrough capability: Empirical investigation of Samsung’s initiatives in memory and microwave oven businessIt is now an incontrovertible fact that capabilities are the source of competitive advantage.

With a background of authoritarian legacies(‘political police’style intelligence agencies controlled by the military) under particular political circumstances and changing strategic environments, these countries experienced disparate trajectories, prescriptions, and outcomes in their efforts to reform their intelligence communities. Drawing on new institutionalism, historical moments and relevant events shaping the dynamics of intelligence democratization are highlighted for each case, depicting failures and successes, and identifying drivers of change.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eduardo E .

The paper demonstrates that the key issue is methodological, not ontological, and that management and organization scholars have been using inadequate research designs in the past to capture path dependence. The paper draws on recent research to explain why the QWERTY case does not provide evidence for path dependence, and provides clear methodological guidelines regarding which methods should be used in the future to fruitfully explore path dependence in the social sciences. Overall, the paper offers an alternative to both the 'sceptics' who claim that path dependence is a myth and the 'believers' who highlight the huge implications of path dependence, but fail to provide convincing evidence that it actually exists as a distinctive process leading to lock-in.Save to LibraryDownloadby JP Vergne•  7  Evolutionary Economics, Technological Innovation, Path Dependence, Efficient Market HypothesisReview of TH Eriksen OverheatingA book review published in 2018: T.H.

In order to enforce civilian control over the military in new democracies, civilian decision-makers need to “break” stabilizing mechanisms of path dependence in civil-military relations. The ability of ‘change agents’ to overcome ‘path dependence’ depends on the concrete approach civilians take to reduce military power. Civilian choices, however, are structured by the specific structural, institutional and ideational contexts in which civil-military interaction takes place. These contextual factors also provide the constraints and resources for civilian actions. The civilian choices and the success of their control strategies are thus conditioned by the resources to which civilians have access and which allow them to initiate and consolidate changes vis-à-vis those actors opposing change in civil-military relations. Durch die Verbindung von Erkenntnissen des historischen Institutionalismus mit Argumenten des strategischen Handelns entwickelt der Artikel eine neue konzeptionelle und theoretische Herangehensweise zur Erklärung der Veränderungen des Verhältnisses von Militär und Zivilisten. In neuen Demokratien stellt die Durchsetzung ziviler Kontrolle des Militärs als Versuch ziviler Entscheidungsträger, stabilisierende Mechanismen der Pfadabhängigkeit zivil-militärischer Beziehungen zu „durchbrechen“, eine Herausforderung dar. Die Fähigkeit von change agents die Pfadabhängigkeiten zu überwinden unterliegt der konkreten Herangehensweise der Zivilisten zur Verringerung militärischer Macht. Jedoch gestalten die jeweiligen strukturellen, institutionellen und ideellen Rahmenbedingungen, innerhalb derer die zivil-militärischen Interaktionen erfolgen, die zivilen Wahlmöglichkeiten und stellen sowohl Einschränkungen als auch Ressourcen zivilen Handelns dar. Die Wahlmöglichkeiten der Zivilisten und der Erfolg ihrer Kontrollstrategien werden dementsprechend durch die Ressourcen bedingt, zu welchen sie Zugang haben und die es ihnen gestatten, Veränderungen hinsichtlich derjenigen Akteure zu initiieren und zu konsolidieren, die Veränderungen der zivil-militärischen Beziehungen ablehnen.Save to LibraryDownloadby Siegfried O.

The article uses discourses as heuristic devices and presents two case studies regarding the enactment of policies of educational governance promoted in 2003 by a local authority (the Italian Provincia) and inspired by the democratic discourse. These policies were intended to promote the participation and collaboration of schools and heads in educational planning. It illustrates how the neo-liberal discourse re-shaped the Italian educational system and challenged welfarism. At the same time, we also attempt to illustrate the action of cultural path dependencies and the space emerging for a democratic discourse, which could be interpreted both as an alternative to its neoliberal counterpart and as an attempt to re-discover democratic participation and promote more equity-oriented practices in the educational field. Two different understandings of educational governance and headship seem to emerge. The study underlines how the intertwining of national and local policies inspired by contradicting discourses could result in the spread of competitive practices and consequently in a further differentiation of the educational provision and stratification between schools, or have an egalitarian outcome, where processes of collaboration, collective empowerment and reflexivity are enacted. Our work demonstrates how democratic and collaborative spaces opened up by site-basedmanagement and policies of educational governance implemented at a local level are always at risk, due both to the rise of competitive pressures and the resilience of welfarist discourses and practice.Save to LibraryDownloadby Emiliano Grimaldi•  14  Ethnography, Educational Administration, Heuristics, GovernanceComparative Law and EconomicsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ugo Mattei•  5  Law and Economics, Path Dependence, Economic analysis, Legal system￼ Non- physische Tonträger im Verdrängungswettbewerb mit physischen Tonträgern – eine Analyse institutioneller Pfade in der MusikindustrieDie Digitalisierung hat einschneidende Veränderungen in den Konsumgewohnheiten und Zahlungsbereitschaften von Musikkonsumenten verursacht.

Seit dem Start der ersten Internet-Tauschbörse und dem ersten, ansatzweise konkurrenzfähigen digitalen Angebot der Musikindustrie vergingen jedoch einige Jahre. Aufbauend auf einer theoretischen Fundierung wird gezeigt, dass die Musikindustrie sich auf, von dominanten Management Logiken getriebenen, institutionellen Pfaden befindet, die in jüngerer Vergangenheit dazu führten, dass an altbewährten Strategien festgehalten wurde, ohne dass die digitalisierungsbedingten Veränderungen ausreichend berücksichtigt wurden.

This is remarkable, since the automotive sector is typically averse to the more radical technological change of engines. The internal combustion engine has been around for more than 100 years after all.In this paper we describe and explain the emergence of electric engines in the automobile market after 1990. We explicate the role of techno-economic mechanisms alongside social and regulatory mechanisms (including the social meaning of an engine). The co-evolutionary analysis is novel in the integrated conception of actor perspectives, feedback effects and competition between products. We find three sources of lock-in through path dependency: from demand, supply as well as the regulatory side. We conclude that automotive engines were significantly locked into a trajectory of internal combustion technology due to techno-economic mechanisms, which produced inertia despite social pressures. The creation of an alternative path, on the other hand, initially stalled. Various stakeholders were unsuccessful in marketing their electric or hybrid-electric vehicles in the 1990s, such as Peugeot/Citroen with various electric models, or Audi with their Duo in 1997. However, after 2000 we find that sustaining efforts of California's Air Resources Board and Toyota were triggering creation of a new innovation path of hybrid-electric engines.Save to LibraryDownloadby Masaru Yarime•  10  Electrical Engineering, Economics, Technology, Internal Combustion EngineThe Knowledge Based-View of the Firm: From Theoretical Origins to Future ImplicationsThe Knowledge-based view of the firm is a recent extension of the Resource- based view of the firm very adequate to the present economic context.

We conceptualize resilience not just as the ability of a region to accommodate shocks, but we extend it to the long-term ability of regions to develop new growth paths. We propose a comprehensive view on regional resilience, in which history is key to understand how regions develop new growth paths, and in which industrial, network and institutional dimensions of resilience come together. Resilient regions are capable of overcoming a trade-off between adaptation and adaptability, as embodied in related and unrelated variety, loosely coupled networks and loosely coherent institutional structures.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ron  Boschma•  6  Institutional Change, Path Dependence, Evolutionary Economic Geography, Urban and Regional ResilienceDynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management, "StrategicSave to LibraryDownloadby amy shuen•  16  Business, Management, Marketing, InformaticsDynamic capabilities and strategic management: organizing for innovation and growthSave to LibraryDownloadby kudret çeltekligil•  16  Business, Management, Marketing, InformaticsReally changing the course: the limitations of environmental management systems for innovationThe paper broadens the scope of environmental management system (EMS) research by describing how EMSs can contribute to inertia in present production systems.

In conjunction with other factors this inertia can inhibit dramatic shifts toward more sustainable technologies and systems. Our approach builds upon technological lock-in theory, which focuses on market coordination and technological interdependencies as generators of inertia in technological systems. Building on this framework, we call attention to previously under appreciated non-market social forces and institutional structures that can further reinforce lock-in. We argue that the co-evolutionary mechanisms that generate increasing returns for physical technologies may also be applied to social technologies, such as management systems. The paper describes the emergence of ‘EMS lock-in’ as a path dependent evolution occurring within the context of the larger quality management paradigm. While EMS may initially produce improvements in environmental performance, EMS may also constrain organizational focus to the exploitation of present production systems, rather than exploring for superior innovations that are discontinuous. The paper questions the enthusiastic private and public sector support for EMS implementation and instead recommends an ambidextrous management approach that integrates foresight and broader stakeholder collaboration.

These equations are motivated by numerous applications in financial modeling, whence the title of the paper. This financial motivation is developed in the first part of the paper, which provides a synthetic view of the theory of pricing and hedging financial derivatives, using backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) as main tool. In the second part of the paper, we establish the well-posedness of reflected BSDEs with jumps coming out of the pricing and hedging problems exposed in the first part.

There is a small but growing literature on the financialization of housing that has demonstrated how housing is a central aspect of financialization. Despite the varied analyses of the financialization of housing and the importance of housing to financialization, the relations between housing and financialization remain under-researched and under-theorized. The financialization of housing is not so much a specific from of financialization, as it transcends several of the different forms of financialization. Housing systems, in particular, differ widely across the globe, which implies that housing financialization will be inherently variegated, path-dependent and uneven. In this introduction to the Symposium, I will discuss how the articles in this Symposium contribute to the literature on the financialization of housing. Housing has entered a post-Fordist, neoliberal and financialized regime. Both mortgaged homeownership and subsidized rental housing increasingly are there to keep financial markets going, rather than being facilitated by those markets. There is little evidence that the global financial crisis has resulted in a de-financialization of housing. There are common trajectories within uneven and variegated financialization rather than radically different and completely unrelated forms of housing financialization.Key words: housing, financialization, mortgage markets, rental housing, home ownership, state and public sectorSave to LibraryDownloadby Manuel Aalbers•  61  Welfare State, Securitization, Urban Studies, Housing PolicyCreativity and Place in the Evolution of a Cultural Industry: the Case of Cirque du SoleilSave to LibraryDownloadby Norma Rantisi•  6  Human Geography, Evolutionary Economics, Urban Studies, Urban And Regional PlanningA integração da geração fotovoltaica distribuída à matriz elétrica brasileira: uma análise sob a ótica institucionalA matriz brasileira de energia elétrica foi construída historicamente como resultado da confrontação de interesses econômicos, políticos e sociais.

Graças a avanços tecnológicos, o setor elétrico brasileiro passa por uma fase de possível inserção de novos modelos, como a geração distribuída de fontes energéticas alternativas, como eólica, biomassa e solar fotovoltaica. Este trabalho oferece uma análise institucional para a compreensão das possibilidades de inserção da geração distribuída fotovoltaica na rede elétrica. Essa análise institucional foi feita através de uma triangulação de técnicas, partindo de revisão bibliográfica de literatura científica, que gerou um modelo analítico para identificar e classificar os principais marcos históricos que direcionaram a estruturação da matriz energética brasileira. Os dados foram confrontados com as entrevistas em profundidade com especialistas do setor elétrico. Os resultados fundamentaram modelos que descrevem a formação histórica de instituições sob os aspectos econômicos, técnicos e normativos. Além disso, os resultados indicam um cenário favorável para investimentos em geração distribuída fotovoltaica até o final da década de 2020, mas também sugerem um possível conflito de equacionamento de custos entre os geradores distribuídos e as concessionárias de distribuição de energia elétricaSave to LibraryDownloadby João Marcos•  5  Path Dependence, Social Skills, Isomorfismo, FotovoltaicaA Conversation about Land Rent, Financialization and HousingManuel B.

Türkiye hızla derinleşen karbon kilitlenmesinden kurtulmak için hâlâ önemli fırsatlara sahiptir. Toplam enerji tüketiminde fosil yakıt bağımlılığı yüksek olsa da özellikle elektrik üretimi ve ulaşım alanında gelişmekte olan bir ülke olmanın avantajlarını kullanabilir. Büyüyen elektrik üretimi alanında yenilenebilir enerji yönünde hızlı bir dönüşümü başarması büyük sanayileşmiş ülkelere göre çok daha kolaydır. Türkiye’nin yol ve inşaat sektörü de hızla büyümektedir ve düşük karbonlu sisteme dönüşüm yönünde politika değişiklikleriyle ulaşımdan ve binalardan kaynaklanan emisyonların azalması sağlanabilir. Türkiye kirletici gelişme yolunu atlayarak ekolojik sıçrama yapma şansına hâlâ sahiptir. Böyle bir siyasi tercih gelecekte büyük ekonomik kayıplara neden olacak karbon kilitlenmesinden kurtulmayı sağlayabilir. Bu yönde bir politika değişikliği işletmelerin de atıl varlıklar riskinden kurtulmaları açısından önemli bir fırsat yaratacaktır.Save to LibraryDownloadby Umit Sahin•  7  Climate Change, Renewable Energy, Energy Policy, Energy and EnvironmentNextLast »Related TopicsHistoria Costa RicaFollowFollowingConservatism (Political Science)FollowFollowingNeoinstitucionalismoFollowFollowingSmart PhonesFollowFollowingReforma AdministrativaFollowFollowingHistorical InstitutionalismFollowFollowingAnthropology of political participationFollowFollowingPath DependencyFollowFollowingPolitical SocializationFollowFollowingJon ElsterFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
