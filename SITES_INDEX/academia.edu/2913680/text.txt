Interactions and local changes in Europe and the Mediterranean from the Bronze to the Iron AgeEXCHANGE NETWORKS AND LOCAL TRANSFORMATIONS. Interactions and local changes in Europe and the Mediterranean from the Bronze to the Iron AgeSerena SabatiniMaria Emanuela Alberti2013(2013) - Throughout the local Bronze and Iron Age, European and Mediterranean societies appear to have been involved in complex systems of exchange networks which invariably affected local customs and historical developments. Archaeological evidence suggests social and economic phenomena, cultural expressions and technological skills stemmed from multifaceted encounters between local traditions and external influences. Examples of cultural openness and transcultural hybridisation seem to be more of a norm than an exception. The articles in the volume explore the dynamic relationship between regionally contextualised transformations and inter-regional exchange networks. Particular effort has been put in approaching the issue in a multi-disciplinary perspective. Continental Europe and the Mediterranean may be characterised by specific development and patterns of relations, but the authors draw attention to how those worlds were not alien to each other and illustrate how common interpretative tools can be successfully applied and a comprehensive approach including both zones adopted. more info and table of content at http://www.oxbowbooks.com/oxbow/oxbow-books-imprint/exchange-networks-and-local-transformations.html"See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAlberti, M.E., Sabatini, S.

Overview and Observations on the Middle Bronze AgeMaria Emanuela AlbertiThe paper is the first step of a systematic and critical review of the history of the internal (and external, though to a lesser extent) history of the Bronze Age Aegean trade systems and circuits. After a short introductionn on geographical aspects and main Early Bronze Age characteristics, the focus is on the phenomena of the Middle Bronze Age, both on a pan-Aegean and regional level: complex phenomena of hybridization and local development lead to the cultural definition of the various regional identities, struggling between localism, external involvement and first Minoanization.Download Free PDFView PDFAlberti E., Sabatini S.

Oxford: Oxbow Books, pp. 134-145Local and transcultural burial practices in Northern Europe in the Late Bronze Age: Face, house and face/door urns2012 • Serena SabatiniArchaeological evidences from Late Bronze Age Northern Europe invite reflecting upon the presence of foreign objects belonging to traditions from the southern part of the continent. Also specific ritual practices appear travelling the same large distances to be adopted, not before undergoing significant local transformations. Within this framework, three burial practices (so called face, house and face/door urns) are analysed and compared with each other. They suggest not only the existence of intercultural interaction between variously far societies, but also of selective processes of negotiation and incorporation of external material culture. They study of face, house and face/door urns provides useful insights into the cultural complexity of Late Bronze Age Northern European communities within the larger continental framework. It unveils their capacity to perform phenomena of hybridization between practices with different cultural origins and allows discussing the complex role of material culture as marker of identity.Download Free PDFView PDF‘Peripheries’ versus ‘cores’ – The integration of secondary states into the World System of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East in the Late Bronze Age (1600-1200 BC)Nikolas Papadimitriou(with Demetra Kriga) in M.E.
