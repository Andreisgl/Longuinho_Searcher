Dunal), a medicinally important plant exposed to different concentrations of CuSO4 (0, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200μM) for 30d in vitro accumulated high amount of Cu in a concentration manner. Toxic effects of Cu on plants were reflected by the reductions in fresh weight (FW), shoot and root length, chlorophyll and carotenoids contents.Download Free PDFView PDFCopper toxicity in Withania somnifera: Growth and antioxidant enzymesMohammad Babar AliDownload Free PDFView PDFAntioxidative responses of Echinacea angustifolia cultured roots toMohammad Babar AliDownload Free PDFView PDFAntioxidative responses of< i> Echinacea angustifolia</i> cultured roots to different levels of CO< sub> 2</sub> in bioreactor liquid cultures2006 • Mohammad Babar AliThe effects of CO2 levels (0.03, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5%) on growth and antioxidant responses in 5l bioreactor (working volume 4l) root suspension cultures of Echinacea angustifolia were studied. CO2 caused reduction in growth, malondialdehyde content (MDA), lipoxygenase (LOX, EC 1.13. 11.13) activity and superoxide anion (O2−) accumulation along with high total phenols accumulation and pH levels. Maximal increases (37%) in total phenols were obtained at 1% CO2 compared to the control.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
