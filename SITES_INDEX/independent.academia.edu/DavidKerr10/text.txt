However, because almost every individual who develops liver cancer dies of the disease, HCC is the third most common cause of the cancer deaths in men and seventh most common in women. The treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma remains surgical resection or liver transplantation, in carefully selected cases. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to surgical intervention a variety of different therapeutic interventions have been investigated. These include direct ablation of the tumour using agents such as ethanol or acetic acid, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, or systemic chemotherapy. The evaluation of their efficacy is compromised by the paucity of adequately powered randomised clinical trials. The main challenge facing the research community over the next decade is to prioritise the most promising treatments and take these...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The value of additional bevacizumab in patients with high-risk stroma-high colon cancer.

In this study, we investigate whether anti-angiogenic therapy might improve survival of patients with a stroma-high profile with potentially increased angiogenesis. Tissue samples of the primary tumor of 965 colon cancer patients participating in the QUASAR2 trial were analyzed for tumor-stroma ratio (TSR). Stroma-high (&gt;50%) and stroma-low (≤50%) groups were evaluated with respect to survival. Disease free survival (DFS) was significantly lower in the stroma-high group (HR 1.53, 95%CI 1.19-1.95, P = 0.001). No difference in DFS was seen with respect to treatment with capecitabine alone (CAP) or capecitabine with bevacizumab (CAPBEV) (Stroma-high HR 1.00, 95%CI 0.69-1.46, P = 0.996; stroma-low HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.75-1.41, P = 0.883).

Aberrant organisation of DNA has been correlated with cancer prognosis in analyses of the chromatin component of tumour cell nuclei using image texture analysis. As yet, the methodology has not been sufficiently validated to permit its clinical application. We aimed to define and validate a novel prognostic biomarker for the automatic detection of heterogeneous chromatin organisation. Machine learning algorithms analysed the chromatin organisation in 461 000 images of tumour cell nuclei stained for DNA from 390 patients (discovery cohort) treated for stage I or II colorectal cancer at the Aker University Hospital (Oslo, Norway). The resulting marker of chromatin heterogeneity, termed Nucleotyping, was subsequently independently validated in six patient cohorts: 442 patients with stage I or II colorectal cancer in the Gloucester Colorectal Cancer Study (UK); 391 patient...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We investigated whether bevacizumab could improve disease-free survival in the adjuvant setting after resection of the primary tumour. For the open-label, randomised, controlled QUASAR 2 trial, which was done at 170 hospitals in seven countries, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with WHO performance status scores of 0 or 1 who had undergone potentially curative surgery for histologically proven stage III or high-risk stage II colorectal cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine alone (1250 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days followed by a break for 7 days) or the same regimen of oral capecitabine plus 16 cycles of 7·5 mg/kg bevacizumab by intravenous infusion over 90 min on day 1 of each cycle.

Evolution of nonsurgical therapy for colorectalThe management of colorectal cancer (CRC) has changed considerably in the past 15 years with the ... more The management of colorectal cancer (CRC) has changed considerably in the past 15 years with the introduction of multiple novel active therapeutic agents. Chemotherapy regimens combining a fluoropyrimidine with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan are standard first-line and second-line therapy for advanced and metastatic disease. The first-line use of these combinations produces tumor response rates of approximately 50% and a median overall survival of approximately 20 months. Addition of bevacizumab to first-line treatment and addition of cetuximab to salvage therapy for patients who fail to respond to irinotecan have contributed to further increases in tumor response rates and enhanced progression-free survival. Such approaches have produced only marginal overall survival benefits, however, and entail considerable cost. Adjuvant chemotherapy, delivered after surgical resection of the primary tumor, increases cure rates by approximately 10% for stage III disease and approximately 3-4% for stage II disease. Encouraging reductions in local relapse rates have been observed in patients with early rectal cancer who have undergone chemoradiotherapy, and increasingly complex regimens are currently being explored in phase II clinical trials in an attempt to increase both the operability and long-term local control of CRC. The greater the therapeutic choice, the greater the cost (both financial and in terms of toxicity), thus the keener the clinical community becomes to develop biomarkers to select patient populations who will be most likely to benefit from a specific agent.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is difficult to calculate all the direct and indirect contributors to the total cost of cancer treatment, but it is estimated that cancer drugs constitute 10% to 30% of the total cost of cancer care. A 2007 study in France showed the contribution of drug costs was less than 20%, with approximately 70% of the total expenditure on cancer accounted for by health care resource use, such as hospitalization. The U.K. government established the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-the dominant function of which is technology appraisal-to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products.

We sought to evaluate the clinical utility of P53 protein expression as a biomarker in VICTOR, a large phase III trial of rofecoxib in stage II and III CRC. Tissue micro arrays were constructed from 884 tumors and the expression of P53 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Tumors were dichotomised as either P53-positive (nuclear expression in &gt;10% of cells or the &#39;absent&#39; pattern, both representing TP53 mutation) or P53-negative (nuclear expression in &lt;10% of cells). Aberrant P53 expression was found in 65% (482/740) of patients. It was associated with distal location (p&lt;0.001) and stage III disease (p&lt;0.001). No effect was observed on disease-free or overall survival, and there was no interaction with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
