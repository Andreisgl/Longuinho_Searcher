We have become unknowingly complicit in perpetuating our own exhaustion because we are treating ourselves like machines. But even phones need to f*cking recharge.Caroline takes a good hard look at the dark side of self-help, and explains how she eventually used a radical period of rest to push back against cultural expectations and reclaim some peace.Tired As F*ck empowers us to say no to the things that exhaust us. It inspires us to carve out time to slow down, feel okay about doing less, and honor our humanity. This is not a self-help book, it’s a cautionary tale. It’s an honest look at the dogma of wellness and spiritual self-improvement culture and revels in the healing power of rest and letting shit go.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextPsychologyPersonal GrowthMental HealthLanguageEnglishPublisherHarperCollinsRelease dateFeb 8, 2022ISBN9780063052994Switch to audiobookStart your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleCDAuthorCaroline DoonerCaroline Dooner is a humorist and storyteller. She spent years as a performer and dieting like it was her job (because it kind of was). After healing her relationship to food, she's been sharing what she learned ever since. She lives with her anxious bernedoodle in Pennsylvania, and they’re just trying to live the simple life. She believes wholeheartedly in the healing powers of food and rest.Read moreRead more from Caroline DoonerSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextThe F*ck It Diet: Eating Should Be EasyEbookThe

Do you ever get in creative funks where you lack the drive to create while feeling invisible to the world?
 
There are those sinister inner voices that try to convince you that your work doesn’t matter and that you can’t make a difference.
 
I’m pretty sure everyone goes through these phases whether they admit it or not.
 
This episode is me admitting this to you in hopes you don’t feel alone in the times you feel invisible as a creative or life in general.
 
There is light at the end of the tunnel as I’m learning that this is _part of the struggle_ of pursuing something that’s important to you. In due time, it will be important to others as well.
 
It’s okay to feel this way at times, _it’s natural_. However, you are capable of pulling yourself out of this creative funk and pushing forward to the next phase on your creative path.

The introduction is amazing,  I had very high hopes for the book as having rest as a way of life is my goal too. But the author doesn't offer how to live this way, how to resist capitalist brainwashing.  Instead, she explores how she personally got to the point of being tired. Mostly, the text is about food addiction and dental problems. I recommend instead a well-researched "Radical Belonging" by Lindo Bacon.

I was feeling stuck, and I hoped that getting rid of my stuff would help me feel . . . something. Lighter? Freer? Clearer? So I got rid of lumpy pillows stuffed in the back of the linen closet. They did not spark joy. I got rid of dresses that were supposed to make me look like a little princess for the musical theater auditions I still forced myself to go to. Joyless. I threw out my little box of mismatched buttons I’d collected over the years. I was never ever going to use them because I am not a quirky seamstress. Goodbye twelve tangled obsolete computer cords! Goodbye broken umbrellas! Goodbye to who I was before! None of these things spark joy. I decluttered and decluttered. I donated and threw out bags and bags of broken kitchen utensils and boots that had never fit, until I was left with a nearly bare apartment. After a few days, once the temporary high of seeing thirty-five empty hangers in an empty closet wore off, I realized: oh . . . my stuff wasn’t actually the big problem; my life doesn’t spark joy. My life sparks dread. It exhausts me. And it has for a long time. I was sick of everything. I was sick of auditioning for acting jobs. I was sick of a career that I needed to medicate myself for in order to calm down. I was sick of never feeling like I was doing enough or being productive enough or impressive enough or innovative enough. I was sick of online dating and the drain of bad first dates, and the guilt I felt for wanting to just stay home. And after fifteen years (more than half my life at that point) of self-help books, I was so so sick of trying to self-improve in one way or another. I was exhausted, but I didn’t feel like I deserved to be exhausted. Most people have way harder lives than me, and most people just push through—because they have to. So, what the hell was wrong with me? Was I weak? Lazy? My burnout seemed like some sort of personal failing. But no matter how ridiculous or weak I thought it looked on the outside, I couldn’t deny it: I was exhausted. I was burnt out. And I could either keep going the way I was going and probably get even more tired, or do something about it. The truth is, the exhaustion went beyond physical exhaustion (even though physical exhaustion was definitely part of it). The exhaustion was stemming from an even deeper place. I had been operating under so many beliefs that I had never consciously recognized. Beliefs about human worth tied to our productivity: You must always be productive. You must always be improving. You can only relax once you reach your goal and become more impressive. I never felt like I was allowed to just . . . be. And I didn’t think I was allowed to accept myself the way I was, because the way I was wasn’t good enough. I was deeply flawed. And I thought until I fixed all my flaws, I had to suffer. I was never able to enjoy and relax, not only because I’d chosen a life and career that was so nerve-racking to me, but also because I was constantly supposed to be self-improving and getting somewhere else. And because the goalpost is always moving, and I never actually got there, it never ended. I never felt calm. And it was frying my nerves. Usually, when I started feeling this way, I looked for a self-help book to help me figure out what was wrong with me, and how to fix it. But this time, something inside me told me that instead of reading another self-help book that promised to heal me on a cellular level from the inside out, what I really needed was to stop. After more than a decade dedicated to rabid self-improvement, the answer for my exhaustion wasn’t more self-improvement. It couldn’t be. I’d already tried that over and over. I didn’t want to be a project anymore. Honestly, I was too tired to be a never-ending project. Right now, the only answer that felt relieving to me was rest. Rest from self-improvement. Rest from the grind. And if at all possible, rest from my own cruel mind. When you’re burnt out, the answer isn’t more pressure. It’s less. I needed to, somehow, get off the hamster wheel I was on. I needed existential rest. I needed soul rest. I needed to opt out of the entire story I’d written for myself about what I was supposed to be doing. We live in a culture that doesn’t really understand or respect burnout. We all soak in this belief that exhaustion is weak and that we all need to just buck up and be a little bit less lazy. That’s what I’d been trying to do. But it wasn’t working for me. So, I needed to give myself permission to opt out of our entire culture that tells us we’re never good enough and never doing enough. I needed to figure out if it was even possible to wake up every morning and not feel guilt or dread. Four years earlier, I realized that dieting and trying to lose weight over and over again had run me ragged. Dieting messed me up physically and mentally and emotionally. So, I decided to stop dieting. I bought bigger pants. I deliberately unlearned most of our misguided cultural beliefs about food and weight and health. I examined some of the root causes of my body fixation—and it all eventually became The F*ck It Diet book. My decision to opt out of our cultural diet mania completely changed my life, but after a few years I realized that I still had cultural expectations about everything else, not just food and weight. Diet culture pushes the belief that we should always be striving for control over food and over our bodies. It says that less food and being thinner is always better. But diet culture is actually just a subset of our culture at large that’s obsessed with control, and hustling, and personal responsibility, and hyper-productivity. And when I addressed my relationship with food, I’d only actually addressed a small part of a bigger cultural paradigm that worships control and self-punishment. So, now I needed to say f*ck it to all the other cultural expectations that were still invisibly strangling me. I had to address hustle culture’s hold over me, where every single fucking second of the day I expected myself to be working, hustling, and being productive. And the way I was deciding to opt out? I was going to rest. I was going to give myself a significant healing period of rest. And, just to be extra dramatic, I decided I was going to give myself two full years to rest. I wanted it to feel radical. And epic. And I felt like one year just wasn’t going to be long enough. Now, when I say rest, most people imagine that I’m saying either: rest from work, rest from physical activity, or good old-fashioned sleep. And while those things are great and important and absolutely a part of rest, I’m actually talking about something even bigger than just sitting still or lying down or doing less. I didn’t want to approach rest as just an activity to check off my to-do list (though that’s fine too!), I wanted to approach it as a sort of . . . way of life. I knew that just sitting around or forcing myself to lie down wasn’t going to be enough. I had to release my stress over it. I had to release my resistance and guilt. I had to radically allow the act of rest. I needed permission to rest as an antidote to the anxiety and burnout I’d been experiencing for years. I still had to work. I wasn’t going to be just lying around for two years. So, my rest was about working through the beliefs I had around rest and relaxation in the first place. I needed to actually figure out how to operate in my life in a more restful way—long term. Not just with work, but with everything. With the way I talked to myself. With the expectations I put on myself. With the constant feeling that I was supposed to be doing more. I needed to give myself permission to chill out, even when I was working. I needed to untangle myself from the pressure I was constantly putting on myself. I needed to work on the guilt and antsy-ness that was programmed into my cells every time I did try to chill out. It didn’t mean I wasn’t going to work for two years—but I was going to stop pursuing a career that has chewed me up and spat me out. It didn’t mean I wasn’t going to exercise or get anything done or spend twenty hours a day in bed, but the energy I approached my life with was going to be very different. Hopefully. That was my goal at least. My new goal was rest, and radical permission to rest. Years ago, while I was unlearning everything our culture teaches us about weight and health and food, I learned about the social determinants of health. And I was shocked. Why doesn’t anybody seem to care about the social determinants of health?! No mainstream conversation is talking about it?! All we talk about is losing weight and eating clean and exercise and the newest fad diets. The mainstream dialogue never mentions the fact that chronic stress, poor sleep, poverty, racism, and all kinds of oppression affect our health, more than anything we eat. Instead of giving people the well-rounded health care they need: sleep, support, access to doctors, trauma-informed therapy, a safe space to heal, and permission to rest, we are usually flippantly told to go on another diet and lose weight. Or go on a cleanse. Or intermittent fast. Or go keto. Just lose weight! It’s easy! As if lose weight isn’t already proven to backfire 95 percent of the time and lead to weight cycling, which often exacerbates chronic health issues. As if drinking celery juice or going keto weren’t already accessible only to wealthy people, not to mention completely unhelpful for most people. No one is talking about the thing that matters even more: Access to rest. Access to peace. This book is about my own experience in a culture that encourages productivity and personal responsibility at all costs. It ran me into the ground. And I’m sharing my story because I know I am not alone. You are not alone. So many of us are burning ourselves out trying to be the best versions of ourselves. But what if the expectations we’ve taken on are unfair? What if the game is rigged? What if we are seeking something created by marketing companies and glorified by magazines and Instagram influencers? What if what we think is the best version of ourselves is actually an impossible version of ourselves? What if we’ll be exhausted until we untangle ourselves from that pressure? So many of us are impossibly hard on ourselves. So many of us are constantly seeking beauty and thinness through extreme dieting and searching for miracle cures through spiritual self-help. So many of us are seeking excellence and approval through soul-crushing workaholism. So many of us are trying to force ourselves into boxes we don’t fit in and don’t belong in. So many of us are trying to have it all and ignoring our body’s signs of burnout. That was my experience. And no matter what it looked like on the outside, stress and self-hatred were eroding me from the inside out. In this book I’m going to tell you my story, and how I was always convinced there was something horribly wrong with me—and the exhausting things I did to try to fix myself. I’m not telling my story because I think it’s the most dramatic or horrible or exhausting or interesting story ever. I really don’t. But telling you some of my story will help me get to a common thread for so many of us: being convinced there is something wrong and broken inside us. These are the things that will continue to exhaust all of us, until we see them for what they are. So, I’m going to tell you about my perfectionism, my self-help obsession, my undiagnosed eating disorder, and how our culture applauded my extremism every step of the way. Everywhere I looked, it felt like I was being encouraged to push even harder. Keep trying to improve! And so—I did. There are so many ways we are encouraged to torture ourselves to become and stay impressive—and usually it doesn’t fucking work. And it isn’t fucking worth it. And then I’m going to tell you how I broke my cycle of exhaustion. I mean . . . don’t get me wrong, I still get stressed. I still get tired. But it’s way better than it was, because I have a different relationship with rest and productivity. After years of running myself ragged, I finally learned how to prioritize my own peace. I want that for you too. How to Not Be a Psychopath Last night in bed, I googled Do sociopaths like dogs? and I lay there reading the responses from self-identified sociopaths and psychopaths on Quora until after midnight. So, I’m very tired today—and angry with myself. But I learned a lot. I learned that, yes, sociopaths like owning dogs, because dogs are obedient and trusting and easily manipulated. Which is upsetting, because I was hoping that a dog could be my man filter so I don’t accidentally end up marrying a murderer one day. I learned a lot last night, actually. I learned the difference between sociopaths and psychopaths. It’s mostly a nature vs. nurture thing (at least according to what I read last night—I am in no way a psychopath expert). Apparently, sociopaths are made, and psychopaths are born. Psychopaths are literally born with a different brain—a smaller amygdala—and do not feel anxiety or fear. Whaaaaat? No anxiety or fear? They don’t have the capacity to feel fear like most other humans. And they have no conscience. No little voice telling them that what they’re doing is wrong. Obviously, that can create major problems, like serial killers and cult leaders and diabolical CEOs, but before thinking about the problems, I tried to imagine what it would feel like to not feel fear or anxiety. And I felt immediately jealous. Can you imagine how freeing that would be? To walk around life like you’re in a video game? To feel like a god among stupid humans? No doubt? No constant self-nagging and self-worry? No incessant voice in your head telling you you’re doing life wrong? Wow. Not fair. After a minute of imagining the fantasy freedom of psychopathy, I decided that even if I had a choice, no, I would not choose psychopathy. Psychopathy is not the answer to our exhaustion. I mean, maybe it actually is, but I know that we’d just be trading one problem for another, bigger problem. But . . . no anxiety? I’d sleep like a baby. I mean . . . I’d sleep like a psychopath. I didn’t actually realize how much anxiety I had until a few years ago. I know . . . that seems like a hard thing to miss, but for so long, I really thought that this was just what life was. Dread! All the time! I thought that my constant feelings of dread were happening because I had things that I needed to fix and figure out and conquer, and that once I finally fixed and figured out and conquered them, all my feelings of general dread would go away. I didn’t identify it as anxiety, I thought it was just the reality of having a million things about myself that I needed to improve. And I thought that once I improved, I wouldn’t feel so scared and miserable anymore. In a way it’s how so many of us are primed to think, hoping that the next product we buy, or the next program we complete, is going to finally fix our brokenness and make us peaceful and content. I’ve now realized that some anxiety is normal and the result of being a non-psychopath human with a normal nervous system and a normal-sized amygdala. Some anxiety is chemical and genetic. Some is the result of unresolved trauma and the body being stuck in a fight, flight, or freeze state. And some is from learned beliefs. My internal thermostat is always set to the mildly anxious setting, and sometimes it breaks and overheats into the very anxious setting, and I need to open the windows and let the air in and call the electrician. I’m guessing that for me, at least part of it is genetic, and unfortunately, it’s just the way it is. But a lot of my anxiety stemmed from believing that I was constantly supposed to be impressing people. And it started back in 1990, when my parents realized that I had a really good singing voice for a toddler. I don’t know what that realization process was like, and I don’t know what a good-singing toddler sounds like, but as far back as I can remember, I have been told I have an absolutely amazing singing voice. And as far back as I can remember, I have been singing for people, and have been very stressed about it. Caroline, you’re such a good singer [for a three-year-old], will you stand up on this coffee table and sing a little song for all your aunts and uncles? Yes! Do you want me to sing ‘I’m a Little Dutch Girl’? Or ‘How Are Things in Glocca Morra’? I felt a constant need to impress people. And then once they were impressed, it didn’t get easier, because then I had to keep people impressed. The constant expectation of performing and impressing people started to stress me out. I did love singing. But even more than that, I learned to love impressing people. And I became very, very stressed about my voice from a very young age. I was very critical of my singing from a young age because I wanted to live up to the hype! I didn’t want to let my peeps down! I couldn’t let down Great-Aunt Bernie! She just told everyone in the room how great I am! What happens to a person’s brain when they are constantly getting praise for something that stresses them out? This dynamic came to haunt me, and will haunt this very book, and it only got worse and worse the more people were part of the hype cycle, and the more high-stakes the performing venues became. This happens to a lot of us, I think. We’re all so caught up being impressive or worth something and holding on to whatever praise we get that we don’t often stop to consider whether it’s actually worth it. Can’t we just live?! Can’t we just enjoy life’s little pleasures without worrying that we are unimpressive? So to any four-year-olds who are reading this book, here is my advice to you: do not take your singing voice too seriously, because your perfectionism might backfire on you with debilitating shakiness and performance anxiety, and the one thing you could have truly loved will come to haunt you and make you cry. And even at thirty-one, when you are singing at your best friend’s wedding, instead of joy you will only feel terror. Instead, maybe just lurk in the background and become OK with simple joys and not being the center of attention. It is more peaceful there. Anxiety is exhausting. It’s depleting. It’s distracting. And it affects your mind and your body. And, if you are not a psychopath, you probably have some anxiety. It’s to be expected. The question I think we eventually have to ask ourselves is: How much of our anxiety is inherent and chemical and unavoidable, and how much of it is learned and accidentally perpetuated? I eventually realized that at least a chunk of my anxiety was coming from learned beliefs and cultural pressures I’d taken on. A million little beliefs I never ever questioned.
