Fillia (pseudonym of Luigi Colombo) was one of the futurist artists who produced paintings on religious themes. This article argues that Fillia used futurist sacred art not in support of Benito Mussolini and fascism, but instead as a means of symbolic protest "from within” the regime. Fillia’s religious paintings are idiosyncratic, complex, and ultimately much more than the traditional religious images they seem to be. Through a close reading of Fillia’s religious paintings from 1931-1933, analyzed in the context of his written works from 1923-1933, the article demonstrates how his iconography and compositional style question and challenge aspects of fascism, and its attempts to establish itself as a lay religion of the state.Download Free PDFView PDF"Filippo Tommaso Marinetti: The Futurist as Fascist, 1929-1937."

While scholars have largely tackled the thematic specificity and visual impact of this text within the general development of Italian Futurist art in the course of the 1920s, they have failed to take up the issue of its specific place in the ongoing construction of the European artistic framework of the 1920s. This essay aims to redefine the history of the concept of Futurist machine art from a different perspective, by highlighting its complex and contradictory relations with contemporary artistic practices in Europe and with the emergence of Constructivism.Download Free PDFView PDFA proposito di „Reconstructing the Universe“: Guggenheim Museum, New York, QFIAB, 94 (2014)Monica CioliDownload Free PDFView PDFBeyond Futurism: Bruno Munari’s Useless MachinesPierpaolo AntonelloDownload Free PDFView PDFBruno Munari: The Lightness of Art‘On the Verge of the Absurd’: Bruno Munari, Dada, and Surrealism in Interwar Italy2017 • Ara H. MerjianNearly every piece of writing on Bruno Munari’s career includes passing nods to Dada and Surrealism: aesthetic (and anti-aesthetic) precedents casually appended to the more obvious influences of Constructivism and Concretism upon his prodigious body of work. Munari’s seemingly inexorable progression toward graphic and industrial design – the practices on which he le his most enduring mark – passed through various, successive stages, in ected in turn by Futurism and the Bauhaus, Abstraction-Création and Arte Programmata, among other movements and tendencies. These affinities appear well documented in scholarship. The nature of Munari’s rapport with Surrealism and Dada, however, has yet to receive any sustained examination – something this chapter aims to redress, considering along the way not simply Munari’s absorption of European currents, but the fittful reception of Dada and Surrealism in Italy at large.Download Free PDFView PDFBruno Munari and the invention of modern graphic design in Italy, 1928-19452011 • Alessandro ColizziThis study examines Bruno Munari’s work as a graphic designer from the late 1920s to mid-1940s, with the aim of understanding the emergence and characteristics of the modernist trend in Italian graphic design. Taking shape in Milan, an original ‘design culture’ eclectically brought together two quite different strains of Modernity: a local tradition represented by the Futurist avant-garde, and a European tradition associated with Constructivism. Munari (1907–1998) worked simultaneously as painter and as advertising designer. Concentrating on Munari’s stylistic development, the study seeks to explore the interaction between the Futurist visual vocabulary and conceptions coming from architecture, photography, abstract painting, and functionalist typography that trickled in from central and northern Europe. The discussion positions the designer in his time and place, concentrating as much on the artefacts as on the broader cultural framework. Secondly, the study attempts to assess Munari’s reputation against a body of exemplary work, based on firsthand documentation. It is the first extensive, detailed record of Munari’s graphic design output, and as such provides a substantial base for a full understanding of his œuvre.Download Free PDFView PDFF. T.

The Lithuanian-born Eva Kühn Amendola (1880-1961), on whom my discussion will be focused, was a deeply non-conformist woman and a multilingual, cosmopolitan intellectual who became an Italian citizen through her marriage with Giovanni Amendola. The couple met in Rome in 1903, when Kühn was still a student. She was a creative writer, essayist and literary translator. There are many gaps and missing links in the story of Kühn’s life and futurist activities. What we have left are basically, as is often the case with female artists, writers and intellectuals until after World War Two, fragments and traces — a kind of “ruined map.” Yet the texts and documents available allow us to see that her experience, including the difficult, deeply conflicted relationship with her husband, is an example of how Futurism before, during and immediately after the Great War, set some intellectual women’s imagination on fire, becoming for them a form of radical existential, aesthetic and then socio-political practice.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Legacy-toward New ParadigmsMina Loy and the Quest for a Futurist Feminist Woman2009 • Lucia Re... destructeur des anarchistes, les belles idées qui tuent, e le mépris de la femme.” The complete “Fondation et manifeste du futurisme” was ...
