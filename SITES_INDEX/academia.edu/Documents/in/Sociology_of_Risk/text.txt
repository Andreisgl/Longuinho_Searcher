Despite this, they have been propelled to the forefront of the political agenda. Using an innovative theoretical approach, this book examines how, under what conditions, by whom, for what reasons, and with what impact cyber-threats have been moved on to the political agenda. In particular, it analyses how governments have used threat frames, specific interpretive schemata about what counts as a threat or risk and how to respond to this threat. By approaching this subject from a security studies angle, this book closes a gap between practical and theoretical academic approaches. It also contributes to the more general debate about changing practices of national security and their implications for the international community.Save to LibraryDownloadby Myriam Dunn Cavelty•  8  Information Warfare, Security Studies, Sociology of Risk, Risk ManagementDevising Local Sustainable Development Indicators: from technical issues to bureaucratic stakes.

It also requires participation in environmental decisions of those affected by them, and equal recognition of their cultural identities, dimensions most clearly articulated in relation to indigenous struggles, where past devaluation of place-based cultural identities is seen as a source of injustice. An alternative concept of environmental justice is proposed that draws on accounts of how attachment (and place attachment specifically) is constitutive for both self-efficacy and collective agency in the face of an intrinsically uncertain future. Drawing on the work of Peter Marris and using a case study of UK gas pipeline infrastructure, it is shown how disruption to attachments also disrupts lived strategies for dealing with an uncertain future. The source of injustice involved in such disruption should be viewed as the ‘colonisation of attachment’.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher Groves•  12  Place Attachment, Community Engagement & Participation, Governance, Sociology of RiskInsurance as a Business of ImaginationDespite the fact that insurance is a ubiquitous core institution of modern society, a sociological theory of insurance does not yet exist.

This article aims at suggesting some hypotheses which can help filling the gap. Insurance has been pertinently defined as "the archetype of modernist governance of the future". Consequently, a sociological research on insurance institution should answer three preliminary questions: First, when we talk about the future, what are we actually talking about? Second, how is it possible to govern the future in the present? Finally, what is the modernity of this modernist governance of the future, and why does insurance represent its archetype? Moving from a comparison between prudence and providence, it is suggested that insurance turns uncertainty into possibilities. In this way, the decision-maker who takes out insurance can plan for the planningness of the future-that is, whatever happens, he relies on an open future. This article suggests, eventually, that the theory of evolution is conceptually well equipped to explain why an institution that at the beginning (that is, in the late Middle Ages) was regarded as a form of deviation has become normal over time.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alberto  Cevolini•  6  Sociology, Social Sciences, Sociology of Risk, Sociological TheoryFukushima und die Grenzen der Risikoanalyse (CSS Analyse)Risikoanalysen dienen dazu, zukünftige Chancen und Herausforderungen systematisch zu erfassen und sie so berechenbar und handhabbar zu machen.

The paper argues that debates over biosecurity can be conceptualised as arguments over the ability to regulate flows of disease and the constructions of space they adopt. Data from parliamentary inquiries and interviews are used to show how attempts to institutionalise forms of biosecurity emerge from a delicate balance of prescribed and negotiated spaces configured by a host of social, natural, and material agents. The interaction between these spaces provides a way of regulating the flows of disease and purifying agricultural space. This balance is resisted by farmers, whose practical knowledges of the constant struggle of managing the contingencies of agriculture lead them to suggest that only uniform versions of space can effectively regulate flows of disease. The author concludes by discussing the importance of recognising these differences for future biosecurity and animal health policy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gareth  Enticott•  9  Geography, Computer Networks, Sociology of Risk, Human-wildlife conflictsSpołeczeństwo informacyjne jako społeczeństwo ryzyka / Information Society as Risk SocietyŁuczak, M.

Kraków: Wydawnictwo UJ.W niniejszym artykule naszkicowane zostaną problemy związane z interpretacją kategorii ryzyka, a także pojęcia zagrożenia, jako takimi, które mogą być pomocne w dyskursie na temat społeczeństwa informacyjnego. Ponadto, kategorie te nie są traktowane jedynie jako swoiste narzędzia takiego dyskursu. Znajdują one swe realne egzemplifikacje w obszarze bytu społecznego, manifestując się nie tylko w odniesieniu do problemów wynikających ze złożoności współczesnego świata i transformacji społeczeństw, ale również na styku szeroko rozumianej domeny komunikacji z domeną współczesnej technologii; co za tym idzie - dotyczą więc zarówno jednostek jak i wielkich zbiorowości społecznych, ujmowanych - odpowiednio - w kontekście systemu osobowości, systemu społecznego oraz systemu technicznego. Godny podkreślenia wydaje się fakt, iż te wszelkie konkretne zagrożenia, które umownie możemy nazwać technologiczno-komunikacyjnymi, wpisują się w całokształt zagrożeń jakie czyhają na współczesnego człowieka "(...) w epoce późnej nowoczesności" (Giddens 2002). Muszą więc być one postrzegane zarówno przez pryzmat swej globalności, jak też z personalnego, osobistego punktu widzenia każdego człowieka, jako członka społeczeństwa. Podobnie ryzyko i zagrożenie jako kategorie wpisują się we współczesny dyskurs - o tymże człowieku i tworzonym przez niego społeczeństwie - stąd też jawne nawiązanie w tytule niniejszego tekstu do znanej książki Ulricha Becka "Społeczeństwo ryzyka".Save to LibraryDownloadby Mikołaj Jacek Łuczak•  7  Sociology of Risk, Ulrich Beck, Socjologia, Społeczeństwo SiecioweSociologia de risco: globalizando a modernidade reflexivaSave to LibraryDownloadby Renata Motta•Sociology of RiskDe Walter White a Heisenberg: El camino del (anti)héroe en la sociedad del riesgoEl nuevo milenio revitaliza las tesis de Ulrich Beck (2008) y su sociedad del riesgo a través de dos grandes acontecimientos que golpean a Estados Unidos en el arranque del siglo XXI: los atentados del 11 de Septiembre —y sus... moreEl nuevo milenio revitaliza las tesis de Ulrich Beck (2008) y su sociedad del riesgo a través de dos grandes acontecimientosque golpean a Estados Unidos en el arranque del siglo XXI: los atentados del 11 de Septiembre —ysus consecuencias— y la Gran Recesión. Precisamente en este ambiente de incertidumbre se desarrolla uno delos momentos de mayor esplendor para las producciones dramáticas estadounidenses conocida como la TerceraEdad Dorada de la televisión. Este doble contexto es el punto de partida de la presente investigación que se centraen el papel de la ficción en la reproducción de la sensación de miedo.

Anenvironment strongly influenced by the uncertainty, where the so-called Third Golden Age of American Television alsotakes place. It is just that the bottom of this research that questions the role of fiction in reproducing the sensationof fear. For such purpose, the case study is Breaking Bad (AMC, 2008-2013). A television series which is born betweenthese two historic moments that impacts in its plot and in its sub-genres.In this way, the Qualitative Content Analysis allows to analyze the influence of the Risk Society on the impact ofthe fear in this plot, specifically the anti-heroism. A research that shows that fiction is fundamental for a better understandingof the environment of uncertainty nowadays.Save to LibraryDownloadby Delicia  Aguado Peláez•  11  Cultural Studies, Sociology of Risk, Heroism, Series TVAgeism and Risk during the Coronavirus PandemicThe coronavirus pandemic has laid bare societal discourses regarding age differences and stereotypes.

Using sociological approaches to risk and drawing on some examples from the Australian online news media, we illustrate how risk management approaches and risk uncertainties in response to the coronavirus, have homogenised younger and older peoples and widely positioned them in a binary generational conflict of ‘risky’ and ‘at risk’. Younger people are frequently framed as healthy, active agents: they are engaging in risky behaviours that endanger their health and that of others. In contrast, older people have been typically cast as passive and at risk: ‘the elderly’ and ‘the vulnerable elderly’. In extreme cases, older people have also been framed as burdensome and worthless. In this chapter, we examine how age was framed or ‘staged’ during COVID-19 to illustrate how ageist language and dichotomous pandemic framings — grounded on blame and shame — add to social divisions and ‘othering’, shape risk management strategies, and cloud public health messaging on risk, viral spread, and physical distancing measures.Save to LibraryDownloadby Peta S Cook and +2Cassie CurryerMaho Omori•  19  Sociology of Risk, Aging, Age Discrimination, AgeismPublic Participation in Sentencing: The Pros and Cons of such InvolvementSave to LibraryDownloadby Eirini Savvidi•  15  Criminology, Criminal Law, Criminal Justice, Sociology of RiskEnvironmental Risk Narratives in Historical Perspective: From Early Warnings to 'Risk Society' BlameThis article builds upon earlier risk narrative research, focusing upon their historical development primarily in the US and UK and drawing upon a wide range of key historical and contemporary moments and examples.

It proceeds from an understanding risk not as a thing, but a tool that brings together an understanding of threats, what is threatened and how that might be remedied in the future, increasingly based upon past experience. Risk narratives emerge historically with the growth of concern for the public impact of environmental events, through individuals prepared to articulate this and then challenge the denial of institutional responsibility. The explicit language of environmental risk only emerges in postwar America through challenges to fluoridation, pesticides and consumer safety, however, amidst concern with the greater impact of man-made risk and situated within a radical discourse of systemic blame. The introduction indicates the power and 'independence' of narratives with the important example of 'nuclear catastrophism', and then sets out definitions and location, including the related fields of framing and stigmatization. The article then begins with the absence of narrative in ancient Roman accounts of environmental events and proceeds chronologically through 18 th century beginnings, the development of more critical responses in the 19 th and early 20 th Century and the full emergence of 'risk society' type narratives, to today. After summarising, it finally suggests that if narrative is to be used in risk communication it will require more sophisticated forms that go beyond only exposing risk and insisting upon blame, based upon cultural assumptions of necessary harm from association with the corporate, 'unnatural' and stigmatized.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adam Burgess•  16  Environmental Studies, Environmental History, Disaster risk management, Sociology of RiskCerase, Andrea (2016) 'Dalla società del rischio alla società a rischio zero: la paradossale radicalizzazione di un processo' in Francesca Colella, Maria Paola Faggiano, Mihaela Gavrila & Mariella Nocenzi (eds.)

We observe that such behavior can become totemisticand have a limited relationship to the risk it ostensibly answers to. Drawing uponexamples such as recycling and original data from a study on drink-spikingavoidance, the article sets out a new concept for discussing and understanding suchrisk-related behavior: the ‘risk ritual’. We elaborate upon this concept in the article,identifying a number of tendencies in risk rituals and drawing upon anthropologicaland sociological work on the nature and uses of ritual. We compare the ‘risk ritual’to religious and community rituals, exploring the connections between the formerand the rain dance, religious ablutions, abstinence from eating meat on a Friday,and rite of passage ceremonies. Influenced by the cultural approach to risk, weargue that risk rituals, like rituals more generally, are shaped by social conditions,currents, and processes, such as the emphasis on personal responsibility for riskmanagement and the desire to mark out the ‘sacred’ and the ‘profane’. The articleconcludes that ritualistic risk behavior is better viewed as functional rather thanirrational.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adam Burgess•  4  Sociology of Identity, Sociology of Risk, Risk, Sexual risk behaviourFrom pool to profile: Social consequences of algorithmic prediction in insuranceThe use of algorithmic prediction in insurance is regarded as the beginning of a new era, because it promises to personalise insurance policies and premiums on the basis of individual behaviour and level of risk.

The core idea is that the price of the policy would no longer refer to the calculated uncertainty of a pool of policyholders, with the consequence that everyone would have to pay only for her real exposure to risk. For insurance, however, uncertainty is not only a problem – shared uncertainty is a resource. The availability of individual risk information could undermine the principle of risk-pooling and risk-spreading on which insurance is based. The article examines this disruptive change first by exploring the possible consequences of the use of predictive algorithms to set insurance premiums. Will it endanger the principle of mutualisation of risks, producing new forms of discrimination and exclusion from coverage?

The plight of Telangana demonstrates the historical and contextual nature of legitimacy. The paper asserts that the ongoing struggle to legitimate risk and democracy will be constitutive of the norms and values of the new state, influencing the way in which exposure to risk is differentiated, and democratic legitimacy defined.  It suggests that, although contextualized, local struggles to legitimate risk and democracy represent a microcosm of a wider global legitimation process which is constitutive of world society and the search for justice in a world at risk.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elaine L Desmond•  51  Sociology, Political Sociology, Geography, AnthropologySocial Work in a Risk SocietyThis text constructs a new way of thinking about social work based on contemporary social theory and taking into account recent changes in social work.

It looks at risk, trust, regulation, identity, and governmentality to explore the impact of risk society and neoliberalism on social work.

Based on longitudinal fieldwork with 56 such students, it analyses motivations described by students and their parents in interviews, showing that these far exceed instrumentalism and engage tactics of both gendered risk management and cosmopolitan self-fashioning. Discussion of the gendered risks in post-socialist China that students seek to mitigate through study abroad illustrates the complexity of students' motivations, and underlines the limitations of western European sociological theories of risk society which assume that gender inequality tends to decrease in late modernity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Fran Martin•  10  Gender Studies, Mobility/Mobilities, International Education, Sociology of RiskKonstruowanie tożsamości współczesnej młodzieży w kulturze ryzyka i skoku adrenaliny, D.

Far from seeing its legitimacy undermined as a risk management agency that should predict and prevent potential migratory crisis, it has incorporated the emergency rethoric into its official communication, making it a legitimating tool for a steady expansion of its role, prerogatives and resources to the detriment of alternative actors in migration policy. This reproduces the paradoxes of a humanitarian policy which is intended at protecting the bare life of migrants and asylum seekers, while violating their fundamental rights to escape and find asylum elsewhere.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giuseppe Campesi•  11  European Studies, Humanitarianism, Critical Security Studies, Immigration LawUne théorie politique du risque.

The theoretical and methodological ideas behind the book, inspired by Aristotelian phronesis, represent an original perspective within the social sciences, and this volume gives readers for the first time a set of studies exemplifying what applied phronesis looks like in practice. The reflexive analysis of values and power gives new meaning to the impact of research on policy and practice. Real Social Science is a major step forward in a novel and thriving field of research. This book will benefit scholars, researchers, and students who want to make a difference in practice, not just in the academy. Its message will make it essential reading for students and academics across the social sciences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg and +1Sanford  Schram•  1613  Screenwriting, Critical Theory, Critical Theory, Critical TheoryManufacturing Uncertainty out of Manufactured Sweeteners: The Curious Case of AspartameSave to LibraryDownloadby Adam Burgess•  9  Risk Governance, Risk regulation, Sociology of Risk, Public Health PolicyRisk, 2nd edition (2013).

However, among contemporary Japanese people of childbearing age, the never-married singlehood rate is ever-increasing amidst a dearth of alternative forms of partnership, a consistently high demand for marriage, and a thriving ‘marriage hunting’ (konkatsu) market. At the core of this puzzle is a prevalence of virginity and significantly decreased inter-gender interaction among the singles as a whole. Based upon qualitative research conducted at multiple ‘marriage hunting’ venues within the Tokyo metropolis, this article analyses contemporary Japanese singlehood within the framework of the ‘culture of uncertainty’, which scholars have argued characterizes post-bubble ‘precarious Japan’. It can be argued that the current absence of past institutions that mediated interpersonal connections has left the recent generation who came of age during the two ‘lost decades’ deprived of relevant gender scripts as well as appropriate gendered expectations. Specifically, this article examines how newly emergent non-normative gender tropes, such as the ‘herbivore-type man’, are regarded with ambivalence by both men and women, as well as how traditional gender norms persist within the singles’ psyche despite their increasing social irrelevance.Keywords: culture of uncertainty, precarious Japan, singlehood, marriage hunting, konkatsu, herbivore, sōshoku, inter-gender interaction*This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Japan Forum on 01/03/2018, available online: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09555803.2018.1441167Save to LibraryDownloadby Kumiko Endo•  7  Economic Sociology, Sociology of Culture, Communication, TrustDisputing Security and Risk: The Convoluted Politics of UncertaintyThis chapter explores some of the dilemmas that arise in using uncertainty as a lens to interpret societal problems and issues.

Using several cases to open up discussion we argue that it is vitally important to understand the historical, political and cultural context in which debates about risk, uncertainty and (in)security materialise. Arguing for a re-specified, context-specific account, we seek to unravel dominant understandings of uncertainty in three domains: cyber security, counter-radicalisation strategy and mechanisms for coping in the aftermath of structural violence. While acknowledging the value of uncertainty as an heuristic device, we argue that established units of sociological analysis – such as power and ideology – remain important explanatory concepts in understanding institutional actions and policy drivers.Save to LibraryDownloadby William McGowan•  5  Security, Sociology of Risk, Uncertainty, Cyber SecurityMegaprojects and Risk.

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorLa società della sicurezza.La società della sicurezza non è l'opposto della società del rischio, ma è il suo specchio.

È una società dove la crescente consapevolezza delle tre possibili fonti di danno - i pericoli, i rischi e le minacce - produce nuove domande di sicurezza. Dove all'aumento degli ambiti della vita sociale in cui i rischi e le minacce si manifestano corrisponde la proliferazione dei metodi per calcolarli, gestirli e controllarli. Dove la paura causata dalla prefigurazione di possibili danni futuri si traduce nella ricerca, talvolta ossessiva, di una condizione di sicurezza nel presente. Attraverso studi di caso in diversi settori di policy - dalla sicurezza internazionale a quella sul lavoro, dalla sicurezza sanitaria a quella urbana - questo libro ripercorre il processo attraverso cui la sicurezza è costruita socialmente mediante una complessa negoziazione di significati tra molteplici attori, quali i politici, gli esperti, i media e il pubblico.Sulla base di un'ampia analisi delle fonti mediatiche, il libro mostra come, di fronte a paventati eventi dannosi, differenti attori competano nell'arena pubblica e mediatica per il dominio della propria interpretazione dei problemi e delle relative soluzioni. Il significato della sicurezza prende forma attraverso la messa in scena delle minacce nel discorso pubblico e contribuisce a determinare il clima di opinione in cui particolari scelte di policy emergono ed acquisiscono legittimazione sociale.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria Grazia  Galantino•  3  Sociology of Risk, Securitization, Risk and crisis managementRyzyko – między kulturą strachu a kalkulowaną niepewnościąSave to LibraryDownloadby Franciszek Kampka and +1Wojciech Polec•  2  Sociology of Risk, SocjologiaSocial work in a risk society: Social and political perspectivesSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Webb•  8  Social Work, Risk Governance, Risk regulation, Sociology of Risk Richard Sparks & Tim Hope, Crime Risk & Insecurity; and Hazel Kemshall, Understanding Risk Save to LibraryDownloadby David  Scott•  2  Sociology of Risk, Risk ManagementO risco nas ciências sociais: uma visão crítica ao paradigma dominanteSave to LibraryDownloadby João Areosa•  7  Sociology of Risk, Risk, Sociologia, Ciências SociaisSilent Spill: The Organization of an Industrial CrisisSave to LibraryDownloadby Thomas D.

Through surveys and interviews with university students in the United Kingdom and United States, we explore knowledgeand beliefs about drink-spiking and the linked threat of sexual assault. University students in both locations are not only widely sensitized to the issue, but substantial segments claim fi rst- or secondhand experience of particular incidents. We explore students ’ understanding of the DFSA threat inrelationship to their attitudes concerning alcohol, binge-drinking, and responsibility for personal safety. We suggest that the drink-spiking narrative has a functional appeal in relation to the contemporary experience of young women’s public drinking.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adam Burgess and +1Pamela Donovan•  7  Criminal Justice, Sociology of Risk, Alcohol Studies, Crime AnalysisA Canadian Perspective on Cannabis Normalization among Adults: Has all the Stigma Gone?

It is based on a contemporary interpretation of the Aristotelian concept phronesis, usually as ‘prudence’. Phronesis is the ability to think and act in relation to values, to deliberate about ‘things that are good or bad for humans’ in the words of Aristotle (1976:1140a24–b12). Phronetic organizational research effectively provides answers to the following four value-rational questions, for specific problematics in management and organization studies: 1. Where are we going with this specific management problematic? 2. Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? 3. Is this development desirable? 4. What, if anything, should we do about it?Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  1348  Screenwriting, Critical Theory, Business, EntrepreneurshipA Political Campaign Risk Management PlanThe purpose of this paper is to develop a Risk Management Plan, or RMP for a political campaign.

The basic idea of the project was comprehensive, coherent, and innovative, and it was based on rational and democratic argument. During implementation, however, when idea met reality, the play of Machiavellian princes, Nietzschean will to power, and Foucauldian rationality-as-rationalization resulted in the fragmentation of the project.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  960  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorRisk Society - paper on Ulrich BeckSave to LibraryDownloadby Marianne Novaes  Figueiredo Bonatto•  3  Sociology of Risk, Ulrich Beck, Risk societyA National Pragmatic Safety Limit for Nuclear Weapon QuantitiesThis study determines the nuclear pragmatic limit where the direct physical negative consequences of nuclear weapons use are counter to national interests, by assuming all unknowns are conservatively optimistic.

The only effect considered is nuclear winter (" nuclear autumn " in the low weapons limits) and the resultant effects on the aggressor nation. First, the ability of low nuclear weapon limits is probed for maintaining deterrence in the worst-case scenario of attacking the most-populous nation. Second, the ability of aggressor nations to feed themselves is assessed without trade and industry resultant from a nuclear attack causing " nuclear autumn " (10% global agricultural shortfall). Third, the best-case wealthy aggressor nation with abundant arable land is analyzed for starvation and economic impacts given 7000, 1000, and 100 nuclear weapons scenarios. The results found that 100 nuclear warheads is adequate for nuclear deterrence in the worst case scenario, while using more than 100 nuclear weapons by any aggressor nation (including the best positioned strategically to handle the unintended consequences) even with optimistic assumptions (including no retaliation) would cause unacceptable damage to their own society. Thus, 100 nuclear warheads is the pragmatic limit and use of government funds to maintain more than 100 nuclear weapons does not appear to be rational.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Pearce and +1David Denkenberger•  46  Risk Management and Insurance, Safety Engineering, Sociology of Disaster, Disaster StudiesNextLast »Related TopicsRiskFollowFollowingRisk GovernanceFollowFollowingRisk and VulnerabilityFollowFollowingEnvironmental SociologyFollowFollowingScience and Technology StudiesFollowFollowingSociologyFollowFollowingPolitics And Sociology Of RiskFollowFollowingScience, Technology and SocietyFollowFollowingRisk ManagementFollowFollowingSoftwareFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
