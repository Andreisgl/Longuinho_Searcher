This approach, labeled construct equivalence, allows for replacing valid tests currently in use with new, experimental tests that have been shown to measure the same constructs. We demonstrated the construct equivalence approach by collecting data from over 2,000 applicants for four different positions in a large petrochemical company. We investigated the equivalence of the experimental and the current tests by using correlational analyses, structural modeling, and analyses of hiring decisions. Results indicated that the experimental and current tests measure the same constructs and that replacing the current tests with the experimental tests would treat ethnic and sex subgroups consistently. Construct equivalence was shown to be a viable approach to test substitution.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel B.

When the condition is not satisfied, we propose a heuristic to obtain a feasible point starting from a solution of the relaxed problem. These methods are then demonstrated to provide exact solutions to a richer class of optimal power flow problems than previously solved.Save to LibraryDownloadby deepak kumar•  20  Mathematics, Functional Analysis, Computer Science, Machine LearningHow is impulsivity related to depression in adolescence?

We find that the usual parameter restrictions (requiring all smoothing parameters to lie between 0 and 1) do not always lead to stable models. We also find that all seasonal exponential smoothing methods are unstable as the underlying state space models are neither reachable nor observable. This instability does not affect the forecasts, but does corrupt the state estimates. The problem can be overcome with a simple normalizing procedure. Finally we show that the admissible parameter space of a seasonal exponential smoothing model is much larger than that for a basic structural model, leading to better forecasts from the exponential smoothing model when there is a rapidly changing seasonal pattern.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Akram•  5  Statistics, Exponential Smoothing, State Estimation, SeasonalityStructural modeling of mutant α-glucosidases resulting in a processing/transport defect in Pompe diseaseSave to LibraryDownloadby Arnold Reuser•  20  Genetics, Chemistry, Human Genetics, MedicineSegregation of Oxygen at Metal/Oxide-InterfacesBy internal oxidation of AgMg- and PdMg-alloys small precipitates ofMgO are formed within the Ag- or Pd-matrix.

Thetotal area of the metal/oxide interface produced this way becomes severalsquare meters in one cubic centimeter of metal. Segregation of oxygen at theinterface is determined by desorption of gaseous oxygen for theAg/MgO-interface and by trapping of hydrogen for the Pd/MgO-interface.

Therefore, in this paper, we develop a structural model of innovation that incorporates information on innovation success from firm surveys along with the usual R&D expenditures and productivity measures. We then apply the model to data on Italian SMEs from the “Survey on Manufacturing Firms” conducted by Mediocredito-Capitalia covering the period 1995–2003. The model is estimated in steps, following the logic of firms’ decisions and outcomes. We find that international competition fosters R&D intensity, especially for high-tech firms. Firm size and R&D intensity, along with investment in equipment, enhances the likelihood of having both process and product innovation. Both these kinds of innovation have a positive impact on firm’s productivity, especially process innovation. Among SMEs, larger and older firms seem to be less productive.Save to LibraryDownloadby Francesca Lotti•  9  Economics, Product innovation, Developing Country, Firm SizeA Hamiltonian electrostatic coupling scheme for hybrid Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics simulationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alessandro Laio•  16  Engineering, Energy Conservation, Quantum Mechanics, ElectrostaticsHow much nominal rigidity is there in the US economy?

Suitable substitution mutations were identified from a three-dimensional model of an AHAS-inhibitor complex. The structural model was generated based on homology to pyruvate oxidase and an imidazolinone inhibitor was positioned in the proposed binding site using structure-activity data for this class of herbicide. Biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli enabled iterative optimization of the mutant genes. Expression of recombinant proteins in tobacco plants conferred resistance in vivo. The novel approach coupling molecular modeling and molecular biology has many advantages over traditional random mutagenesis and selection methods and will be crucial to the future development for environmentally safe and sustainable agricultural systems.Save to LibraryDownloadby Vladimir Sidorov•  20  Molecular Biology, Sustainable agriculture, Tobacco, Gene expressionNickel trafficking: insights into the fold and function of UreE, a urease metallochaperoneSave to LibraryDownloadby Stefano  Ciurli•  22  Inorganic Chemistry, Protein Folding, Macromolecular X-Ray Crystallography, Homology ModelingVULNERABILITY AND DAMAGE ANALYSES OF EXISTING BUILDINGSSave to LibraryDownloadby Ali Bakhshi•  5  Earthquake Engineering, Seismic Hazard, Seismic Risk, Nonlinear static & dynamic analysisImpact of government support on R&D and innovationSave to LibraryDownloadby Abraham Garcia•  4  European Union, Product innovation, Community Innovation Survey, Structural modelMOSILAB: Development of a Modelica based generic simulation tool supporting model structural dynamicsSave to LibraryDownloadby Christoph Nytsch-Geusen•  11  Structural Dynamics, Use Case, Simulation experiment, Mixing TimeGreen products and corporate strategy: an empirical investigationPurpose – The purpose of the study is to examine the influence of multiple factors on the green purchase intention of customers in Australia.

A structural model of the value continuum is formulated and tested on small and mid-size enterprises in the software industry. Partial least squares path analysis is used to investigate the cause–effect relationships between the foundation values – efficiency and effectiveness – and the innovation value. The results show that the innovation value of localised inter-firm networks originates from costs savings and quality improvements. Conversely, alliance-induced 'speed' benefits (measured by the R&D process's acceleration), which improve flexibility and/or shorten delivery time, have no significant impact on market-based performance. An alliance's time-related benefits may be important to maintain competitive parity, but they do not significantly support competitive advantage, market development and market penetration. Instead, value is created via, for example, an exchange of tacit knowledge and a reduction in transaction costs, and particularly by a reduction in customer service costs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christian M .
