Minimal processing operations need to be designed to protect fruits and vegetables against undesirable deleterious consequences of mechanical bruising such as browning, off-flavor development and texture breakdown. The search for methods to retard these negative effects is of great interest to all the stakeholders involved in the production and preservation of fresh-cut fruits. In this sense, edible coatings can be regarded as a strategy to maintain the original properties of intact vegetable tissues. The artificial semipermeable barrier, a polymeric edible coating, contributes to shelf-life extension by reducing migration of moisture and solutes, gas exchange, respiration and oxidative reactions, and the associated physiological disorders. Edible coatings can additionally act as carriers of antibrowning, antimicrobials, colorants, flavouring agents, nutrients or even probiotic organisms. Edible coatings may be composed of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids or a blend of these compounds. Their composition determines the barrier properties of the layer with regard to the transfer of moisture, gases, solutes and/or volatiles when applied on a food system. This review is an update about the state of the art of the development of edible coatings for fresh-cut fruits, as an alternative to the currently used preservation approaches.Download Free PDFView PDFTrends in Food Science & TechnologyEdible films and coatings: Structures, active functions and trends in their use2011 • Albert  IbarzDownload Free PDFView PDFUse of Edible Coatings to Increase the Shelf Life of Jaggery A Review.pdfBOGALA  MADHUDownload Free PDFView PDFEdible Films and Coatings for Food ApplicationsStructure and Function of Protein-Based Edible Films and Coatings2009 • Kirsten DangaranDownload Free PDFView PDFStructure and Function of Starch-Based Edible Films and Coatings2000 • Michael P KramerEdible films and coatings satisfy a variety of needs and meet specific product challenges for a large number of food applications. There is a general lack of agreement as to what constitutes a coating. A layer of seasoning on a snack or an oil spray applied to a cracker or a baked product, are examples of edible coatings.

The tomatoes selected for the present study were treated with one of several coatings, carrageenan (0.5% and 0.3%), carrageenan + cinnamon oil (0.3% + 0.25%), carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) (1% and 0.5%), CMC + cinnamon oil (0.5% + 0.25%) for 2 min and stored at 25 ± 5°C and 60 ± 5% relative humidity. Physico-chemical and biochemical analyses revealed a significant decrease in the incidence of decay, weight loss, and delay in the change in colour, pH and titratable acidity of coated tomatoes relative to uncoated fruit. Coatings maintained the textural quality and antioxidant level of tomato fruit during the storage period. The shelf life of coated tomatoes could be extended by 12 days more than uncoated fruit. The results of this study show that edible coatings have the potential to control decaying incidence, extend the storage life and maintain valuable characteristics by delaying ripening and senescence processes in tomatoes.Download Free PDFView PDFEffects of Opuntia Cactus Mucilage Extract and Storage under Evaporative Coolant System on the Shelf Life of Carica papaya FruitsEmmanuel Sunday AjayiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
