Based on an empirical investigation conducted in 2017 on a national sample of 193 social workers from Romania, the current article answers the following questions: What type of impact do the job and the personal and organizational characteristics have on the well‑being and turnover intentions of Romanian social workers? Which of these characte ristics are the most significant? Three indicators were used to analyze social worker's well‑being: the three‑dimensional construct of burnout, mental health complaints, and physical health complaints. The turnover intention was added as an outcome. The findings of the study suggest that more than the personal characteristics of the respondents or the specific requirements of the job, it is the organizational environment which has a definitive impact on the social worker's well‑being and turnover intention. The most significant among the organizational characteristics observed were: the job pressure, the supervisor support, and the organizational justice. The final section of the article presents some possible lines of action to reduce burnout among social workers, as well as some future research questions that arose from the study findings.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersArtigo Maslach Job Burnout2001Catarina RochaDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF BURNOUT, WORK ENGAGEMENT AND WORKAHOLISMBaran MetinAbstract The present study explores the interrelationships between specific work attachment styles, work engagement, workaholism and burnout, as well as their antecedents such as job demands (e.g. workload), and job resources (e.g. colleague support). Moreover, the effects of work characteristics on work and non-work related outcomes (physical health, organizational commitment and work-family harmony) are investigated as well. Structural equation analysis of data from 266 hotel employees shows that high job demands are associated with burnout and workaholism, whereas the presence of job resources is strongly related to work engagement. Work engagement was also associated with better health, increased organizational commitment and more favorable work-family harmony. Workaholism was only linked to high levels of organizational commitment. Findings support the proposed employee well-being model. The results are discussed in terms of the basic assumptions of the Job Demands-Resources Model, and practical implications for managers and employers were suggested for desired person-job fit and related consequences.Download Free PDFView PDFUnderstanding the burnout experience: recent research and its implications for psychiatryChristina Maslach, Michael P. LeiterThe experience of burnout has been the focus of much research during the past few decades. Measures have been developed, as have various theoretical models, and research studies from many countries have contributed to a better understanding of the causes and consequences of this occupationally-specific dysphoria. The majority of this work has focused on human service occupations, and particularly health care. Research on the burnout experience for psychiatrists mirrors much of the broader literature, in terms of both sources and outcomes of burnout. But it has also identified some of the unique stressors that mental health professionals face when they are dealing with especially difficult or violent clients. Current issues of particular relevance for psychiatry include the links between burnout and mental illness, the attempts to redefine burnout as simply exhaustion, and the relative dearth of evaluative research on potential interventions to treat and/or prevent burnout. Given that the treatment goal for burnout is usually to enable people to return to their job, and to be successful in their work, psychiatry could make an important contribution by identifying the treatment strategies that would be most effective in achieving that goal.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Nursing ManagementPredicting cynicism as a function of trust and civility: a longitudinal analysis2013 • Michael P.

It has been linked to psychological distress (burnout), mainly in healthcare and educational settings. Burnout is a serious public health concern. Studies addressing the impact of workplace incivility on employee well-being in the hospitality industry are scarce. The primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between workplace incivility and burnout among hotel employees. Cross-sectional data for 385 Portuguese hotel employees (54% male; M age = 33.9, SD = 11.3) were analysed using bootstrap regression models. Results revealed that (1) supervisor incivility was significantly more frequent than co-worker incivility; (2) supervisor and co-worker incivility were significant positive predictors of emotional exhaustion and cynicism, the core components of burnout; (3) supervisor incivility was the stronger predictor of emotional exhaustion, and co-worker incivility the stronger predictor of cynicism; and (4) severe burnout was highly prevalent in our sample. This study provides insight into the phenomena of workplace incivility and burnout among Portuguese hotel employees. Our results have practical value for management strategies aiming to prevent or reduce burnout, which in turn has the potential to enhance individual, group, customer and organizational outcomes within the hospitality industry.Download Free PDFView PDFSystematic Review of Burnout Risk Factors among European Healthcare ProfessionalsAdriana BabanHealthcare professionals’ burnout is a response to the prolonged exposure to occupational stress and affects negatively both the employee and the organization. The aim of the present review is to discuss the relevant burnout risk factors for European healthcare professionals working in hospitals and clinics. A systematic search of articles published between January 2000 and December 2011 was conducted in several databases (ISI Web of Knowledge, PsychArticles, SagePub, PubMed and Cochrane database of systematic reviews). After the analysis of the 4335 articles found, 53 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Results confirm the main role of occupational and organizational risk factors while pointing out that psychosocial factors have a small yet statistically significant influence on burnout development. Socio-demographic factors, although included in the majority of studies, seem to have little impact on burnout. In conclusion, the review pointed out that althou...Download Free PDFView PDFOccupation Psychology in Higher Education Institutions in PakistanDr Riaz A MangiDownload Free PDFView PDFOccupational Psychology in Higher Educational Institutions: A Study in PakistanDr Riaz A MangiThe work engagement and job burnout are rapidly emerging areas in research on human resources management and occupational psychology in Pakistan.

The first aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the short version of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale in the Italian context. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 3-factor model of perfectionism and evidenced satisfactory psychometric properties of the scale. The study also aimed to test a theoretical model in which the three dimensions of perfectionism — self-oriented, other-oriented, socially prescribed perfectionism — have both a direct and an indirect effect, through workaholism, on emotional exhaustion and professional inefficacy. Results showed that self-oriented and other-oriented perfectionism were positively associated with workaholism, which, in turn, was positively associated with emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, workaholism mediated the relationship between self-oriented and other-oriented perfectionism and emotional exhaustion. Additionally, self-oriented perfectioni...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
