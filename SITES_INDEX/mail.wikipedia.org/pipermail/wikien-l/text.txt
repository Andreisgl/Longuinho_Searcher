I think we should go further still and shoot for the ultimate goal of 
creating "Wikimedia." That's media with an "m." It would use 
Wiki-style rules to enable public participation in the creation and 
editing of all kinds of media: encyclopedias and other reference 
works, current news, books, fiction, music, video etc. Like current 
broadcast media, it would have differentiated "channels" and 
"programs," each with self-selecting audiences. Unlike current media, 
however, the audience would also be actively involved in creating its 
own programming, instead of merely passively watching it.
