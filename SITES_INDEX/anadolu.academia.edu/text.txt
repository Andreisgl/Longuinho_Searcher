Ahmet Tolga TekAnadolu University,  Classical Archaeology,  Faculty MemberAncient economy+35Prof. Dr. of Classical Archaeology at Anadolu University, Dept. of Archaeology, Faculty of Literature (Edebiyat Fakültesi), Yunus Emre Campus, Eskisehir, Turkey. attek@anadolu.edu.tr ORCID ID 0000-0002-3893-6256I have worked (or now working) in several excavations and surveys : In Lycia at Arykanda, Olympos, Andriake, Letoon ; In Caria at Aphrodisias, Stratonikeia, Lagina; In Lydia at Tripolis; in Galatia at Ankyra.; in Pamphylia at Side; in Cilicia at Kelenderis and Tarsus.I have participated to or recently lead teams to do numismatic surveys at Afyon, Fethiye, Sinop, Isparta and Side Museums. I am at the moment working on coin finds from Stratonikeia, Tripolis, Aphrodisias, Letoon and Side and the Museums of Side and Isparta. I also publish time to time numismatic/glass material I worked at Arykanda. My research interest is also on ancient glass. I sometimes look/catalogue/study at other small finds/material (gems, metalwork, seals and rarely pottery) As a hobby I try to learn and study Medieval-Modern coinages and Medal art, banknotes and stamps as testimonies of self representation of the states and leaders, in order to further understand the mentality behind ancient coin design and production. For this reason I started to collect only "modern" coins, medals, banknotes, pre 1945 postcards and stamps.   I believe every ancient artifact or art piece belongs to public and they should not be hidden by private parties, but be open to all - and we have technology to do that/ bring out all collections online, share freely the information and knowledge! I have nothing against collectors, I just want the system to benefit science, governments, public and the collectors as a whole with information being made available freely to all. I see illegal excavation destruction everywhere I go, this has got to stop. The market has to control its greed and stop destroying information and evidence of our past.   Also I try to learn and understand Medieval Islamic Coinage, but I admit, not my strongest point at the moment - more road to travel there:)  To summarise, my research interest focuses on ancient coinage and glassware, with wider interest on various aspects of economics. I enjoy working on scientifically excavated material more than fancy museum pieces with no provenances and find details. After all, I am an classical archaeologist trained and seasoned many years at field and maybe more in excavation/museum depots:):):)  I sometimes do government work as advisor to Law Courts as a coin and small finds specialist.At the moment I am teaching Greek and Roman Numismatics; Ancient Glass; Gems and Cameos; Historical Geography of Turkey and Historical Geography of Mediterranean and Europe at Archaeology department of Anadolu Uni.  In the past, for many years I have taught Geometric, Oriantelizant; Black and Red Figure Attic, Hellenistic and Roman Pottery, Hellenistic Art and Archaeology and Classical Mythology as well.less2,938 Followers524 Following12 Co-authorsTotal Views ;626 Public MentionsFollowFollowingWebsiteall15 Arykanda in Lycia15 Side in Pamphylia3 Stratonikeia in Caria11 Other Numismatic Work1 Other Glass WorkMore  7 Miscalenious Papers15 Conference Presentations69 Tarihi Coğrafya Dersleri - Historical Geography24 Grek Nümizmatiği Dersi - Greek Numismatics Course19 Roma Nümizmatiği Dersi - Roman Numismatics Course3 Akdeniz Avrupa Tarihi Coğrafyası2 Ongoing Studies1 Talks1 Papers1 SeminarArykanda in Lycia(2020) A Numismatic Riddle from Arykanda: The God of the Water Springby Ahmet Tolga Tek and Hacer SancaktarAdalya,  2020Among the coin types minted for Arykanda under

His club is lowered,and he is holding the reins of his horsewhich stands next to him. On Kakasbos’s rightthe horse with its right front hoof is striking arock from which water flows. The iconographyis new for Kakasbos and has never been seenbefore. In fact, he is always shown riding hishorse with his club raised to strike. This articleexplains why this is an image of Kakasbos andnot some other deity. It uses other archaeologicalfinds - epigraphic and iconographic - foundduring the excavations at Arykanda. The authorsalso identify the water source meant onthe coin type and the cult area that existednext to it at Suyun Gözü, the main source ofthe Arykandos River.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Out of this total, 117 Early Byzantine coins, that is between Anastasius I to Constans II, are presented in this article. The nature of early Byzantine coins found at Stratonikeia are very similar to several other published sites in Karia and rest of Asia Minor, but a major disparity from other Karian sites start from the reign of Phocas with more examples and continue during the reign of Heraclius with less examples represented at Stratonikeia. Although the sample is low in number, these indicate an attack and destruction at the site, most possibly caused by Persians in or shortly after 616 AD. The find sequence shows a distinct cut in the reign ofConstans II due to a very probable Arab attack destroying the city shortly after 655/6 AD as coin finds suggest. No coins belonging to the following 250 years until mid-tenth century AD have been uncovered at Stratonikeia yet.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

(2020) Antik Ve Orta Çağ Kaynaklarinda, Yazitlarda Ve Sikke Basimlari İle Podalia / Podalia in Ancient and Medieval Sources, Inscriptions and its CoinageOLBA,  2020The city of Podalia was situated in North Lycia in the Elmalı Plain, close to the village of Kara... more The city of Podalia was situated in North Lycia in the Elmalı Plain, close to the village of Karamık at Buralye Hill. This area was in early antiquity originally part of Milyas which seems to have been invaded by Lycians from the south and Pisidians from the east. The city was rarely mentioned in ancient or medieval texts and although there are no inscriptions known from the site known yet, a few inscriptions from elsewhere mention the city name. For very brief periods, the city produced Hellenistic and Roman Provincial coinage. Its Hellenistic coinage is only known from 8 examples all belonging to the same type that has a head of Artemis on the obverses and a half figure of a Zebubull shown butting on the reverses with an abbreviated from of the city name. These coins cannot be later than 81 or 75 BC when Podalia, together with Arykanda seems to have been added to the Lycian League. The types’ similarity to the Royal Seleucid and Seleucid influenced autonomous civic coinage suggest that they may have been minted around 188-160s BC. Podalia’s only Roman Provincial Coinage belongs to the Lycian series minted for Gordian III and Tranquillina. 14 examples (6 for Gordian, 8 for Tranquillina) have been collected from museum collections and auction data vastly increasing examples hitherto known for this city. Although number is still too low, the existing dies suggest that more coins were produced for Gordian than Tranquillina. Thereverses feature Apollon Kitharadeus and Ares. 5 misattributions to this mint have also been catalogued. For historical perspective of the North Lycia, Milyas area, one should especially be aware of the misattributed bronzes to Podalia under the Lycian League; Podalia was not a League mint.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although low in number to comment upon, when joined with a further 189 “excavated” examples from the 1961-1973 seasons at the site published by Prof. D. J. MacDonald, these provide ample evidence to understand the coins represented at Aphrodisias and their place in circulation. Coins from the other mints represented at Aphrodisias provide us with evidence for travel made on the major routes in the region.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As one may expect, most of these finds belong to thecity itself or its neighbouring communities, butapproximately 14% of the Greek and 12% of the RomanProvincial issues come from mints more than 100 km ormore distant from Side. Several mints in the Aegean regionare also represented in this sum.We have to argue of course what exactly excavated“foreign” coins from any given archaeological site actuallyshow. Can they be interpreted as evidence to activities liketrade or transport of army units etc? I personally do notbelieve so. There are for example many ways to do trade;the simplest being exchange of product against productwhere no money changes hands. I believe excavated bronzecoins merely show “personal travels” for various reasonsincluding trade and military. Silver units would have beenused more for trade, but these behaving differently frombronze units in circulation and found less in civicexcavations are merely shadowed volume wise incomparison to what may have been circulating then insidehoard finds. The finds from Side show different patterns of“personal travels” between Greek and Roman periods; butthe contacts with Aegean cities is unmistakable.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
