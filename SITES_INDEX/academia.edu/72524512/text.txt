Web-based learning environments (WBLEs) were designed in collaboration with participating teachers with the use of simple tools that do not demand specialized IT knowledge. Several word-based mathematical problems were chosen. The WBLEs guided the students following five steps. The guidance was facilitated by navigation buttons, audio instructions, pictures, and diagrams, etc. Six whole-classroom implementations were conducted where the students (including a student with dyslexia) collaborated in groups with the use of a computer. Also, eight individua...Download Free PDFView PDFStudies in Second Language Learning and TeachingCross-country comparison of EFL teacher preparedness to include dyslexic learners: Validation of a questionnaireDina TsagariThe aim of this study was to validate a 24-item TEPID (Teachers of EFL Preparedness to Include Dyslexics) scale measuring the beliefs of 546 pre-service and in-service teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) across three countries (Cyprus, Greece, and Poland) on their preparedness to include learners with dyslexia in mainstream foreign language (FL) classes. Principal component analysis of the scale led to a two-factor structure, that is, knowledge and self-efficacy in implementing inclusive instructional practices with dyslexic EFL learners, and stance towards inclusion. The analysis of measurement invariance confirmed the generalizability of the TEPID across all subgroups and allowed valid comparisons between factor variances and covariances. The scale is a useful tool for investigating perceived teacher preparedness to include dyslexic learners and variables that influence TEPID, comparing the results across countries, and designing tailored pre-service and in-service tra...Download Free PDFView PDFEducation Abstracts: 14th Annual International Conference2012 • Gregory T PapanikosThis abstract book includes all the abstracts of the papers presented at the 14th Annual International Conference on Education, 21-24 May 2012, organized by the Athens Institute for Education and Research.

Using a qualitative, single case study approach, data were collected from observations, field notes, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. The students were observed in inclusive general classrooms in Year 6, in English and Arabic, respectively, in addition to pull-out sessions for further English literacy support. Findings revealed that the school is providing both students with effective educational services, but the students are not able to access the Year 6 curriculum in English. There are no support services provided for Arabic literacy. A lack of coordination between teaching staff, administration and parents, and an unclear vision of inclusive education, had a negative impact.

This is often attributed to their lacking of skills needed to engage socially with classmates in order to develop social relationships and friendships. Some studies have found that particular teaching arrangements such as cooperative learning activities and wider pedagogical practices can be conducive to promoting the social inclusion of pupils identified as having SEN. In this paper, we draw on evidence from two recent studies conducted in England and Cyprus which combined sociometric techniques ascertaining the social position of pupils accredited with SEN with in-depth interviews with practitioners and pupils as well as observations. By combining the insights gained from two different contexts, we formulate an open list of pedagogical strategies and wider school practices for promoting social interaction and ultimately the social inclusion of all children.Download Free PDFView PDFDyslexia friendly practices in Greek primary EFL classrooms2016 • Maria  RerakiThree EFL classrooms in primary schools in Greece were introduced to dyslexia friendly practices so as to explore whether dyslexic pupils? inclusion was enhanced.

The study was qualitative and used non-participant observation in two primary classrooms in different primary schools and semi-structured interviews with the main teachers of these classes. The findings revealed that the main changes implemented by these teachers were a differentiated programme of literacy and numeracy, and opportunities to students to process information through many senses. In addition, the teachers boosted the learning of students with learning difficulties by focusing on essentials, using process-oriented praise, peer tutoring, and regular communication with parents. The article concludes with suggestions about how Cypriot primary school teachers can boost the learning of students with difficulties and how leaders can support their efforts.

A survey and follow up interviews were employed to investigate the following: a) Novice teachers’ perceptions of their preparedness to teach English after completing a 4-year Teacher Education program, and b) Challenges encountered during induction years in relation to English language teaching (ELT). Findings point to the inadequacy of pre-service education in Cyprus, in this regard, and call for the reconceptualization of the current practices for preparing primary teachers for the actualities of ELT in state schools.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
