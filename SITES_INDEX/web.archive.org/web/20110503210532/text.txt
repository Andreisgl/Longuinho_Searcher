 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.

At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.

Collection: Wide Crawl started March 2011
Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011.  This uses the new HQ software for distributed crawling by Kenji Nagahashi.
What?s in the data set:
Crawl start date: 09 March, 2011
Crawl end date: 23 December, 2011
Number of captures: 2,713,676,341
Number of unique URLs: 2,273,840,159
Number of hosts: 29,032,069
The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa?s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date.  We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives.  The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites.
However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it.  For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them).  We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.
We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available ?warts and all? for people to experiment with.  We have also done some further analysis of the content.
If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you?re hoping to do with it.  We may not be able to say ?yes? to all requests, since we?re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered.

About Piarco International Airport 
Welcome
Welcome to Piarco International   Airport. Its fairly new terminal stands out like an eagle on the Caroni plains.This airport is set against a backdrop of the Northern range in the north and, as such, the view before landing is breath taking.
As you make your way down the arrival corridor you will notice our walls are  full of our country's history which is rich in culture. The murals displayed will give one a closer look at the past, present and future achievements of our people. These images may haunt you yet awaken  your senses to what Trinidad has to offer.
After clearing with immigration  officials, do notice our duty free shops. They carry a variety of items that  range from perfumes and cosmetics to eye wear and foot wear.
At this point you may probably  think that you are in a party, but that is the Trini culture those sweet tunes  come from Rhyner’s Record shop and it is a mere sample to what can be heard as  you peruse the streets of Port of    Spain, our capital.
If you have time, kindly visit  the atrium which is not only the main point of the facility but also the hub of  activity where exhibitions are set up complete with entertainment, exhibitors  and a plethora of persons eagerly sifting through current displays. 
If you have any further questions about the island, the  Tourism Development Company's office is situated just outside of the Customs  Hall. The office is open between the hours of 8:00am to 10:00 pm daily. 
Do enjoy your stay and thank you  for choosing Trinidad.
