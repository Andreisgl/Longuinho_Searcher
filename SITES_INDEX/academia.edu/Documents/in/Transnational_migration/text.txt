Unatoč tome zamjetan je rastući suvremeni interes za proučavanje migrantskih organizacija među društvenim znanstvenicima. Stoga je cilj rada izdvojiti glavne suvremene pristupe istraživanju migrantskih organizacija, uključujući definicije, koncepte i perspektive, te upozoriti na zanemarene teme i izvore pristranosti u istraživanjima. U prvome dijelu rada razmatraju se definicije migrantskih organizacija, uključujući i terminološke dvojbe oko sastavnih dijelova definicije tj. pojmova „organizacija“ i „migranti“. Izdvojeni su i teorijski i empirijski tipovi migrantskih organizacija koji nastaju kao pokušaj reduciranja kompleksnosti empirijskih manifestacija migrantskog organiziranja te služe kao heuristička sredstva umjesto preuskog ili preopćenitog definiranja migrantskih organizacija. Tipiziranje migrantskih organizacija varira od jednostavnih dihotomnih kategorizacija do tipologija s više kategorija prema nekoliko kriterija, od ciljeva do aktivnosti i orijentacije organizacija. Autorica razmatra i metodološke pristupe istraživanju i metode prikupljanja podataka o migrantskim organizacijama, izdvajajući manje rasprostranjene i specifičnije metodološke pristupe. Sljedeći dio rada predstavlja glavne pristupe istraživanju migrantskih organizacija, uključujući i povezane koncepte – socijalni kapital i strukturu političkog oportuniteta – koji su u različitim varijantama rasprostranjeni u istraživanjima migrantskih organizacija iz nacionalne perspektive. Autorica izdvaja transnacionalnu perspektivu istraživanja, naspram prethodno razmatranim pristupima koji djelovanje migrantskih organizacija promatraju u „kontejneru nacija-država primitka“ zanemarujući značajan dio utjecaja na njihovo formiranje i djelovanje koji dolazi izvan zemlje primitka. Kao zastupljena područja istraživanja migrantskih organizacija u transnacionalnoj perspektivi, izdvajaju se migrantski politički transnacionalizam i istraživanja migrantskih zavičajnih organizacija, dok su studije koje za glavnu temu imaju istraživanje veza među migrantskim organizacijama u transnacionalnim socijalnim prostorima značajno manje zastupljene. Posljednji dio rada osvrt je na teme koje su rijetko u fokusu istraživanja migrantskih organizacija i na pristranosti u istraživanjima, uključujući esencijalizam i metodološki nacionalizam. Zamjetno je zanemarivanje rodne perspektive, organizacija unutarnjih migranata i neformalnih oblika organiziranja te prezastupljenost istraživanja migrantskih organizacija koja se fokusiraju na političke aktivnosti i sudjelovanje u političkim procesima.Save to Libraryby Simona Kuti•  4  Diasporas, Migration Studies, Transnational migration, Migrant OrganizationsAfrican Transnational Mobility in China: Africans on the Move - IntroductionConsidering the African presence in China from an ethnographic and cultural studies perspective, this book offers a new way to theorise contemporary and future forms of transnational mobilities while expanding our understandings around... moreConsidering the African presence in China from an ethnographic and cultural studies perspective, this book offers a new way to theorise contemporary and future forms of transnational mobilities while expanding our understandings around the transformations happening in both China and Africa. The book develops an original argument and new theoretical insights about the significance of the African presence in Guangzhou, and presents an invaluable case study for understanding particular modes of transnational mobility. More broadly, it challenges forms of (re)presenting and producing knowledge about subjects on the move; and it transforms existing theorisations and critical understandings of mobility and its shaping power. Through an ethnographic approach, the volume brings us closer to a number of practices, features and objects that, while characterising the lives of Africans in Guangzhou, are also evidence of the interplay between individual aspirations, and the structural constraints embedded in contemporary regimes of transnational mobility. Raising critical questions about ways of (un)belonging in the precarious settings of neoliberal modernity and the future of African mobilities, this book will be of interest to scholars of transnational, African and Chinese Studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Roberto Castillo•  6  Cultural Studies, African Studies, Transnationalism, ChinaTransnational Entrepreneurs: An Alternative Form of Immigrant AdaptationThe recent literature on immigrant transnationalism points to an alternative form of economic adaptation of foreign minorities in advanced societies that is based on the mobilization of their cross-country social networks.

Case studies have noted the phenomenon's potential significance for immigrant integration into receiving countries and for the economic development in countries of origin. Despite their suggestive character, these studies consistently sample on the dependent variable (transnationalism), failing to establish the empirical existence of these activities beyond a few descriptive examples and their possible determinants. These issues are addressed using a survey designed explicitly for this purpose and conducted among selected Latin immigrant groups in the United States. Although immigrant transnationalism has received little attention in the mainstream sociological literature so far, it has the potential of altering the character of the new ethnic communities spawned by contemporary immigration. The empirical existence of transnationalism is examined on the basis of discriminant functions of migrant characteristics, and the relative probabilities of engaging in these kinds of activities is established based on hypotheses drawn from the literature. Implications for the sociology of immigration as well as for broader sociological theories of the economy are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby William Haller•  3  Transnationalism, Migration Studies, Transnational migrationFraming a De-Territoralized, Hybrid Alternative to Nationalist Essentialism in the Postcolonial Era: Tjalie Robinson and the Diasporic Eurasian 'Indo' CommunityThe dislocated, deterritorialized discourse produced by repatriates from formerly European colonies has remained overlooked in academic scholarship.

One such group is the Eurasian “Indo” community that has its roots in the former Dutch East Indies, today’s Indonesia. This article focuses on Tjalie Robinson, the intellectual leader of this community from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The son of a Dutch father and a British-Javanese mother, Robinson became the leading voice of the diasporic Indo community in the Netherlands and later also in the United States. His engagement resulted in the foundation of the Indo magazine Tong Tong and the annual Pasar Malam Besar, what was to become the world’s biggest Eurasian festival. Robinson played an essential role in the cultural awareness and self-pride of the eventually global Indo community through his elaboration of a hybrid and transnational identity concept. By placing his focus “tussen twee werelden” (in-between two worlds) and identifying “mixties-schap” (mestizaje) as the essential characteristic of Indo identity, Robinson anticipated debates on hybridity, transnationalism, and creolism that only much later would draw attention from scholars in the field of postcolonial studies. This article highlights Robinson’s pioneering role in framing a deterritorialized hybrid alternative to nationalist essentialism in the postcolonial era.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeroen Dewulf•  154  Cultural Studies, Cultural Sociology, Self and Identity, Southeast Asian StudiesStaatstheorie vor neuen Herausforderungen.

The different chapters consider the multiple facets of the phenomenon and the complex challenges they pose, bringing together knowledge from several disciplines and regions of the world within a single collection. Together, they provide an integrated picture of transnational movements of people by sea with a view to making a decisive contribution to our understanding of current trends and future perspectives and their treatment from legal-doctrinal, legal-theoretical, and non-legal angles. The final goal is to unpack the tension that exists between security concerns and individual rights in this context and identify tools and strategies to adequately manage its various components, garnering an inter-regional / multi-disciplinary dialogue, including input from international law, law of the sea, maritime security, migration and refugee studies, and human rights, to address the position of ‘migrants at sea’ thoroughly.Save to LibraryDownloadby Violeta Moreno-Lax•  16  European Law, Human Rights Law, International Law, Human RightsOne way Trip.

A common response to livelihood insecurities and destruction is migration. Using Peter Singer's ‘historical principle’, this paper argues that a morally just evaluation requires taking causality between climate change and migration under consideration. The historical principle is employed to emphasize shortcomings in commonly made philosophical arguments to oppose immigration. The article concludes that none of these arguments is able to override the moral responsibility of industrialized countries to compensate for harms that their actions have caused.Save to LibraryDownloadby Raphael J Nawrotzki•  23  Ethics, Climate Change, Climate change policy, MigrationTheory of the Border (Oxford University Press, 2016)There are more types of borders today than ever before in history.

Borders of all kinds define every aspect of social life in the twenty-first century. From the biometric data that divides the smallest aspects of our bodies to the aerial drones that patrol the immense expanse of our domestic and international airspace, we are defined by borders. They can no longer simply be understood as the geographical divisions between nation-states. Today, their form and function has become too complex, too hybrid. What we need now is a theory of the border that can make sense of this hybridity across multiple domains of social life. Rather than viewing borders as the result or outcome of pre-established social entities like states, Thomas Nail reinterprets social history from the perspective of the continual and constitutive movement of the borders that organize and divide society in the first place. Societies and states are the products of bordering, Nail argues, not the other way around. Applying his original movement-oriented theoretical framework "kinopolitics" to several major historical border regimes (fences, walls, cells, and checkpoints), Theory of the Border pioneers a new methodology of "critical limology," that provides fresh tools for the analysis of contemporary border politics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Thomas Nail•  247  Critical Theory, European History, Cultural History, Cultural StudiesBorderlands.

Drawing on his ethnographic fieldwork, he shows that borders, far from disappearing, have acquired a new kind of centrality in our societies, becoming reference points for the growing numbers of people who do not find a place in the countries they wish to reach. They have become the site for a new kind of  subject, the border inhabitant (or) the border dweller, who is  both ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, enclosed on the one hand and excluded on the other, and who is  obliged to learn, under harsh conditions, the ways of the world and of other people.  In this respect, the lives of migrants, even in the uncertainties or dangers of the borderlands, tell us something about the condition in which everyone is increasingly living today, a ‘cosmopolitan condition’ in which the experience of the unfamiliar is  more common and the relation between self and other is in constant renewal. . This book will be of great interest to students and scholars in anthropology, sociology and politics, as well as anyone concerned with the pressing issues raised by migration today.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michel AGIER•  11  Globalization, Border Studies, Migration, CosmopolitanismTRANSNAZIONALISMO E PERCORSI FAMILIARI: PROFILI DI GENERE E DI GENERAZIONE A CONFRONTO NELL'IMMIGRAZIONE ECUADORIANAIl presente articolo analizza, un profilo del transnazionalismo migratorio ancora recentemente poco tematizzato nella pur vasta letteratura sul tema: la dipendenza di almeno una parte dei legami transnazionali dalla fase del corso di vita... moreIl presente articolo analizza, un profilo del transnazionalismo migratorio ancora recentemente poco tematizzato nella pur vastaletteratura sul tema: la dipendenza di almeno una parte dei legami transnazionali dalla fase del corso di vita attraversata dai migranti, e dalla fase del loro ciclo di vita familiare, prima che da altre variabili più spesso enfatizzate; ad esempio il capitale umano, sociale ned economico dei migranti, o le struttura d’opportunità con cui essi si confrontano.

It thus becomes a matter of both challenge and opportunity for the home and host countries. On the one hand, the economic changes over the past hundred years that includes close integration, opening of trade, ideas and information, have resulted in benefitting the industrially developed economies. On the other hand, for the developing economies, the challenges remain though of different level and kind. However, the changed circumstances globally also bring along opportunities for these states to help them overcome the challenges. The increased movement of people has resulted in the global development of new ideas, intercultural linkages, democratisation of global space etc. In this scenario , diaspora has emerged as an important player in the transnational sphere for both the home and host countries.

In so doing, it advances a model of the nineteenth-century US state-in-formation that demonstrates how the legal status of the transatlantic Famine Irish took on greater significance than any cultural differences with White Anglo Saxon Protestant America. Key concepts are explored, such as citizenship, nationality, race, ethnicity, the fractional state, the racial state, and the Black and Green Atlantic. Introduced, moreover, is one of the most important yet most overlooked American patriots of the nineteenth century, Irish-born Archbishop John Hughes of New York, whose efforts helped to mold the corporate Catholic Church into a major ideological apparatus of the US state.Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter D O'Neill•  32  American Literature, American History, Cultural History, Cultural StudiesTransnational Islamic charity as everyday ritualsIn this article, through a case study of transnational Islamic charity, we explore the intersection between migrant development engagements and religious practices.

While migrant engagement in development is well known, the intersections of these with everyday religious practices are less so. We use the prism of 'everyday rituals', understood as human actions that connect ideals with practices. Everyday rituals not only express but also reinforce ideals, in this case those of Islamic charity in a context of sustained migrant transnationalism. The article draws on 35 interviews about Islamic charity, transnationalism and development with practising Muslims of Pakistani origin in Oslo, Norway. We argue that everyday rituals are a useful tool for exploring the role of religion in motivating migrant development engagements. This is because they include transcendental perspectives, bridge ideals and practices that connect the contemporary to the hereafter, encompass transnational perspectives, and are attentive to the 'here' and 'there' spatially in migrants' lives. On a shelf in Aisha's 1 living room, there is a small, discreet collection box. If she happens to have spare change when she is passing the box, Aisha will drop a few coins into it. She does not keep track of how often or how much. It is something she just does in passing, usually on a daily basis – sometimes when reminded of all she has to be grateful for, at other times when she learns of the pain and suffering of those less fortunate than herself. The latter are often people in the village where her mother still lives and about whom she gets updates whenever she and her mother speak on the phone. She always uses the money in the box to help other people. Sometimes she donates it to a development organization or initiative collecting money at the mosque, at others she sends it to Pakistan for her mother to pass on to those in need of assistance, or to victims of natural disasters or conflicts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kaja Borchgrevink and +1Marta Bivand Erdal•  6  Development Studies, Migration, Development and Religion(s), IslamSegregation: Harvest of a Connecting World?Evoking the painful failure of overcoming the fallout of centuries of slavery in the United States and conjuring up the specter of state-enforced apartheid in South Africa, “segregation” nowadays appears to be almost ubiquitously... moreEvoking the painful failure of overcoming the fallout of centuries of slavery in the United States and conjuring up the specter of state-enforced apartheid in South Africa, “segregation” nowadays appears to be almost ubiquitously condemned, but at the same time seemingly impossible to eradicate. Looking at (primarily urban, spatial, ethnic) segregation from a global angle, this seminar will reveal that the phenomenon has indeed plagued a great many societies since 1500, albeit in varying degrees and changing forms. Starting from recent arguments by historians (esp. Nightingale 2012) that segregation was primarily the result of state action, this seminar looks beyond the classic cases of the U.S. and South Africa in order to ask to what extent we should understand segregation as a side effect of the history of increasing global connectedness. Moving from rarely studied examples, such as 17th-century Ayutthaya, to better-known cases of late 19th-century Atlantic immigration cities, such as Buenos Aires, the seminar thus seeks to tease out the reasons and consequences of urban ethnic unmixing through wide-ranging comparisons.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael Goebel•  28  History, Modern History, Sociology, GeographyTransitioning the Vietnamese Ullambana Festival to TaiwanDescribing three Vietnamese Buddhist groups in Taiwan.Save to LibraryDownloadby Polly Cheng•  4  Transnational migration, Transnational Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism, Buddhist RitualsSufrimiento social y migraciones de retorno: una propuesta conceptualEl artículo pone de relieve cómo el sufrimiento social, concebido como manifestación de la opresión social y la injusticia incorporada en el individuo, posee atributos que atraviesan las distintas etapas del retorno migratorio, etapas que... moreEl artículo pone de relieve cómo el sufrimiento social, concebido como manifestación de la opresión social y la injusticia incorporada en el individuo, posee atributos que atraviesan las distintas etapas del retorno migratorio, etapas que se encuentran marcadas por procesos transnacio-nales y multilocales.

Each has its own history, therefore, 'our history' is not made by us, but by previous generations. The rise of International migration and the crumbling of family structures, however, only make it harder for descendants to learn about their family history. Inhibited by language and geographical barriers as well as lost connections to the bearers of knowledge, many offspring of migrant families year for answers to questions such as 'Where do I come from?' or 'How did I get here?' Answering these requires re-establishing lost connections and meeting family one previously did not know. This paper illustrates how the juxtaposition of two generations of Chinese Australian migrants' narrative (a 'pioneer migrant' and an 'overseas born Chinese' are vital to piecing together a segment of family history.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher  Cheng•  60  Asian Studies, Self and Identity, Social Networks, Family studiesAlienation and Recognition.

Come si è giunti all'attuale definizione di tale categoria migratoria? Il presente articolo ripercorre la storia della sua evoluzione, analizzando processi e avvenimenti che hanno reso questa figura ciò che è oggi. Frutto di un cortocircuito del sistema politico westfaliano, lo sviluppo del suo profilo contemporaneo rappresenta per certi aspetti il "negativo" dell'idea occidentale di libera circolazione. Ripercorrere tali vicende, contribuisce a mettere in luce le debolezze alla base delle distinzioni fra categorie migratorie.How the term refugee was born? How did this migration category become what it is today? This article retraces the history of its evolution, analysing processes and events that contributed to shape this figure as we know it. The refugee's contemporary figure emerged from a breakdown in Westphalian international political system and then it developed to some extent in opposition to the western idea of freedom of circulation. The historical path of this type of migration highlights how weak are migrants categories' distinctions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gianluca Gerli•  20  European History, Transnational and World History, Mobility/Mobilities, Migration mobilitiesRegional migration report: South CaucasusUp to the lat e 1990s, discourse around mass emigration from Azerbaijan had to do, above all, with mass post-Soviet labour migration.

During the last two decades (1990-2009) 266,000 arrived in the country as permanent migrants and 707,500 departed from Azerbaijan according to official statistics. According to official statistics the balance of migration was negative for Azerbaijan (though never massively negative) almost every year. But in the last two years more people arrived in the country than left it. On the grounds of these figures the authorities announced that Azerbaijan has become attractive for immigrants. President Ilham Aliyev’s stated: “The number of foreigners intending to visit the Republic of Azerbaijan will increase while Azerbaijan is developing.

La serie forma parte de la grilla de contenidos del primer canal educativo y público diseñado por el Ministerio de Educación de la Nación Argentina. La propuesta documental representa una herramienta educativa y de comunicación innovadora desarrollada a partir de un trabajo interdisciplinar entre la comunicación, la animación, el audiovisual, y la sociología de las migraciones. La serie cuenta la vida cotidiana de niños y niñas migrantes que residen en la ciudad de Córdoba (Argentina), y retrata la diversidad y la hibridez cultural de la ciudad desde la mirada y vivencia de los niños. Busca representar los relatos de los niños migrantes, sin caer en los estereotipos, simplificaciones o visiones folckorizantes de las culturas de nuestra Latinoamérica y del resto del mundo. DE ALLÁ PARA ACÁ es una propuesta dinámica, atractiva y reflexiva que permite al público infantil de entre 8 y 12 años acercarse a los conceptos de diversidad, interculturalidad y migración desde la mirada de los protagonistas de la serie: desde niños para niños. La serie no está dirigida exclusivamente a niños que han experimentado un proceso migratorio, ya que plantea temas transversales vinculados a los desafíos propios de la infancia: la relación con los otros, la convivencia, los vínculos, la integración, la discriminación, etc.Palabras claves: niños migrantes, interculturalidad, identidad, material educativo, migración infantil.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patricia Jimena  Rivero•  44  Intercultural Communication, Sociology of Children and Childhood, Film Studies, DiversityInformal learning in a transnational setting: exploring learning spaces of people migrating between Estonia and FinlandAlenius, P.

Doctoral dissertation. Acta Universitatis Tamperensis 2034. Tampere: Tampere University Press. Download from http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/96964Abstract The aim of this dissertation was to explore the learning processes of migrants in transnational settings and the emerging transnational spaces of learning. The focus was specifically on the experiences of people migrating between Estonia and Finland (both transmigrants, shuttling to and fro between the countries, and the more settled immigrants). The research questions were: 1) What kinds of informal learning environments emerge in transnational settings, particularly concerning migrants between Estonia and Finland? 2) What are the characteristics of transnational learning processes from migrants' perspectives? 3) How are conceptions and practices shared in transnational learning environments? The research data (78 semi-structured and 20 life-course interviews) were gathered in Finland during the TRANS-NET project (Transnationalisation, Migration and Transformation: Multi-Level Analysis of Migrant Transnationalism, 2008-2011). The interview data were analysed qualitatively, following theory-guided content analysis in which theoretical concepts provided insights for the interpretation of the data collected. The theoretical framework related to socio-cultural, situated learning theories (for example, Lave and Wenger 1991; Wenger 1998) and research on migrant transnationalism. The situated learning approach has examined learning as a collective phenomenon, exemplified through shared participation in the social practices. Transnational migration studies have explored how migrants engage in transnational social fields, spaces, or circuits embedded in at least two societies across national borders. The framework developed by Faist (2000) and Pitkänen et al. (2012) was applied in this research to analyse the structure of transnational spaces. While there is a large body of research on transnational networks and border-crossing activities of migrants, there are only few studies examining migrants' learning experiences in transnational settings and diverse transnational learning environments. Three main, broad transnational learning environments were identified: transnational family space, transnational occupational space and transnational civic space. These border-crossing, socially constructed spaces connected people residing or having resided in at least two or more different societies. On the macro level, these spaces were shaped by international, regional, and national policies, administrative regulations as well as the socio-cultural and political development of societies. The meso level social formations, such as families, work communities, non-governmental organisations and transnational networks, provided arenas in which both migrants and non-migrants had the opportunity to engage in situated learning processes in their everyday lives in a transnational setting. On the micro level, individuals had diverse learning trajectories and experiences in transnational environments. The informants' key learning processes included identifying differences in conceptions and practices, comparison of different beliefs and behaviours, reflecting on one's own socio-cultural heritage, ongoing processes of identity construction, adoption of new ideas, ways of behaviour and mindsets as well as sharing conceptions and practices across national borders. Some of the informants had been acting as transnational brokers by mediating and interpreting information, skills and practices, for example, between families, work organisations and associations located in different countries. The informants had shared conceptions and practices related to societal and occupational issues, gender orders as well as cultural traditions with their non-migrant relatives, friends, colleagues and associative contacts although differences in the politico-historical development of societies created barriers between the individuals and groups impeding and complicating such exchanges.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pauliina Alenius•  3  Transnationalism, Transnational migration, Intercultural LearningGlobal Heartland Displaced Labor, Transnational Lives, and Local PlacemakingGlobal Heartland is the account of diverse, dispossessed, and displaced people brought together in a former sundown town in Illinois.

Recruited to work in the local meat-processing plant, African Americans, Mexicans, and West Africans recreate the town in unexpected ways. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in the US, Mexico, and Togo, Faranak Miraftab shows how this workforce is produced for the global labor market; how the displaced workers' transnational lives help them stay in these jobs; and how they negotiate their relationships with each other across the lines of ethnicity, race, language, and nationality as they make a new home. Beardstown is not an exception but an example of local-global connections that make for local development. Focusing on a locality in a non-metropolitan region, this work contributes to urban scholarship on globalization by offering a fresh perspective on politics and materialities of placemaking.Save to LibraryDownloadby Faranak Miraftab•  27  Multiculturalism, Globalization, Corporate Social Responsibility, TransnationalismRepresenting the Homeland: Lebanese Diaspora Notions of Home and Return in a Global ContextThis article examines the representation of home among members of the Lebanese diaspora in New York, Montreal and Paris.
