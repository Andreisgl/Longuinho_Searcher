As the end of the year approaches, and tonight is Christmas Eve, I wanted to let you know that I wrote a Christmas letter to Santa Claus, along the lines of asking for good-will, peace, abolition of developing and less developed countries’ external debt, the fall of the patriarchy and eradication of structural violence, once that has been taken care of, I’d like a floating diamond to adorn my neck and why not, throw in condoning all our debt, and… inflation, we should take care of that one too. Also, I don’t know if you are familiar with Strega Nonna’s pot of pasta… but, please situate those in strategic places. Thank you Santa, and please know that my students were very well behaved and should get their lists too…So, you, my dear listeners and beloved students, are included in my wishes and also gratitude. Thank you for clicking, thank you for listening, Happy Solstice,  Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year.Today, I will read a poem I learned when I was in Kindergarten. Of course, my cheese brain only remembers the first few lines, so I had to read it. Still, I read it with love. I hope you enjoy. I’ll be back next year, and as ever, I’m listening.Twas the Night before Christmas PoemTwas the night before Christmas, when all through the houseNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;The children were nestled all snug in their beds,While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;And mamma in her „kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter‟s nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.Away to the window, I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snowGave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,When what to my wondering eyes should appear,But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;“Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer And Vixen! On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donner And Blitzen!...
