Publications of the De Nobili Research Library, 37. Vienna: Sammlung De NobiliThe literary production of works on yoga is vast, and it increases constantly. This large output reflects on the one hand the quest of modern (or, according to one's own stand point, post-modern) globalized societies for supplements and alternatives to their own religious and/or secular traditions. The thriving yoga literature is a symptom for the growing acculturation of modern yoga into globalized societies, for which the existence of yoga studios at almost every second corner of the streets in cities of many parts of the world provides additional evidence.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAdaptive Reuse: Aspects of Creativity in South Asian Cultural HistoryFrom Theory to Poetry: The Reuse of Patañjali’s Yogaśāstra in Māgha’s Śiśupālavadha2017 • Philipp A MaasThe present Chapter discusses two cases of adaptive reuse of religio-philosophical ideas and text passages from the Pātañjalayogaśāstra (“The Authoritative Expo-sition of Yoga by Patañjali,” PYŚ) in a work of high-class poetry, i.e. in stanzas 4.55 and 14.62 of Māgha’s epic poem Śiśupālavadha (“The Slaying of Śiśupāla,” ŚPV). After a brief introduction to these two quite different literary works in sections 1 and 2, the Chapter outlines the history of research on the ŚPV and its relationship to Sāṅkhya and Yoga philosophy in section 3. The very fact the Māgha alluded to Sāṅkhya and Yoga conceptions in his poem is known in indological research for more than one hundred years, but the exact nature of these references was never investigated in detail. This topic is addressed in the first part of Section 4, which interprets stanzas 4.55 and 14.62, highlights the text passages and conceptions of classical Yoga that Māgha reused, analyses the specific contexts in which the reuse occurs, and suggests possible answers to the question of which authorial intentions actually may have led Māgha to reuse Patañjali’s authoritative work on Yoga. The concluding part of section 4 investigates the reception of Māgha’s reuse by the 10th century Kashmiri commentator Vallabhadeva. Section 5, the conclusion, highlights the main historical result of the paper, namely that the PYŚ was widely known as a unitary authoritative work of Yoga theory and practice in different parts of South Asia at least from the eight to the tenth century. It was this very appraisal of the work in (at least in in some) educated circles that suggested it to Māgha as a source of reuse in order to achieve two interrelated purposes: On the one hand his reuse contributed to strengthening and maintaining the authoritativeness of the śāstra, and on the other hand it charged the objects of Māgha’s poetical descriptions as well as his very poem with the philosophical and religious prestige of the śāstra.Download Free PDFView PDFEli Franco (ed.) in collaboration with Dagmar Eigner, Yogic Perception, Meditation, and Altered States of Consciousness.

Vienna: Vienna University Press by V&R unipressOn al-Bīrūnī’s Kitāb Pātanğal and the Pātañjalayogaśāstra2018 • Philipp A Maas, Noémie VerdonIn this chapter the thematic focus shifts from the description and analysis of yoga in individual religious and philosophical traditions of premodern South Asia to the cultural transfer of yoga from South Asia to the Arab intellectual world in the Middle Ages. After providing an introduction to the life and work of al-Bīrūnī, the famous Perso-Muslim polymath who lived at the turn of the first millennium CE and spent some years in north-western South Asia, it surveys previous scholarly attempts to identify the Sanskrit source of his Kitāb Pātanğal, an Arab rendering of a yoga work in the tradition of Patañjali. The two authors arrive at the novel hypothesis that al-Bīrūnī may have used the Pātañjalayogaśāstra (i. e., the Yogasuūtra together with the so-called Yogabhāṣya) as the main source of the Kitāb Pātanğal. This finding provides the basis for a new assessment of this work as the result of different literary transformations, some of which necessarily had to be highly creative in order to transfer the philosophical and religious content of a Sanskrit yoga work of the late fourth or early fifth century into the intellectual culture of medieval Islam. Taking into consideration these creative aspects of the Kitāb Pātanğal, Maas and Verdon demonstrate that the aspiration of the Perso-Muslim author was not merely to provide a translation faithful to the wording of its source text, but to make the spiritual dimension of yoga accessible to his Muslim readership.Download Free PDFView PDFYoga in TransformationSome Problematic Yoga Sutras and their Buddhist Background2018 • Dominik WujastykChapter 1 of: Baier, K., Maas, P.

Yet if we broaden the scope of inspection to a wider textual corpus, we can identify a richer and more complex discourse of classical yoga in soteriological contexts. This discourse is also employed in Buddhist Sarvāstivāda traditions and is semantically and metaphorically entangled across religious boundaries. By comparing passages from the Pātañjalayogaśāstra and the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, this article highlights the botanical image of the seed and its seedbed (the substratum) as a key metaphorical structure in the soteriology of the two texts.Download Free PDFView PDF"Aspectos lingüísticos, estilísticos y teoréticos del Yogasūtra. Análisis de la apropiación y resignificación patañjálica del género sútrico y del darśana del Yoga". En Revista Exlibris, FFyL, UBA, n° 4, pp. 424-439, 2015.Gabriel MartinoCon el presente proyecto nos proponemos examinar diferentes aspectos del Yogasūtra de Patañjali, texto considerado fundacional del darśana clásico del Yoga. Su composición en estilo sútrico, su contenido propio de una disciplina meditativa cuyo fin es la liberación del ciclo de las reencarnaciones y el carácter filosófico, argumentativo y polémico del texto hacen de él un ejemplar sumamente valioso para su análisis y para la comprensión de una expresión característica del pensamiento de la India clásica. La historia del texto y de su interpretación, asimismo, que han sido objeto de revisión en las últimas décadas, constituyen una interesante muestra del modo en que proceden los estudios indológicos contemporáneos, de su metodología y del alcance de sus conclusiones. Por estos motivos, y por la importancia que el yoga ha adquirido en las últimas décadas nos proponemos abordar en su lengua original, el sánscrito, uno de los textos fundamentales de esta tradición.Download Free PDFView PDFKarl Baier, Philipp A.

Vienna: Vienna University Press by V&R unipress“Sthirasukham Āsanam”: Posture and Performance in Classical Yoga and Beyond2018 • Philipp A MaasThis chapter is largely devoted to the Pātañjalayogaśāstra (PYŚ) and the history of its reception. More specifically, it investigates Patañjali’s treatment of yogic postures (āsana), starting with a contextualisation of the role of āsana-s within the yogic path to liberation. It then analyses the passage PYŚ 2.46–48 and demonstrates that the two sūtra-s 2.46 and 2.47 should be understood as a single sentence. This is followed by a discussion of the list of posture names in the PYŚ as well as of the possible nature of the postures themselves from a philological perspective. The critical edition of the text of PYŚ 2.46 provides the basis for a detailed comparison of various descriptions of posture performance in medieval commentaries on the PYŚ and in the authoritative Jaina yoga treatise by Hemacandra. This comparison reveals that designations of āsana-s and the descriptions of their performance may differ from source to source. However, all analysed sources agree in presenting āsana as a complex of psycho-physiological practices meant to enable the yogi to undertake long sessions of exercises, such as breath control, and of various kinds of meditation, rather than mere performances of bodily configurations as means in themselves.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Indian PhilosophySarvāstivāda Buddhist Theories of Temporality and the Pātañjala Yoga Theory of Transformation (pariṇāma)2020 • Philipp A MaasThis article discusses the peculiar Sāṅkhya-Yoga theory of transformation (pariṇāma) that the author of the Pātañjalayogaśāstra created by drawing upon Sarvāstivāda Buddhist theories of temporality. In developing his theory, Patañjali adaptively reused the wording in which the Sarvāstivāda theories were formulated, the specific objections against these theories, and their refutations to win the philosophical debate about temporality against Sarvāstivāda Buddhism. Patañjali’s approach towards the Sarvāstivāda Buddhist theories was possible, even though his system of Yoga is based on an ontology that differs considerably from that of Sarvāstivāda Buddhism because both systems share the philosophical view that time is not a separate ontological entity in itself. Time is a concept deduced from change in the empirical world. This agreement results from the common philosophical orientation of Sarvāstivāda Buddhism and Yoga, which takes the phenomenon of experience as the basis of philosophical enquiry into the structure of the world. The intention that guided Patañjali’s adaptive reuse was twofold. On the one hand, he aimed at winning the debate with Sarvāstivāda Buddhism about how the problem of temporality can be solved. He thus integrated four mutually exclusive theories on temporality into a single theory of transformation of properties (dharma) involving a second-level and a third-level theory on the transformation of the temporal characteristic mark (lakṣaṇa) and on the transformation of states (avasthā), respectively. On the other hand, Patañjali intended to achieve philosophical clarification regarding the question of how exactly properties relate to their underlying substrate in the process of transformation of the three constituents or forces (guṇa) sattva, rajas and tamas of matter (pradhāna) that account for all phenomena of the world except pure consciousness (puruṣa). Patañjali’s theory of transformation is thus of central importance for his Sāṅkhya ontology, according to which the world consists of 25 categories or constituents (tattva), i.e., of primal matter (prakṛti) and its transformations and pure consciousness.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
