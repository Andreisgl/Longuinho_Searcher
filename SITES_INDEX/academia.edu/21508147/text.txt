Ten expert opinion articles were used for discussion. For the 2009 WHO classification studies show: when determining severe dengue sensitivity ranges between 59-98% (88%/98%: prospective studies), specificity between 41-99% (99%: prospective study) - comparing the 1997 WHO classification: sensitivity 24.8-89.9% (24.8%/74%: prospective studies), specificity: 25%/100% (100%: prospective study). The application of the 2009 WHO classification is easy, however for (non-severe) dengue there may be a risk of monitoring increased case numbers. Warning signs validation studies are needed. For epidemiological/pathogenesis research use of the 2009 WHO classification, opinion papers show that ease of application, increased sensitivity (severe dengue) and international comparability are advantageous; 3 severe dengue criteria (severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, sev...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersParasites & VectorsEvaluation of host and viral factors associated with severe dengue based on the 2009 WHO classification2014 • Jorge Pozo-aguilarDownload Free PDFView PDFPathogens and global healthWHO Dengue Case Classification 2009 and its usefulness in practice: an expert consensus in the Americas2015 • Silvia Runge-RanzingerIntroduction: In 2009, the new World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case classification - dengue/severe dengue (D/SD) - was introduced, replacing the 1997 WHO dengue case classification: dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DF/DHF/DSS). Methods: A 2-day expert consensus meeting in La Habana/Cuba aimed to (1) share the experiences from Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) member states when applying D/SD, (2) present national and local data using D/SD, and (3) agree with the presented evidence on a list of recommendations for or against the use of D/SD for PAHO, and also globally. Results: Eight key questions were discussed, concluding: (1) D/SD is useful describing disease progression because it considers the dynamic nature of the disease, (2) D/SD helps defining dengue cases correctly for clinical studies, because it defines more precisely disease severity and allows evaluating dynamically the progression of cases, (3) D/SD describes correctly all clin...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Infectious DiseasesUtility of warning signs in guiding admission and predicting severe disease in adult dengue2013 • Ying HaoDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific ReportsSerum chymase levels correlate with severe dengue warning signs and clinical fluid accumulation in hospitalized pediatric patientsManouri SenanayakeDengue induces a spectrum of severity in humans from the milder dengue fever to severe disease, or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Chymase is a candidate biomarker that may aid dengue prognosis. This prospective study aimed to identify whether warning signs of severe dengue, including hypovolemia and fluid accumulation, were associated with elevated chymase. Serum chymase levels were quantified prospectively and longitudinally in hospitalized pediatric dengue patients in Sri Lanka. Warning signs were determined based on daily clinical assessments, laboratory tests and ultrasound findings. Chymase was significantly elevated during the acute phase of disease in DHF or Severe dengue, defined by either the 1997 or 2009 WHO diagnosis guidelines, and persisted longer in the most severe patients. Chymase levels were higher in patients with narrow pulse pressure and clinical warning signs such as severe leakage, fluid accumulation, pleural effusion, gall-bladder wall thickening and rapid ha...Download Free PDFView PDFMemórias do Instituto Oswaldo CruzEvaluation of the WHO classification of dengue disease severity during an epidemic in 2011 in the state of Ceara, Brazil2014 • Maria Paula MourãoDownload Free PDFView PDFReporting Progress on the Use of the Who 2009 Dengue Case Classification: A Review2015 • Silvia Runge-RanzingerThis review reports on the progress in the use of the WHO 2009 dengue case classification--dengue and severe dengue--following up on a previous review (Horstick et al, 2012). The previous review detailed Steps 1 - 5 in developing the 2009 WHO case classification. As a further step, a systematic review of published studies comparing the two classifications has been published with 12 studies and a further 10 expert opinion papers that recommend the use of the 2009 WHO dengue case classification for clinical management, epidemiology, and clinical research. Furthermore, a formal expert consensus was reached in La Habana, Cuba in 2013 with dengue experts from the Americas, sharing experiences that applied the 2009 WHO dengue case classification. The expert panel recommended to 1) update ICD10, 2) include the 2009 WHO case classification in country epidemiological reports globally, and 3) implement studies improving sensitivity/specificity of the dengue case definition.Download Free PDFView PDFRevista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina TropicalEvaluation of the World Health Organization 2009 classification of dengue severity in autopsied individuals, during the epidemics of 2011 and 2012 in Brazil2015 • Deborah Nunes de Melo BragaDownload Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Tropical Medicine and HygieneEvaluation of the 2009 WHO Dengue Case Classification in an Indonesian Pediatric Cohort2012 • Byron MartinaDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS Neglected Tropical DiseasesAssessment of the new World Health Organization's dengue classification for predicting severity of illness and level of healthcare requiredBalgees AjlanDownload Free PDFView PDFBMC Infectious DiseasesUsefulness and applicability of the revised dengue case classification by disease: multi-centre study in 18 countries2011 • Rivaldo Da CunhaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
