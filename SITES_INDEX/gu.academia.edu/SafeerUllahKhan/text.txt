Analyzing the acceptance of Islamic personal financing using extended TRA model: Evidence from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PakistanAbasyn Journal of Social Sciences,  2019Islamic personal financing (IPF) is an emerging phenomenon though less investigated area in Islam... more Islamic personal financing (IPF) is an emerging phenomenon though less investigated area in Islamic finance. IPF, which the Islamic banks offer according to the needs of their customers, has been overlooked especially using a comprehensive model(s) in most of the developing Islamic countries. This study closes the gap and examines the factors (i.e., attitude, government support, social influence, pricing, and awareness) that determine the acceptance of Islamic personal financing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan. Relying on the survey, the study used a sample of Islamic banks customers who were studying or doing a job in higher education institutions. The data were collected through a survey by distributing 600 questionnaires out of which 360 valid responses were used for further analysis. For analyzing the data, the Smart-PLS was used with structural equation modeling to get results of the hypothesized relationships.

Although different theoretical models for technology acceptance have been thoroughly explored, there is as yet sparse literature regarding its use in the context of healthcare in developing countries, especially with innovative models. To this end, this article uses an integrative model of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) extended by perceived credibility to better understand the acceptance of e-prescribing among physicians in a developing Asian country. In addition, the article uses perceived organizational support as a moderator between behavioral intentions and usage of technology. Using a survey method, the article collects data from 295 physicians in the capital city of Pakistan and analyzes the data through structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate relationships ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In developing Asian economies, online banking technology can strengthen financial systems by developing a solid connection between financial institutions and the local populace. Technology acceptance studies are under-researched in this region, especially with innovative models. Filling the gap, this paper uses a comprehensive model of extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), moderated by cultural variables. This will provide new insights into the determinants of technology acceptance by considering cultural effects on individual customers. The authors analyzed the model through structural equation modeling. The results validated performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, habit, perceived security, and price value as important antecedents of behavioral intentions.

Understanding the Drivers of Islamic Credit Card Selection Using TRA Model: Evidence from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PakistaniRASD Journal of EconomicsThis study investigates the drivers of Islamic Credit Card (ICC) adoption in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (... more This study investigates the drivers of Islamic Credit Card (ICC) adoption in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan by using the extended Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) model. Particularly, the study examines the impact of subjective norms, attitude, perceived financial cost, knowledge, and social influence on ICC selection. Using a convenient sampling technique, this study relied on self-administered questionnaires that were distributed among Islamic banks’ customers in Kohat and Bannu divisions. A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed, and 340 valid questionnaires were selected for the final analysis. The results from the regression analysis indicate that the factors i.e., subjective norm, customer attitudes, knowledge, and social influence have a positive and significant effect on the intentions to use the ICC, but perceived financial cost shows a negative effect on the intentions to use ICC. Among the predictors, the subjective norm was found a very influential driver to fore...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the trend has been transformed toward revolutionary means of marketing communications owing to widespread penetration of the technology. Therefore, electronic marketing is a challenging and growing trend to attain consumers&#39; attention using internet in the present era. The core aim of this chapter is to investigate the significance of e-marketing (eM) and outdoor media advertising on consumer buying behavior within the electronic products of Pakistan. It is empirically revealed that e-marketing and outdoor advertising are factors of exploratory consumer buying behavior. In comparison, electronic marketing may have a higher positive influence than outdoor media advertising in the current digital age to reach a particular market.

A better understanding of factors contributing to the adoption of electronic health care is needed, yet this remains an under-researched phenomenon. Grounded in the united theory of acceptance and use of technology, this article attempts to fill the gap by proposing and empirically testing the contribution of trust, privacy, task-technology fit, and personal innovativeness of patients’ intentions to adopt electronic health technology. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 353 patients in major hospitals in Islamabad, Pakistan. This study used Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling for the analysis.

This paper aims to follow the idea of social capital theory (SCT), which contends that social relationships are resources that lead toward the development of intellectual capital, important for innovative work behavior (IWB) of employees; the mediating role of knowledge sharing self-efficacy (KSSE) and moderating role of innovation climate (IC) are considered. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected the data from the foreign and local employees working in multinational companies in China. The quantitative analysis was performed using Smart-PLS 3.0. Findings The results indicated that employee high-ranking of SL is positively related to KSSE. Moreover, SL is significant to enhance IWB, whereas KSSE explained this relationship.

It hypothesises the influences of the Coronavirus outbreak as situational determinants, which include the place accessibility (e.g. the shutting of physical Hijab stores) and stores environment (e.g. well-being risks in physical shops, online shopping movement and extra marketing attempts from online Hijab stores through the outbreak). Design/methodology/approach Structured questionnaires were retrieved from 366 female Muslim shoppers, both wearing and not wearing Hijab. ADANCO 2.0.1 programming and PLS-SEM were applied in empirical investigation.

This study attempts to close the gap by considering the “big five” individual personality traits—neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness—to investigate individuals’ sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions in a developing Asian country, specifically Pakistan. Moreover, the study tests the moderating effects of servant leadership to know whether servant leadership impacts the relationship between personality traits and sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions. Relying on quantitative methods, data were collected from employees of SMEs in the capital territory of Pakistan. The valid responses from 450 individuals were analyzed using SPSS version 23 and PROCESS V3.2. Our results confirm that those five factors significantly impact sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions, and servant leadership moderates the relationships of intention with extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The study equips academicians, practitioners, and governments to devise strategies to promote sustainable entrepreneurship.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It investigates the impact of awareness-knowledge and perceived trust on EST adoption. Using a questionnaire-based survey, data were collected from 347 experienced investors, and were analyzed through structural equation modeling. The results indicate that awareness-knowledge, perceived trust, and risk dimensions (including time, financial, performance, social, privacy, and opportunity cost risks) have a significant impact on BI. Moreover, all the risk dimensions partially mediate the relationship between awareness-knowledge and BI, as well as between perceived trust and BI. The study enriches theory and practice by providing implications for promoting EST in developing countries, especially in Pakistan.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
