Its main goal is to provide the scientific community with a central resource for protein sequences and functional information. The UniProt consortium maintains the UniProt KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB) and several supplementary databases including the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). (1) UniProtKB is a compre-hensive protein sequence knowledgebase that consists of two sections: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, which contains manually annotated entries, and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, which contains computer-annotated entries. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries contain information curated by biologists and provide users with cross-links to about 100 external databases and with access to additional information or tools. (2) The UniRef databases (UniRef100, UniRef90, and UniRef50) define clusters of protein sequences that share 100, 90, or 50 % identity.

For a number of PROSITE profiles, the tool now makes use of ProRules—context-dependent annotation templates—to detect functional and structural intra-domain residues. The detection of those features enhances the power of function prediction based on profiles. Both user-defined sequences and sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase can be matched against custom patterns, or against PROSITE signatures. To improve response times, matches of sequences from UniProtKB against PROSITE signatures are now retrieved from a pre-computed match database. Several output modes are available including simple text views and a rich mode providing an interactive match and feature viewer with a graphical representation of results.Download Free PDFView PDFNucleic Acids ResearchThe SWISS-PROT protein knowledgebase and its supplement TrEMBL in 20032003 • Maria MartinDownload Free PDFView PDFPROTEOMICSAnnotation of post-translational modifications in the Swiss-Prot knowledge base2004 • Brigitte BoeckmannDownload Free PDFView PDFHuman  …The Swiss‐Prot variant page and the ModSNP database: A resource for sequence and structure information on human protein variants2004 • Amos BairochDownload Free PDFView PDFBriefings in BioinformaticsSwiss-Prot: Juggling between evolution and stability2004 • Brigitte BoeckmannDownload Free PDFView PDFNucleic Acids ResearchExPASy: SIB bioinformatics resource portal2012 • Konstantin ArnoldDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
