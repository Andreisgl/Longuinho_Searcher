Wow .. thanks for that.  Being a very visual guy this brings a lot into
focus.
Is this a MW item or something you created for your own (shared)
information.  
Thanks

Subject: [Wikitech-l] Very rough draft MediaWiki DB schema diagram
Hi All,
There's a very rough draft diagram of MediaWiki 1.10's DB schema at:
http://files.nickj.org/MediaWiki/mediawiki-db-schema-v1-cropped.png
Very high chance of errors / omissions / stuff-ups, so comments and
corrections and suggestions welcome.
Quick questions:
* Can the validate table be safely deleted?  (I'm assuming it's cruft
left over after schema updates)
* Can the ipblocks_old table be safely deleted?  (I'm assuming it's
cruft left over after schema updates)
* A one line description of the trackbacks table?  (e.g. "Stores
trackbacks from external sites which link to the wiki")
-- All the best,
Nick.
