Focusing on the case of Javanese, the largest ethnic group, this study examines the role of the HL as an ethnic marker and its interplay with factors such as ethnic self-identification, proficiency, and usage frequency. The data were collected via parental surveys of 183 primary school children in East Java. The findings indicate that the Javanese language is still highly valued as ethnic marker and that Javanese people view its maintenance as central to their identity construction. However, inconsistencies are identified between attitudes and practices, with use of Javanese as a home language decreasing, and children’s production showing extensive influence from Indonesian. Taken together, positive attitudes regarding the Javanese as identity marker and the apparent ethnolinguistic vitality of Javanese is not nece...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersGEMA Online® Journal of Language StudiesLanguage Shift among Javanese Youth and Their Perception of Local and National Identities2019 • Erna AndriyantiDownload Free PDFView PDFArka, I Wayan , N.

Tajolosa Palawan State University published in Asia-Pacific Linguistics, 2015 released under Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0) teestajolosa@gmail.com The aim of the study was to examine the ethnolinguistic vitality of three Batak communities in Palawan and predict whether language maintenance or shift will prevail, drawing on by Tajfel and Turner’s (1986) Social Identity Theory , Giles, Bourhis, and Taylor’s (1977) theory of ethnolinguistic vitality, Bourhis’ (1979) ethnolinguistic vitality model, and Allard and Landry’s (1987) macroscopic model of bilingualism. Batak, Kalakuasan and Mangapin demonstrated positive language attitude and very high ethnic identity, reported high Batak language ability which correlated with actual language proficiency, reported more domains of language use and exhibited medium to strong beliefs in ethnolinguistic vitality. Structural analysis of data from the objective language test revealed replacements of Batak lexicon by Tagbanua and Cuyonon counterparts. However, examination of sentence translation data for grammatical morphemes revealed a relatively intact set of Batak grammatical morphemes. Findings in the present study have established the following variables– (1) age, (2) actual language proficiency, (3) language attitude, (4) ethnic identity and interpersonal network of linguistic contacts as predictors of language contact, shows clearly that despite individuals’ own set of which shows clearly that despite individuals’ own set of language habits, it is the behavior of the majority that distinguishes a certain language group. Overall, the speakers in all three areas have generally demonstrated in varying degrees, additive bilingualism/multilingualism in that the learning of Tagalog, Tagbanua and Cuyonon did not entail the loss of the Batak language. While Tagalog is indisputably dominant in the domains of school, church, politics, media and public interactions, and while Tagbanua and Cuyonon have shown influence in Batak language, none of these three languages is embraced as a Batak identity marker, hence the Batak language continually occupies the domains of home, neighborhood and work in all three areas.

They should be used in the family and community so that children do not avoid or become unfamiliar with their vernaculars. This study explored the attitudes of Acehnese young families toward Acehnese language, and further investigating their efforts in maintaining and passing the local language to their children. Twelve Acehnese couples (young parents) residing in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, were interviewed to obtain data. They were chosen on purpose because their first languages had to meet the study's criteria: (a) Acehnese-speaking parents, (b) Acehnese-speaking fathers and Indonesian-speaking mothers, (c) Indonesian-speaking fathers and Acehnese-speaking mothers; (d) Indonesian-speaking parents, (e) Acehnese-speaking fathers and other ethnic language-speaking mothers; as well as (f) other ethnic language-speaking fathers and Acehnese-speaking mothers. The data were then transcribed and identified for the key points, patterns, or themes in accordance with the attitudes of Acehnese young parents toward Acehnese language. The findings show that the Acehnese language was highly valued for being the heritage language, connecting people within and outside of families, expressing emotions, and requiring promotion despite its low popularity. Although a majority of parents in this study saw the Acehnese language as important for expressing their Acehnese identity and were aware of its values, they failed to pass the language on to their children. Out of the twelve families, only one family succeeded in passing on and maintaining Acehnese to their children. Nevertheless, language maintenance in the home works if parental practical efforts are made by providing their children with linguistic resources, and most important of all, using the local language in interactions with them.Download Free PDFView PDFIndonesian JELT: Indonesian Journal of English Language TeachingWeighing on languages: Indonesian parents’ perspectives on bilingualismarapa efendiThe paper focuses on the micro-level language policy where parents are the primary ‘actors’ to socialize language(s) to their children in the family circle. This small-scale study aims to find out 1) parent’s language attitudes towards bilingualism; 2) how the attitudes contribute to the decision making on language policy in the family; 3) and what efforts or strategies for maintaining the heritage language (HL). Data were collected from questionnaires to 28 Indonesian parents (from diverse ethnic backgrounds). To gain deeper insights, interviews were also conducted to investigate individual perceptions, feelings, and experience over bilingualism. Based on the analysis, it is found that although most of the families are bilingual with 3-4 languages being spoken at home, there is a limited context where interaction is carried out in HLs. The majority of respondents reported that it is only used to close relatives. The maintenance of HL is symbolic rather than strategic; it is perceiv...Download Free PDFView PDFSosiowati, I Gusti Ayu Gde, Ni Ketut Widhiarcani Matradewi, and I Wayan Arka. 2022. Language vitality, identity, and tourism in multilingualism: A case study of Nusa Penida Balinese.I Wayan ArkaThis paper discusses multilingualism and language vitality in Nusa Penida Balinese, an understudied and conservative dialect of Bali Aga spoken on the island of Nusa Penida, Bali-Indonesia. Nusa Penida has undergone an unprecedented change in the past decade due to a surge in the tourism industry, resulting in a significant influx of outsiders to the small island. Tourism has transformed the local sociolinguistic and economic landscape. Employing a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this research investigates the sociolinguistics of contemporary Nusa Penida Balinese by exploring native speakers' attitude to their native language, and the linguistic practices that reflect language usage in a range of traditional and modern multilingual contexts. This research focuses on two Nusa Penida villages. Respondents across different age groups were selected, and data on their language use in domestic and public spaces was collected and analysed. Findings reveal crucial patterns regarding intergenerational transmission, identity, language loyalty and motivation in gaining multilingual fluency. Nusa Penida Balinese exhibits good vitality and is dominantly used in the critical domains necessary for language survival. It enjoys loyalty from its speakers, and symbolically indexes their Nusa Penida identity. The impact of Nusa Penida's recently booming tourism industry is observed in the linguistic landscape of local placenames. However, the overall configuration of diglossic multilingualism on the island remains largely unaffected with the Nusa Penida variety still occupying the lowest status relative to other varieties.Download Free PDFView PDFIndonesian Journal of EFL and LinguisticsInvestigating Ideological Factors in Family Language PolicyRani septi SapriatiA family has a role in supporting bilingual or multilingual children.
