SEISMIC PROPERTIES OF FLOOD BASALTS FROM HOLE 917A DOWNHOLE DATA, SOUTHEAST GREENLAND VOLCANIC MARGIN11998 • Sverre PlankeOcean Drilling Program Hole 917A penetrated 779 m of subaerially emplaced basalts and dacites near the landward edge of the seaward-dipping reflector sequences on the southeast Greenland volcanic margin. Wireline logs were recorded in a 430-m interval covering four very thin sediment units and 48 lava units with mean and maximum thickness of 8.9 m and 53 m, respec- tively. Seismic compressional-, shear-, and tube-wave velocities were obtained by slowness-time coherency inversion of sonic waveform data. The compressional-wave velocity log shows asymmetric cyclic variations, with velocities of 2.5 to 5.5 km/s in the brecciated and vesicular flow tops, and high velocities, 5 to 6 km/s, in the massive and fractured central and lower part o f the lavas. The variations in velocity are attributed to systematic changes in total porosity, pore geometry, and alteration. Th e shear-wave velocity log recorded in high-velocity ( Vs &gt; 1.5 km/s) intervals correlate well with the compressional-wave velocity log. High shear-wave amplitudes identified near numerous high-impedance boundaries are related to mode-conversion within the lava pile. Vp/Vs ratios of 1.8 to 2.0 are recorded throughout the sequence, with no systematic variations. The normalized tube-wave energy log is broadly inversely proportional to the velocity logs, with low energy values in fractured massive inter- vals and high energy values near unit boundaries and within the top part of the lavas. Comparison of conventional logs and the Formation MicroScanner image gives high confidence to the usefulness of conventional logs in terms of recording downhole textural and lithologic variations in flood basalt terrains. The average velocity in the lava pile is 4.17 km/s, corresponding to 4.05 km/s obtained from the interpretation of seismic reflection data, and is primarily a function of the average lava unit thi ck- ness.Download Free PDFView PDFSeismic properties of flood basalts from Hole 917A downhole data, southeast Greenland volcanic marginSverre PlankeDownload Free PDFView PDF43. Geochemical Well Logs in the Izu-Bonin Arc-Trench System, Sites 791,792, and 793 1Cristina BrogliaGeochemical well logs were obtained in sediments at Site 791 and in both sediments and basalts at Sites 792 and 793 of Leg 126. Corrections have been applied to the logs from the latter two sites to account for variations in hole size, drilling fluid interference, and drill-pipe attenuation. Oxide and calcium carbonate weight percentages have been calculated from the processed logs and are compared to the available core measurements. Log-derived CaCO 3 measurements correlate well with shipboard CaCO 3 core measurements from Hole 79IB. In Holes 792E and 793B the log-derived oxides, with the exception of SiO 2 , agree extremely well with the X-ray fluorescence measurements.Download Free PDFView PDFData Report: 42. Geochemical Results From Wireline Logs in the Celebes Sea, Sites 767 and 770 of Leg 1241Elizabeth PratsonGeochemical well logs were obtained at ODP Sites 767 and 770 in the Celebes Sea. The log data obtained at sea have been corrected for borehole size changes, the effects of drilling fluids, and logging-speed variations. The processed logs are then used to calculate the amounts of the three major radioactive elements (Th, U, and K) and the dry weight percentages of oxides every 0.1524 m throughout the logged intervals. Numerous oxide core measurements were made for Site 767 and for the basement section of Site 770. Core and log measurements of CaO, A12O3, FeO*, K2O, and TiO2 agree well. At both sites, however, the log-derived SiO2 is higher than that measured on cores. The discrepancy is due to the fact that MgO or Na2O could not be calculated from the logs, causing each of the elements measured by the geochemical tool to be slightly high, an effect that is most apparent in SiO2 because it makes up the greatest portion of the rock-forming elements.Download Free PDFView PDF13. Data Report: Geochemical Logging Results from the Ocean Seismographic Network OSN-1: Leg 136, Site 8431Cristina BrogliaGeochemical well logs were obtained through sediment and basaltic basement at Site 843 of Leg 136. Corrections have been applied to the logs to account for variations in borehole size, drilling-fluid composition, and drill-pipe attenuation. Concentrations of Th, U, and Gd, as well as oxide weight percentages have been calculated from the logs and a comparison was made with available X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core measurements. Log-core agreement, except for A12O3, is good throughout the igneous section. The A12O3 log-core comparison is a measurable difference possibly due both to a weak 252Cf source and to the freshest sample selection for the major element analyses by XRF.Download Free PDFView PDF39.
