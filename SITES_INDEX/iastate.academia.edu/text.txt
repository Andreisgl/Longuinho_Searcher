In this study, virtual prices for the rationed goods are used to calculate a new cost-of-living index (CLI). The results for Poland show that from 1987 to 1992 the CLI that ignores the rationing effects is biased upward from 3.6 to 6.99 percentage points per year. Compared to the welfare loss calculated by neglecting the rationing effects in the prereform period, the welfare loss that reflects the rationing is only 25 percent as large using external virtual prices, and only 15 percent as large using Hausman virtual prices.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The information is in the form of key parameters for consumer demand systems. The modern theory of consumer behavior is the basis for estimating systems of demand equations. These systems yield estimates of own and cross price elasticities. The Linear Almost Ideal Demand System (LAIDS) model is applied in estimating a system of demand equations for food commodities. A full demand matrix results with a coherent and consistent set of price and expenditure elasticity estimates. Using the estimated own and cross price and expenditure elasticities, food and agricultural policies during the transformation to the market economy can be analyzed. A framework for utilizing the estimated demand parameters in forecasting is also presented.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The combination of these policies distorts the quantity, price, and form of Japanese pork imports. An important issue relevant to the liberalization of the Japanese pork market is the accurate measurement of the price wedge between Japanese and world pork prices. The analysis indicates that the tariff equivalent of the price wedge over the 1986-88 period was 44%. If the tariff equivalent of the price wedge is reduced over a ten-year period, Japanese pork imports are projected to increase by over 39% initially and by over 215% compared to baseline projections by the year 2000. Producer welfare can be maintained by a deficiency payment scheme. A less costly alternative is an industry buffer scheme, which maintains the level of the pork industry for two years and then implements a declining deficiency payment scheme that limits the decrease in production levels to 5% ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Among the several reasons normally cited for adopting this type program is price and income stability. However, recent swings in commodity prices, net farm income and government program costs have stimulated widespread interest in farm program redesign and modification in 1985.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
