Computer-based interactive patient simulations can help students affect this transfer because simulations allow students to develop and practice problem solving and decision-making skills interactively within the context of patient problems. A program for authoring computer-based interactive simulations is described. Patient simulations can effectively integrate basic science relevance, preparation for clinical problem solving, teaching new clinical content and several other necessary elements into curriculum infrastructure. Case simulations also can contribute to evolving educational standards set out by accrediting bodies.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCASE STUDIES for Dentistry®: Development of a Tool to Author Interactive, Multimedia, Computer-Based Patient Simulations2000 • Pamela Arnold, Louis AbbeyComputer-based patient simulations have been used to enhance the dental curriculum since the 1980s. This article describes the development of CASE STUDIES for Dentistry ® (CSD), a patient case simulation building template, developed at Virginia Commonwealth University, with which authors who have no programming expertise can create realistic, effective, interactive multimedia patient simulations by entering their own information and imagesDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of Dental EducationWeb-based virtual patients in dentistry: factors influencing the use of cases in the Web-SP system2009 • Nabil ZaryWe studied the students’ acceptance and utilization of virtual patients (VPs) authored by faculty using the Web-SP system over two consecutive years. We also studied factors of importance for the utilization of VPs for self-assessment. Both year-groups studied found the Web-SP system easy to use and their overall opinion of Web-SP was positive (Median: 5, p25-p75: 4-5). They found the VPs engaging, realistic, fun to use, instructive and relevant to their course. Students used, on average, 9.68 VPs per course, which constitutes 43 percent of the available VPs. The number of VPs available seemed to be sufficient for the target course, even if some of the students preferred a higher number of VPs. Of the VPs encountered, 71% (CI: 68-75%) were VPs with feedback, and correspondingly 29% of the VPs chosen were without feedback. The difference in utilization between both types of VPs was significant, at p < 0.001. Thus, the students clearly favoured VPs with feedback compared to VPs without feedback. There were three modes of engagement in which the VP was utilized. Mode 1 was the preferred mode for VPs without feedback, while mode 3 was dominant for VPs with feedback.. Whether or not a VP was selected for review during a teacher led seminar or not, did not affect student behaviour, at least on the surface. Teacher led seminars may still be of importance to provide credibility to the VPs by integrating them into the curriculum.Download Free PDFView PDFBAMSImpact of the Virtual Patient Introduction on the Clinical Reasoning Process in Dental Education2012 • Nabil ZaryDownload Free PDFView PDFA Multimedia Patient Simulation for Teaching and Assessing Endodontic Diagnosis2000 • Elaine DempsTeaching and assessing diagnostic skills are difficult due to relatively small numbers of total clinical experiences and a shortage of clinical faculty. Patient simulations could help teach and assess diagnosis by displaying a well-defined diagnostic task, then providing informative feedback and opportunities for repetition and correction of errors.

This article describes the core skills required of the development team members for the six phases of successful educational software development. During analysis, the foundation of product development is laid including defining the audience and program goals, determining hardware and software constraints, identifying content resources, and developing management tools. The design phase creates the specifications that describe the user interface, the sequence of events, and the details of the content to be displayed. During development, the pieces of the educational program are assembled. Graphics and other media are created, video and audio scripts written and recorded, the program code created, and support documentation produced. Extensive testing by the development team (alpha testing) and with students (beta testing) is conducted.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Health Workforce in collaboration with the Department of Knowledge, Ethics and Research commissioned the Global eHealth Unit (GeHU) at Imperial College London to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to evaluate the effectiveness of eLearning for undergraduate health professional education. At a global level, it will assist in the implementation of the WHO’s global human resources for health strategy by providing the best evidence of how and where eLearning can best be used in country settings.

There are no reports in the literature describing students&#39; perceptions of mandatory laptop programs, which are now being implemented by at least 25 percent of North American dental schools. In schools that have implemented laptop programs, students are required either to enroll with their own laptops that meet specifications or to purchase a laptop from the school at matriculation. In some schools, students are also required to purchase curriculum support software that is bundled with the laptop. This study was conducted to determine students&#39; opinions at U.S. dental schools with mandatory laptop programs about these aspects of this information technology initiative: frequency of use, perceived necessity of use, note-typing during lectures, effectiveness of training...Download Free PDFView PDFDesigning and evaluating an interactive dental educational module to teach freshman dental studentsRafat AmerCertain Operative Dentistry skill sets, such as bonding procedures, do not require a refined psychomotor skill level as much as a mastery of the concepts, placement and timing requirements of the bonding procedure. Procedures such as these may lend themselves well to the interactive media style that today&#39;s students are so familiar with in a computer module &quot;gaming&quot; format.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
