The goal of this research is to understand how Learner-Centered Education (LCE) is promoted within a human-rights framework and implemented as an approach to emancipatory social change. The findings show significant discrepancies in the implementation of LCE. Differences emerged between educational interventions that influence the language-learning and assimilation-integration processes of adults with migrant backgrounds. Informed by these findings, this article builds a case for Emancipatory Learner-Centered Education (ELCE)-a pedagogical approach that goes beyond courseSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The presented research harnesses the biographical learning theory and adopts a Bakhtinian, dialogical way of presenting the data under three themes: wars and identity struggles, religious beliefs, migration and language learning in the host country. The findings revealed that adult migrants’ life experiences and transitions constitute a learning process, which enhances transformative learning of ‘being’, through a process of ‘perspective and identity struggles’. It is also found that the accumulated experiences and transitions as well as adult migrant learners’ previous educational capital are in constant relation to the way they experience language learning in the programme.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The exploration is illustrated by qualitative data from interviews with eight adult educators and sixteen adult learners/students, and adopts a case study approach within a phenomenological mode. In the study, LCE approaches are seen as being at one end of the educational practice continuum and comprise of a number of elements, namely: motivation, epistemology, techniques and relationships that are used as a conceptual framework to guide data analysis and interpretation. Findings reveal the partial and unintentional use of LCE approaches in the distance learning programmes explored, and make recommendations for the implementation of LCE in the teaching of adults in distance education universities.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The project complements previous research and attempts to extract from the findings ideas and practices that could contribute to the re-organization of distance courses that facilitate adult learning. It has as its main units of analysis 16 adult learners and 8 educators, and rests on a research framework that views certain programme elements as being vital in unveiling the processes of adult learning. It harnesses a phenomenological approach and qualitative research techniques. The study contributes to a better theoretical understanding of the processes of adult learning and the mediating role of the distance learning context, in comparison to other previously explored contexts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article attempts to inquire on this absence by offering a critical analysis of key policy texts and proposals as well as prominent programmes and initiatives that have shaped the recent transformations of adult education in Cyprus. On the one hand, it is important to reflect on the gaps, mishaps, and silences of Cypriot educational policies in relation to the challenges posed by migration in the era of globalised mobility. On the other, it is also critical to highlight the connections between adult education policies and the formulation of the state’s policy towards adults’ migration and its concrete initiatives towards fostering a politics of integration. The article offers a critique of the presence situation in Cyprus, arguing that it confines adult migrants to a position where they cannot play a significant role in co-shaping how adult learning is organised, structured and implemented in Cyprus.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At the same time, the paper aims at unveiling theobstacles hindering learners’ empowerment process and making suggestionsfor the improvement of the educational programme fosteringfurther empowerment of the learners. To achieve the objectives set bythe research, a hybrid methodological design was applied combininghermeneutic phenomenology and critical discourse analysis. Data collectionwas performed using three tools: semi-structured interviews, reflectivejournals and document analysis. The results led to the emergence ofa multilevel empowerment scheme of vulnerable adults in the programme.The empowerment mechanisms that emerged were as follows:(a) empowerment through participation as a self-value, (b) empowermentthrough the reconstruction of past experiences, (c) empowermentthrough the strengthening of their social capital and (d) empowermentthrough literacy skills. At the same time, the study shed light on anumber of factors that inhibit the process of learners’ empowerment,which unveil structural and operational weaknesses of the programme aswell as of the policies pursued by the State.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is based on findings from a survey conducted in 2013 that explored issues regarding educational institutions offering adult education and continuing vocational training, provision of adult education, participation of adult learners in educational activities, and the professional profile of adult educators. This article, by offering an orientation into the system of adult education and training in Cyprus, seeks to identify areas of improvement, key challenges for the future, and provide the basis for further systematic research in thearea. In doing this, it takes into account current international comparative research on typologies of adult education systems and their impact on provision and participation. The examination of the case of Cyprus highlights the interconnectedness of adult and continuing education with historical, cultural, and socio-political aspects and the influence of the public policy framework on provision and participation in adult education.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Kirkpatrick’s fourth facet on evaluation, “behavior evaluation,” is used as a foundation for the study. This concerns the extent to which participants applied the learning and altered their behavior. The research used a qualitative methodology within an interpretative paradigm and used meta-interviews as the core method for data gathering. 18 secondary teachers and 8 academics were questioned. The findings expose thought-provoking issues allied to the impact of the university imparted professional development programme; reinforce claims made in the prime study; and make a case about the practice of follow up research and meta-interviews in qualitative inquiries.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The article concludes by highlighting the limited use of the adult learning principles, while designing and implementing f2f meetings during the distance learning programmes explored. Recommendations for the design of f2f sessions in consideration of adult learning are made.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The exploration is illustrated by qualitative data from a case study of adult educators’ and adult learners’ insights and experiences of a teacher development course organised by a Greek university. Analysis focuses on Knowles’ (1990) andragogical notion of design, i.e. selecting the combination of learning units and learning formats that most effectively accomplish the objectives of a programme. Findings of the study are somehow optimistic in that they do indicate, however imperfectly, that adult learning principles might be further applied in designing learning activities for teacher development, and make some tentative recommendations for Greece and elsewhere.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The ultimate aim of the paper is to unveil and illuminate some of the adult distance teaching and learning processes at work in these courses. The research harnesses a case-study approach within a qualitative paradigm. It draws upon the experiences of 16 learners (open university students) and 8 educators (open university tutors) who embarked on an undergraduate programme in Greek Civilization and a postgraduate programme in Education Studies in the two case study universities. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with the above participants. For the analysis of the data a heuristic was used that brings together a set of key stages on adult programme development. These are: needs identification, planning, design, climate, and evaluation. The findings highlighted a number of issues/factors that relate to the above stages of programme development and proved as influencing adult distance teaching and learning processes in the contexts under exploration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet, although research argues that adults need digital skills, limited evidence has been directed to digital literacy teaching approaches to adults and the associated pedagogy. The study explores the extent to which core features of effective adult learning were addressed within the context of digital literacy courses offered by the State Institutes of Further Education (SIFE) in Cyprus. Semi-structured interviews conducted with two groups of Greek-Cypriot adults enrolled in these courses indicate that while certain aspects of adult learning, such as an optimal climate for learning were in place, other principles related to the consideration of learners’ needs and learners’ input in the development of learning contracts were in effect to a certain extent only. Since this can mainly be attributed to the nature of the courses which were designed top down and remained openly ECDL exam-oriented with pre-fixed content, repercussions are drawn with regards to alternative paths to adult digital literacy, organized on the basis of learners’ expectations, profiles and needs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To this end, the Bernsteinian concept of framing, involving instructional rules was used. Results of the analysis reveal that the CELL module is largely oriented towards definite arrangement of instructional rules, by introducing strong framing in the educational process, while the AER module establishes a generally weak framing. Moreover, the findings disclose tensions between the principles of distance and adult education, with the former implying explicit and rather ‘close’ direction of study, and the latter advocating flexibility in adult learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The study adopts a case study approach, employing qualitative data collection through semi-structured interviews with participants in four thematic units in two distance learning programmes:  Greek Civilization (undergraduate) and Education Studies (graduate) organized by the Open University of Cyprus and the Hellenic Open University.  The research draws on andragogy and illustrates the experiences and perceptions of sixteen adult learners and eight tutors with regards to: the design of the f2f meetings, the educational techniques and means used, the participation, and the perceived usefulness of such sessions. The article concludes by highlighting the limited use of the adult learning principles, while designing and implementing f2f meetings during the distance learning programmes explored. Recommendations for the design of f2f sessions in consideration of adult learning are made.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The exploration is illustrated by qualitative data from a case study of adult educators’ and adult learners’ insights and experiences of a teacher development course organised by a Greek university. Analysis focuses on Knowles’ (1990) andragogical notion of design, i.e. selecting the combination of learning units and learning formats that most effectively accomplish the objectives of a programme. Findings of the study are somehow optimistic in that they do indicate, however imperfectly, that adult learning principles might be further applied in designing learning activities for teacher development, and make some tentative recommendations for Greece and elsewhere.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The ultimate aim of the paper is to unveil and illuminate some of the adult distance teaching and learning processes at work in these courses. The research harnesses a case-study approach within a qualitative paradigm. It draws upon the experiences of 16 learners (open university students) and 8 educators (open university tutors) who embarked on an undergraduate programme in Greek Civilization and a postgraduate programme in Education Studies in the two case study universities. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with the above participants. For the analysis of the data a heuristic was used that brings together a set of key stages on adult programme development. These are: needs identification, planning, design, climate, and evaluation. The findings highlighted a number of issues/factors that relate to the above stages of programme development and proved as influencing adult distance teaching and learning processes in the contexts under exploration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet, although research argues that adults need digital skills, limited evidence has been directed to digital literacy teaching approaches to adults and the associated pedagogy. The study explores the extent to which core features of effective adult learning were addressed within the context of digital literacy courses offered by the State Institutes of Further Education (SIFE) in Cyprus. Semi-structured interviews conducted with two groups of Greek-Cypriot adults enrolled in these courses indicate that while certain aspects of adult learning, such as an optimal climate for learning were in place, other principles related to the consideration of learners’ needs and learners’ input in the development of learning contracts were in effect to a certain extent only. Since this can mainly be attributed to the nature of the courses which were designed top down and remained openly ECDL exam-oriented with pre-fixed content, repercussions are drawn with regards to alternative paths to adult digital literacy, organized on the basis of learners’ expectations, profiles and needs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Results of the analysis reveal that the CELL module is largely oriented towards definite arrangement of instructional rules, by introducing strong framing in the educational process, while the AER module establishes a generally weak framing. Moreover, the findings disclose tensions between the principles of distance and adult education, with the former implying explicit and rather ‘close’ direction of study, and the latter advocating flexibility in adult learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Challenging the  ‘European Area of Lifelong Learning’: a critical responseby George K.

The volume contains 25 chapters from 35 contributors from all around Europe. -Analyzes the implementation of the Memorandum for Lifelong Learning from a wide range across the European Union-Helps understanding and interpreting the different dimensions of lifelong learning-Brings forward new aspects of lifelong learning that are critically positioned towards European policy trendsThe book critically reflects on the context in which lifelong learning policies and practices are organized in Europe with contributions of researchers and policy makers in the field. Through a critical lens the book reinterprets the core content of the messages that are conveyed by the European Commission in the “Memorandum for Lifelong Learning”, the most important policy document in the area, which after a decade from its publication still remains the vehicle for all current developments in lifelong learning in Europe. With references to research findings, proposed actions, and applications to immediate practice that have an added value for Europeans –but which either do not appear to correspond directly to what is stipulated by the European Commission, or are completely ignored as part of the lifelong learning process– the book offers an analytic and systematic outlook of the main challenges in creating the ‘European Area of Lifelong Learning’. In times as decisive as the ones we are going through today (both in social and economic terms), a critical perspective of the practices and policies adopted by the EU Member States is essential. The book follows the same structure as the Memorandum in order to debate and critically approach in separate sections the core issues that Europe faces today in relation to the idea of making a ‘European area of Lifelong Learning’. ​ Contents:  Introduction, Maria Gravani & George K.

This comparative approach is crucial for exploring the complex global, regional, national and local dynamics that account for varying implementations (or non-implementations) of LCE in different settings, for appreciating the thin or wide differences in practices of implementation, and for assessing the successes, failures and needs for improvement of diverse LCE programmes. The book’s primary focus on migration as a social process, and migrants as active citizens is useful in unravelling the convergences and divergences of different national and urban settings where migrant adult learners live as citizens, or as non-citizens, and how this intersects with their experiences as learners.  This research is contextualised in the larger political context. What emerges from the parting reflection is a European scenario marked by ambivalent and contradictory relations with migrants, and an educational intervention that is located somewhere between the assimilationist-integrationist dialectic. The four cases presented generally respond to the learners’ needs on the ground while rarely problematising the ideological stance of the state in relation to the educational plight of migrants. The final chapter introduces and elaborates on a new concept, Emancipatory LCE, to help generate a deeper analysis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Particular attention is also drawn to the ways in which adult education policies and initial education and training opportunities for prospective adult educators affect the role of higher education institutions in terms of academic orientation and programme delivery.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Emerald PublishingThis chapter discusses findings from a multiple case study of language learning programmes offere... more This chapter discusses findings from a multiple case study of language learning programmes offered to adult migrant learners in Cyprus, Scotland, Malta and Estonia. First, using a cross-comparative policy analysis, the discussion synthesizes indicators of integration embedded in education policies and provisions for adult migrant learners. This analysis brings to light an overall inclusive approach: providers and programmes emerged as comparable in terms of type of programmes (formal, informal and nonformal; academic, vocational and interest-based); options available (academic, vocational and interest-based) and providers (state and civil society). However, policy analysis also illuminates restrictive indicators, such as traits of monocultural, generalizing policymaking that lacks consideration of sociodemographic differences between adult migrant learners. Secondly, the discussion validates the synthesized indicators by means of an analysis of qualitative data concerning the language programmes and related micro classroom-based practices, retrieved using qualitative research with adult migrant learners, their educators and related policy executives. Validated indicators include an inclusive approach to learners' entitlement to educational provision, as testified by educators' and policy executives' values and pedagogical approaches. Indeed, despite traits of monoculturalism and generalizing or homogenizing approaches identified at policy level, micro context data illuminated stakeholders' critical acknowledgement of the need of differentiated teaching and learning. Research-based recommendations include increased cooperation between state entities (e.g., inter-ministerial collaboration) and between state and civil societies, as well as professional development for adult educators that elicits their agency in proactively resisting and changing restrictive aspects of existent policies and practices.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The study reveals that the university distance learning programme furnishes adult educators with professional knowledge and skills in the field of adult education, and, therefore, informs their professional practice and strengthens their work position.

One of the main challenges for open and distance learning is to ensure a collective capacity support system that helps adult learners to overcome barriers that might arise due to the distance factor, the different ways of learning, the individual differences of the target group, their family and professional compulsions and so on. In doing the above, the chapter uses the example of the ‘Teaching adult education on-line’ course, recently designed and delivered by the Open University of Cyprus (OUC) for the International Masters on Adult Education for Social Change. It evolves around the following questions: in what ways is collective capacity being built in the above course conveyed via the OUC eClass eLearning Platform and how is this experienced/perceived by its participants (adult learners)? The pedagogic design of the course is influenced by the connectivist approach to online adult teaching and learning. It also builds upon a sociocultural approach to learning, which proposes that learning is essentially a distributed and mediated phenomenon located in the interactions between people, the artifacts they use and the activities they engage in. The chapter contributes to the discussion of an under researched area and makes a clear point about the importance and possibility to build collective capacity in distance education.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Gravani,  published in Springer, discusses the extent to which technology used at the Open University of Cyprus supports adult teaching and learning and promotes learnerautonomy. It uses the concept of learner-centred education, which shares common principles with adult learning theories and constructivists approaches tolearning and findings from a qualitative study to critically discuss the educational tools/eClass eLearning Platform and the degree to which it supports amore learner-centred approach to learning. The chapter has revealed that technology used at the OUC is not being informed to a great extent by the LCEparadigm, due to the centralized system, fixed curriculum, predefined aspects of the units, failure of the platform to grasp the authenticity of learning insocial settings and establish intimate relationships among participants. Nonetheless, it does indicate some positive aspects of LCE implementation thatrelate to opportunities it gives for interaction and collaboration. The study makes a clear point that technology is useful, but as a tool that is not culturaland political neutral, in order to support adult learners in distance education, needs to be used in a context that favours learners’ autonomy and respectstheir needs and experiences.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the basis of reported literature, in particular, deficiencies identified in Bell’s (1991) traditional “individual”, “group,” and “school development” approaches, the authors propose an alternative model for TPD delivered through VCs. In support of this “new” model, key issues underlying the VC paradigm in terms of the design and implementation of such environments are further discussed. In particular, the authors argue about the value and complications behind the adoption of this model and suggest principles supporting the design of such type of environments.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The main objective is to sketch out the education, training, role, competences,  competencies and challenges faced by a particular cohort of ICT educators participated in the study, in order to further understand how they conceptualize themselves and their role in this specific educational context, and the ways in which their educational praxis has been shaped as a result. The analysis presented draws upon the findings from interviews with eight adult educators teaching ICT in the context of four case study Second Chance Schools (SCS) in Greece, a project funded by the European Commission and the Greek government aimed at combating social exclusion of individual adults through education. The latter consist of a population with special characteristics and traits regarding the teaching and learning of ICT. The study reported, harnessing a qualitative case study approach within an interpretative paradigm, focuses on the ICT educators’ beliefs, experiences and perceptions. From the analysis, a number of themes have emerged that proved to have shaped the profile of the ICT educators in SCS; a) the lack of adequate education and effective preparation and training· b) educators’ undefined role along with their competences, skills, personal characteristics and abilities, and the impact of the above on their educational praxis· c) their previous experiences at typical secondary schools· and d) the need for lifelong training and professional development. The issues raised and the implications of the study might be helpful in future attempts to develop an integrated national framework for the specification of the education, training, competences and competencies of the ICT adult educator aimed at improving learning and teaching in SCS.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper reviews the literature on open and distance education and learning with regards to the interrelated terms distance, open, e-learning and blended learning and discusses the educational practices used in the context of open and flexible education in the global era. A case study approach - employing qualitative data collection through semi-structured interviews - is adopted to explore educational practices in the two universities: the OUC and the HOU. In more specific, the study illustrates the experiences of 16 adult learners and 8 tutors, participating in four thematic units in each of the two programmes offered by both universities: Greek Civilization (undergraduate) and Education Studies (graduate). The paper proceeds to a discussion of the face-to-face meetings used in the two open universities contexts. The findings indicate that the educational practices exercised in the two programmes reflect a blended approach. In this regard, issues of flexibility and adult learners’ involvement in the design of educational practices are further discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It aspires to shed light on the educational reality at SCSs regarding the teaching and learning of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) subject and to highlight the processes of adult learning. In doing so, the paper uses the experiences and perceptions of 24 adult learners and 8 educators as they embarked on the ICT course in four SCSs. The exploration reveals the importance placed by the participants on the ICT subject, although it was proved to be a ‘difficult’ one, due to learners’ age, fear of exposure and technology, the lack of appropriate organization and material infrastructure, and educators’ instructional habits. However, data indicate that educators in the sessions tried to adopt flexible practices adjusted to adult learners’ needs and interests, aligned with the adult learning principles and embodying elements of interdisciplinarity. Moreover, findings reveal that learning in the course of the ICT subject has been mainly ‘active’ rather than ‘passive’ for both adult learners and educators: they have both developed philosophical and pedagogical knowledge, while learners further developed technical and social skills on ICT, and have had serious difficulties in conceptualizing knowledge concerning ICT systems and components. The article ends with some implications concerning the design of adult digital literacy courses and future initiatives about ICT educators’ preparation and development.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Gravani, M. N. (2007). New' lifelong education policies in Greece. Moving forward or backward? The paper in an attempt to explore the extent to which ‘new’ lifelong education policies adopted ... more The paper in an attempt to explore the extent to which ‘new’ lifelong education policies adopted in the Greek context promote rather than hinder development and modernisation, uses the example of the Second Chance Schools (SCS) programme, run by the General Secretariat for Adult Education and the Institute for Continuing Adult Education of the Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs in Greece. The SCS is a flexible and innovative educational programme which provides individuals of 18 and over who have not completed the nine-year compulsory education with the possibility of obtaining a lower secondary education certificate and of well integrating into social, economic and professional life. In the above context, a ‘new’ policy is being currently adopted for the assessment of different parameters of the programme. This is critically discussed in the light of the feedback drawn from the programme’s participants, experienced researchers and administrators. The paper draws its theoretical framework from the work of Borg and Mayo (2005, p. 203) which brings out the neo-liberal tenets that underlie much of the thinking and rationale of the EU projects and policies and indicates how much of the old UNESCO discourse of lifelong education has been distorted to accommodate capitalism's contemporary needs. The analysis underlines the 'top down' approach adopted in designing and implementing the policy for the assessment of the SCS programme as well as the lack of flexibility and democratic spirit. It is hoped that findings will contribute towards the debate for a more flexible, adequate, and appropriate method to be adopted for the assessment of the SCS programme. Moreover, it aspires to pave the way so that a transparent and intellectual debate will flourish in the Greek context, thought the involvement of all interested parties, despite pressure to bend the lifelong education policies in Greece to serve the neo-liberal agenda.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Gravani, M. N. (2005). Academics and practitioners: partners in generating knowledge or citizens of two different worlds?

It seeks to unveil the dynamics of learning in the course of the sessions and endeavors to capture the ways in which different forms of knowledge interact.  In investigating these issues, the study gave voice to the experiences and perceptions of twenty-two teachers and twelve tutors, who were the key units of analysis, as they embarked on a course of a European Union funded in-service training programme in Greece. Since it focuses on how individuals understand, experience and interpret a phenomenon and seeks for a deeper interpretation and conceptualization of that phenomenon (van Manen, 1984), a grounded theory approach to the collection and analysis of data was adopted. This means that the study aimed at developing theory and conclusions that are discovered and verified provisionally through systematic data collection and rigorous analysis pertaining to the phenomenon under study. Therefore the data collection, theory and analysis stand in ‘reciprocal relationship to one another’ (Strauss & Corbin, 1990, p. 23). Analysis is described around three antithetical pairs: theory versus practice, propositional versus procedural and knowledge producers versus knowledge translators. These are seen as constituting a continuum between two poles aimed at helping data interpretation.  The theory/practice relation emerged several times throughout the study taking the form, first, of theoretical knowledge provided by academics as opposed to practical knowledge favoured by teachers and; second, of theory seen in terms of rules and premises which were presented in abstract and contrasted with practice. It was also presented in the disjuncture between the espoused theories of the academics and their theories-in-use (Argyris and Schön, 1974). The second theme, relates to the propositional knowledge that most of the academics exhibited compared to the procedural knowledge traditionally held by schoolteachers. The majority of the former, mainly those who had not been in schools, adopted a hierarchical model in the transmission of knowledge and presented themselves as being knowledge generators rather than partners in understanding practice.  The above echoes the traditional theory-into-practice model that has historically relied on university-based researchers to generate knowledge for teachers viewed primarily as “technicians who must somehow absorb the results of this research and introduce it” into schools (Lieberman, 1992, p. 11). However, as Bickel and Hattrup (1995, p. 47) identify, “No where is this more important than the need to revisit the traditional approach to knowledge production that promotes researchers as knowledge generators and teachers as translators”. Hence, if this is to take place, then emphasis must be placed on the facilitation of more Mode 2 forms of knowledge as described by Gibbons et al., (1994). Characteristic of such knowledge is that researchers and users lose their hierarchical identity in teams. They become partners in knowledge creation, validation, adoption, dissemination and diffusion. The research reported is, nevertheless, fundamentally optimistic in that it does indicate, however imperfectly, that rather than focusing on the gap, the discussion should be about space. Both academics and practitioners need to inhabit the space and work out mutually its boundaries, its structures and its purpose. Essentially, academics must leave the hill-tops and meet the teachers coming up upward. To build on Geer’s (Geer, as quoted in Hoyle, 1994) metaphor teachers should not be seen any more as spreading other people’s butter. Both academics and teachers should ‘make butter and spread it mutually’.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The overall aim of this paper is to present a new modelling approach to professional learning, necessary to identify the factors associated with it, and successfully deal with its complexity and multi-variability. A number of studies have suggested that two key-parameters, i.e., climate and planning, and their associated variables (e.g., mutual respect, collaboration, mutual trust, supportiveness, openness, etc) influence professional learning. In this paper, we applied quantitative analysis to a series of representative data of such variables (drawn from an in-service training programme in Greece) and through fuzzy logic-based modelling, an innovative modelling theory, we were able to quantify the substantive effects of these variables and parameters to professional learning. We found that the proposed fuzzy logic-based modelling reveals statistically significant different trends in professional learning  , however unidentifiable in the input data by human’s inspection. This was the result of the intrinsic property of the fuzzy logic-based model to linguistically describe human’s perspective and quantitatively track the ‘fine-grained’ processes of professional learning. In addition, our analysis highlights the advantages of the fuzzy logic approach to successfully capture the complex nature of professional learning, and introduces a framework for alternative engagement in the field.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The creation of a highly skilled and motivated teaching force is vital and an awareness of both the efficacy and effectiveness of the in-service training of teachers is crucial. The study reported in this paper draws upon the findings of a research that followed up a study exploring teachers’ and tutors’ experiences and perceptions of a ‘new’ in-service training programme in Greece. The research presented was conducted thirty-one months after the completion of the principal study. It aims at placing value on its participants by focusing on their views of the programme’s efficacy and on changes they have experienced in their work, as a result of participating in this. The study leans on Mishler’s (1986) and Clarke & Robertson’s (2001) assumption about the use of ‘meta-interviews’ as a research strategy for enhancing the credibility of the claims made from analyses of interview data. It was carried out with six secondary teachers (philologists) and four university tutors. Findings were collected through semi-structured interviews and analysis was guided by Spradley’s (1979) ethnographic semantics and by Van Manen’s (1984) thematic device for analyzing phenomenological description. The findings bring to light the value of meta-interviewing in qualitative studies and promise to yield important cues for teacher education and teaching professions that will be useful to anyone engaged in examining in-service training.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It aspires to present an illuminate view of the ‘fine-grained’ processes that are at work during the organization and the delivery of the courses and tries to capture the ways in which different forms of learning and knowledge interact.  In investigating these issues, the study gave voice to the experiences and perceptions of twenty two teachers and twelve tutors, who were the key units of analysis, as they embarked on a course of a European Union funded in-service training programme in Greece. The study used a research framework that viewed certain programme elements as being vital in unveiling the processes of professional learning. It harnessed a qualitative methodology in order to answer four key questions: to what extent has the professional learning of teachers and tutors been influenced by the ‘conceptual inputs’ they bring to the courses? In what ways does the social context of the programme impact on professional learning? How do the participants experience the in-service training courses and what feelings are triggered? How does the educational context within which the courses operate impinge on professional learning?  The findings indicate that the processes by which teachers and tutors grow professionally in the course of the in-service training programme is complex rather than linear, a step-by-step event. It involves and is affected by different factors and conditions, which interrelate and can either support or hinder learning. Therefore, when looking to restructure professional learning processes and programmes in Greece, and elsewhere, these should be taken into account. In particular, as both Hoban (2002) and Knight (2002) outline, what is needed in professional learning is a shift in emphasis away from individuals and courses to systemic, complex understanding of the ways in which learning is created and shared in communities of practice. Finally, building on Wenger (1998), the findings draw attention to the processes of professional learning, in particular to combine an understanding of knowledge ‘for’, knowledge ‘in’, and knowledge ‘of’ practice.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Analysis focuses on one aspect of Knowles’ andragogical model for programme development, used as a foundation for the study: the construction of activities. The remaining aspects of this model have been explored in previous papers. Findings make some tentative recommendations with regards to the design of effective professional development programmes for teachers in the lights of adult learning in Greece and elsewhere.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This project explores the use of cultural heritage in Europe for fostering academic teaching and social responsibility in higher education. The project is funded through the Erasmus+ program of the European Commission (ref. no. KA203-051104). The data for the project results come from a survey and interviews carried out among selected institutions, organizations, local leaders managing or using cultural heritage, and universities represented in the project (University of Lower Silesia, University of Gothenburg, University of Leiden, University of Malaga, Open University of Cyprus). Study visits organized in the partner countries in the form of training sessions for project participants were also an important source of data. The booklet of recommendations: Together for cultural heritage is the third output of the EU_CUL project.

The project assumes that the presence and influence of universities on the closest social environment should be strengthened. Cultural heritage is diverse, but in every dimension (European, regional, local) it can perform functions that integrate communities and include underrepresented groups in the mainstream of social life. Target groups in the project are academic staff, leaders of social enterprises ( non-governmental organizations), educators of cultural institutions, employers, managers and decision-makers managing the cultural heritage of the specific region. Teachers, students and citizens of local communities are intended indirect beneficiary of the project.The consortium consists of five universities: University of Lower Silesian (Poland, leader), University of Gothenburg (Sweden), University of Malaga (Spain), University of Ljubljana (Slovenia), the Open University of Cyprus, and University of Leiden (the Netherlands).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The topics discussed here vary from the initial education and training of adult educators in higher education environments, to the role of universities as validating agencies of existing psycho-pedagogical competences for in-service adult educators. Particular attention is also drawn to the ways in which adult education policies and initial education and training opportunities for prospective adult educators affect the role of higher education institutions in terms of academic orientation and programme delivery.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
