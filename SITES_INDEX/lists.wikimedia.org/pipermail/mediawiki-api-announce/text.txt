[Mediawiki-api-announce] API BREAKING CHANGE: Default continuation mode for action=query will change at the end of this month

As has been announced several times (most recently at
https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-April/081559.html),
the default continuation mode for action=query requests to api.php will be
changing to be easier for new coders to use correctly.
*The date is now set:* we intend to merge the change to ride the deployment
train at the end of June. That should be 1.26wmf12, to be deployed to test
wikis on June 30, non-Wikipedias on July 1, and Wikipedias on July 2.
If your bot or script is receiving the warning about this upcoming change
(as seen here
<https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=allpages>, for
example), it's time to fix your code!
   - The simple solution is to simply include the "rawcontinue" parameter
   with your request to continue receiving the raw continuation data (
   example
  
<https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=allpages&rawcontinue=1>).
   No other code changes should be necessary.
   - Or you could update your code to use the simplified continuation
   documented at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Query#Continuing_queries
   (example
  
<https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=allpages&continue=>),
   which is much easier for clients to implement correctly.
Either of the above solutions may be tested immediately, you'll know it
works because you stop seeing the warning.
I've compiled a list of bots that have hit the deprecation warning more
than 10000 times over the course of the week May 23–29. If you are
responsible for any of these bots, please fix them. If you know who is,
please make sure they've seen this notification. Thanks.
