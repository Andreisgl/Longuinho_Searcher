Since the emergence of time-based media such as film, video and digital technology, artists have used them to experiment with their potential. The resulting artworks, with their basis in rapidly developing technologies that cross over into other domains such as broadcasting and social media, have challenged the traditional infrastructures for the collection, preservation and exhibition of art. Addressing these challenges, the authors provide a historical and theoretical survey of the field, and introduce students to the challenges and difficulties of preserving and exhibiting media art through a series of first-hand case studies. Situated at the threshold between archival practices and film and media theory, it also makes a strong contribution to the growing literature on archive theory and archival practices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Mediated Listening Paths : Breaking the Auditory BubbleDrawing on interdisciplinary literature on urban walking, mobile media studies and sound studies,... more Drawing on interdisciplinary literature on urban walking, mobile media studies and sound studies, this paper explores how everyday walking is redefined by portable audio technologies. Above all, it considers how artists have reshaped mediated listening on the move since the 1980s, when the first Walkmans were launched on the market. I will discuss different artistic projects and suggest that many of these works infiltrate the dynamics between the walker and urban space by acting on the interference and hybridization between contextual and mediated experience, therefore breaking the “auditory bubble” (Bull 2007) created by headphone listening on the move. In particular, I propose three possible “tactics” – “revelation,” “overwriting” and “interaction” – as permeable and overlapping ways to establish alternative behaviour, spaces and times that reinforce the potentialities associated with walking by creating micropractices of aesthetic inhabitation of ordinary spaces.
