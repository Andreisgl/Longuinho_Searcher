Design/methodology/approach – A survey based on a random sample of 514 male and female police officers was conducted, and multivariate regression was employed to assess the effects of demands and resources on work stress and work engagement. Findings – Family–work conflicts, organizational and operational factors affected work stress and work engagement among police officers. Constructive coping was found to be positively related to work stress and negatively associated with work engagement. Research limitations/implications – Survey data collected from a single Chinese city may not be generalized to officers in other parts of China or Chinese societies with different social and political contexts. Originality/value – The present study filled the knowledge gap about factors influencing police stress and engagement. This study provides insights into how to establish relevant contextual measures to reduce police work stress. This study represents one of the first attempts to use a random sample of police officers for the investigation of police stress in Hong Kong.

Participants were 387 men, ages 20 to 33 yr. ( M = 24.1, SD = 2.4), in their last month of academy training before becoming police officers. Partially in support of predictions, work engagement was associated with Stressor control perceived, but not Stress intensity experienced over a self-selected stressor. Although the three dimensions of work engagement were explained by Stressor control and coping, Absorption was the dimension better explained by these variables. Police recruits reporting higher Absorption, Vigour, and Dedication reported using more Active coping and less Behavioural disengagement. Results showed that stress appraisal and coping are important variables influencing work engagement among police recruits.

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two randomly selected police districts in Kuala Lumpur from 2009 to 2011. A total of 579 police officers from 11 police stations and two headquarters participated in this study. The 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress questionnaire was used. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine the effect of socio-demographic and work factors on stress. Results: The overall prevalence of stress was 38.8% (95% CI 34.2, 43.6) with 5.9% (3.9, 8.8), 14.9% (11.6, 18.8) and 18.0% (14.5, 22.2) for severe, moderate and mild stress, respectively. Inspectors were more likely to suffer from severe stress (aOR 10.68, 95% CI 3.51, 32.53) compared to junior officers. Those who complained that their salaries were not commensurate with their jobs were more likely to suffer from moderate levels of stress (aOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.43, 5.22) compared to those who were happy with their salaries. Conclusions: This study strengthens findings that police job is stressful. Special attention needs to be paid to Inspector-level ranks and the remuneration structure of police officers to address this issue.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Police Science and ManagementThe Relationship between Stressors and Police Job Involvement2019 • Hanif QureshiPolice organizations are tasked with a wide variety of duties, and officers often encounter stressful situations. Past studies have indicated that job stressors are negatively related to job involvement, which is, in turn, positively related to several beneficial outcomes. The present study empirically tested the job demands model using data obtained from a police agency in India. Survey data was collected from 827 police officers in the Indian state of Haryana. Analysis was carried out to determine the impact of job stressors (role overload, role underload, repetitiveness, role ambiguity, fear of victimization, and role conflict) on job involvement. Findings indicate that all stressors except fear of victimization had a negative effect on job involvement. The implications of the findings, for organizations in general and police in particular, include the need to reduce workplace stressors and improve the work environmentDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Financial ResearchFactors Influencing Job Stress Among Malaysian Traffic Police Officers2020 • MUHAMAD KHALIL OMARTraffic police officers face many challenges in their line of duty to the protect the country and its citizens.
