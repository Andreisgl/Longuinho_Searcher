To find out, we used nonlinguistic psychophysical tasks to compare mental representations of musical pitch in native speakers of Dutch and Farsi. Dutch speakers describe pitches as high (hoog) or low (laag), whereas Farsi speakers describe pitches as thin (nazok) or thick (koloft). Differences in language were reflected in differences in performance on two pitchreproduction tasks, even though the tasks used simple, nonlinguistic stimuli and responses. To test whether experience using language influences mental representations of pitch, we trained native Dutch speakers to describe pitch in terms of thickness, as Farsi speakers do. After the training, Dutch speakers' performance on a nonlinguistic psychophysical task resembled the performance of native Farsi speakers.

In English, for instance, pitches can be "high" or "low" (i.e., height-pitch association), whereas in other languages, pitches are described as "thin" or "thick" (i.e., thickness-pitch association). According to results from psychophysical studies, metaphors in language can shape people's nonlinguistic space-pitch representations. But does language establish mappings between space and pitch in the first place, or does it only modify preexisting associations? To find out, we tested 4-month-old Dutch infants' sensitivity to height-pitch and thickness-pitch mappings using a preferential-looking paradigm. The infants looked significantly longer at cross-modally congruent stimuli for both space-pitch mappings, which indicates that infants are sensitive to these associations before language acquisition. The early presence of space-pitch mappings means that these associations do not originate from language. Instead, language builds on preexisting mappings, changing them gradually via competitive associative learning. Space-pitch mappings that are language-specific in adults develop from mappings that may be universal in infants.Download Free PDFView PDFThe thickness of musical pitch: Psychophysical evidence for the Whorfian hypothesisAsifa  MajidDo the languages that people speak affect the way they think about musical pitch? Here we compared pitch representations in native speakers of Dutch and Farsi. Dutch speakers describe pitches as „high‟ (hoog) and „low‟ (laag), but Farsi speakers describe high-frequency pitches as „thin‟ (naazok) and low-frequency pitches as „thick‟ (koloft). Differences in language were reflected in differences in performance on two psychophysical pitch reproduction tasks. This was true even though the tasks used entirely nonlinguistic stimuli and responses. To test whether experience using language changes pitch representations, we trained native Dutch speakers to use Farsi-like metaphors, describing pitch relationships in terms of thickness. After training, Dutch speakers‟ performance on a nonlinguistic psychophysical task resembled native Farsi speakers‟. People who use different space-pitch metaphors in language also think about pitch differently. Beyond correlation, language plays a causal role in shaping mental representations of musical pitch.Download Free PDFView PDFSpatial language and abstract conceptsRoberto  BottiniDownload Free PDFView PDFThe sound of thickness: Prelinguistic infants' associations of space and pitchAsifa  MajidPeople often talk about musical pitch in terms of spatial metaphors.

Rather, language may build upon pre-existing mappings and change them gradually via some form of competitive associative learning.Download Free PDFView PDFSpatial metaphor in language can promote the development of cross-modal mappings in childrenAsifa  MajidPitch is often described metaphorically: for example, Farsi and Turkish speakers use a ‘thickness’ metaphor (low sounds are ‘thick’ and high sounds are ‘thin’), while German and English speakers use a height metaphor (‘low’, ‘high’). This study examines how child and adult speakers of Farsi, Turkish, and German map pitch and thickness using a cross-modal association task. All groups, except for German children, performed significantly better than chance. German-speaking adults’ success suggests the pitch-to-thickness association can be learned by experience. But the fact that German children were at chance indicates that this learning takes time. Intriguingly, Farsi and Turkish children's performance suggests that learning cross-modal associations can be boosted through experience with consistent metaphorical mappings in the input language.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Colour of Pitch: A pilot experiment in linguistic relativityJ.A. BrownThere is an ERRATUM on p. 14: a non-significant p-value of .091 is erroneously reported as significant. Also, the wrong statistical test was used. A 2x3 interaction effect between native language group and direction of association on each of the three pairs should have been tested. (This was pointed out to me by Susanne Brouwer, to whom I give my sincere thanks for this.) If you spot any other ERRATA, please let me know! Updated, improved version (with some added paragraphs and references) of a term paper I originally wrote in June 2019 for the Linguistic Universals and Diversity course, taught by Drs. Lila San Roque and Saskia van Putten. Different languages have different conceptual metaphors to describe pitch. These metaphors influence our mental representations of pitch, even at a nonlinguistic level (Shayan et al., 2011; Dolscheid et al., 2013). Thus there appears to be linguistic relativity in the domain of pitch. The present study investigates whether linguistic relativity also influences colour–pitch associations. A pilot experiment was carried out to test two hypotheses: 1) whether reliable colour–pitch associations are made; 2) whether these associations differ between speakers of native languages that use different metaphors for pitch. The experiment included two tones (high and low), three pairs of colours that differed either only in hue or only in brightness, and speakers of native languages that fell into one of two groups: languages that use ‘high’ and ‘low’ as pitch terms and those that use ‘thin’ and ‘thick’. It was found that reliable associations are made between hue and pitch, as well as brightness and pitch, and that these associations were the same for both language groups. These findings are discussed in the context of the origin of metaphorical mappings: from “cross-modal correspondences” (Walker et al., 2010, cited in Dolscheid et al., 2013, p. 619), the so-called ‘physical-properties view’; or from experiential regularities (Dolscheid et al., 2013, p. 621), the ‘skeptical-metonymical view’.Download Free PDFView PDFLinguistic Relativity and Perceptual Origins of Colour-Pitch Mappings: A proposed experimentJ.A. BrownUpdated, improved to reflect the final results of the pilot experiment, and corrected version of a term paper I originally wrote for the Psycholinguistics course taught by Monique Flecken, Ph.D. Languages differ in the metaphorical terms they use to describe pitch (Shayan et al. 2011, Dolscheid et al. 2013). The origin of these differences is not known; the metaphorical mappings for pitch could originate either in experiential correspondences or in what has been called “cross-modal correspondences” (Walker et al., 2010, cited in Dolscheid et al., 2013, p. 619). To investigate this, a pilot experiment is being carried out that tests associations between pitch and colour in speakers of languages with different such mappings. The present paper discusses the preliminary results of the pilot experiment and addresses some of the methodological problems that could confound its results by describing a new, more elaborate experimental setup; implications of the possible outcomes are reviewed. If it is indeed the case that the perceptual properties, reflective of the physical properties, of one domain are mapped onto the other, we would expect no linguistic relativity. If, on the other hand, linguistic relativity is found, a different explanation is in order.Download Free PDFView PDFEitan and & R. Timmers.

However, it is unknown whether impaired auditory processing is associated with impaired pitch–space mapping. Experiment 1 examined spatial representation of pitch in individuals with congenital amusia using a stimulus–response compatibility (SRC) task. For amusic and non-amusic participants, pitch classification was faster and more accurate when correct responses involved a physical action that was spatially congruent with the pitch height of the stimulus than when it was incongruent. However, this spatial representation of pitch was not as stable in amusic individuals, revealed by slower response times when compared with control individuals. One explanation is that the SRC effect in amusics reflects a linguistic association, requiring additional time to link pitch height and spatial location. To test this possibility, Experiment 2 employed a colour-classification task. Participants judged colour while ignoring a concurrent pitch by pressing one of two response keys positioned vertically to be congruent or incongruent with the pitch. The association between pitch and space was found in both groups, with comparable response times in the two groups, suggesting that amusic individuals are only slower to respond to tasks involving explicit judgments of pitch.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
