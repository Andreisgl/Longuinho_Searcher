Comparative biomusicology integrates different comparative approaches, biological frameworks as well as levels of analysis in cognitive science, and puts forward principled explanations, regarding cognitive systems as different instances of the same principles, as its central research strategy. The main goal is to provide a preliminary answer to this question in form of hypotheses about neurocognitive mechanisms, i.e., cognitive and neural processes, underlying a core function of syntactic computation in language and music, i.e., mapping hierarchical structure and temporal sequence. In particular, the relationship between language and music is discussed on the basis of a top-down approach taking syntax as combinatorial principles and a bottom-up approach taking neural structures and operations as implementational principles. On the basis of the top-down approach, the thesis identifies computational problems of musical syntax, cognitive processes and neural correlates of music syntactic processing, and the relationship to language syntax and syntactic processing. The neural correlates of music syntactic processing are investigated by ALE meta-analyses. The bottom-up approach then studies the relationship between language and music on the basis of neural processes implemented in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. The main result of the current thesis suggests that the relationship between language and music syntactic processing can be explained in terms of the same neurocognitive mechanisms with different expressions on the motor-to-cognitive gradient. The current thesis, especially its bottom-up approach, opens up a possible way going toward comparative cognitive biology, i.e., a comparative approach to cognitive systems with a greater emphasis on the biology.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSyntax in language and music: what is the right level of comparison?Rie  AsanoIt is often claimed that music and language share a process of hierarchical structure building, a mental “syntax.” Although several lines of research point to commonalities, and possibly a shared syntactic component, differences between “language syntax” and “music syntax” can also be found at several levels: conveyed meaning, and the atoms of combination, for example. To bring music and language closer to one another, some researchers have suggested a comparison between music and phonology (“phonological syntax”), but here too, one quickly arrives at a situation of intriguing similarities and obvious differences. In this paper, we suggest that a fruitful comparison between the two domains could benefit from taking the grammar of action into account. In particular, we suggest that what is called “syntax” can be investigated in terms of goal of action, action planning, motor control, and sensory-motor integration. At this level of comparison, we suggest that some of the differences between language and music could be explained in terms of different goals reflected in the hierarchical structures of action planning: the hierarchical structures of music arise to achieve goals with a strong relation to the affective-gestural system encoding tension-relaxation patterns as well as sociointentional system, whereas hierarchical structures in language are embedded in a conceptual system that gives rise to compositional meaning. Similarities between music and language are most clear in the way several hierarchical plans for executing action are processed in time and sequentially integrated to achieve various goals.Download Free PDFView PDFEdited volume, based on a selection of talks from the event: http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199553426.doLanguage and music as cognitive systemsPatrick RebuschatIn recent years, the fields of linguistics, musicology, experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and evolutionary anthropology have witnessed an increasing interest in the comparative study of music and language as cognitive systems. This conference aims to bring together major contributors from these areas of research in order to assess the progress made, and future directions to take, in this truly interdisciplinary enterprise, and to provide researchers and graduate students from diverse backgrounds with a unique forum for discussion. The conference is structured around four core areas in which the collaboration between music and language has proven to be particularly fruitful: (1) Structural comparisons between language and music (2) Evolution of language and music (3) Learning and processing of language and music (4) Neuroscience of language and music The format of the event is designed to encourage discussion of theoretical models, empirical results, and methodological approaches to the investigation of musical and linguistic cognition. For this purpose, we have invited outstanding contributors from different research areas to serve as keynote speakers and panel discussants. We were pleased by the unexpectedly large number of abstract submissions. What was originally planned as a one-day event has developed into a three-day international conference with six keynote speakers, thirteen panellists and over 80 paper/poster presentations. We would like to thank the members of our Scientific Committee, who diligently evaluated the submitted abstracts. We would also like to express our gratitude to the panel moderators and session chairs for their contribution. Finally, the organization of this event would not have been possible without adequate funding. We would like to acknowledge the generous financial support of the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and the Humanities (CRASSH), the Society for Education, Music and Psychology Research (SEMPRE), the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC), the Faculty of Music and Oxford University Press. We would also like to thank Catherine Hurley, Gemma Tyler, Philippa Smith, Anna Malinowska at CRASSH as well as Susan Rolfe, Barbara Jones and Mike Franklin at RCEAL for their help in several important administrative aspects of this conference. Finally, we would like to thank the staff and students of the Centre for Music & Science and the Research Centre for English & Applied Linguistics for their assistance and support.Download Free PDFView PDFPsychophysiologyAbnormal neural responses to harmonic syntactic structures in congenital amusia2019 • Linshu Zhou, Jun  JiangIn music, harmonic syntactic structures are organized hierarchically through local and long‐distance dependencies. This study investigated whether congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of pitch perception, is associated with impaired processing of harmonic syntactic structures. For stimuli, we used harmonic sequences containing two phrases, where the first phrase ended with a half cadence and the second with an authentic cadence. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the ending chord of the authentic cadence to be either syntactically regular or irregular based on local dependencies. Sixteen amusics and 16 controls judged the expectedness of these chords while their EEG waveforms were recorded. In comparison to the regular endings, irregular endings elicited an ERAN, an N5, and a late positive component in controls but not in amusics, indicating that amusics were impaired in processing local syntactic dependencies. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the half cadence of the harmonic sequences to either adhere to or violate long‐distance syntactic dependencies. In response to irregular harmonic sequences, an ERAN‐like component and an N5 were elicited in controls but not in amusics, suggesting that amusics were impaired in processing long‐distance syntactic dependencies. Furthermore, for controls, the neural processing of local and long‐distance syntactic dependencies was correlated at the later integration stage but not at the early detection stage. These findings indicate that amusia is associated with impairment in the detection and integration of local and long‐distance syntactic violations. The implications of these findings in terms of hierarchical music‐syntactic processing are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFCerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)Decoding temporal structure in music and speech relies on shared brain resources but elicits different fine-scale spatial patterns2011 • Anjali BhataraDownload Free PDFView PDFTopics in Cognitive ScienceMusic and Language Perception: Expectations, Structural Integration, and Cognitive Sequencing2012 • Barbara TillmannDownload Free PDFView PDFAnatomical Record Part A-discoveries in Molecular Cellular and Evolutionary BiologyLeft hemispheric lateralization of brain activity during passive rhythm perception in musicians2006 • Allen BraunDownload Free PDFView PDFMusical Relevance.

In this fMRI study, we measured brain metabolic response in musicians as they generated structured and non-structured sequences in language and music. We employed a univariate and multivariate cross-classification approach to provide evidence that a common neural code underlies the production of structured sequences across the two domains. Crucially, the common substrate includes Broca's area, a region well known for processing structured sequences in language. These findings have several implications. First, they directly support the hypothesis that language and music share syntactic integration mechanisms. Second, they show that Broca's area is capable of operating supramodally across these two domains. Finally, these results dismiss the recent hypothesis that domain general processes of neighboring neural substrates explain the previously observed " overlap " between neuroimaging activations across the two domains.Download Free PDFView PDFCognitive SemioticsListen Up!
