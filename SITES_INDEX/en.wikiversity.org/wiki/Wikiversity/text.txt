What is Wikiversity?
Wikiversity is a community devoted to collaborative learning. We build learning resources from the ground up and also link to existing internet resources. Wikiversity uses wiki software, which makes collaboration easy. Wikiversity participants are continually improving the educational content of Wikiversity's pages. See also more about Wikiversity.
Can I help?
Click edit this page to change a Wikiversity webpage.
Sure! Don't be afraid to edit—anyone can edit, and we encourage you to be bold! Find something that can be improved, either in content, grammar or formatting, and fix it.
You can't break Wikiversity. Anything can be fixed or improved later. So go ahead, edit, and help make Wikiversity the best learning center on the Internet. We should contribute our own efforts to perfect it!
