By combining these two dimensions, we develop a typology of four approaches for studying organizational change. Although the four approaches may be viewed as opposing or competing views, we see them as being complementary. Each approach focuses on different questions and provides a different — but partial — understanding of organizational change. We argue that coordinating the pluralistic insights from the four approaches provides a richer understanding of organization change than any one approach provides by itself.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marshall Scott Poole•  6  Sociology, Organizational Change, Organization Studies, Business and ManagementHandbook of Whiteheadian process thought (Ontos, 2008)Save to LibraryDownloadby Will Desmond•  145  Management, Semiotics, Gnosticism, HistoryApplying the science of complexity to the question of organizationIn this master thesis, the question is explored of how complexity theory can inform and challenge the study of organizations.

Complexity theory researches complex social and natural systems and the phenomena to which they give rise, such as emergence, adaptiveness, self-organization and complexity. It has been suggested that (human) organizations are complex systems, being composed of many actors which, through local interactions, generate emergent behavior on the level of the organization as a whole. If this is true, it challenges many of the – implicit - assumptions we hold when thinking and writing about organizations. Drawing on complexity scholars and organization theorists such as Ralph Stacey, Paul Cilliers, and Edgar Morin, I analyze and critically evaluate (1) How complexity theory has been used in organizations studies so far (2) What theoretical and ethical consequences the insights from complexity theory hold for the way we think about organizations (3) What a theory of organization rooted in complexity studies could look like (4) How professionals working with organizations can develop an attitude that allows them to better deal with complexity in their practice. I conclude that complexity theory has important consequences for the way we think and work in organizations, proposing an approach which is not aimed at reducing complexity for those involved, but at engaging it from an attitude which is both modest and reflective. My thesis was awarded with the Leo Polak Thesis Prize 2014 (second prize).Save to LibraryDownloadby Jasper  Ligthart•  9  Organizational Behavior, Normative Ethics, Organizational Change, Complexity TheoryChe cos’è l’estetica organizzativa, Roma: Carocci, 2010Indice Introduzione©7 1.

Whether in nonprofit, for-profit, or governmental agencies, the practical realities of human service organizations are a central element of professional social work. This book explores the climate and culture of these agencies and provides essential information for surviving and thriving in this setting. It prepares students for their future careers so that they will feel empowered in their work and be able to fulfill their responsibilities toward organizational, community, and social change. Using real-life examples, the authors examine the internal structures of management, financing, and supervision and discuss common conflicts between agencies and professionals. The book’s straightforward tone and practical advice make it an asset to anyone entering human service organizations. This new edition contains updated examples, case studies, and references. It also contains valuable information on the effects of the recent financial crisis on human service organizations. Agencies now face increased caseloads and more complex social problems with fewer resources and less money. Understanding how these events have changed the nature of human service organizations will allow students to be better prepared for the work ahead of them. Features • Expanded content on the practical aspects of organizational theory and suggestions for developing leadership skills• Updated examples, case studies, and references throughout the book• Key points and discussion questions following each chapter• Updated instructor’s manual available online as a PDF or Word document"Save to LibraryDownloadby Rich Furman•  141  Business, Organizational Behavior, Management, Business AdministrationSherlock Holmes and the adventure of the rational manager: Organizational reason and its discontentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Monika Kostera•  14  Management, Social Sciences, Organization Studies, Detective FictionBook Review: The Age of Surveillance Capitalism.

Drawing on empirical datafrom a  four-year research project (SOGRO), the article reflects on the impact of information technologies (IT) on the organisation of emergency response and on rescue services  against  the  backdrop  of  broader  organisational  shifts  and  contemporary  demands.  Because  IT strengthens  a  particular  way  of  MCI management,  it  is  firstly  described  as  expressing  and  reifying  specific considerations of emergency response experts. Secondly, the benefits of an IT-based emergency responseare critically reviewed. IT collects and makes available data about the rescue operation. Thus, it makes aformerly blurred rescue operation transparent. Although its operational benefit remains vague for on-scene executives, the visualisation  reduces uncertainties  among  them.  Thirdly,  the  article  points  out  the  inherent  logics  of IT.  Its implementation not only satisfies newly evolved information needs, but also increases the control density.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nils Ellebrecht and +1Stefan  Kaufmann•  9  Computer Networks, Organization Studies, ICT, DatabasesCaracteristicas Estructurales De Las Organizaciones Deportivas: Principales Tendencias en El Debate AcademicoLa relacion entre teoria organizacional y deporte ha presentado normalmente al deporte como un campo interesante en el cual ilustrar el fenomeno organizacional.

Limited access to organizations is a likely explanation, particularly because process analysis often requires detailed data. Experimental research may provide the necessary data, if only a method is used that allows the situation under study to change as a result of actors’ behaviors. Simulation/gaming meets this criterion. It allows for registration of interaction processes, and it enables experimental control of factors of interests. The method can be used to study organizational processes in detail and to explore how these processes are influenced by organizational strategies, in this article, results of process analysis derived from a simulation/game of a house-building company are presented.Save to LibraryDownloadby Geert  Vissers•  4  Game studies, Social Interaction, Organization Studies, Process AnalysisIn Search of Organizational Virtue In Business: Agents, Goods, Practices, Institutions and Environments (with Geoff Moore) (Organization Studies 27:3, 369-389; 2006)Save to LibraryDownloadby Geoff Moore•  5  Business Ethics, Virtue Ethics, Organization Studies, Alasdair MacIntyreOrigins of Corporate Governance in the USA, Sweden and FranceSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Lubatkin•  2  Organization Studies, Business and ManagementPower and Glory: Concentrated Power in Top Management TeamsSave to LibraryDownloadby Henrich Greve and +1Mitsuhashi Hitoshi•  3  Organization Studies, Business and Management, Top Management TeamStanding Conference on Organizational Symbolism: Sport, Play and Game, 7-10 July 2014 Utrecht, the NetherlandsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jeroen  Vermeulen•  16  Sociology of Sport, Play, Organizational Culture, Alternative forms of management and organizationA "Circuits of Power"-based Perspective on Algorithmic Management and Labour in the Gig EconomyThe bulk of contributions on digital business so far provide mainly descriptive analyses when it comes to the study of power-related phenomena within the gig economy.

We particularly lack systematic, integrative studies which focus on interdependencies of power relations, labour conditions and business model efficiency, based on robust theoretical approaches which capture meso-level structures and micro-level dynamics of power simultaneously. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap by investigating power relations in platform arrangements, based on the framework of "circuits of power". We use the case of the ridesharing platform Uber, which has caused debates in and beyond academia to illustrate how this framework, combined with concepts from labour process theory, behavioural economics and micro-politics, can be applied for a systematic analysis of the diversified portfolio of power-related control and influence mechanisms that are embedded in platforms' software infrastructures. Departing from this, we examine how our approach can inform future research focused on assessing specific forms of management, organisation and work in the wider gig economy. Our discussion concentrates on a) the classification and comparison of heterogeneous forms of gig work; b) the assessment of labour-related problems; and c) power-related organisational dynamics or inertia in such settings. The latter point is related to the central question of why employee voice and resistance are rare in certain gig-work arrangements.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Pastuh and +1Mike Geppert•  11  Industrial And Labor Relations, Organizational Theory, Sociology of Work, Industrial RelationsNational employment systems and job autonomy: Why job autonomy is high in the Nordic countries and low in the United States, Canada, and AustraliaSave to LibraryDownloadby Terry Boychuk•  3  Organization Studies, United States, Nordic countriesEnacting Dismal Science: New Perspectives on the Performativity of EconomicsIn this book, sociologists, philosophers, and economists investigate the conceptual issues around the performativity of economics over a variety of disciplinary contexts and provide new case studies illuminating this phenomenon.

In featuring the latest contributions to the performativity debate the book revives discussion of the fundamental questions: What precise meaning can we attribute to the notion of performativity? What empirical evidence can help us recognize economics as performative? And what consequences does performativity have for contemporary societies? The contributions demonstrate how performativity can serve as a powerful conceptual resource in dealing with economic knowledge, as an inspiring framework for investigating performative practices, and as an engine of discovery for thinking of the economic proper.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ivan Boldyrev and +1Ekaterina Svetlova•  15  Management, Economic Sociology, Organizational Theory, Sociology of Knowledge“The Leadership Struggle:  The Case of Costen Elementary School.”  In  Distributed Leadership in Practice edited by James Spillane and John Diamond.

This introduction reviews this approach to integrating history into organization studies and explores its paths forward. We begin by examining the intellectual origins of the approach and by defining why and how it matters to the study of management and organizations. Specifically, we emphasize the performative role of history in making and unmaking organizational orders. Next, we elaborate on how the articles in the special issue demonstrate the uses of the past in shaping organizational identity, strategy, and power. We also highlight how this work contributes to our understanding of the socially embedded character of history in organizations by accounting for the role of materiality, intertextuality, competing narratives, practices, and audiences in how the past is used.

Una concurrida feria dominical de la ciudad de Córdoba reconocida por distintos discursos, entre otros los mediáticos, como un espacio exclusivo de migrantes de origen peruano. La etnografía, sin embargo, nos presenta la Feria de los Patos como un ensamblaje de grupos, intereses y actividades que complejiza esta definición identitaria, y que depende de una noción local de comercio que combina las transacciones económicas con los compromisos afectivos. Al recorrer los puestos y las maneras en que se vinculan familias, comidas y clientes se hace evidente el importante papel de las prácticas de seducción en el establecimiento de relaciones de comercio e intimidad, así como en la organización y sostenimiento de la Feria de los Patos cada domingo.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jose Maria Miranda•  6  Organization Studies, Economía, Antropología, Inmigrantes en argentinaDynamic diversity: variety and variation within countriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Brendan McSweeney•  3  Business Administration, Organization Studies, Business and ManagementFrom Information‐Seeking Behavior to Meaning Engagement Practice.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark Aakhus•  5  Information Systems, Organizational Communication, Organization Studies, Information Seeking BehaviourOrganizational Ingenuity: Concept, Processes and StrategiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Benson Honig and +1Israel  Drori•  2  Organization Studies, Business and ManagementSumaq Kawsay: the birth of a notion?May the principle of Sumaq Kawsay be used to discuss about new development and organizational thinkingfrom a Latin American perspective?

The aim of this paper is to detail an approach to treating both structures in a comparable way, an approach that explicitly recognizes core and underlying commonalties. Two distinct  analytical strategies are employed to this end. The first involves a detailed comparison and contrast of selected and relevant structural dimensions drawn from the two research streams. The second strategy involves the application of these dimensions to the study of network graphs of both the formal and informal structures of the same organization at the same point in time.Save to LibraryDownloadby Starling D Hunter•  18  Organizational Behavior, Organizational Communication, Organizational Theory, Social NetworksProject?

However, if we look at the history of the 'Heartland' economies then it becomes evident that they were never neoliberal in the first place - that is, the economic policies and discourses in these countries did not follow neoliberal prescriptions. /We Have Never Been Neoliberal/ explores this divergence between neoliberal theory and 'neoliberal' practice by focusing on the underlying contradictions in monetarism, private monopolies, and financialization. The book finishes by proposing a 'manifesto for a doomed youth' in which it argues that younger generations should refuse to pay interest on anything in order to avoid the trap of debt-driven living.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kean Birch•  83  Business, Business Ethics, Finance, SociologyStrati A., Gherardi S., La philosophie de Luigi Pareyson et la recherche esthétique des pratiques organisationnelles: un dialogueThe philosophical aesthetics of the Italian philosopher Luigi Pareyson is discussed in a dialogue between the two authors with reference to its importance in understanding practice in organizational life and in Practice-based Theory of... moreThe philosophical aesthetics of the Italian philosopher Luigi Pareyson is discussed in a dialogue between the two authors with reference to its importance in understanding practice in organizational life and in Practice-based Theory of organization.Save to LibraryDownloadby Antonio Strati and +1Silvia Gherardi•  8  Economic Sociology, Philosophy, Aesthetics, Organizational TheoryOrganization as Communication: A Luhmannian PerspectiveThis article introduces Luhmann’s theory of social systems as a prominent example of communication as constitutive of organization (CCO) thinking and argues that Luhmann’s perspective contributes to current conceptual debates on how... moreThis article introduces Luhmann’s theory of social systems as a prominent example of communication as constitutive of organization (CCO) thinking and argues that Luhmann’s perspective contributes to current conceptual debates on how communication constitutes organization. The theory of social systems highlights that organizations are fundamentally grounded in paradox because they are built on communicative events that are contingent by nature. Consequently, organizations are driven by the continuous need to deparadoxify their inherent contingency. In that respect, Luhmann’s approach fruitfully combines a processual, communicative conceptualization of organization with the notion of boundary and self-referentiality. Notwithstanding the merits of Luhmann’s approach, its accessibility tends to be limited due to the hermetic terminology that it employs and the fact that it neglects the role of material agency in the communicative construction of organizations.Save to Libraryby Dennis Schoeneborn•  7  Organizational Communication, Organization Studies, Luhmann, Social Constructionism/ ConstructivismPOLITICS AND POWER IN THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION: AN INTRODUCTIONSave to LibraryDownloadby Mike Geppert•  8  Critical Theory, Organizational Theory, International Business, Strategic ManagementRecruitment Challenges and Best PracticesFor the past 20 years, the attention of human resource specialists and other stakeholders has been drawn to the usage of psychological tests and assessment instruments that give an insight into potential employees' personality,... moreFor the past 20 years, the attention of human resource specialists and other stakeholders has been drawn to the usage of psychological tests and assessment instruments that give an insight into potential employees' personality, interpersonal style, and their response to stressful situations (Gatewood & Feild, 1998; Ryan & Sackett, 1987).Save to LibraryDownloadby CHIOMA UZOAMAKA  ITEOGU•  14  Business, Management, Business Administration, International StudiesThe making of an ethnically diverse management: contested cultural meanings in a Dutch amateur football clubThis article discusses ethnographic research on the planned transition from an all-white Dutch management towards an ethnically diverse management of an amateur football club.

The article is based on a three-year period of ethnographic fieldwork in a football club, located in an ethnically diverse neighborhood in the Netherlands. We argue that the transition led to contested understandings of cultural practices and artefacts within the club. The meaning-making processes of the club’s organizational culture reinforced us-them divisions between the two groups. What is at stake is the symbolic ownership of the club that comes from a deep-rooted desire among members of sport clubs to be ‘among themselves’. The findings suggest that apparent equity in terms of shared participation in the club’s management does not necessarily lead to bridging of ethnic differences on the level of the club’s culture. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17430437.2013.821257#.UhMeTUoso4kSave to LibraryDownloadby Michel van Slobbe and +2Martijn KosterJeroen  Vermeulen•  60  Management, Sociology, Cultural Studies, Sociology of SportManagen van cultuur in publieke organisatiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Martijn Koster•  20  Management, Sociology of Culture, Anthropology, Public AdministrationGherardi S., Strati A., Learning and Knowing in Practice-based Studies, Cheltenham: Elgar, 2012The book is structured into three parts with the purpose of giving prominence to both the concepts and methods of practice-based studies.

The paper seeks to respond to this question by adopting a psychoanalytically informed approach to the analysis of how individuals perceive their own corruptness. I focus in particular on the Goldman Sachs Abacus deal, a notorious case of corruption concealed behind a facade of legality. Building on the detailed analysis of emails exchanges from within Goldman Sachs, I utilize the Lacanian concept of ‘ideological fantasy’ to discuss how the traders’ narratives bear witness to a certain logic of fantasy that appears to fuel corrupt activities. I also examine the cover-up tactics which were adopted to camouflage the corrupt operations and make them appear licit. Corrupt performances and their cover-up are theorized as forms of self-transgressive jouissance, a simultaneously pleasurable and selfdestructive practice that is needed to sustain and protect the impossible norms of the corporation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Edouard Pignot•  9  Organizational Psychology, Psychoanalysis, Organizational Theory, Critical Management StudiesFatal attraction.

The biotechnology sector is not as closely connected to the historical patterns of Norwegian specialization as aquaculture, aluminum, or oil and gas, which represent the small scale decentralized and the large scale centralized paths within the Norwegian innovation system. Parts of the contemporary biotechnology industry in Norwayhave elements in common with high technology engineering, and in the case of marine biotechnology, there are some links with the nation’s long established trajectory of resource-based industry. Moreover, the recent entry of a large number of new firms into Norway’s biotechnology industry has occurred in parallel with the development of a Norwegian venture capital industry.Save to LibraryDownloadby Terje Gronning•  6  Technology, Social Sciences, Innovation statistics, BiotechnologyВ поисках доверия: сравнительно-историческая социология публичной сферы Апостолиса ПапакостасаВступительная статья в книге: Папакостас А.

We address this gap by drawing from an in-depth case study of a musical intervention in a professional ice-hockey team in Finland. At the time of the study, the organization faced a serious crisis, having lost 11 sequential games, leading its managers to search for " alternative " means for promoting social cohesion, and subsequently engaging in an arts-based musical intervention. Our findings examine how material objects and collective synchronization rhythms grounded the interpersonal interactions of team members and mediated members' attempts to transform personal subjective experiences into collective collaboration. We draw out the conceptual implications of our findings for understanding, on the one hand, the collective nature of aesthetic processes, and on the other hand, the materially mediated processes of communication. In terms of practical implication, we contribute to understanding the social dynamics and transformative organizational possibilities of artistic interventions that generate value for the organization and its members.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gazi Islam•  22  Business, Organizational Behavior, Management, Business AdministrationAntecedents and Consequences of Organizational Commitment: A Comparison of Two ScalesSave to LibraryDownloadby Dawn Carlson•  37  Information Systems, Marketing, Psychology, ServicesHospitality and organisations: Enchantment, entrenchment and reconfiguration This paper examines the complex relationship between hospitality and organisations.

It is argued that a variety of organisational practices can be understood by considering how hospitality is mobilised and experienced by multiple stakeholders. The paper begins by synthesising existing conceptions of hospitality and outlining its different dimensions. It then goes on to examine how hospitality themes and related issues emerge in, and are thus relevant to, the study of organisations and management. The paper firstly considers how hospitality is extended to or oriented towards external stakeholders and thus mobilised as tactical or strategic enchantment. It is argued that hospitality can be used purposefully to establish power relations and invoke obligations both to conform to organisational norms and to reciprocate. Secondly, the paper considers how hospitality emerges within organisational practices and may be deployed by various stakeholders as an instrument of entrenchment to perpetuate existing norms and hierarchies. However, it is also suggested that practices of hospitality can create alternative organisational spaces and networks, and hospitable acts may thus help to reconfigure power relationships and become focal points of resistance. The paper concludes by reflecting upon emerging questions, challenges and potential avenues for further research and intervention.Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter Lugosi•  17  Organizational Behavior, Cultural Geography, Organizational Theory, Hospitality StudiesOrganizational Culture in The Office (S03E05, Initiation)A case study for organizational behavior based on the "Initiation" episode of the third season of The Office (S03E05).
