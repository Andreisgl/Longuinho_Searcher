I posted a proposition regarding the Wikimedia Mouvement here: 
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Www.wikimedia.org_template
The general idea is to create a website which would report on our global 
mouvement. Main benefits would be
* to present ourselves as a loose but nevertheless coordinated body of 
some sort (public face)
* share practices and experiences between chapters and wmf
Situation right now is not satisfactory and I believe it likely to 
create either more tension or more separation in the future. Generally, 
information regarding wikimedia mouvement is hosted on
* internalwiki (private wiki shared between some chapters members and wmf),
* on meta (access to information is very confusing since it is mostly a 
work-wiki and a wiki shared by many),
* on Foundationwiki (eg 
http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_room/Media_Contact_2008)
* on each association website (eg http://wikimedia.de/)
Can we discuss that ? If you are supportive, please mention it on the 
wiki page
Thanks
Ant
