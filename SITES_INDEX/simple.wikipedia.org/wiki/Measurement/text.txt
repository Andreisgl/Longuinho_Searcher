Measurement means compare to a fix standard value. To measure something is to give a number to some property of the thing. Measuring something puts the amount of the thing into numbers. Measurement can be written using many different units. For example, if we want to compare two different sized container for holding a given quantity of liquid, we can ask: Are both containers the same size? Will they hold the same amount of liquid?
