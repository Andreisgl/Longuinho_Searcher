If, on one hand, ascent and decline are (in general) considered characteristics typical of all civilizations, on the other hand it is possible to also see them as a different and less evident phenome- non: one which is made up of the transformation of civilizations into other civilizations and in their expressions of social innovation phenomena.Clearly, it does not make sense to reason in terms of universal determinism, that is, with the idea of a necessary cycle that always works similarly both in different historical moments as well as in geographic and social contexts. Nor is it correct to reduce the multiplicity of civilizing processes to a unique model of “civilization”. The historical dynamics of civilization work differently and do not act only from the outside upon individuals and social groups. On the contrary, within these processes, individuals generate or internalize certain values, which make them bearers – through their existence – in the increasingly broader environment in which they live.Today, more than in the past, both individuals and their surrounding contexts are globally connected. The in- teraction between different processes of civilization continuously manifests itself, generating a possible twofold de- velopment: a progressive clash between civilizations originating from the conflict between the different identities that contend for hegemony over a world perceived as global but also delineated by defined and irreducible spaces and identities; or an idea of civilization that is decentralized and de-spatialized originating from a dynamic of con- tinuous hybridization, shaped by the intangible flows that crisscross the globe.The multiplicity of ongoing processes and their temporal durations may push towards a more plural redefini- tion of globalization understood as the set of ways in which different cultures acknowledge (or have conceived) the interdependence and contact between civilizations. Thinking about what were, or are, the relationships between dif- ferent civilizations and different “globalizations” as well as how they change the processes of civilization in relation to plural global dynamics, can undoubtedly offer new paradigms in which to understand social complexity with hermeneutical modalities that are just as complex.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With the term " Anthropocene " scholars from various disciplines illustrate the idea of a recent geological epoch in which human activity has made an unprecedented impact on the planet. Human modification of geological and ecological processes has accelerated rapidly over the span of the twentieth century. The expansion of industrial growth, especially in the " great acceleration " and the surge of energy use after the Second World War, urbanization and the socio-cultural changes that accompany it, as well as the lifestyle and mind-set of most people all over the world are factors contributing to what is happening to our planet. In the past five decades, human activity has begun to change the earth at a rate and on a scale that is fundamentally different from anything seen before in human history. Today, two-thirds of the world's ecosystems are degraded and being used unsustainably. The evidences of climate change are clear and so are its potentially catastrophic results. Due to their extreme use, the reserves of traditional resources are declining, which will, in turn, have a profound effect on the global economy. All of these interdependent issues threaten the world and humankind's wellbeing; their consequences already affect food, water, energy, resource security and so forth. In order to reverse this trend, we need to develop strategies for a peaceful and equitable relationship between humans and the earth.

This paper builds on the previous literature and addresses the following: a) understand the link between the social determinants of health framework and the Affordable Care Act; b) explore Somali women's attitudes about the feasibility of access and knowledge of the Affordable Care Act, specifically the Medicaid expansion and health insurance marketplace; c) address Somali women's encounters with doctors and practitioners post-enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Using interview data from twenty Somali women, common themes elicited were the following: mis-communication among Somali immigrant women and their healthcare providers, feelings of social anxiety and other mental health issues, as well as poor patient and doctor relationships. The project is a community-engaged research study that collects data on individuals' knowledge with the Affordable Care Act by working with members of several Somali led organizations to identify additional key issues within the community. Furthermore, this project challenges the complexity of adapting and integrating into an unfamiliar culture due to language barriers and approach to medical practices, i.e. views about medical practices may be due to cultural values and beliefs about health. In conclusion , this paper provides demographic data about the impact of health disparities on Somali refugees and immigrants by including how they view access to healthcare, identify barriers to information and care provided by health practitioners, and examine their needs in terms of preventive care.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nowadays, the " self " and the " other " meet in a " neutral " space where geographies and landscape merge hosting the dialogue in a welcoming space that while defying a definite description opens itself up for exploration. Our world is characterized by pluralities, by spaces that are less and less defined, by messages that circulate in an undefined cyberspace in multiple languages, in exchanges that are closer and closer to a simultaneous dialogue where words and thoughts that represent multicultural spaces escape being defined as a geographical space while nonetheless painting a unique landscape. I will explore these concepts as I will analyze the transliterary process of migration of stories, cultures and cultural artifacts centering my study in the transcultural space. I will analyze this figurative and objective geographical space. I will study how the story after being confined to a class perception, to cultural stereotypes thus being held immobile, then thanks to the creation of a transliterary space the story migrates and participates in the globalized dialogue that transcends the literary realm of origin. This literary and cultural migration take place in a landscape that represents the transitional aspect of the literary transaction creating a unique geographical landscape and space that I will explore in detail.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

DantaniThe paper examines how globalization induces tensions and prejudices in the federal state of Nige... more The paper examines how globalization induces tensions and prejudices in the federal state of Nigeria, which lead to separatist and secessionist movements. The methodological issues are based on documentary and content analyses and adopt a sociological approach as the framework of analysis. The approach argues that a federal structure permeated by forces of globalization, primordial sentiments and pretensions, agitations for self-determination are presented as separatist or secessionist movements. Research finding argues that the onset of globalization in Third World nations was perpetuated through colonial domination which created a divide and rule policy in the federal state of Nigeria. The policy of domination and marginalization by European colonialist and continued by the first republic politicians and military dictators have triggered agitations and counter agitations for secessionism in Nigeria. It is also argued from the research finding that deregulation of the downstream sector of the Nigerian oil industries in the Niger Delta region, one of the forces of globalization creates and intensifies unemployment , brings abject poverty and hunger, looses soil fertility, creates environmental pollution and degradation, destroys aquatic animals and prevalence of oil spillage. The outcome was the intensification of militancy operations in the region-fuelled secessionist movement by the inhabitants of oil producing communities. Furthermore , it is indicated by the finding of the research that trade liberalization – a rule of the game of globalization – allows the intrusion of small arms and light weapons into Nigeria by the secessionist movements and Boko Haram insurgents who want to establish an Islamic state based on theocracy. Possession of logistics and their applications for secessionism, therefore, pose a serious challenge to the corporate existence federalism in Nigeria. Moreover, the contagious theory effect of globalized media that provides chances of spreading the philosophy and successes of other secessionist movements elsewhere into the federal structure of the country has aided the process of agitations for separatism. The paper concludes that despite the demands for secessionism, the process left much to be desired as the Ni-gerian state continues to exist under a unified and indivisible country.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2018, 2, Cambiamento e stabilità nelle federazioni dell'Asia Meridionale: India, Pakistan e Malesia, by Enrico CiappiDespite sharing the same colonial heritage, over the past few decades the federal systems of Indi... more Despite sharing the same colonial heritage, over the past few decades the federal systems of India, Pakistan and Malesia have been changing in very different ways. In order to understand this evolution, the article examines some political phenomena that have questioned the stability of these federations. The starting point of this analysis is the treatment of strategies adopted by the central governments to halt the activation of internal inter-community conflicts. Thanks to a comparison with recent thematic literature, the discussion about the strengths and the limits of devolution and centralization policies is linked to the problem of internal peace within multinational societies. In the Asian federal states, the inter-ethnic conflict and the problem of ethnic outbidding have their roots in the political management of territory and the representation of regional populations within the legislative chambers. Having taken into account the description of the dissimi-larity between the federal cases, it can be seen that the internal geographical divi-sion's criteria has greatly determined the degree of autonomy of regions and, moreover, the relations between central government and local institutions. Additionally , the reinforcement of intergovernmental collaboration has allowed India to simplify the cooperation between regional and federal politicians, although the Veto Players Theory explains why the operation of cooperative federalism may pose a threat to institutional stability by legislative immobilism. To conclude, it seems that the federal integration strategies advocated by India and Malaysia have been able to consolidate the stability of these regimes, but only at the cost of a strong centralization and discriminatory practices against some local autonomies. As for Pakistan, however, the presence of an authoritarian regime, characterized by a bureaucratic-military leadership and a precarious federal system, seems to expose the Pakistani society to the risk of collapse.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2018, 2, Federalism: a way to govern globalization, by Lucio LeviGlobalization is a social and economic integration process, which has a significant political mea... more Globalization is a social and economic integration process, which has a significant political meaning, i.e. the erosion of state sovereignty. The nature of globalization is not a mere quantitative increase of social relations and exchanges at world level, but it is a qualitative change rooted in the scientific revolution of material production, and it creates, alongside national societies and markets, a global market and a global civil society. It is a process that is changing the form and size of economic and social life and imposes on all sectors of social life a much wider dimension than that of sovereign states, even the biggest ones. The changes that have occurred in the sovereign state and the international system of states are by now recognized as the central political fact of our times. The construction of a general theory of politics that unifies political science and international relations is a long term task that may be performed by an entire generation of scholars. Multitudes of scholars are working to reconstruct a theory of politics that adheres more to the evolution of contemporary history. Federalism is one of these theories: it is an unfinished project, not a static political vision nor a timeless political theory. It is an unaccomplished project, which is constantly evolving in response to the new problems which history is raising relentlessly. Flexibility – which is the specific character of federal institutions – is particularly adapted to answering the need of combining unity with diversity that is required by the globalization era. Therefore, federalism is a political tool suitable for governing the social transformations under way in the contemporary world. It appears to be a very efficient institutional device for political integration, for ensuring the functioning of pluralistic societies, for protecting minorities, for solving ethnic, religious and national conflicts, and for answering the need for peace and international solidarity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Changes in immigration and citizenship la... more Germany has the highest number of immigrants in Europe. Changes in immigration and citizenship laws have intended to make Germany an attractive destination for skilled immigrant workers. The accentuated focus on the economic efficiency of migration, however, leaves open the question of how Germany's national identity is living up to the immigrant situation. Based on face-to-face, in-depth, semi-structured interviews (N=45), this question is probed through the eyes of first and second generation immigrants in southwest Germany. Perceptions of social and affective integration, group identifications and possibilities of de-differentiating native-immigrant distinctions are studied in detail. While a few respondents mention instances of personal discrimination and most are at ease with their life in Germany, even fewer see themselves as German without further qualification. Even though there are hints of a partial disintegration of the fault lines between immigrants' self and what they perceive as " German " , their answers provide little indication of an emergence of a new inclusive narrative of Germaneness. Germany's national identity still needs to broaden its understandings of " what it means to be a German " .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We welcome studies in any field, with or without comparative approach, that address both practical effects and theoretical import. All articles should be sent to: p.bassetti@globusetlocus.org and davide.cadeddu@unimi.it Articles can be in any language and length chosen by the author, while its abstract and keywords have to be in English. The analysis of migratory flows have led some scholars to agree upon the theory of " double absence " , where the migrant experiences in his own dealings a loss of " belonging " to his origins as well as lack of " recognition " as a citizen in his newly adopted country. The protean reality of globalisation permits, however, to identify different points of view and particular concrete cases that suggest the necessity for more complex hermeneutical paradigms. Some cultural identities, for example, express themselves with more evocative intensity when outside of their countries of origin, thanks to the " comparison with the other " which, in a different light, created many problems in the history of humanity. Globalisation seems capable of generating idem sentire different than the standard idea of national belonging. Some identities adapt themselves to the host culture: they modify and recognise themselves as expressions of multiple memberships, but are nourished by the act of preserving cultural characteristics. While the idea of a worldwide network of ethnic or national origin (such as Anglo Saxon, Hispanic and Chinese) is widely accepted, different data sources clearly show the development of communities which are not modelled on the traditional criteria of identification and belonging. These communities can still progressively gather strength, to the extent to which they know how to open and connect themselves, and thus form a well-connected network of people without a defined territory. Some global communities do not identify themselves through the use of a common language, but rather through shared interests and values, from which they are then able to create business communities. It is therefore necessary to go beyond mere historical data of emigration in order to define new global identities founded on mentality, taste and world view that express the way in which we relate to others, conduct business, and recognise ourselves in a specific type of art and culture. The existence of a business community that works to enlarge the area of its market also involves the search for acknowledgement of identity through the creation of a network society, a network of mass media formed of numerous entities (newspapers, television programs, websites) and an enormous and varied global network of operators. These business and network communities seem to challenge the evermore formal role performed by political institutions in the capacity to represent and operate, and implicitly invite them to transform political territorial representation with governance of flows of people, goods, money and information into a new political representation of these flows with governance of territories. How to reorganise, and with what legitimising principles, this new form of multiple governance that already unravels the facts, so that politics takes control and gives sense to the ongoing historical process, is the task which politics will probably need to take charge of in the future.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

GJ #2017, 1, Party-Movement's Power Dynamics in Transcultural Perspectives: the AAP and the M5S between Participation and Electoral Politics, by Cristiano Gianollaby Glocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and Innovation and Cristiano GianollaPolitical parties are privileged phenomena from which to analyse and understand political power d... more Political parties are privileged phenomena from which to analyse and understand political power dynamics; this article focuses on a specific type: party-movements. These are considered to be particularly interesting because they have emerged from civil society, carry innovative political ideas based on participation and entail new forms of sharing political power. Looking very closely at the power dynamics within party-movements, this empirical research (based on two cases of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in India and Italy) comparatively investigates the power dynamics between local and national centres of power within the participatory approaches of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S). The comparison takes place between two similar political phenomena of two culturally and geographically different political systems and provides further evidence in relation to representative democracy. In both cases, party-movements infuse a new enthusiasm into politics with the promise to redistribute power at the local level through participation. However, in order to compete with the power of other political parties within the electoral arena, party-movements need to be united political entities and de facto they relegate political participation under the primacy of party centralism. This resultantly has an impact at the local and national levels. Furthermore, the comparison of party-movements pertaining to diverse political landscapes emphasises the transcultural tendency of the power dynamics in representative systems in which participation is subdued to centralisation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2017, 1, "Legal Pluralism in Contemporary States: Between Traditional and Formal Justice Mechanisms in Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire", by Oladapo Kayode Opasinaby Glocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and Innovation and Oladapo OpasinaIt is generally assumed that African states have yet to explore the full potential of their tradi... more It is generally assumed that African states have yet to explore the full potential of their traditional institutions and the specific role that society wants them to play in modern states. While focusing on Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, this empirical research seeks to explore legal pluralism in modern African democracy. The study specifically answers the research question: is the traditional justice system applicable to Nigerians and Ivorians in contemporary dispensation? The study finds out that a significant population at the grassroots rely on the traditional justice system, when compared with their counterparts in the cities. The rural population argues that the formal justice system is quite expensive and that the legal procedures are difficult to understand , coupled with the fact that court houses are mostly located in the cities. On the other hand, the gender-biased and male-dominated outlook of the traditional justice mechanism and its proneness to external influences, as well as the impact of modern religions, have continued to propel a considerable population (especially in urban areas) to patronize the formal justice system. Meanwhile, the adoption of western institutions of government by African states has forced traditional institutions to occupy the back seat. Hence, there is a mixed social environment wherein both formal and traditional justice systems are weak, and the states being weak themselves are significantly responsible for the weakness of traditional institutions. Consequently, flaws in both justice systems have compelled people to take the law into their own hands and to resort to jungle justice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Tracing the placement and spatiality of the Arab Spring uprisings, their media and ideascapes (Appadurai 1990), this paper draws upon theoretical frameworks of Homi Bhabha's (2004) third space, Margaret Kuhn's (2003) radical space, and Geert Hofstede's (2014) cultural indicators. Given the information about self-immolations as the events that stirred the uprisings in the Arab Spring's countries in 2010-2012, it explores how patterns of contagion of conflict have been operating through specific cultural conditions during successful protests that led to the change of regime as opposed to failed protests that did not. The paper offers a cultural profile of the Arab Spring countries, discussing its implications for the countries' governance regarding the existence of inter-networked places of protests, significance of their cultural traditions, and their linkage to success or failure of the protests.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2017, 1, "Beyond Globalization: Reflections on Glocalism", by Fred DallmayrThe old adage states that humankind moves " one step forward " before it moves " two steps backwa... more The old adage states that humankind moves " one step forward " before it moves " two steps backward " , suggesting that there is no such thing as a linear evolution. This is particularly true when applied to our present time, the " age of globalization ". In the case of globalism, " two steps back " are needed in order to assess more soberly the present historical trajectory, and capture the " internal dialectic " of globalism. In fact, what we are witnessing today in many parts of the world is a backlash to globalism, manifest in an upsurge of traditional nationalism, if not chauvinism and ethnocentrism. The core issue is a difficult relation between nearness and distance, between the concretely singular and the general/universal which the term " globalism " seeks to capture but, of course, cannot explain. My reflections in the following seek to explore and shed some light on this relation. In a first step, I venture into philosophical (and theological) terrain in an effort to discern the meaning of human situatedness in a place, a space, or a " world ". Next, I discuss the inevitable tensions or conflicts between nearness and distance, that is, the inner " dialectic " between the local and the global. Finally, I translate the local/global syndrome into the correlation of " earth and world " , " roots and routes " , familiar loyalties and unfamiliar pere-grinations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2017, 1, "Does Glocal Political Power Already Exist?", by Lorenzo OrnaghiLarge periods of history are usually characterized by equally important moments of change in scie... more Large periods of history are usually characterized by equally important moments of change in scientific knowledge and, in particular, in the understanding of political power. We still need to study in depth whether the former provokes (almost of out necessity) the latter, or whether they are " great " because they are favored by the innovation of the paradigms of knowledge. The passage from medieval universal-ism to the particularism of the modern age represents an extremely interesting analogy when compared to the transformations that are now underway. The example of John of Salisbury's Policratus, the starting point of this article, is illuminating in our comprehension of the relevance of the interweaving between the persistence of the ancient forms of recognition of power and the search for new forms. The existence of glocal realities is already a fact. Even if it is relatively easy to recognize these realities (a business, a university, a humanitarian association, not a few of the same " parts " which constitute the traditional organization of the State), it is more difficult to define the specific characteristics of the power at their disposal. Moving from the widening gap between " actual " power and " potential " power, the article examines the motives for which the classical definitions of power are always becoming more insufficient in understanding the role now emerging from glocal realities. And, in particular, by looking at how the " command-obedience " relationship is changing also as a consequence of communication networks and information technology, the article analyzes that specific " contamination " within global elements and local elements, which seems to be the main base of glocal political power.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article questions the place of untied aid in development aid policies towards the African continent and gains in efficiency. If it is clear that the disbursement of Official Development Assistance has not reached its targets, it has adapted and evolved. The article analyzes the different implications of untied aid in terms of development and questions whether its emergence within the debate on the effectiveness would not be a smokescreen. For untied aid to be effective , some inherent contradictions have to be addressed. Untying aid in practice is subject to other constraints in recipient countries, and even untied aid finds itself in some way tied de facto.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This new concept could bridge the 'once sisters' disciplines of philosophy and geography, proposing a new way to analyze the biggest environmental phenomena of our times. In this paper, we will define what Hyperobjects exactly are, starting with their philosophical roots and the implications for the discipline of geography: the traditional notion of " World " itself is going to be challenged. The aim of this paper is obviously not to write a complete list of every Hyperobject, but to start a catalogue of them. For this reason, to support our arguments, we will discuss some of the most evident examples of Hyperobjects, such as Global Warming, landscape , abandon and waste; an array of very different phenomena that share some common traits: they are all shaping the geographies of our time, and they all have what an object need to be considered an Hyperobject.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using two popular examples, Babel and Love Actually, I explore the uses and the limits of the social network, respectively through a global and deterritorialised network and a local one that reveals kinship. Using the dynamic of networks to represent the characters' interactions, these types of films nonetheless need boundaries. In the context of globalization, hyperlink movies are the mirror of a new geography but cannot show the complexity and the extent of it all since they are restricted by their own limits, being a narrative medium with a specific length. Hyperlink movies therefore present an interesting compromise, using a popular narrative technique to showcase a complex phenomenon.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This response introduces the Ciutat Refugi Plan with a city-to-city network at the municipal level that involves other European cities in creating safe routes for refugees at the local government level. In line with multi-level governance theory, I argue that central governments' inaction has pressured local governments to take action during the Syrian refugee influx. Relying on the influence of local government networks, the Municipality of Barcelona uses discourse as a tool of action in opening discursive spaces for humanitarian political responses to the refugee crisis. Using critical discourse analysis, I test this argument by examining in-depth interviews, speeches of people in power that have appeared in news articles, and statements on official websites.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

All three of these characteristics are undergoing changes. Several developments involve a redefinition of the " State " and produce numerous contradictions, which can only be solved if we consider the historicity of both the phenomenal essence and the conceptual essence of the State.

It will be argued that despite the political and ideological conflicts between the U.S. and Iran, reaching a " point by point " agreement would best help to resolve Middle East predicaments, especially the Islamic terrorism. To achieve this, the following pages examine the historical background of issues such as terrorism in the Middle East. This paper also focuses on two main paths to support the better U.S.-Iran cooperation, if not talking about relations at all. First, the theory of " point by point " approach helps both countries to tackle tough agendas and overcome the predicaments in the Middle East. Second, to reach the desired cooperation between these two countries, both the U.S. and Iran need to overcome their own internal constraints as well as the external constrains imposed by other countries. This paper takes an historical and theoretical approach to reveal the two countries' common interests in the Middle East. The general thesis argues that the Middle East's security requires the United States and Iran to develop a diplomatic and military cooperation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 2, Globalization and Democratic Experiments: A Sociological Profiling of Nigeria's Democratic Colonialism (1999-2015), by Muhammad Maigari Abdullahi and Peter Nungshak ZikaGlobalization has become a contagious phenomenon that has not spared any society and social insti... more Globalization has become a contagious phenomenon that has not spared any society and social institutions. Events happening at the global arena has far-reaching impact and implications at the remotest village in virtually any part of the earth. The tidal wave of democracy as the most acceptable system of government and capitalism as the best economic system synchronized with the shattering hurricane of globalization around the world has been producing innumerable political changes. Nigeria like most countries in the third word that were formerly under military rule embraced the civilian rule in 1999 after 16 years of its suspension from 1983-1999. From this point of view this paper will seek to know the meaning of globalization, democracy and the inverse relationship of the two concepts on most of the third world countries in general and Nigeria in particular. A conceptual clarification of globalization and democracy will follow next. Methodologically, the paper adopted a qualitative methods of content analysis to analysed the literature and empirical studies on topic reviewed and provided some insightful sociological analyses and conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 2, Revisiting Liberal Democratic Universalism: A Critical Rhetoric of the Liberal Democratic World Order, by Rose Joy E.

However, it seems as though setting up a functional, stable, and viable democratic state is harder than overthrowing autocratic rulers. This rhetorical criticism explores gridlocks that hamper the development of universal liberal democratic values by emphasizing the Western hegemonic status of defining what liberal democracy is. It is pertinent to look into this dominant role considering that it is through these values that actions, policies, and other values are to be construed and judged. This paper aims to (1) highlight the role of moral cosmopolitanism as the initial step of Western hegemony, (2) identify the paradox of defining liberal democracy as universal but treating it as a particular, and (3) discuss the ironies of democratic imperialism and its hindrance to self-determination. This paper hopes to shed some light in the importance of various interpretations, definitions, and adaptations of liberal democratic values depending on the context of the society incorporating, its culture , its values, and its identity, in order to find a more comprehensive definition of democracy .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the one hand, it needs to manage the current refugee's influx efficiently and on the other hand it needs to deal with the democratic deficit that emerged by Europe's incapacity to make the required decisions and gain the justification of its actions from its own people. This article aims firstly to highlight the legal framework (rule of law) that governs the asylum and migration procedures as well as the democratic gap that these provisions created in the different member states, as a crystal clear example of how a national competence became supranational. Furthermore , it illustrates the refugee profile, as a human being with acquired human rights through the theories of H. Arendt and the U. Beck. Lastly, the cosmopolitan approach is suggested in order to overcome the refugee crisis but a well-established integration should be the long term goal of Europe.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is this presumption that I wish to address. This paper will assert that the citizen is no longer at the heart of the democratic process. Using the example of the UK, I will argue that this is a consequence of the representative nature of liberal democracy which concep-tualises citizenship as a legal status, giving citizens protection of the law rather than participating in its formulation or execution as in the civic republican model. Liberal democracy not only eschews greater political participation, it does not prepare citizens for it. There currently exists a democratic deficit at local and national level which is leading to a decline in active citizenship. Therefore any attempt to democratise globalisation without addressing the weakening of national democracies will simply lead to the current political elites populating new 'democratic' structures. With this in mind I will counter arguments utilised to discredit the civic republican model of democracy. I will argue that in England the present educational system, predicated upon a narrow skills-based agenda premised upon an economic rationale, is undermining democracy by not preparing the citizenry for active political participation or to critique governance. In addition, policy changes in England are leading to the commodification of education which will undermine its social purpose and inter alia democracy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 2, Sovereign Borders: The Militarisation of Asylum Seeker Discourses in Australian Television News Media, by Leicha Stewartby Glocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and Innovation and Leicha StewartWhile the democratic paradigm of governance and its constituent political processes are well esta... more While the democratic paradigm of governance and its constituent political processes are well established in Australia, consistently negative media representations of people seeking asylum may be viewed as justification for institutional decisions allowing continued punitive treatment of people seeking asylum on Australian shores. Historically, notions of Australian sovereignty exist as a changing discourse with reference to land claims and the Australian Indigenous population (O'Dowd 2011; Due 2008). However, in terms of contemporary political claims about Australia's need to enforce border protection policies , notions of sovereignty are consistently framed through the themes, images and language of military discourses. Media scholar, John Street suggests that although there is disagreement about whether specific political outcomes can be attributed to press influence, the role of television in politics has been more comprehensively established as shaping broader world views in regards to ideas, values and practices that are considered 'common-sense' (Street 2011; Craig 2013). This paper argues that the increasing role of the military in the treatment and processing of people seeking asylum may be justified, through repetitive negative media representations of asylum seekers which secures public support for such practices, thereby undermining the very principles of the democratic paradigm, and indeed the role of the media or 'fourth estate'(Schultz 1998) in a functioning democracy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 2, Old Dilemmas Renewed: Fear of Freedom vs. Freedom from Fear, by Aleksandra Gruszczykby Glocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and Innovation and Aleksandra  GruszczykContemporary societies are currently subjected to very rapid and radical social changes and, as a... more Contemporary societies are currently subjected to very rapid and radical social changes and, as a consequence, struggle with their outcomes. The results range from the unforeseen repercussions of globally shifting political powers, through rising nationalisms, to prolonged economic, environmental, political and humanitarian crises. Critical analysis of the theories focused on the phenomena of authoritarianism, escapism, political myth, and conformity allows for outlining a comprehensive picture of the universally recognized opposition between freedom and security. From the distinction between the positive and negative freedom to the ambiguity surrounding the concept of " freedom from fear " , the fundamental dilemma is viewed from a historical perspective and illustrated with modern examples, emphasizing its current validity, insightfulness and potential in analyzing contemporary global problems. This approach allows for in-depth analyses of diversified social and political issues, such as the North African-European refugee crisis, rising nationalisms in the Western world, or a marked shift in political and social perspectives worldwide, from modern escapism to the birth of new myths of state.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 2, Jostling for Position: The Future of Regional Power-Sharing and the Role of the Pacific Islands Forum, by Kylie Evans-Lockeby Glocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and Innovation and Kylie Evans-LockeThe Pacific Islands Forum has long held the title of the most dominant regional association with ... more The Pacific Islands Forum has long held the title of the most dominant regional association with links in trade, politics and regional security. Following two political coups in the region the PIF was forced to shift its approach to regional governance opting for a more active and hands-on role with its first such mission being the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The role undertaken by the PIF within RAMSI is noteworthy for its shifts and changes with an initially minimalist role morphed into an intermediary role as tensions rose between the major funding donor, Australia, and the host state, Solomon Islands in 2006-07. Although the PIF acted in a mediator role in this instance this has not been the normal role for the institution. This article examines the role the PIF has adopted in managing regional democratic stability through targeted development activities, whether their adopted role is applicable on a wider regional-level scale, and further, through examining key human-security related challenges, such as climate change, where the PIF fits into regional power-sharing institutions in the Pacific Islands of the future .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 2, Foucault Comes to Bakur: Sovereign Power and Collective Punishment, by Mümtaz Murat KökThe Solution Process in Turkey has come to an abrupt end and along with it came an unprecedented ... more The Solution Process in Turkey has come to an abrupt end and along with it came an unprecedented violence in Bakur (Northern Kurdistan). This paper argues that the violence ravaging the region – especially in those areas where curfews have been declared – can be considered as a practice of punishment that is being employed indiscriminately. In line with this thought, the paper adopts a Foucauldian approach for comprehending the motivations behind the practice of collective punishment. In doing so, the paper revolves around the concepts of sovereign power and punishment introduced and argued by Michel Foucault. The paper argues that success of a pro-Kurdish party (HDP) in June 7 elections and following declarations of self-rule in the region constituted an obstacle in Erdoğan's desire for presidency but more importantly he took it as an act of dissent to his sovereign will. As can be seen in the functioning of sovereign power, he therefore punishes those people who are HDP's main constituent while making an example out of them for potential challengers to his sovereign will.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, there is a lingering controversy over the proper us of the outputs from such studies to benefit anti-corruption efforts. Against this backdrop, these paper reviews the theoretical context of the perception studies of corruption and their justifications. It examined key perception studies of corruption at the global, regional and national levels in relation to Nige-ria and discusses key issues associated with them. These include controversies around the definition of corruption, methodological issues such as the reliability of the perception approach to the study of corruption, possibilities of cross country comparisons, the connections between global, regional and local anticorruption studies and the issue of how such studies and rankings reflect power relations. The paper argues that perception studies will be significant and effective to the extent that elites and government officials continue to take the opinion and perception of citizens and other stakeholders seriously.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Utilising the documentary research approach, the paper will first explore the main economic disputes which were manifested in two rounds of the United States-European Community Consultation in 1970 and 1972. Then, it will investigate the divergence between the United States and the European Community in their policy stances on energy and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War which together constituted the major political disputes between the two sides. With these economic and political disputes, the years 1969-1974 witnessed a difficult phase of the United States-the European Community relations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 1, The road to liberating citizens while governing the urban areas. The tale of two cities: Cairo and Buenos Aires, by Azza Sirry and Sandra BustamanteThe relation between the political agenda, the social and economic policies, and urban planning a... more The relation between the political agenda, the social and economic policies, and urban planning and fabric of cities as a product cannot be missed. And as cities are centres of national economic growth and given that the future of the world will be urban it is thus ironic that the majority of the population of almost all cities in almost all developing countries lives in houses that are below standards, in areas that lack services and basic infrastructure. Furthermore, the people who live in these areas suffer from high present of socioeconomic problems such as unemployment and literacy. The poorest of the population have to pay more for their houses, service and infrastructure provision. And they lack access to formal credit and thus to opportunities (Sirry 2004). The cities have become places of frustration instead of places of hope and opportunities. It is not thus surprising that the world is witnessing a wave of upheavals all over its' cities. In the two case studies the article will try to discuss the background of the country and the political, social, and economic conditions and the physical outcome that is manifested in the image of its cities specially the capital city and how can the change towards democracy help the country, its cities and the urban population. The period covered is called by many the contemporary period, it starts in 50's in Egypt and 70's in Argentine.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Modern communication network now relies on the internet using the computer and mobile telephones. In fact, there is no place to hide with the internet and the handy smart phones with which calls are made and pictures and videos recorded and transmitted across boundaries and continents.The advancements in the computer and internet systems in the last decade of the 20th century produced radical changes in both internet connectivity and features available to users through which people are linked across the globe. The three most basic of these internet features that have radically shaped modern communication are, Facebook, Twitters, and the U-Tube, among others. The three are the most popular and core elements of the social media compartment of our modern internet system. Computer technology has broken the boundaries of closed societies and systems, making actions and activities in such systems open and available to the wider world. Through the internet and its core elements, repressive regimes have been exposed and activities going on in liberal societies are shared. Interestingly, Africa became the starting point for the agitation for political change, which was bolstered by the social media.The so-called “Arab Spring”, which first started in Africa through expositions of social media, saw the dismantling of three despotic and ruthless regimes in Arab North Africa, thus giving vent to agitations for an end to dictatorship and illiberality in other Arab states. The paper will examine the role of the social media in political transformation and change of dictatorial regimes in Africa and the consequences such would have on the overall political template of Africa.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These alternatives allow for groups to create their own dialogues that can then be used to change the direction of the larger discussion. While the Internet seems to be the perfect tool for these alternative dialogues to be created, the feasibility of using the Internet to take the next step into mainstream dialogue remains unclear. The black blogosphere is one alternative information stream pushing back. This chapter examines the way in which the black blogosphere discusses news stories and offers alternatives to the mainstream discourse, and why it is crucial that these alternative public spheres are available.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
GJ #2016, 1, Internet and Social Media’s Social Movements Leading to New Forms of Governance and Policymaking: Cases from India, by Esha Sen MadhavanJust as internet has touched and transformed every aspect of human life in present times, its sig... more Just as internet has touched and transformed every aspect of human life in present times, its significant effects on the realms of politics and governance is captured in this essay through some real world events like the social movements. Internet and social media have given new strength to social activism and in the process have laid the path for a new form of govern-ance model – open, consultative and inclusive. India has witnessed social movements that have resulted in significant policy related decision making. In the recent times, such social movements have gained much of its momentum through internet and social media. In this essay, three social movements from India are compared and analysed through case study research in order to draw attention to the growing prevalence of a new form of open consultative policy making process that is both leading to a learning experience for the networked society and also creating newer responsibilities for citizens. The three social movements analysed are the Right to Information Act movement (2005); the India Against Corruption movement (2011); and the Net neutrality movement (2015). The case studies are analysed in terms of their unique features of fostering deliberative democracy under the possible influence of internet and social media. The case studies generate data that could be used to study similar practices with a global comparative perspective.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
