AI at
            the edge
AI is pervasive today, from consumer to enterprise applications.
              With the explosive growth of connected devices, combined with a
              demand for privacy/confidentiality, low latency, and bandwidth
              constraints, AI models trained in the cloud increasingly need to
              be run at the edge. Edge TPU is Google’s purpose-built ASIC
              designed to run AI at the edge. It delivers high performance in a
              small physical and power footprint, enabling the deployment of
              high-accuracy AI at the edge.

                  End-to-end AI infrastructure
Edge TPU complements Cloud TPU and Google Cloud services to
                    provide an end-to-end, cloud-to-edge, hardware + software
                    infrastructure for facilitating the deployment of customers'
                    AI-based solutions.
                  High performance in a small physical and power footprint
Thanks to its performance, small footprint, and low power,
                    Edge TPU enables the broad deployment of high-quality AI at
                    the edge.
                  Co-design of AI hardware, software and algorithms
Edge TPU isn't just a hardware solution, it combines custom
                    hardware, open software, and state-of-the-art AI algorithms
                    to provide high-quality, easy to deploy AI solutions for the
                    edge.
A
                  broad range of applications
Edge TPU can be used for a growing number of industrial
                    use-cases such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection,
                    machine vision, robotics, voice recognition, and many more.
                    It can be used in manufacturing, on-premises, healthcare,
                    retail, smart spaces, transportation, etc.
 An open, end-to-end
                  infrastructure for deploying AI solutions 
Edge TPU allows you to deploy high-quality ML inferencing
                    at the edge, using various prototyping and production
                    products from
                    Coral.
                  
The Coral platform for ML at the edge augments Google's
                    Cloud TPU and Cloud IoT to provide an end-to-end
                    (cloud-to-edge, hardware + software) infrastructure to
                    facilitate the deployment of customers' AI-based solutions.
                    In addition to its open-source TensorFlow Lite programming
                    environment, the Coral platform provides a complete
                    developer toolkit so you can compile your own models or
                    retrain several Google AI models for the Edge TPU, combining
                    Google's expertise in both AI and hardware.
Edge TPU complements CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other ASIC
                    solutions for running AI at the edge.
Infrastructure that
                      works with you
By
                      connecting edge tools with Google Cloud, you can deploy
                      solutions that can bridge the functionality of the cloud
                      with the availability of edge computing.
 Edge TPU features 
This ASIC is the first step in a road map that will
                    leverage Google's AI expertise to follow and reflect in
                    hardware the rapid evolution of AI.
