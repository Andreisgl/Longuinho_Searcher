This siricid woodwasp is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa where it is considered to a secondary colonizer of conifer trees. However, it is a primary colonizer of conifer trees in its non-native zone in the Southern Hemisphere. Sirex noctilio is a polyphagous woodwasp with a wide host range, mainly in commercially important pine species and occasionally on larch, fir, and spruce. Sirex noctilio kills trees ...Download Free PDFView PDFNewsl. Mich. Entomol. SocChicago joins New York in battle with the Asian longhorned beetle1998 • Robert Haack...
