Да бисмо то постигли нису довољни само ентузијазам и прегалаштво уредништва, па ни финансијска подршка коју од Министарства културе свакако очекујемо. Најважније је да сви ми, цела наша струка, овај часопис доживимо као место на коме ће се од сад лако пронаћи шта је у претходном периоду рађено, и да не чекамо да сам од себе заживи, јер заживеће једино захваљујући нашим стручним прилозима.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersРимске игре на табли у Сингидунуму и околини / Roman Board Games in Singidunum and Its EnvironsMarko A. JankovićThe first discovery of dice was made accidentally in 1908 during the construction of Belgrade’s telephone switch building, and the last one in 2008. The century-long exploration of ancient Singidunum has uncovered sixteen finds that can be associated with board games. The body of finds is not large but it is illustrative enough because the finds come from different archaeological contexts. A problem in making a catalogue of this type of finds is the unpublished material. Counters, boards and dice have not been attractive enough for researchers and most are referred to only cursorily. The finds have been referred to as items in collections in MA and PhD theses dealing with a particular kind of finds, or as items in exhibition catalogues. Texts specifically discussing this theme are few. The finds cover the period of the 1st to 4th centuries, or the period of Roman rule. The finds of dice, counters and boards from Singidunum and its environs should be looked at in the context of a larger whole, the Roman Empire, rather than in isolation. Such finds do not occur before the Roman conquest of what was to become the province of Moesia. The popularity of board games is evidenced by 223 published finds from more than forty sites across Serbia. Most finds from Singidunum come from civilian contexts. Whether recovered from dump pits or from hearths, what they have in common is that they were discarded while still “in circulation”; which is a probable explanation for the isolated discoveries. A similar example has been registered on Sirmium’s Site 80 (city’s dump yard), which yielded four discarded counters, or Site 44, where a counter was discovered in the dump pit of a bone-carving workshop. The site at 9 Studentski Trg yielded an inscribed bone counter such as found across the Roman Empire, but the only such piece known from Serbia. Its importance resides in the fact that it is the only piece found on the floor of a house, meaning that it had been in use before the house was abandoned. The finds from burials constitute the largest group of such finds from Moesia. Of 223 finds, 157 come from burials, which accounts for 70% of the total number. As they were found on sites all over Moesia, there does not seem to be a pattern relating them to any particular funeral rite, or to the social or ethnic background, age or sex of the deceased. Counters and dice were found in brick-built graves (Singidunum: 28, Majke Jevrosime St; Niš), in leaden sarcophagi (Singidunum: 47, Kosovska St; Viminacium) and in cremation burials (Viminacium). In the cases where the age and sex of the deceased could be determined (Viminacium), it turned out that they were equally distributed between adults and children of both sexes. No pattern in the grave goods seems to be recognizable, i.e. the finds of dice and counters do not occur in association with any particular type of finds. There are several explanations for the presence of counters and dice in funerary contexts. One of them refers to Stoic philosophy with its view of the world as a board game of chance, with humans being mere gaming pieces and the dice, thrown by someone else, deciding the outcome of the game beyond their influence. Others relate the magical properties of dice to the cult of Venus Funeraria. Just as gamers in this world needed Venus’ sympathy, so the dwellers of the Underworld needed the sympathy of Venus Funeraria. It is well known that the best throw of dice, two or three sixes depending on the number of dice, is known as the Venus throw. In his analysis of the contents of some of Viminacium’s graves, A. Jovanović observes that the dice do not occur in association with other types of finds relatable to the cult of Venus such as dolphins, shells, pins with heads in the form of Venus’ bust. In the discussion about the symbolism of the finds, a certain distinction is made between the finds from burials and those from other contexts. The finds from thermae, taverns, houses and fortresses are interpreted as elements of the game set, and the dice and counters from burials are interpreted as elements of the rite related to the funeral and to the deceased, whether seen as the deceased’s self-interpretation or as an expression of the living relatives’ beliefs. The isolated finds of counters and dice in most graves would suggest the expression of beliefs, where a single counter or die is enough to convey a message as a substitute for the whole set. On the other hand, it would be logical to expect a larger number of finds in civilian or military buildings. The situation is quite the opposite. A tomb in Niš yielded almost the whole game set (only the board is missing, although a wooden one should not be ruled out), while an unpublished grave at Viminacium contained as many as 59 counters made of different materials. These instances stand in stark contrast to most cases from civilian and military buildings where no more than three dice or counters are found in association. The finds of board games, which are associated with leisure time, departs from anything known so far in the archaeological literature dealing with Roman society. The subject of this paper may seem flippant or even unnecessary, but any belittlement of such finds takes us a step farther from a comprehensive picture of the society that produced them. Leisure time is a little known aspect of Roman everyday life and our knowledge amounts to written sources created at different times and on different occasions. Therefore the body of such finds is a useful basis for exploring this aspect of Roman everyday life. The intellectual nature of board games, their intricate rules and practising in different strata of society shed light on the importance the Romans attached to their leisure time. According to some historical sources, time spent playing board games was time well spent intellectually, and the skill was considered “cultural”, in some circles even desirable. By contrast, other chroniclers and poets of the Roman period considered it an immoral vice. Many sources referring to games, regardless of the way in which they deal with them, provide nothing more than the impression of the contemporaries. Understanding the concept of board games and associated activities (gambling, competition, creativity…) would contribute to a broader understanding of the ancient Romans leisure time and everyday life.Download Free PDFView PDFАрхеолошки ПРЕГЛЕД  н . с. 1 (2003) /Archaeological REPORTS n. s. 1 (2003)Srpsko Arheološko Društvo, Adam Crnobrnja, Milorad Ignjatović, Miljana  Radivojević, Vojislav Djordjević, Vera Bogosavljevic, Dejan BulicDownload Free PDFView PDFA Contribution to the Understanding of Hallstatt Burial Customs - Archaeobotanical Evidence from Tumuli 13 and 14 at the Site of Kaptol, near PozegaAntonela Barbir, Renata  ŠoštarićDownload Free PDFView PDFIStRAŽIVANJA tUMULA NA LJUBAčKOJ KOSI 2007.
