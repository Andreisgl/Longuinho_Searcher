After a brief summary of previous studies on Pliny the Elder’s language and style, we introduce L.A.S.L.A. statistical tools and methods. In the second part we apply these tools to compare syntactically Naturalis Historia II and Seneca’s Naturales Quaestiones VII, in order to highlight the main differences in the structure of the sentence, as well as pragmatic features which emerge on a statistical ground. In the last section, we proceed with a factorial correspondence analysis on a corpus of Latin texts, to show which texts are associated with Naturalis Historia II.Save to LibraryDownloadby Margherita Fantoli•  5  Pliny the Elder, Ancient Astronomy, Latin linguistics, Naturales QuaestionesHistoria w rzymskiej literaturze erudycyjnej.

This inter-imperial borderland betweenthe Roman Empire and the Arsacid and Sasanid Empires providedfertile ground for Roman geographical writers to articulate their ideasabout space, boundaries, and imperial power. By examining thesegeographical descriptions, Hamish Cameron shows how each authorconstructed an image of Mesopotamia in keeping with the goals andcontext of their own work, while collectively creating a vision ofMesopotamia as a borderland space of movement, inter-imperialtension, and global engagement.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hamish Cameron•  20  Historical Geography, Ancient borders and borderlands (Archaeology), Ancient Geography, StraboDruidic Rituals and Roman AdministratorsWhen the Early Imperial Roman writers imagined the cultural processes taking place in the newly-conquered Gaul, they frequently had recourse to a rhetoric that can appear strikingly similar to some later, colonial narratives of... moreWhen the Early Imperial Roman writers imagined the cultural processes taking place in the newly-conquered Gaul, they frequently had recourse to a rhetoric that can appear strikingly similar to some later, colonial narratives of civilizational improvement and the abolition of nefarious ritual life. I will focus on the possible local informants of those Romans who, according to our literary sources (e.g. Pliny, Suetonius), rooted out the Druidic rites from Gaul. How did a Roman administrator recognize the forbidden ‘Druidic’ parts of Gallic ritual life? Who acted as the subaltern middlemen for the Romans in this process, and did they have any influence on the direction of the Roman gaze? This paper seeks to explore whether we might be able to use colonial analogies, particularly from British India, to aid us in distinguishing the knowledge-generation practices of the Roman administrators in the Early Imperial religious ‘middle grounds’ of Gaul.Save to LibraryDownloadby Antti Lampinen•  19  Latin Literature, Postcolonial Studies, Colonialism, SubalternDe Arcágato a Galeno: los médicos griegos y la difusión de la Τέχνη Ἰατρική en el mundo romanoIn 3rd century BC, like a part of the global process of Hellenization of the Roman culture, Hippocratic medicine arrived to Rome.

Between year 219 BC, when is attested the first Greek physician in the city, and the 2nd century AD, when Galen of Pergamon developed a doctrine which laid the foundations of western medicine, a succession of medical professionals made possible the progressive importing and assimilation of Greek allopathy in italic soil. In this way, a foreign element turned into a characteristic and representative component of Roman culture. The aim of this paper is to analyze the socio-cultural features that characterized this process of scientific diffusion. To this end, we propose a combined study of literary and epigraphical sources that refers to physicians who made possible this development.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mª Ángeles Alonso-Alonso•  9  Classics, Roman History, Roman Republic, Galen"A New Painting of Calypso in Pliny the Elder," Eugesta 7 (2017) 184-198.In Book 35, chapters 147-148 of his Natural History, Pliny the Elder offers valuable information on female painters from the Greek and Roman worlds 2.

More than 9,000 pages and thirty volumes—here abridged to one volume, and translated into English for the first time—it contains entries on everything from medieval moon-worshipping cults, sexual aphrodisiacs, and the substance of clouds, to how to get the smell of alcohol off one’s breath, the deliciousness of cheese made from buffalo milk, and the nesting habits of flamingos. Similar works by Western authors, including Pliny’s Natural History, have been available in English for centuries. This groundbreaking translation of a remarkable Arabic text—expertly abridged and annotated—offers a look at the world through the highly literary and impressively knowledgeable societies of the classical Islamic world.

It synthesizes the accounts and opinions of numerous Graeco-Roman writers from the Augustan Age to late antiquity in order to help illustrate the new and interconnected post-Carrhae world and its legacy. The rivalry of the Romans and Parthians became a primary focus of their foreign policies and drastically expanded their perceptions of the world in which they interacted. Even after the fall of the Parthians to the rebellious Sassanid Persians in the 220s CE, the Romans continued to find their three-century-long rivalry with the Parthians of interest and relevant to the changing world of late antiquity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nikolaus L Overtoom•  290  History, Ancient History, European History, Military HistorySuspending Disbelief: Magnetic and Miraculous Levitation from Antiquity to the Middle AgesStatic levitation is a form of marvel with metaphysical implications whose long history has not previously been charted.

First, Pliny the Elder reports an architect's plan to suspend an iron statue using magnetism, and the later compiler Ampelius mentions a similar-sounding wonder in Syria. When the Serapeum at Alexandria was destroyed, and for many centuries afterwards, chroniclers wrote that an iron Helios had hung magnetically inside. In the Middle Ages, reports of such false miracles multiplied, appearing in Muslim accounts of Christian and Hindu idolatry, as well as Christian descriptions of the tomb of Muhammad. A Christian levitation miracle involving saints' relics also emerged. Yet magnetic suspension could be represented as miraculous in itself, representing lost higher knowledge, as in the latest and easternmost tradition concerning Konark's ruined temple. The levitating monument, first found in classical antiquity, has undergone many cultural and epistemological changes in its long and varied history.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dunstan Lowe•  21  Iconoclasm, Science Fiction, Augustine, Relics (Religion)παραπλήσιον ζωγράφων Save to LibraryDownloadby Pietro Maria Liuzzo•  7  Ancient History, Historiography, Ancient Greek History, Ancient Greek HistoriographyTársadalomkép Plinius Maior művében.

KEY WORDS: Pliny the Elder. The Fortunate Islands. Juba II nd of Mauretania. The Canary Islands in the Antiquity. Juba II de Mauritania, nacido el 52 a.C. en el seno de la familia imperial númida, fue hijo de Juba I, rey de Numidia, cuyo suicidio, tras la derrota a manos de Julio César en la batalla de Tapso el 46 a.C. (McDermott, 1969: 857), determi-nó que la infancia del joven príncipe se viera bruscamente interrumpida y cambia-se totalmente de escenario. Tras este acontecimiento, el reino de la Numidia se convirtió, en su mayor parte, en provincia imperial, y en Roma César tomó al niño Juba bajo su protec-ción y gracias a ello cultivó la amistad de Octaviano, que prosiguió amparando al joven príncipe desheredado después del asesinato de César y que le dio una gran confianza al llevarlo a algunas de sus campañas militares más exitosas (Dión Casio, LI, 15, 6). De esta manera, para recompensarle por la ayuda prestada, quizás, en Accio, y en la Guerra de los cántabros (Dión Casio, LIII, 26, 1), le otorgó, el 25 a.C., junto con las insignias de su reino, el gobierno de la Mauritania que él mismo había asegurado después de la muerte de Boco II el año 33 a.C., incluyéndolo en la esfe-ra administrativa romana bajo la autoridad de un prefecto ecuestre.Save to LibraryDownloadby Fortunatae Revista canaria de Filología, Cultura y Humanidades Clásicas•  5  Pliny the Elder, Canary Islands, Juba II, Islas CanariasCorinthian Bronze and the Gold of the AlchemistsAlloys that went under the name of Corinthian Bronze were highly prized in the Roman Empire at the beginning of the Christian era, when Corinthian Bronze was used to embellish the great gate of Herod's Temple in Jerusalem.

From the ancient texts it emerges that Corinthian Bronze was the name given to a family of copper alloys with gold and silver which were depletion gilded to give them a golden or silver lustre. An important centre of production appears to have been Egypt where, by tradition, alchemy had its origins. From an analysis of the earliest alchemical texts, it is suggested that the concept of transmutation of base metals into gold arose from the depletion gilding process.Save to LibraryDownloadby David Jacobson•  17  Plutarch, Roman Empire, Josephus, Pliny the ElderKereskedelem Róma és India között (Trade between Rome and India)Save to LibraryDownloadby Melinda Székely•  3  Pliny the Elder, Ancient Roman economy, trade and commerce, Roman Trade in the Indian OceanGandhara, Gandhara!

They agree that it was an alloy of copper, gold, and silver. Together they describe various stages in its manufacture-heat treatment, quenching, leaching, and burnishing. In addition, the Leiden papyrus X attests to a process of depletion gilding, whereby an alloy containing gold could acquire a golden surface hue. The process that can be pieced together from all these sources turns out to be essentially identical with that re- constructed by H. Lechtman and D.A. Scott for the tum- baga of the pre-Columbian cultures of South America. Experimental reconstruction produced a golden hue even in an alloy containing as little as 15% (by volume) of gold. Silver was found to be a necessary constituent for the gilding process. Some recent scholarship has suspected the accuracy of the ancient accounts, supposing instead that Corinthian bronze simply meant all bronze from Corinth, or alternatively a high-tin bronze invented in Corinth. In fact, however, Corinthian bronze was characterized by the admixture of precious metals and a special process of manufacture, exactly as specified in the ancient sources.Save to LibraryDownloadby David Jacobson•  12  Graeco-Roman Alexandria, Pliny the Elder, Pausanias, Ancient Metallurgy'Wine and oil presses in the Roman to Late Antique Near East and Mediterranean: Balancing textual and archaeological evidence'Substantial archaeological finds of Roman oil and wine installations have been uncovered in the Near East and analysed in detail by archaeologists, constituting a significant body of evidence for this important activity of the ancient... moreSubstantial archaeological finds of Roman oil and wine installations have been uncovered in the Near East and analysed in detail by archaeologists, constituting a significant body of evidence for this important activity of the ancient rural world.

Pliny’s famous description of druids culling the mistletoe from oaks fundamentally influenced the modern picture of Celtic religion. On the other hand the informations this text presents are far from being unproblematic as can be seen from the disonant opinions in scientific literature. This paper tries therefore to assess what actually can be yielded from Pliny’s testimony. Not only the wider context but also Pliny’s general attitude towards druids and Celtic religion are taken in consideration. Furthermore Pliny’s source(s), his botanic accuracy, and the single elements of the mistletoe rite are thoroughly examined.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andreas Hofeneder•  12  Ancient History, Botany, Classics, Celtic Studies"The Matter of Classical Art History", Daedalus, Spring 2016, "What's New About the Old?"Though foundational to the study of art history, Greco-Roman visual culture is often sidelined by the modern, and overshadowed by its own cultural and intellectual reception.

Recent scholarship, how- ever, has meticulously unpacked the discipline’s formative narratives, while building on archaeological and literary studies in order to locate its objects of analysis more precisely within the dynamic cultural frameworks that produced them, and that were in turn shaped by them. Focusing on a passage from Pliny the Elder’s Natural History (arguably the urtext of classical art history), this paper explores the perennial question of how the material stuff of antiquity can be most effectively yoked to the thinking and sensing bodies that inhabited it, arguing that closer attention to ancient engagements with materialism can alert us to models of image-making and viewing that are both conceptually and physically grounded in Greco- Roman practices of production, sense perception, and interpretation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Verity Platt•  4  Classics, Ancient Greek and Roman Art, Pliny the Elder, Classical Art and ArchaeologyRegio, chora, regioneIn this paper, I argue that the main legacy of the geography of Augustan Italy is the very construction of the concept of region.

The nature of region which I delineate is based on the dialectics between the ethics of regula, proper to regio, and the ethics of action/movement/change, proper to chora. Regio and chora are the two identities of region emerging respectively from Pliny’s and Strabo’s description of Italy.

Pour ce faire, nous avons jeté un regard double sur notre corpus : alors que notre plan a été essentiellement guidé par une enquête épistémologique abordant les grands thèmes de l’astronomie antique – autrement dit, le contenu –, notre analyse a été quant à elle davantage concentrée sur la forme, tant logique que rhétorique, de ces exposés.Nos analyses nous ont permis de mieux comprendre l’aspect didactique de toutes ces oeuvres, aussi diverses soient-elles quant à leur genre, en repérant un certain nombre de procédés littéraires qui leur étaient communs, parmi lesquels nous trouvons la triple mise en scène de l’homme qui observe les phénomènes célestes, de l’homme qui raisonne du ciel lui-même.Save to LibraryDownloadby Emilie-Jade Poliquin•  14  Latin Literature, History of Science, History of Astronomy, History of PhysicsHow does Pliny the Younger use language to portray his uncle as a hero in Epistle 6.16?An analysis of the language and techniques used by Pliny the Younger to depict his uncle as a hero, and in turn portray himself as equally fortunate in Epistle 6, a letter conveying their actions during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.... moreAn analysis of the language and techniques used by Pliny the Younger to depict his uncle as a hero, and in turn portray himself as equally fortunate in Epistle 6, a letter conveying  their actions during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  (2014)Save to LibraryDownloadby Laura  Kennelly Jarman•  4  Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Ancient Rome, Pliny's LettersSergio Bettini, "Ricerche sulla luce in architettura: Vitruvio e Alberti" [2011]Form and function of light in architecture between Antiquity and the Fifteenth Century, through the analysis of the texts of Pausanias, Vitruvius, Pliny the Elder, Julian of Ascalon, Isidore of Seville, Pius II Piccolomini, Leon Battista... moreForm and function of light in architecture between Antiquity and the Fifteenth Century, through the analysis of the texts of Pausanias, Vitruvius, Pliny the Elder, Julian of Ascalon, Isidore of Seville, Pius II Piccolomini, Leon Battista Alberti and Antonio Manetti.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sergio Bettini•  36  Renaissance Studies, Renaissance Humanism, Architectural History, Architectural Lighting"Histoire naturelle" de Pline l'Ancien, L'Histoire 432, janvier 2017Save to LibraryDownloadby Giusto Traina•  3  Latin Literature, Natural History, Pliny the ElderНовгородова Д.Д. «У Плиния и хризопраз не хризопраз, и топаз не топаз, и сапфир не сапфир»The article is devoted to the 37th book of the «Natural History» of Pliny the Elder, On Gems.

Various approaches to the interpretation andtranslation of Pliny’s names of gems and concepts associated with them are considered with references to works in geology and gemology, as well as to the first experience of academic translation of the last five books of «Natural History» (33–37) by academician V. M. Severgin (1819). Pliny's distribution of gems in groups is analyzed, a hypothesis is proposed about the meaning of the Latin adjective candidus in the gemmae candidae group of colored gems, as referring not to their color, but to some special optical properties known in modern gemology (asterism, irisation, opalescence, etc.). The influence of the 37th book of «Natural History» on the practices of collecting gems, including those preserved in modern mineralogical museums, is considered.Novgorodova D.

C., aunque la fecha es solo aproximada, podría ser incluso de finales del VI o principios del V a. C. En el mismo se halló un grafito con el inesperado nombre de un personaje que hasta el momento del hallazgo solo aparecía mencionado en copias medievales de los escritos de algunos autores griegos y romanos de la antigüedad clásica. El inesperado texto permitía leer el nombre de Argantonio, pero escrito de una manera algo extraña, lo que llevó a una doble lectura, y con ello, a la duda de si realmente se trataba del mismo célebre rey tartésico, Argantonio, citado por Anacreonte, Heródoto, Plinio y otros importantes autores de la antigüedad…Leer el resto del artículo en http://atlantisng.com/blog/argantonios-el-rey-de-tartessos-que-reino-durante-150-anos-en-un-ostracon-griego-contemporaneo/Save to LibraryDownloadby Georgeos Díaz-Montexano•  40  Macedonian, Herodotus, Pliny the Elder, History of Ancient Macedonia“Orphaned Objects: Pliny’s Natural History and the Phenomenology of the Incomplete,” Art History 41.3 (September 2018), 492–517, special edition on The Embodied Object in Classical Antiquity.In his Natural History, Pliny the Elder refers to a series of paintings left unfinished at the artist’s death.

These inperfectae tabulae are ‘held in greater admiration than their completed works’, for they display not only the final traces of each artist’s hand, but also his ‘very thoughts’. While Pliny’s comments have influenced notions of the non finito, less attention has been paid to their significance for his broader ethical and intellectual project. This essay attends to the facture and materiality of the objects that Pliny celebrates, as well as the subjects that they depict.Whilst conventional works are celebrated for their illusionism, the unfinished object offers a different model of viewing, in which the workings of ars are revealed by means of the traces of the artist’s body. Suspended in a state of coming-into-being, the inperfecta tabula invites both a temporal retracing of its own creation, and a connoisseurial fantasy of its imagined completion. Repeatedly returning to themes of parental loss, death, and aborted creativity, the discourse of the unfinished painting evokes culturaland biological bonds between parents and children that parallel the corporeal connection between the artist and his work.Save to LibraryDownloadby Verity Platt•  7  Classical Archaeology, Art History, Graeco-Roman Mosaics and Wall Paintings, Ancient Greek and Roman ArtMel maenomenon - różanecznikowy miód szaleńców (Mel maenomenon - the maddening honey of rhododendron.)Symbolika miodu w świecie grecko-rzymskim, pozornie dobrze znana, odsłania ostatnimi czasy swoje nowe znaczenia: jak się okazuje, starożytni znali miody z domieszkami i wykorzystywali je jako środki halucynogenne lub trucizny.

Gambari), complete with recourse to the Carabinieri force, a considerable expense by the Municipality, supervision by the Superintendency and trumpeting on national and foreign magazines by of another official of this   (F. Rubat Borel).  Its falsity is demonstrated, by the author, on the basis of geological and historical-environmental basis, as well as by the judgments of professional archaeologists, from which it emerges that it is an unreal reconstruction, a "stupidity".And this is just one of many such enterprises in the Biella region and beyond, by the same official.  For the Biella territory a some of them had already been highlighted, especially as regards the area of the Bessa Park (Roman gold mines): the disinformative tables, the alleged archaeological cupels of Zubiena, the alleged stele of Vermogno, the substantial funding for the restoration of the presumed Castelliere di Mongrando (locally defined as a monument to idiocy), the expenses for the abstruse highlighting of the double washing channel (defined by the author as another monument to idiocy). Then there is the story of the famous Elvo river pseudo-pirogue (better known as pirloga) which still hovers in the Biella Museum where it was replaced by a  pirogue of  the Bertignano lake, in a false torrential context set up for the presumed semi-finished Elvo pirogue (which is why the structure is still called the "pirloga museum"). Furthermore, ideological falsifications are not limited to the pirogue, and also there are material errors.And then there are the alleged Mazzé stele, the fantasies on Viverone Lake, the alleged remains of Roman gold mines in Ossola region, the mineralogical and mining bestialities on the Ticino ones, highlighted in part by the author, in part by other experts.However, the official has always been "covered" and strenuously defended by the reference body, the Superintendency, although this was well aware of his fantasies and errors: in fact, it has never published, in the specific newsletter, informations about the work of this official and the public money he used.The behavior is to be related to the last topic dealt, the "alleged presence of the Salassi peoples in the Biellese area and their exploitation of the Bessa gold mines".  From the documentation collected, it is more than evident that, in order to obtain remarkable funding from the Ministry, in 1987 the Superintendency, supported "scientifically" by the officials Brecciaroli Taborelli and Gambari, prepared a "package" full of speculations and inventions: it then continued to support the falsehoods, also through other officials, despite the contrary evidence reported and published by the author, and continues despite the recent archaeological finds that prove the contrary, that ones recognized by themselves, but falsely attributed to Gambari who had repeatedly claimed the opposite.  Consequently, the falsehoods of the officials are accepted by many unconscious authors, Italian and foreign, confident of the authority of the Superintendency, as well as by professional archaeologists and university professors, forced by arrogant bureaucrats, less prepared than they, to prostitute themselves, morally and intellectually, to be able to operate in Italy. Some examples, shown in the article illustrate the issue.With the public administration reform underway, which would like to introduce merit as a basis for assessing the career of public officials, our Superintendency is stubbornly opposed and would like to silence the past management and even beatify its recently deceased official.Save to LibraryDownloadby giuseppe pipino•  16  Archaeology, Roman History, Celtic Studies, Megaliths (Archaeology)La raffigurazione del delta del Po nella "Tabula Peutingeriana"Save to LibraryDownloadby Alberto Andreoli•  20  Historical Geography, History and Classical tradition studies, History of Cartography, Medieval CartographyGaius Plinius Secundus d.
