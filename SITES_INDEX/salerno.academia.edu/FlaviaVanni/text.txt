Flavia VanniUniversity of Salerno,  Dipartimento di Scienze del Patrimonio Culturale/DISPAC,  Post-DocSTORIA DELL'ARTE+14Currently researcher at Università degli Studi di Salerno woking on an outreach project to make accessible to blind and visually impaired visitors the wall painting so the church of St Ambrogio at Montecorvino Rovella. Progetto 'Accessibilità e inclusività per il patrimonio culturale della Campania' I am interested in stucco (and moulded plaster) decorations both from the artistic point of view (iconography and technique), and as 'ephemeral' material which offers an insight into economic history (élite and non-élite customer demand), as well as the history of guilds and workshops. Another line of enquiry is the manipulation of natural light through sculpture.

This topic is worth discussion in the context of the examination of ‘global Byzantium’ because of the Byzantine influence that some scholars attribute to these buildings. While the analysis of style has been used to suggest a Byzantine cultural milieu, the chemical composition of the stucco mixture was sometimes interpreted as a proof for the presence of artisans from Islamic territories. Through the analysis of modelling, casting and fixing stucco, this chapter argues that the artisans active in Cividale and Brescia were local, trained in an artistic environment that was permeated with the legacy of Late Antique culture which was following, at this stage, a similar path as in the Byzantine empire before moving to a different direction in the following centuries.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Gli stucchi mediobizantini invece non hanno goduto di particolare fortuna critica né tantomeno di studi sistematici. È lecito dunque chiedersi se tale situazione derivi dall’effettiva scarsità di testimonianze, o piuttosto dallo stato frammentario delle conoscenze.In questa sede, verranno presentati i preliminari risultati di un censimento degli stucchi medio-bizantini ristretto, per il momento, all’area della penisola balcanica che mostra come lo stucco fosse un materiale frequentemente utilizzato all’interno degli edifici bizantini fra l’843 e il 1204. Tuttavia tali testimonianze sono state pubblicate, perlopiù, in monografie su singoli monumenti, o in studi sulla scultura di specifiche regioni, mentre raramente sono state oggetto di studi specialistici . Di conseguenza, non sono rimaste inedite, ma non sono state neanche valutate adeguatamente nella loro peculiarità e nel loro contesto di appartenenza. Riconoscere la loro peculiarità non significa isolarle dal resto del programma decorativo cui esse necessariamente appartengono, ma è tuttavia premessa indispensabile per la comprensione del ruolo che svolgevano all’interno di tale programma e per il modo in cui esse erano percepite ed utilizzate da maestranze e committenti.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It brings together the results of disparate studies, with new material and textual evidence, to write, for the first time, a coherent narrative of the history of Byzantine stucco during the Middle and the Late Byzantine periods. This thesis demonstrates the uninterrupted use of stucco in Byzantine architecture from the Late Antique period onwards. It sheds light on the techniques used by Byzantine artisans to work stucco and examines their social and legal status in Byzantine society, providing a nuanced vision of both the skills and incomes of people in this period. A wide range of Byzantine patrons chose to decorate their buildings with stucco: from emperors to local officers and ordinary people. They used stucco to convey statements of authority or to underline their participation in networks of power. After having analysed stucco in Byzantine society, the thesis turns to wider Mediterranean stucco production, and examines differences and commonalities between Byzantine stucco and that produced in Medieval Italy and the different regions under Islamic reigns.This thesis is an initial framework. This framework is threefold: the single building, the broader context of Byzantine art, and the stucco production in the Mediterranean. The case-by- case approach used revealed how the study of stucco, in combination with the rest of the materials used in architecture, is crucial to understand the history of buildings and the communities behind them. It is the interaction between micro and macro contexts that provides the core for understanding stucco in Byzantine architecture. This interaction is also what makes stucco a diagnostic material, which provides us with a new insight into Byzantine architecture.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Quest’ultima, infatti, rivestiva un ruolo visivo fondamentale che consisteva nel direzionare lo sguardo del fedele verso il fulcro del programma teologico nell’abside, come dimostrato da Leal.Questo paper si concentra su un aspetto della decorazione aniconica: la porta dipinta sulla parete nord che si contrappone all’ingresso sul lato meridionale (fig.1).La porta è l’unico elemento che interrompe l’opus sectile dipinto (fig. 2). Le analisi multispettrali condotte da Gheroldi e Marazzani (Kos Arte-indagine) hanno mostrato l’uso di pigmenti oleosi per alcuni dettagli della porta. Questo aspetto tecnico è stato rilevato per l’abside ma non per il resto delle pitture aniconiche della navata. La porta dipinta è inoltre parzialmente in asse con una tomba sul lato settentrionale esterno all’edificio e potrebbe essere un'ulteriore prova del significato funerario della porta dipinta. È tuttavia interessante notare che i confronti iconografici più stretti si rilevano in sarcofagi romani e nelle pitture catacombali, ma non in contesti altomedievali.Questo paper intende contestualizzare la porta dipinta nel quadro della tradizione classica e tardoantica, ed esplorare la materialità che la porta evoca attraverso i riferimenti formali a porte tardo antiche e altomedievali.ENThe Church of Sant’Ambrogio at Montecorvino Rovella (SA), excavated and studied in the 1980s, since July 2017 has been the focus of two study campaigns of the project ‘At the Crossroads ofEmpires’ (Università di Salerno-University of Birmingham).While the ninth-century paintings in the apse (the Virgin and the saints) have benefitted from several studies, the aniconic decoration did not benefit of in-depth studies. The latter, as recently stressed by Leal, had a significant visual role in Sant’Ambrogio surrounding the medieval viewer at eye-level, and leaving the core of the theological message in the apse.This paper focuses on an aspect of the aniconic decoration of Sant’Ambrogio that requires further consideration: the panelled door painted on the north wall, opposite the doorway (fig. 1).The door is the only element which interrupts the painted opus sectile of the nave (fig. 2). The multispectral analysis carried out by Gheroldi and Marazzani (Kos Arte-indagine) shows details traced with oily based pigments, a technical aspect which have not been found in the painted opus sectile in the nave, but only in the apse. Since a tomb is laid against the exterior of the northern wall, in partial correspondence with the painted door, the latter may be an indicator of the funerary aspect of the church. Iconographic comparisons can be found on Roman sarcophagi and Late Antique catacombs but not in Early Medieval contexts.This paper contextualises the iconography of the painted door of Sant’Ambrogio in the frame of the Classical and Late Antique tradition, and explores the materiality evoked by the door through its formal references to Late Antique and Early Medieval wooden and metallic doors.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

‘Byzantine attitudes towards the Past. Restorations and plaster reliefs’. The Oxford University Byzantine Society’s XXI International Graduate Conference, Contested Heritage: Αdaptation, Restoration, and Ιnnovation in the Late Antique and Byzantine World (22-23 February 2019)This paper examines Byzantine attitudes towards the past and architectural heritage through a non... more This paper examines Byzantine attitudes towards the past and architectural heritage through a non-conventional category of material: plaster reliefs. Decorations made of carved or moulded plaster were frequently used in Middle and Late Byzantine buildings, as my PhD research demonstrates. Plaster/stucco reliefs are, in fact, attested in more than forty buildings dated between the tenth and fourteenth centuries, in a territory extended from Greece and the Balkans to Anatolia. In this paper I will present some case studies which show that stucco was used for restoring ancient architectural sculptures, as in the Panagia church at Hosios Loukas (tenth century), and for creating new decorations in open competition with the contemporary sculptural products, as in the Panagia Kosmosoteria in Feres (1152). Stucco was considered to be part of the past that needed to be preserved, as the fourteenth-century restorations in the Protaton church and of the Vatopedi katholikon (Mount Athos) show. Finally, proskynetaria frames made of stucco were part of the templon composed of marble spolia for the Peribleptos church in Mistra (1365-1374). This raises the question whether the proskynetaria were Middle Byzantine spolia too (Louvi 1980) or whether their style was intentionally imitating the more recent past (Grabar 1976). The so-called ‘ephemeral’ materials, such as stucco, offer us a unique and dynamic perspective towards Byzantine attitudes to their cultural heritage (from  a sort of philological reconstruction to appropriation and reinterpretation). Long-lasting materials, such as marble and stone, were not the only media worthy to be transmitted or adapted to posterity and they were, indeed, charged with ideological messages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
‘Between painting and sculpture: stucco decorations in Byzantine architecture’. Midlands3Cities Research Festival 2018. Maple House (Birmingham), 24th May 2018The fame of Byzantine artisans was widespread in the Mediterranean world: rulers, clergymen and a... more The fame of Byzantine artisans was widespread in the Mediterranean world: rulers, clergymen and aristocrats called from Constantinople mosaicists, sculptors and blacksmiths for working in the Islamic and Christian territories. Some written sources list professions including stucco workers. They seem to point the existence of strict boundaries between professions; however, material evidence shows that such boundaries were easily crossed. My PhD thesis engages with techniques exchanges analysing the decoration made of stucco in Byzantine buildings. This material is suitable for the creation of reliefs which imitated marble sculptures as well as the haloes of painted figures. Is not always easy to distinguish whether stucco was worked by sculptors or by painters. In this presentation, I will address this issue through the evaluation of cornices of wall painted icons, a category of artefacts that can be both considered part of the sculptural as well as of the painted decoration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Questo aspetto tecnico è stato rilevato per l’abside ma non per il resto delle pitture aniconiche della navata. La porta dipinta è inoltre parzialmente in asse con una tomba sul lato settentrionale esterno all’edificio e potrebbe essere un'ulteriore prova del significato funerario della porta dipinta. È tuttavia interessante notare che i confronti iconografici più stretti si rilevano in sarcofagi romani e nelle pitture catacombali, ma non in contesti altomedievali.Questo paper intende contestualizzare la porta dipinta nel quadro della tradizione classica e tardoantica, ed esplorare la materialità che la porta evoca attraverso i riferimenti formali a porte tardo antiche e altomedievali.ENThe Church of Sant’Ambrogio at Montecorvino Rovella (SA), excavated and studied in the 1980s, since July 2017 has been the focus of two study campaigns of the project ‘At the Crossroads ofEmpires’ (Università di Salerno-University of Birmingham).While the ninth-century paintings in the apse (the Virgin and the saints) have benefitted from several studies, the aniconic decoration did not benefit of in-depth studies. The latter, as recently stressed by Leal, had a significant visual role in Sant’Ambrogio surrounding the medieval viewer at eye-level, and leaving the core of the theological message in the apse.This paper focuses on an aspect of the aniconic decoration of Sant’Ambrogio that requires further consideration: the panelled door painted on the north wall, opposite the doorway (fig. 1).The door is the only element which interrupts the painted opus sectile of the nave (fig. 2). The multispectral analysis carried out by Gheroldi and Marazzani (Kos Arte-indagine) shows details traced with oily based pigments, a technical aspect which have not been found in the painted opus sectile in the nave, but only in the apse. Since a tomb is laid against the exterior of the northern wall, in partial correspondence with the painted door, the latter may be an indicator of the funerary aspect of the church. Iconographic comparisons can be found on Roman sarcophagi and Late Antique catacombs but not in Early Medieval contexts.This paper contextualises the iconography of the painted door of Sant’Ambrogio in the frame of the Classical and Late Antique tradition, and explores the materiality evoked by the door through its formal references to Late Antique and Early Medieval wooden and metallic doors.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Decorations made of carved or moulded plaster were frequently used in Middle and Late Byzantine buildings, as my PhD research demonstrates. Plaster/stucco reliefs are, in fact, attested in more than forty buildings dated between the tenth and fourteenth centuries, in a territory extended from Greece and the Balkans to Anatolia. In this paper I will present some case studies which show that stucco was used for restoring ancient architectural sculptures, as in the Panagia church at Hosios Loukas (tenth century), and for creating new decorations in open competition with the contemporary sculptural products, as in the Panagia Kosmosoteria in Feres (1152). Stucco was considered to be part of the past that needed to be preserved, as the fourteenth-century restorations in the Protaton church and of the Vatopedi katholikon (Mount Athos) show. Finally, proskynetaria frames made of stucco were part of the templon composed of marble spolia for the Peribleptos church in Mistra (1365-1374). This raises the question whether the proskynetaria were Middle Byzantine spolia too (Louvi 1980) or whether their style was intentionally imitating the more recent past (Grabar 1976). The so-called ‘ephemeral’ materials, such as stucco, offer us a unique and dynamic perspective towards Byzantine attitudes to their cultural heritage (from  a sort of philological reconstruction to appropriation and reinterpretation). Long-lasting materials, such as marble and stone, were not the only media worthy to be transmitted or adapted to posterity and they were, indeed, charged with ideological messages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Some written sources list professions including stucco workers. They seem to point the existence of strict boundaries between professions; however, material evidence shows that such boundaries were easily crossed. My PhD thesis engages with techniques exchanges analysing the decoration made of stucco in Byzantine buildings. This material is suitable for the creation of reliefs which imitated marble sculptures as well as the haloes of painted figures. Is not always easy to distinguish whether stucco was worked by sculptors or by painters. In this presentation, I will address this issue through the evaluation of cornices of wall painted icons, a category of artefacts that can be both considered part of the sculptural as well as of the painted decoration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Transferring skills and techniques across the Mediterranean: some preliminary remarks on stucco in Italy and Byzantium', free-communication at Global Byzantium.

Artistic exchanges across the Mediterranean can be seen through the direct contribution of Byzantine artisans and through the circulation of Byzantine iconographies, models, and technical traditions then absorbed and used by local artisans. This paper will explore these interactions from a particular perspective: the manufacturing of stucco. Stucco was a material both used in Byzantine territories and in the Early Medieval and Medieval Europe. Some well-known Italian Early Medieval examples, such as the church of Santa Maria in Valle at Cividale del Friuli, and the church of San Salvatore in Brescia were claimed to show an ‘Eastern’ influence and considered to be made by byzantine or ‘Syriac’ artisans. A recent study of David Knipp (2012) about the fragmentary stucco cornices of Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome has suggested that Coptic artisans, active in Rome during the second half of the sixth century, were probably the authors of these stucco elements. In this paper, Italian examples of the eight till the eleventh century will be presented and compared to the existing stuccoes preserved into buildings of Byzantine territories. This comparison will be carried out considering manufacturing and technique process, chemical composition and decorative patterns in order to evaluate whether it is possible to identify a direct action of Byzantine artisans in Italy or not. The mobility of artisans across the Mediterranean is well attested, but how much were Byzantine stucco artisans global?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The lack of material evidence and its ephemeral nature could give the impression that stucco was not frequently used. However, a considerable number of churches show such decorations. In some cases, there is a double presence of both stucco and marble sculptural decoration that lead us to think about craftsmen and about building-site organization.There was a specific production of stucco mouldings or sculptures? Were artisans who worked stucco specialized craftsmen? This paper focuses on passages from written sources of the Middle Byzantine period that provide glimpses of the artisans who worked gypsum and stucco within their contemporary society and allow us to visualize their artefacts.“Human forms made of stucco” were current in the houses of the élites: Theodore Balsamon, in his Commentary of the Council in Trullo (12th century), complains about the “immoral practice” of decorating walls with indecorous scenes in stucco. In addition, people who ‘had to do’ with gypsum and stucco are mentioned in Regulation books, such as the Book of the Eparch, in the Life of Saint Lazarus, in some Lexika and, incidentally, in some passages of the Church Fathers. The emerging blurry picture induces a reflection on the value of written sources for visualizing Byzantine art and for understanding Byzantine artistic culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Stucco was also very widespread in Islamic art and, in addition, in Western art. Is it possible to see connections between the Byzantine stucco 'products' and those of Islamic and Western European culture? Can Byzantine stucco show relations and connections between the different cultures of the Mediterranean? In order to answer this question, I will analyse and compare Byzantine stuccoes of the 11th and 12th century with stuccoes from Southern Italy dated between the late 11th and 12th century. This comparison shows how the 'Byzantine' pieces examined are different from the Italian ones in: choice of decorative patterns, manufacturing process, and patronage.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Aspetti meno noti della scultura mediobizantina: la decorazione in stuccoLa decorazione in stucco negli edifici mediobizantini non ha goduto di grande fortuna critica o d... more La decorazione in stucco negli edifici mediobizantini non ha goduto di grande fortuna critica o di studi sistematici, come invece è avvenuto per gli stucchi in Occidente (in particolare quelli francesi, italiani, spagnoli e dell'area mitteleuropea fra V e XII secolo) e, in parte, nel Vicino Oriente (sasanidi, omayyadi, abbasidi).  È lecito chiedersi se ciò sia avvenuto per l'assenza di testimonianze consistenti o semplicemente per la scarsa attrattiva esercitata dal tema. Gli esempi finora rintracciati sembrano, invece, prospettare un panorama interessante e ricco di spunti che permette di osservare la decorazione di un edificio sotto diversi aspetti. Innanzitutto le decorazioni in stucco sono state individuate in edifici di una certa rilevanza, vale a dire fondazioni commissionate da personaggi della famiglia imperiale, oppure da regnanti che intendevano mettersi in competizione con l'impero bizantino. Anche laddove non si conosce la committenza, si è in presenza di edifici la cui importanza nella storia dell'arte bizantina è unanimemente riconosciuta. La maggior parte di queste decorazioni interagisce con gli arredi scultorei di pietra o di marmo, inducendo una riflessione sulle competenze di chi lavorava lo stucco e sul significato che esso doveva avere all'interno dell'apparato decorativo di un edificio.Da itinerario poco frequentato sembra, quindi, che lo stucco di età mediobizantina sia un campo degno di uno studio approfondito e sistematico che può contribuire ad avere una percezione il più organica possibile della decorazione complessiva degli edifici e ad interrogarsi sull'organizzazione del cantiere e sulle ripartizioni dei compiti tra le diverse maestranze operanti.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Artistic Mobility and Visual Exchanges in the Adriatic Seaby Franka Horvat, Flavia Vanni, and Giulia Anna Bianca Bordi48th Annual Byzantine Studies Conference -UCLA,  2022The Adriatic Sea is located between large coastal powers with different cultural traditions; fara... more The Adriatic Sea is located between large coastal powers with different cultural traditions; faraway from both Western and Eastern centers. As a result, it has not conformed to single areas of study. Borderline areas are generally considered to be regions of divisiveness separating cultures, languages, and materials. Yet the same factors can be taken as signals of connectivity. This session examines the Adriatic as an extension of Byzantium and explores its material culture from the perspective of connectivity with the Eastern Mediterranean. The Adriatic Sea offers extensive evidence of Byzantine traditions, informed by trade, diplomacy, and family relations. While acknowledging Venice’s important role in the Adriatic basin, this session moves beyond the notion that the Adriatic was “the sea of Venice,” and examines the part that smaller coastal towns played in the broader exchange of goods, ideas, and objects with the Eastern Mediterranean. Each paper sheds light on a different micro-region of the Adriatic and brings a different set of materials and issues to the discussion of interconnectivity. The session opens with an examination of late medieval artistic connections of the Adriatic, Ionian, and Aegean Seas from the perspective of the Elaphiti archipelago (southern Dalmatia). The second paper discusses the mobility of renowned magistri from the shores of Dalmatia to Apulia (12th – 14th c.), while the third addresses movements of stucco artisans in Epiros, in territories contested by the Palaiologans, Angevins, and Epirote rulers (13th c.). The fourth paper focuses on documented instances of direct artistic and intellectual transfers between Italy (Ancona) and Greece in the 15th century. The session results from discussions initiated by the international network “Reconnecting the Late Medieval Adriatic,” supported by UCLA and the University of Birmingham. The BSANA congress is an ideal place to share the initial research outcomes in a thematic session to a specialist audience.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As theauthors and commissioners of most of the documented sources thatsurvive, the history of the Byzantine world of the 4th to 15thcenturies, is essentially their history. Yet, such individuals and groupscomprised only a fraction of the population living within the empire'sborders.Harder to deduce are the roles and lives of its demographic majority:non-elites and the poor. Such groups are largely ignored in thewritten sources and therefore hold a diminished position incontemporary the scholarship. These sessions seek to remedy thisissue. Scholars continue to develop new approaches for examining thedaily interactions and activities of non-elite populations, including thepeasantry, urban labourers, and the destitute. Equally fundamentalare questions about how the poor were conceptualised and controlledby the primary custodians of wealth and power. Through a synthesisof archaeological, textual, and art historical remains this panel aimsto explore a more dynamic understanding of poverty and the peasantcondition within the pre-modern eastern Mediterranean.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Schultz and Sydney Barnsley spent two months at the monastery of Hosios Loukas, documenting the byzantine remains of the monastery on behalf of the newly established British School at Athens. Their notes and drawings produced the first documentation of the stucco cornices from the katholikon monastery and other monuments in Greece. In the following decades, the need to write the history of Byzantine art led scholars to focus on material traditionally associated with Byzantium (mosaics, wall paintings, marble), so stucco and other materials were left aside. However, with few exceptions, stucco continued to elude broader narratives of Byzantine art, being mainly confined to specific case studies. This paper addresses this gap by discussing the evidence for using stucco in middle and late byzantine religious buildings from a bird-eye perspective. Stucco was part of the decorative apparatus of Byzantine churches following the late antique tradition of ‘transitional’ material between marble cladding and mosaic-covered surfaces but also innovating and following new trends in middle Byzantine sculpture. This is visible from the use of stucco from string-course cornices to proskynetaria frames, capitals, tomb arcosolia, templa, and window transennae. At the same, the study of stucco and its workers forces us to re-think our contemporary, traditional categories of ‘painting’ and ‘sculpture’ and how they affect our perception of Byzantine material culture.Link to the lecture recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOhi1mBf7hUSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
