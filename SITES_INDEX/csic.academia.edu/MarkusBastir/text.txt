Here, we provide a virtual 3D reconstruction of the thorax of the adult male Kebara 2 Neandertal. Our analyses reveal that the Kebara 2 thorax is significantly different but not larger from that of modern humans, wider in its lower segment, which parallels his wide bi-iliac breadth, and with a more invaginated vertebral column. Kinematic analyses show that rib cages that are wider in their lower segment produce greater overall size increments (respiratory capacity) during inspiration. We hypothesize that Neandertals may have had a subtle, but somewhat different breathing mechanism compared to modern humans.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Big Choanae, Larger Face: Scaling Patterns Between Cranial Airways in Modern Humans and African Apes and Their Significance in Middle and Late Pleistocene Hominin Facial EvolutionBulletins et Mémoires de la Société d'Anthropologie de Paris,  2019This study aimed to understand the ontogenetic and allometric relationships in scaling between th... more This study aimed to understand the ontogenetic and allometric relationships in scaling between the anterior and posterior openings of the cranial airways and facial size, in order to shed light on the mechanisms that might underlie the evolution of a large face and large airways in Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neandertals. Sizes were calculated from 3D landmarks measured on the facial skeleton and airway structures of 403 skulls from two ontogenetic series of H. sapiens and P. troglodytes, an adult sample of gorillas and 11 Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neandertals. RMA regression models were used to compare the patterns in scaling between the anterior and posterior airways in relation to overall facial size.

Additionally, recent research investigating the relationship between vitamin D and AIS found a relation between them. We hypothesize a negative correlation between FA and vitamin D. Methods We performed a surface scan of the torso of 53 AIS patients, a blood test to measure vitamin D and the radiographic Cobb angle. A correlation analysis between vitamin D and FA was carried out to test our hypothesis, and a regression of vitamin D on 3D shape was performed to observe shape differences between the vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency groups. Results There was no correlation between vitamin D and FA. We found a strong negative correlation between vitamin D and the Cobb angle only in the premenarche group (n = 7; r = − 0.92).

Interestingly, current reconstructions of thoraces in small-bodied hominins, such as the Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1, may feature a smaller, more apelike pulmonary thorax (upper thorax), while its larger-bodied conspecific KSD-VP-1/1 is suggested to be more human with a relatively expanded upper thorax. Toward understanding this dichotomy, we examine the relationship between body size and thorax shape, and model trajectories of the upper limb relative to differently shaped thoraces. We show that variation in thorax shapes facilitate or constrain certain locomotor patterns, as a small upper with an expanded lower thorax facilitates knuckle-walking, orienting the upper limb close to the sagittal midline and center of gravity during locomotion, and confers efficient scapular movement around the ribcage. Conversely, an expanded upper and small lower thorax better facilitates bipedality, facilitating more efficient arm swing and energy return from upper limb momentum, while lower thoracic expansion constrains arm swing in bipedal locomotion. Since lung volume and body mass scale isometrically, increases in lung capacity (and concomitant expansion of the thorax) would be best apportioned to the lower thorax in knuckle-walkers. By contrast, increases in lung capacity and thorax expansion in bipeds are best apportioned superiorly. Thus, locomotor constraints, in concert with the isometric relationship between body size and lung size, may explain thoracic shape variation in early hominins.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Here, we describe a partial first rib from Member 4 of the Sterkfontein Caves, South Africa. The rib shaft is broken away, so only the head and neck are preserved. The rib is small, falling closest to small-bodied Australopithecus first ribs (AL 288-1 and MH1). Given that it was recovered near the StW 318 femur excavation, which also represents a small individual, we suggest that the two may be associated. Three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses were used to quantify the rib fragment morphology and compare it to extant hominoid and other fossil hominin ribs. While only the proximal end is preserved, our analyses show that South African Australopithecus share derived features of the proximal first rib more closely resembling A. afarensis and later hominins than grea...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

L’objectif est de mettre en évidence les mécanismes qui peuvent expliquer l’apparition d’un massif facial et de voies aériennes de grande taille chez les hominines du Pléistocène moyen et chez les Néandertaliens. La taille est calculée à partir de point-repères 3D positionnés sur la face et les ouvertures liées aux voies aériennes de 403 crânes provenant de deux séries ontogénétiques d’H. sapiens et de P. troglodytes, d’une série de gorilles adultes et de 11 Néandertaliens et hominines du Pléistocène moyen.

Variation in human 3D trunk shape and its functional implications in hominin evolutionScientific ReportsThis study investigates the contribution of external trunk morphology and posture to running perf... more This study investigates the contribution of external trunk morphology and posture to running performance in an evolutionary framework. It has been proposed that the evolution from primitive to derived features of torso shape involved changes from a mediolaterally wider into a narrower, and antero-posteriorly deeper into a shallower, more lightly built external trunk configuration, possibly in relation to habitat-related changes in locomotor and running behaviour. In this context we produced experimental data to address the hypothesis that medio-laterally narrow and antero-posteriorly shallow torso morphologies favour endurance running capacities. We used 3D geometric morphometrics to relate external 3D trunk shape of trained, young male volunteers (N = 27) to variation in running velocities during different workloads determined at 45–50%, 70% and 85% of heart rate reserve (HRR) and maximum velocity. Below 85% HRR no relationship existed between torso shape and running velocity. Howe...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, recent studies suggest that sexual dimorphism could challenge this assumption in Homo sapiens. We test the torso integration hypothesis in two modern human populations, both considering and excluding the effect of sexual dimorphism. We further assess covariation patterns between different thoracic and pelvic levels, and we explore the allometric effects on torso shape variation. A sex-balanced sample of 50 anatomically connected torsos (25 Mediterraneans, 25 Sub-Saharan Africans) was segmented from computed tomography scans.

We found that early Homo sapiens had relatively larger cerebellar hemispheres but a smaller occipital region in the cerebrum than Neanderthals long before the time that Neanderthals disappeared. Further, using behavioural and structural imaging data of living humans, the abilities such as cognitive flexibility, attention, the language processing, episodic and working memory capacity were positively correlated with size-adjusted cerebellar volume. As the cerebellar hemispheres are structured as a large array of uniform neural modules, a larger cerebellum may possess a larger capacity for cognitive information processing. Such a neuroanatomical difference in the cerebellum may have caused important differences in cognitive and social abilities between the two species and might have contributed to the replacement of Neanderthals by early Homo sapiens.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Role of the Thoracic Spine during Breathing in Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A Combined Traditional Morphometry and 3D Geometric Morphometrics ResearchOsteology,  2021OsteogenesisImperfecta (OI) is a rare disease with respiratory problems, which are usually attrib... more OsteogenesisImperfecta (OI) is a rare disease with respiratory problems, which are usually attributed to the secondary effects of scoliosis and rib fractures and to severe restrictive pulmonary disease. Conventional morphometry has already been studied in OI patients but three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (3D GMM) has never been used to assess how the thoracic spine shape changes during maximal breathing. A total of 6 adult subjects with OI type III and 16 healthy controls underwent a spirometric study and two computed tomography scans in maximal inspiration and expiration. Shape data by means of 3D GMM and Cobb angle values of scoliosis and kyphosis were obtained and their relationship with spirometric values was analysed using regressions and mean shape comparisons. No differences in kyphosis (p = 0.285) and scoliosis Cobb values (p = 0.407) were found between inspiration and expiration in OI patients.

Allometry, sexual dimorphism in human ossa coxae, and its relevance for understanding human torso variationThe thorax and pelvis are integrated systems, important for understanding human body shape and ev... more The thorax and pelvis are integrated systems, important for understanding human body shape and evolution. Research has shown that in the lower thorax, sexual dimorphism and allometry produce wider ribcages in larger males and narrower ones in smaller females. If the pelvis and thorax are integrated, we would expect that the upper pelvis would similarly be wider in larger males and narrower in smaller females. Within this framework of torso integration, we explore allometry and sexual dimorphism in ossa coxae. From a human sample with variation in body size (25 males, 25 females, Bass Collection; N=3 small-bodied humans, AMNH), we measured 142 (semi)landmarks on coxal bones and analyzed them using Geometric morphometrics. These results explore how sexual dimorphism and allometry affect torso width measured from pelvis morphology compared to previous studies of the ribcage. Males and females differ both allometrically and non-allometrically. Allometrically, smaller individuals have wider ossa coxae than larger individuals, regardless of sex; non-allometrically, females have a wider pelvic inlet than males, presumably due to obstetric adaptations. Both findings contradict previous results on lower ribcage dimensions. Our results show that while allometry and sexual dimorphism are important factors explaining ossa coxae morphology, they affect the pelvis and thorax differently, challenging the torso integration model. Morphological and positional relations between both hip bones and the sacrum could account for this. However, interactions between 3D-pelvis shape and size and stature are likely important in the context of pelvis reconstructions and body shape in small-bodied humans and hominins.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

TE site is under systematic excavation since 1996, and the inferior and superior levels are being dug up independently. The exposed section has been divided into 21 lito-stratigraphic units defined by major unconformities. Concerning the cave history, at least three main infill phases have been identified. The lower phase (TE8-TE14) is dated to Early Pleistocene (between 1.1 and 1.4 million years ago) on the basis of inverse paleomagnetics and belonging to the later Early Pleistocene on the basis of biochronology. The TE lower phase is providing a rich faunal assemblage, and shows evidence of human occupation. A set of stone tools of flint, and possibly, calcareous, is being found at these levels.

Geometric morphometrics in paleoanthropology: Mandibular shape variation, allometry, and the evolution of modern human skull morphologyMorphometrics,  2004Twenty 3D landmarks were digitized on adult mandibles from Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos (AT-SH) ... more Twenty 3D landmarks were digitized on adult mandibles from Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos (AT-SH) (N=8), Neanderthals (N=17) and modern humans (N=82). The 3D data was converted into 2D data for Thin-Plate splines analyses. Multivariate regression of partial warps and uniform component scores on size and bootstrap analyses were used to test three hypotheses of allometry. The mandible was divided into a supra- and infra-alveolar part, which are developmentally distinct components. Separate analyses for each component revealed that all species displayed greater allometric variation at the supra-alveolar unit than at the infra-alveolar unit. The infra-alveolar unit showed allometric variation patterns associated to spatial position of the mandible within the craniofacial system. In the supra-alveolar unit the formation of a retromolar space was identified as positive allometric effect in all three species. However, this effect was morphologically different and stronger in Neanderthals and AT-SH hominids than in humans. These findings are discussed in the framework of possible evolutionary modifications of the overall skull design.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We found that early Homo sapiens had relatively larger cerebellar hemispheres but a smaller occipital region in the cerebrum than Neanderthals long before the time that Neanderthals disappeared. Further, using behavioural and structural imaging data of living humans, the abilities such as cognitive flexibility, attention, the language processing, episodic and working memory capacity were positively correlated with size-adjusted cerebellar volume. As the cerebellar hemispheres are structured as a large array of uniform neural modules, a larger cerebellum may possess a larger capacity for cognitive information processing. Such a neuroanatomical difference in the cerebellum may have caused important differences in cognitive and social abilities between the two species and might have contributed to the replacement of Neanderthals by early Homo sapiens.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Role of the Thoracic Spine during Breathing in Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A Combined Traditional Morphometry and 3D Geometric Morphometrics ResearchOsteology,  2021OsteogenesisImperfecta (OI) is a rare disease with respiratory problems, which are usually attrib... more OsteogenesisImperfecta (OI) is a rare disease with respiratory problems, which are usually attributed to the secondary effects of scoliosis and rib fractures and to severe restrictive pulmonary disease. Conventional morphometry has already been studied in OI patients but three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (3D GMM) has never been used to assess how the thoracic spine shape changes during maximal breathing. A total of 6 adult subjects with OI type III and 16 healthy controls underwent a spirometric study and two computed tomography scans in maximal inspiration and expiration. Shape data by means of 3D GMM and Cobb angle values of scoliosis and kyphosis were obtained and their relationship with spirometric values was analysed using regressions and mean shape comparisons. No differences in kyphosis (p = 0.285) and scoliosis Cobb values (p = 0.407) were found between inspiration and expiration in OI patients. The 3D GMM analysis revealed significant shape differences between OI an...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Allometry, sexual dimorphism in human ossa coxae, and its relevance for understanding human torso variationThe thorax and pelvis are integrated systems, important for understanding human body shape and ev... more The thorax and pelvis are integrated systems, important for understanding human body shape and evolution. Research has shown that in the lower thorax, sexual dimorphism and allometry produce wider ribcages in larger males and narrower ones in smaller females. If the pelvis and thorax are integrated, we would expect that the upper pelvis would similarly be wider in larger males and narrower in smaller females. Within this framework of torso integration, we explore allometry and sexual dimorphism in ossa coxae. From a human sample with variation in body size (25 males, 25 females, Bass Collection; N=3 small-bodied humans, AMNH), we measured 142 (semi)landmarks on coxal bones and analyzed them using Geometric morphometrics. These results explore how sexual dimorphism and allometry affect torso width measured from pelvis morphology compared to previous studies of the ribcage. Males and females differ both allometrically and non-allometrically. Allometrically, smaller individuals have wider ossa coxae than larger individuals, regardless of sex; non-allometrically, females have a wider pelvic inlet than males, presumably due to obstetric adaptations. Both findings contradict previous results on lower ribcage dimensions. Our results show that while allometry and sexual dimorphism are important factors explaining ossa coxae morphology, they affect the pelvis and thorax differently, challenging the torso integration model. Morphological and positional relations between both hip bones and the sacrum could account for this. However, interactions between 3D-pelvis shape and size and stature are likely important in the context of pelvis reconstructions and body shape in small-bodied humans and hominins.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The "Sima del Elefante" cave site at Atapuerca (Spain)The “Sima del Elefante” (TE site) (Atapuerca, Spain) is a major cave infill with a stratigraphic ... more The “Sima del Elefante” (TE site) (Atapuerca, Spain) is a major cave infill with a stratigraphic succession 25 m thick and 15 m wide, wealthy in animal bones and evidences of human occupation at different Pleistocene ages. TE site is under systematic excavation since 1996, and the inferior and superior levels are being dug up independently. The exposed section has been divided into 21 lito-stratigraphic units defined by major unconformities. Concerning the cave history, at least three main infill phases have been identified. The lower phase (TE8-TE14) is dated to Early Pleistocene (between 1.1 and 1.4 million years ago) on the basis of inverse paleomagnetics and belonging to the later Early Pleistocene on the basis of biochronology. The TE lower phase is providing a rich faunal assemblage, and shows evidence of human occupation. A set of stone tools of flint, and possibly, calcareous, is being found at these levels. Hence, the lower part of the TE section documents early presence of...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Geometric morphometrics in paleoanthropology: Mandibular shape variation, allometry, and the evolution of modern human skull morphologyMorphometrics,  2004Twenty 3D landmarks were digitized on adult mandibles from Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos (AT-SH) ... more Twenty 3D landmarks were digitized on adult mandibles from Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos (AT-SH) (N=8), Neanderthals (N=17) and modern humans (N=82). The 3D data was converted into 2D data for Thin-Plate splines analyses. Multivariate regression of partial warps and uniform component scores on size and bootstrap analyses were used to test three hypotheses of allometry. The mandible was divided into a supra- and infra-alveolar part, which are developmentally distinct components. Separate analyses for each component revealed that all species displayed greater allometric variation at the supra-alveolar unit than at the infra-alveolar unit. The infra-alveolar unit showed allometric variation patterns associated to spatial position of the mandible within the craniofacial system. In the supra-alveolar unit the formation of a retromolar space was identified as positive allometric effect in all three species. However, this effect was morphologically different and stronger in Neanderthals and AT-SH hominids than in humans. These findings are discussed in the framework of possible evolutionary modifications of the overall skull design.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Response to Comment on "The growth pattern of Neandertals, reconstructed from a juvenile skeleton from El Sidrón (Spain)Science (New York, N.Y.),  Mar 9, 2018The comment by DeSilva challenges our suggestion that brain growth of the El Sidrón J1 Neandertal... more The comment by DeSilva challenges our suggestion that brain growth of the El Sidrón J1 Neandertal was still incomplete at 7.7 years of age. Evidence suggests that endocranial volume is likely to represent less than 90% adult size at El Sidrón as well as Neandertal male plus Krapina samples, in line with further evidence from endocranial surface histology and dural sinus groove size.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
