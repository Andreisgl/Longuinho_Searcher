This includes delineation of each site, characterisation of ejected materials and a determination of relative chronology. Understanding of past volcanic behaviour on the island is particularly important due to its prominence as a tourist destination and because the main volcanic complex has long since been designated as a " Decade Volcano " by the International Association for Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
