Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museums, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This ground-breaking book reflects on material, visual and digital culture from the Calais “Jungle” – the informal camp where, before its destruction in October 2016, more than 10,000 displaced people lived. LANDE: The Calais 'Jungle' and Beyond reassesses how we understand ‘crisis’, activism, and the infrastructure of national borders in Refugee and Forced Migration Studies, foregrounding the politics of environments, time, and the ongoing legacies of empire. Introducing a major collaborative exhibit at Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum, the book argues that an anthropological focus on duration, impermanence and traces of the most recent past can recentre the ongoing human experiences of displacement in Europe today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It revisits Tim Ingold’s 1993 paper ‘The Temporality of the Landscape’, considering its relationship with the phenomenological and interpretive archaeologies of the 1990s and what we learn from it today. Engaged not so much in an ‘ontological turn’ as in a kind of archival return, the essay compares Ingold’s discussion of Bruegel’s painting The Harvesters (1565) with an archaeological photograph from 1993. A discussion of the after-effects of performance follows, and four theses about temporality, landscape, modernity and revisiting are put forward: 1) The passage of time transforms archaeological knowledge; 2) Archaeological knowledge transforms the passage of time; 3) An archaeological landscape is an object that is known through remapping; 4) Archaeological knowledge is what we leave behind. The essay concludes that archaeology is best understood not as the study of the temporality of the landscape, as Ingold had argued, but as the study of the temporality of the landscape revisited.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This shift has opened up a space for new dialogues between historians and post-medieval archaeologists working on British cities. It offers the potential for reassessing approaches to studying the urban past and for experimenting with fresh methodologies. Noting that archaeological perspectives have been largely absent from recent historical accounts of the modern metropolis, in this chapter we explore the potential for pursuing collaborative research that fuses archaeological evidence and thinking with other forms of historical practice to write material histories of London.  The discussion divides into three parts. First, we sketch the post-war development of urban post-medieval archaeology in London, and the range of archaeological collections and excavation sites that relate to the Georgian and Victorian city. Second, we consider some of the ways in which the analysis of these sources might be used in interdisciplinary urban historiography, especiallyin the light of methodological approaches developed in North American and Australian urban archaeology. Third, we present a case study that explores how nineteenth-centuryhousehold archaeologies in London might be developed, examining some of the complexities and challenges of integrating archaeological methods into the study of households andlocalities in the nineteenth-century metropolis. In conclusion we consider the prospects for the development of interdisciplinary approaches to the material remains of London’s modern past."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Goethe Annual Lecture - Prof Dan Hicks (14 Jan 2022)Unrechtskontexte (Contexts of Injustice): dismantling colonial legacies from Berlin to London
In... more Unrechtskontexte (Contexts of Injustice): dismantling colonial legacies from Berlin to LondonIn 2013, the German Museums Association (Deutscher Museumsbund) issued guidance on the treatment of human remains in museum collections, in which they introduced a novel concept. The idea of 'Unrechtskontext' (context of injustice) should, they suggested, guide curatorial ethics when assessing the circumstances in which museum collections were acquired. Among considerations here was not just the contexts of the past, but also whether any particular injustice 'continued to have an effect in the present'.A decade later, this question of the unfinished nature of certain 'contexts of injustice' now lies at the centre of Euro-American debates about the enduring legacies of empire, 'scientific racism', and theories of cultural supremacy. This lecture takes stock of recent events in Europe and North America - from removing statues and un-naming buildings to returning artefacts from colonial museums, but also to ongoing violent regimes of display at the British Museum and now rekindled at Berlin's Humboldt Forum. The lecture asks: How should we understand the 'Unrechtskontexte' of colonial legacies today? By the standards of the time - or by the values that we hold today? And how can these legacies be meaningfully dismantled?https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/goethe-annual-lecture-by-dan-hicks-tickets-227734799917Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a single world of presence and absence that can be interpreted through multiple archaeologies (Buchli and Lucas 2001)? Or as multiple worlds that emerge through the practice of archaeology? This paper considers this question in two ways. First, it explores the legacies of three 20th-century concepts: ethnology, folklife, and material culture. Second, it presents the implications of two 21st-century alternatives in how archaeologists understand time. In doing so, the paper reflects on what we are left with, a decade on from first CHAT conference in Bristol. It warns that presence, just like history, can be stolen (Goody 2006).ReferencesBuchli, V. and G. Lucas (eds) 2001. Archaeologies of the contemporary past. London: Routledge.Goody, J. 2006.
