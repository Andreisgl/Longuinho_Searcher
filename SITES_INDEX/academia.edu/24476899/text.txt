Analyzing Harpo’s role as an object-machine of enjoyment, it connects his status, as well as the larger realm of the brothers’ humor, to Lacan’s perverse and perverting analytic discourse.Download Free PDFView PDFNew German Critique, No. 92, Special Issue on Multicultural Germany: Art, Performance and New MediaStrangers in Disguise: Role-Play beyond Identity Politics in Anarchic Film Comedy2004 • Deniz GokturkIn this article, I reflect on the potentials of humor and role-play in fighting racism especially in our contemporary world where national broadcasting media or film funding schemes can no longer avoid the question of how to represent and address increasingly multilingual, multiethnic and multicultural audiences. Exile and comedy, diaspora and humor appear to be contradictions in terms. How could uprooting, loss of home, and displacement in a strange land be anything but unsettling, traumatic, and tragic? In the prevalent rhetoric about diaspora cultures and representations of minorities in the media, metaphors of space and place carry heavy emotional, often nostalgic investments that need to be carefully scrutinized. Possibilities of transgressing symbolic regimes of victimization and marginalization might be opened up through strategies of humor and irony, carnival and anarchy, distancing and reversal, masquerade and mutual mimicry, delusion and role-play. Comic moments in the transnational and transethnic imagination can suggest liberating rhetorical positions beyond territorially grounded notions of identity and belonging, and can destabilize dominant practices of inclusion and exclusion. While remaining aware of the limitations and problems of ethnic humor, I argue that humor can be instrumental in releasing tensions and breaking up encrusted fixations in the way we perceive ourselves and others.Download Free PDFView PDFStudies in Musical TheatreI'll Say She Is! (1924) the "laugh-a-minute revue" that Made the Marx Brothers2013 • Margaret FarrellThis brief examination of the 1924 Broadway revue I’ll Say She Is! describes the process of constructing it, analyses its contents, and addresses the importance of the show in the careers of its stars, the Marx Brothers. This show is an example of the revue as a composite structure, constructed out of a combination of new and recycled material to feature three expected types of entertainment: music, comedy and spectacle. Resembling both a musical and a vaudeville bill, this revue is held together by the unifying construct of a plot. The most important sources in this examination are the unpublished diaries of the show’s writer, Will B. Johnstone. These diariescontain details of the construction process of a revue that add to our store of knowledge on the revue in the 1920s.Download Free PDFView PDFA Companion to Film Comedy 2012Teguh AryawangsaDownload Free PDFView PDFEl 'efecto-silencio' en las películas de los Hermanos Marx.

It appears often to mock figures of authority, but ideology also relies on comedy to create an investment in the ruling social structure. This essay argues that comedy has no inherent political leaning. We must determine the politics of comedy by analyzing how the conception of the social order that it produces. If comedy creates an image of the social order as a whole, it has a conservative function. But if comedy reveals the incompleteness of the social structure, it functions as a critical comedy that plays an emancipatory role in political struggle.Download Free PDFView PDF1935 extended version.docxJoseph DorinsonDownload Free PDFView PDFBiderman, S.
