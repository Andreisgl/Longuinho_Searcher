I read this because the reviews were so polarised.  It's not a man-hating book- it's insane and involves a psychopath/sociopath- more than one.

It’s not my birth name, put it that way. It could just as easily be Paul, Steve or Dave. But I like John. It’s a boring nondescript name. Unexciting. And I don’t look exciting – you could pass me in the street and not give me a second glance; probably wouldn’t even notice me at all. Except perhaps for my size. I’m big. Like a big old cuddly teddy bear. I look like a John. Someone you’d welcome into your home. The name fits in with my immediate plans. Comfortable, unassuming, John. People never expect the unexpected with me. They only see my easy-going façade; the very John-ness of me. I’d initially thought about simply breaking into the house, and surprising Rebecca. I had, after all, burgled many a property in my past. And indeed, had accessed this very house in particular. I could have used the spare key that was kept under the flowerpot. But this way was better. I’d decided on the charm offensive. I could do charm: a lot of smiling, a lot of eye contact, a lot of meaningless compliments. And a lot of practice. I’d learnt quickly, absorbing all the information on how to finesse and delightfully engage others. Charm always took people by surprise. Common decency and politeness dictated that many people, especially women, were thrown by a show of gracious courtesy and they acted stupidly, without thought. By which time, of course, it was too late. Too late for them to see the error of their ways and I would be inside their house. With them. I stood in front of the large country house. Not your average chocolate-box cottage but a magnificent grey stone structure on three floors. I peeked through the open slatted venetian blinds, into a spotless modern kitchen. Nothing chintzy going on here. Having already concealed my bigger and much heavier rucksack behind a large bush to the right of the front door, I hooked my two thumbs around the straps of my lighter rucksack, casually slung over my shoulders, and adopted a completely non-threatening stance. My legs were planted slightly apart, my black brogues so highly polished I could see my own reflection in them. My laces were, as always, tied with a double safety knot. I’d taught myself as a boy how to make my footwear more secure and enjoyed the added ‘safety’. Proudly I’d shown my mother, but she’d had little time for praise: a busy lady. But I knew she was pleased. She’d patted me absently on the top of my head in a congratulatory way. Quiet, unspoken plaudits, but good enough for me. The double safety knot had worked for me for all these years. I saw no reason to change a habit of a lifetime. Being prepared was a good motto, although I was no boy scout. Far from it. But I liked the principle of being ready for any eventuality. Standing away from the threshold, not wanting to crowd, I plastered on my oh-my-good-gosh-boy-next-door smile, rang the bell and waited. The woman who opened the door – Rebecca – was wearing her hair up and a flour-dusted apron which held her heaving bosom in place, and only partially covered her simple jogging pants and baggy jumper ensemble. Sunday lunch was already on the go. Flaring my nostrils I inhaled discreetly. Chicken. My favourite. At least I wouldn’t go hungry on this particular venture. Rebecca’s eyes furrowed in slight confusion as she looked at me. I wasn’t expected and she didn’t recognise me, so it was a facial expression I’d anticipated. Sweeping my blond hair from my forehead in a boyish gesture, I beamed at her. A real, live full-wattage smile, showing off my perfect white dental work: boasting my little row of impeccably enamelled Tic-Tac-teeth. ‘Rebecca, how lovely to see you again. You look marvellous.’ I opened my arms and gathered up her small frame, nearly lifting her off her feet. Planted a big wet one on her cheek and gave her a little squeeze. ‘Roger told me how well you were, but he didn’t tell me just how fantastic you look. It really is lovely to see you again.’ Stepping past her, I watched her face drop as she realised I was suddenly and unaccountably on the wrong side of the door. I was in. Her cheeks pinked, and she said, ‘No, wait. Please stop. I don’t know who you are.’ ‘It’s me. You know me.’ I laughed softly and pretended a mock-hurt look that she had forgotten me so quickly. I held my hand to my heart, feigning distress. She visibly dithered; her innate good manners fighting with the fact that there was an uninvited man in her house. I slithered my glance up and down her body. Taking the whole of her in. It had the desired effect. She blushed. I grinned at her. ‘I’m certainly all the better for seeing you, Becky. Is it through here…?’ Of course I knew where the kitchen was because I’d let myself in weeks before – just to familiarise myself with the lay of the land. I pointed quizzically as if unsure of the route but walked into the kitchen, and then like a divining rod, headed miraculously into the dining room as if by luck. Heard her hurried footsteps behind me. She laid her hand on my arm, her fingers gripping with a surprising strength. ‘No, really, please wait. Look, I’m very sorry, but I’m still not sure who you are, and I wasn’t expecting you.’ ‘Who were you expecting?’ I smiled to take the bite from my words. ‘Don’t tell me Roger forgot to tell you I was coming for Sunday lunch? I’ve been looking forward to it so much. And of course I can’t wait to see your daughter again – Lucy, and her new husband, Frank, as well. Do tell me they’re still coming.’ My apparent intimate knowledge of her family and their plans for the day, threw her. Her cheeks still held an embarrassed tinge of pink but flared afresh again in an ugly crimson flush. ‘Yes. I mean, no. Roger didn’t tell me. Or I forgot. Probably my fault – it usually is. Brain like a sieve. And yes, Lucy and Frank are coming. As per. But I’m terribly sorry, I really can’t quite place you. Who are you? How do we know each other?’ ‘Rebecca, really. How can you not remember me? I can’t believe it. I’m hurt.’ Her fingers interlocked with each other, creating a mass of reddened digits, her knuckles showing white. She was a veritable blaze of angst-ridden colour. ‘Come on, Becky. Tell me you’re only playing. You are, aren’t you?’ She looked on the verge of weeping at her own social ineptitude. Rallying well, although laughably transparent in her attempts to redeem herself, she stretched her mouth into a smile – so tight I thought her lips might split. ‘Just give me a clue. I’m just dreadful with names and faces. Always walking past people who I’ve known forever.’ Collapsing down heavily on one of the wooden dining chairs, as if she were feeling faint from her utter uselessness and lack of etiquette, I almost felt sorry for her. No, that’s a lie. I didn’t feel sorry for her. Not one little bit. I said, ‘I haven’t told you my name. My fault entirely. That’ll help. It’s John. Remember now? We last saw each other at Roger’s Christmas party. Three months ago?’ I spread my arms out in what could only be interpreted as charming. ‘How could you forget, Becky? We all had such a laugh that night.’ She feigned a look of relief as she pretended to recall our non-meeting. Slapped her hands to her forehead. ‘Oh, stupid, stupid me. Now I remember. John. How are you?’ ‘Certainly better now you know who I am. Sorry if I frightened you. You looked as if I were the bogeyman who’d come for Sunday lunch, instead of me, John. Don’t worry, don’t be upset. Easy mistake to make. We’d all had a bit too much of the old vino at the Christmas do, so no hard feelings. I know I’m not exactly a stand-out type of man, am I?’ Again with the blushing. She jumped up. ‘I’ll get you a drink. Wine? Red or white?’ ‘Whatever you’re having.’ She hesitated because I’d given her a choice. Left it up to her. ‘White would be lovely, thanks, Becky,’ I said, coming to her aid. I made myself comfortable at the solid oak dining table, my hands folded in front of me. I couldn’t help but take the time to admire my beautifully and professionally manicured hands: the nails were buffed to a soft sheen, the cuticles were where they should be, and the tips of my nails were bright white, perfect crescents. Filed, smoothed. Delightful. My rucksack sat on the chair next to me as I politely waited for my glass of wine. She brought it to me and sat opposite, looking pointedly at her watch. ‘Roger will be home soon. Back from the pub. Two o’clock. He’s never late.’ That much I knew. And estimated time of arrival for Lucy and Frank – they also ran like clockwork and would turn up at three. We both sipped politely from our respective glasses and I leaned forward. Instantly, she recoiled. Tried to cover her rudeness by pretending a coughing fit. Getting up and walking around the table so that I stood over her, I rested the back of my legs against the adjacent chair to Becky. ‘I’m a real townie – can’t abide the country. Too much open space for me. However, I do concede, that on the face of it, because you have no other houses around you, you have your very own idyll of peace and tranquillity, with no one else close enough to spoil it. But do you know the worst thing about living in such a beautiful rural house like this? A secluded house like this? Do you know the one real pitfall of this set-up?’ She shook her head, her eyes suddenly rounder and eyebrows higher than they should be. I quickly bent in close, so that my mouth almost touched her face, and her hair tickled my cheek. I whispered in her ear. ‘The worst thing about living here, Rebecca, is that no one can hear you scream.’ Then I headbutted her, right between the eyes. 2 Me Tutting, I cleaned up the broken wine glass from the carpet. It had caught the edge of the table as it fell, as Becky fell, and I consequently had to mop up the spilt wine with wads of kitchen paper from a roll. Didn’t want it to stain: it was a nice carpet. More to the point, I wanted things to look normal; didn’t want Roger glancing through the kitchen window and not seeing his wife slaving over a hot stove. He wouldn’t be able to see her now at all, as she was hog-tied on the dining room floor, with an apple in her mouth to stop her shouting out. She looked uncannily and amusingly like a pig on a spit, adorned and decorated as if for a banquet. But at least she was quiet. And of course, breathing. I am not a complete beast. The stuffing of the mouth with an apple was purely to stop her shouting out and warning Rog that all was not as it should be. That dinner might be a little delayed. But hopefully not spoilt. The masking tape which held the apple in place rather ruined the overall medieval look that I was going for, but it at least restrained her dribble that would otherwise have run free. A real plus. I looked at my watch. Ten to two. Ten minutes. Frankly I was bored and couldn’t wait for everyone to get here. Becky wasn’t up for general chit-chat, so after a quick wander about, tidying as I went, I positioned myself on the hinge-side by the inside of the front door and simply waited. Holding the carving knife with both hands, the tip of the blade pointed straight up. Finally, I heard the sound of Roger’s car pull into the lane and park outside the house. Bang on two o’clock. I had to hand it to the man, he adhered strictly to his own self-imposed timetable. It was an admirable quality – that of reliability, if a little nerdy for my tastes. He always looked a bit too much of an Anorak for me, showing a lack of spontaneity and a smidge too much of predictability and dullness. I’d like to say, ‘Each to their own,’ but I didn’t really think like that. And I actually knew that he was far from being Anorak-Man. Don’t judge a book by its cover and all that. He had hidden depths. And he’d hope to keep those depths well and truly hidden. For his own sake. Good luck with that. I braced myself as I heard Roger shout out, ‘Rebecca, I’m home.’ And then he closed the door to find me standing there, staring at him. Instantly, at a glance, I recognised again, up close and personal, the weakness in him. Smelled the beer fumes coming from him. He reeked of it. On impulse, I thrust my face to his. ‘Boo!’ Tiny flecks of my own spittle landed on his cheeks and his arms flew up in defence. He stepped back and in doing so, managed to stand on one of his own feet: he fell in an embarrassment of idiocy and cowardice, landing on his blubbery bottom. You must forgive my theatrics, but I wasn’t physically under threat from old Rog, so I had allowed myself the fun of simply frightening him. He brought his hand to his mouth and I saw it tremble. ‘Stand up,’ I said. He did, his mouth slack. His face had undergone a weird sort of disintegration, almost disappearing, as if unsure of what expression to settle on. ‘Hello, Rog, I’m John. Thanks for being on time. It’s appreciated. Hang your coat up and we’ll go and find your wife, okay? Suit you?’ He didn’t move. Not a muscle. I had to step forward one pace, softly, softly so as not to frighten him to death, to check that he was still doing the old breathing in and out thing. And there it was; a raspy, whispery sound – his breath had taken on a whistle for the occasion. Odd. I unlooped the corded twine that I had earlier placed on one of the coat pegs, lasso-style, and gently hung it around Roger’s neck. Pulled it tight, but not too tight, and led him down the short hall to the dining room. Not really knowing why I bothered as he was very low maintenance, I manacled his hands together. Police issue handcuffs. Only the best. I knew a man who knew a man who knew a woman. It’s good to have contacts in my world. Becky was already wearing a matching pair. I’d got four for the price of two. Bargain. I didn’t even have to wield my mighty blade at Roger. He was already completely cowed purely by my very existence in his house. Bit pathetic I thought. Leading him like a dog on a leash, I had to tug harder on the cord as his feet failed him. Like a horse refusing a jump, he planted himself at the entrance to the dining room. ‘Come on, Roger, for pity’s sake, don’t you want to see your wife? Check she’s okay? Christ, get a backbone, for God’s sake. You’re embarrassing me. And yourself.’ Roger was almost as nondescript looking as I. There was nothing that defined him physically, nothing that made him anything other than grey. Up close, he reminded me again of just how nothing-looking he really was. He wasn’t, visually at least, a man to make you think, Now there’s someone I’d like to spend time with. I sighed extravagantly. ‘She’s alive, Rog. Becky is alive and waiting for you. When I tug, you walk, right?’ He nodded. Barely. But it was something. I noticed a small drop of sweat trickle down the side of his cheek. And then it just hung there. Dangling in space, a droplet of fear, suspended from his chin. It quivered like a gelatinous blob and I had to stop myself gagging. I made a swiping movement on my own face, and then pointed at his jaw. He looked back at me blankly. ‘Roger, pull yourself together and wipe your face. You’re sweating.’ Disgusted, I had to look away. I wasn’t overly keen on others’ bodily excretions. Wasn’t a fan of human fluids. I liked things clean. Very clean. Blood was different. I didn’t mind blood. Funny that, if you think about it. Having got rid of the offending sweat, I allowed Roger to see Becky for the first time. His reaction was, as anticipated, a non-one. He remained immobile; his face seemed to have lost all ability of portraying any emotion. Becky, however, was, thankfully, a different proposition entirely. She reacted like a real person. Seeing Roger, she attempted to scream. She only managed grunts from behind the apple; now dribble escaped from the corners of her mouth. I hastened my gaze over her drool, not wanting to linger on it. But at least she tried to communicate, whilst old Rog just looked down at her as if he’d never met her. Putting my hand on his shoulder I said, ‘Roger, this is Becky. Becky, Roger.’ Appalled by his lack of anything emotional, I pushed blank-man onto one of the dining room chairs and bound his feet, arms and torso to the chair with the cord. In an intricate but man-size version of a cat’s cradle. Shoved an apple in his mouth just to keep a little symmetry going – piggy number two. Gathering Becky in my arms like a child, I lifted her from the floor and gently deposited her in one of the other dining room chairs. Opposite her husband. Trussed her up in similar fashion to Roger. Their arms were able to bend at the elbows; other than that, their movement was severely restricted. They made for an odd couple. Not an obvious pairing on the face of it. They seemed somehow mismatched. Uncomfortably so. I stood back to see what they’d do. They eyeballed each other; Becky doing better with expressing her fear through her eyes, although they were both horribly swollen and blackened by the impact of my head. She used her eyes to convey to Roger that he needed to do something. Anything. But Roger was proving to be a bit of a dud all round. I hoped he’d improve. With or without the apple. Stupid little piggy. I settled in for the last two guests to arrive. Then we could begin. 3 Me Two people are harder to control than one, so I’d had to give this part of the plan a little more thought. Not a lot, because I wasn’t expecting any difficulty. But it was, theoretically, double jeopardy. So, equally, double the fun. Two more cords hung on the coat pegs; nooses-in-waiting, and the knife remained in my hands. Again, I was warned of their arrival by the sound of tyres on the lane outside, and the slamming of two car doors. Their laughter floated in through the closed windows and I knew it would be a very long time before either of them would be laughing again. I assumed that Lucy would be the first through the door as she had the keys. When I’d watched them arrive over the previous weeks, for their free Sunday lunch provided by Mummy and Daddy, she’d always been the one to open the front door. I could only presume that today would be no different. And I was right. I saw her swathe of long blonde hair first as it flew through the door, closely followed by Lucy herself. No faffing about here. Swift action was called for and before she was even fully over the threshold, I grabbed her from behind, the blade jutting into the bottom of her chin. Gasping, she struggled briefly, her hands instinctively grabbing my forearm. All it took was a teeny pressure on the knife from me, just a slight upward dig motion, and a drop of blood blossomed suddenly on her skin. She must have felt the droplet hot and wet as it swelled and dripped down her neck. She stopped fighting. Quick learner, our Lucy. Good girl. Frank, much like Roger, had frozen. I backed away from the door, allowing him space to enter, saying, ‘Take your coat off, hang it up and put that rope around your neck. Now.’ He looked at me. ‘Go on, do it. Or I’ll cut Lucy. Cut her deeper. Don’t think I won’t. Do you want me to prove my intent or will you take it as a given?’ Then he moved. Fumbled his coat off and stood there with the cord hanging from his neck like a forlorn rescue mutt. I threw him a pair of handcuffs. ‘Put them on.’ He did as instructed. ‘Now, move slowly. Or I swear to God I’ll slice your brand-new wife. Into strips. Imagine a paper shredder. Now imagine your wife. Understand?’ He nodded. Mute. I smiled at him. He didn’t smile back. Of course I was rather overplaying the bad man here. But it was a quick and effective method of making people do what you tell them. Fear was a useful tool in its place. I used what worked but it went against the grain. I preferred a little more finesse personally. Frightening people for the sake of it didn’t fill me with any sense of accomplishment. It was unnecessary and uncalled for. But it was expeditious. Still keeping the knife to Lucy’s neck, I popped the fourth pair of handcuffs around her slender wrists. Pulling the noose tight around Frank’s neck – all the better to lead him with, and still with a knife to Lucy’s throat, I brought them both into the dining room. Neither of them made any noise when they saw Becky and Roger sitting bound in their chairs, apples in mouths. Except for a little gasp from Lucy. A little inhalation that I might have missed were my ears not waiting for some sort of audible reaction. Frank, without being told, silently went and sat in the third chair, his eyes continually flitting in my direction, following the knife, fixating on the knife. Frightened of the knife. He chose the chair diagonally opposite Roger. Waited like an obedient boy for his tying-up turn. Strange reaction but it made life simpler for me. I was already familiar with the way Frank operated so wasn’t overly bothered. I dropped the end of his neck leash onto the floor and stood on it. I tied Lucy first, to chair number four and then roped in Frank. All bound and remarkably unresistant, I took out the apples from Roger and Becky’s mouths, using a napkin to avoid coming into contact with their spit, and then sat on the fifth chair. At the head of the table. The constant moving of the knife stopped any one of them from even thinking of being difficult. But really, at this stage, their options were limited. We looked at each other. I beamed at them. At last we were all here. But first things first. ‘I’m hungry. I assume you’ll join me if I make sandwiches?’ I said. ‘What? A sandwich. Christ. Who are you?’ Lucy said. ‘All in good time. Your mother can fill you in while I rustle up a little something to eat. Okay?’ Smiling to myself at Lucy’s impatience, I pivoted on my feet and left them to it. But Lucy had asked a good question. Who was I? I smiled. They’d never guess. 4 Rebecca Rebecca had a headache. Her whole face ached and she felt her eyes puffed up; her lids only able to open a crack. But a slits-view of her world was all she wanted now. It was enough. She felt an embarrassment and humiliation that she’d been so stupid as to let the man in. Politeness had forced her to allow him entry, not knowing how to stop him without being rude. That politeness could be the death of her. Of her family. Stupid, stupid, stupid. She couldn’t stretch to another adjective that quite summed up her idiotic behaviour. With the acknowledgement of that idiocy, inevitably she felt a deep sense of shame and guilt. Now her family was in danger – all because of her. Fear ricocheted around inside her head. Taking a deep breath, she tried to calm herself. An odd, strained silence fell. Finally her daughter broke it, saying – her voice a childlike whisper, ‘Mum – your face. What did he do? Are you all right?’ Rebecca nodded. Smiled. Smiled – yes, really. But honestly, in the grand scheme of things, she told herself, she just had two black eyes. Her tongue worried the corner of her lip where it felt like it had split. From having the apple in her mouth. A cold sore perhaps preparing to blossom at a later stage. Again, did that really rate as a major concern at this point? Dear God, it could have been a lot worse. The man could have killed her, tortured her. Raped her. She should be grateful, although that particular emotion remained out of reach for the moment. Very out of reach. But she quieted her daughter with a firm but calm lie: ‘I’m fine. Really, Lucy, I’m fine. Don’t worry.’ Then she noticed the small drops of blood on her daughter’s neck; some of it had dried on Lucy’s top.
