The World Health Organization considers dengue among the top ten global health threats . This is particularly concerning as no specific treatment or vaccine against dengue is not widely available (a dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur, has been licensed in 24 countries and introduced into public immunization programs in the Philippines and Brazil) . Furthermore, the dengue virus's genetic heterogeneity (serotype and genotype) adds another dimension to the public health challenge due to the increased risk of disease severity (secondary and tertiary infection). Dengue has spread over 125 countries, with 400 million annual infections and 40,000 deaths . The endemic regions of tropical and subtropical countries (South East Asia and South Asia) account for 70% of the dengue burden .See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersTropical Medicine and Infectious DiseaseIncreasing Dengue Burden and Severe Dengue Risk in Bangladesh: An OverviewMohammad KayeshDengue is a prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans. The geographic range of dengue is expanding, and much like in many other tropical regions of the world, dengue has become a major public health issue in Bangladesh. Until a large epidemic dengue outbreak in 2000, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh since 1964. After 2000, varying intensities of dengue activity were observed each year until 2018. However, in 2019, Bangladesh experienced the largest dengue epidemic in its history, with 101,354 dengue cases and 164 dengue-related deaths. Notably, this outbreak occurred in many regions that were previously considered free of the disease. As of 10 December 2022, a total of 60,078 dengue cases and 266 dengue-related deaths were reported in Bangladesh, with the 2022 outbreak being the second largest since 2000. There is an increased genetic diversity of the dengue virus (DENV) in Bangladesh and all four DENV serotypes are prevalent and co-...Download Free PDFView PDFTropical Medicine and HealthSketch of 2018 dengue outbreak in a megacity, BangladeshTamanna TabassumBackground Dengue has become a major public health threat in Bangladesh since 2000, when the first outbreak was reported. Each outbreak has distinct characteristics, and thus, the report of the outbreak helps to understand the disease process and subsequent clinical management of these patients. On that ground, the study was designed to sketch the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of the 2018 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. Methods This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in one of the largest public medical college hospitals and a single private hospital located in the southern and northern parts of the megacity of the country. A total of 297 confirmed dengue cases were assessed with a preformed pretested questionnaire. Clinico-epidemiological and laboratory parameters were reported along with sociodemographic details. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20. Results Male patients were predominantly affected by dengue infection. The mean age of the patie...Download Free PDFView PDFTropical Medicine and Infectious DiseaseNationwide Distribution of Dengue Virus Type 3 (DENV-3) Genotype I and Emergence of DENV-3 Genotype III during the 2019 Outbreak in BangladeshSyeda NasreenBangladesh is an endemic region of dengue fever and experienced an unprecedented large outbreak with more than 100,000 confirmed cases in 2019. To understand the prevalence of dengue antibody in patients and molecular epidemiological characteristics of dengue virus (DENV) in this outbreak, a total of 179 blood samples were collected from patients in 10 districts (seven divisions) covering nearly the whole country from August to December 2019. DENV NS-1 was detected in 162 samples, among which DENV-specific IgM was positive in 119 samples (73.5%), including 60.5% samples also positive for DENV-specific IgG. Sequencing of the partial C-prM gene and its phylogenetic analysis revealed predominance of DENV type 3 genotype I, accounting for 93% of samples examined. DENV-3 genotype III was identified in two samples from separate districts, and only one DENV-2 cosmopolitan genotype was found in the capital city, Dhaka. These findings suggest the predominance of DENV-3 genotype I and occurre...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Infectious DiseasesModeration effects of serotype on dengue severity across pregnancy status in MexicoDR WAN FAIROS WAN YAACOBBackground Pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of severe dengue. To the best of our knowledge, the moderation effect of the dengue serotype among pregnant women has not been studied in Mexico. This study explores how pregnancy interacted with the dengue serotype from 2012 to 2020 in Mexico. Method Information from 2469 notifying health units in Mexican municipalities was used for this cross-sectional analysis. Multiple logistic regression with interaction effects was chosen as the final model and sensitivity analysis was done to assess potential exposure misclassification of pregnancy status. Results Pregnant women were found to have higher odds of severe dengue [1.50 (95% CI 1.41, 1.59)]. The odds of dengue severity varied for pregnant women with DENV-1 [1.45, (95% CI 1.21, 1.74)], DENV-2 [1.33, (95% CI 1.18, 1.53)] and DENV-4 [3.78, (95% CI 1.14, 12.59)]. While the odds of severe dengue were generally higher for pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women with DENV-1 and DENV-2...Download Free PDFView PDFA Comprehensive Study on Knowledge, Attitude and Preventive measures regarding Dengue Fever in Bangladesh: Quantitative Interview among University Students2021 • IMTIAJ CHOWDHURYArticle Info: _____________________________________________ Article History: Received 04 Nov 2020; Review Completed 28 Dec 2020 Accepted 09 Jan 2021; Available online 25 Jan 2021 _____________________________ Cite this article as: Farzana SM, Sahid FB, Bhattacherjee D, Zulfiquar TN, Haque S, Jahan L, Baral PK, Chowdhury IH, A Comprehensive Study on Knowledge, Attitude and Preventive measures regarding Dengue Fever in Bangladesh: Quantitative Interview among University Students., Journal of Drug Delivery and Therapeutics. 2021; 11(1):93-103 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.22270/jddt.v11i1.4525Download Free PDFView PDFBioresearch CommunicationsAll four dengue virus serotypes co-circulate in concurrent dengue infections in a single dengue session in Chittagong, Bangladesh2021 • Anjuvan SinghPurposes: Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is a global public health burden affecting millions of people each year and over 40% of world populations are at risk of dengue. Therefore, prompt and accurate dengue diagnosis is inevitable for disease surveillance and for aiding disease management. In this study we report dengue virus (DENV) seroprevalence in Chittagong, Bangladesh along with clinical manifestation of dengue infections. Methods: All samples included in this study were selected based on dengue NS1-based diagnosis, clinical sign and symptoms were judged by expert clinical physicians and infecting DENV serotyping was done by RT-PCR. The blood cells (Platelet, Haematocrit, WBC etc) were analyzed using Haematology cell counter. Results: First, among the 112 DENV infected serum samples tested by RT-PCR, 42 were DENV positive where 76% samples had single DENV serotype infection and 24% were concurrently infected with two or more DENV serotypes, indicating that all f...Download Free PDFView PDFThe emergence of dengue in Bangladesh: Epidemiology, challenges and future disease riskDavid Harley, Elvina ViennetDownload Free PDFView PDFTropical Medicine and HealthDevastating dengue outbreak amidst COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: an alarming situationZarmina IslamDengue fever is a viral infection caused by Aedes mosquitoes that has recently expanded fast in many of the WHO member states globally. Female mosquitoes, mostly Aedes aegypti and, to a smaller degree, Aedes albopictus, disseminate dengue virus. Dengue fever has been more common in recent decades all across the world, and Bangladesh is no exception. As the COVID-19 outbreak wreaks havoc, the following rise in dengue illnesses has been a source of considerable concern. As the health care has been stretched thin in these dangerous times, the vulnerable population has been left at the mercy of these two viral infections. Lack of knowledge, major legislative changes, poor eradication initiatives, and a lack of financing resources have all contributed to the increase in numbers. Stakeholders and policymakers must begin taking meaningful actions and implementing well-thought-out adjustments immediately, or the situation will worsen, resulting in the loss of thousands of innocent lives.Download Free PDFView PDFDengue Epidemic Is a Global Recurrent Crisis: Review of the Literature2020 • Yusha ArafPurpose: This review highlights the global scenario of dengue outbreaks, dengue pathogenesis, symptoms, immune response, diagnosis methods and preventive measures which facilitates the better understanding of the global expansion and concerns relating to the disease. Recent Findings: A recent study showed that natural killer cells of the infected person become activated soon after the infection which may help in treatment and vaccine development. A research team has also produced synthetically engineered mosquitoes that can prevent the transmission and dissemination of the dengue virus by the activation of an antibody. Furthermore, a mutation in the protein envelope of the dengue virus leads to variation in shapes, developing resistance towards the vaccine. Summary: The mosquito vectors marked their worldwide distribution through an increasing number of reported cases which was further facilitated by the growth in the shipping and commerce industries.

Despite significant number of incidences and reported deaths each year, there are inadequate number of studies relating the temporal trends of the clinical parameters as well as socio-demographic factors with the clinical course of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to associate the clinical parameters, demographic and behavioral factors of the dengue patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the 2019 outbreak of dengue with the clinical course of the disease. Data were collected from the 336 confirmed dengue in-patients and analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software. Majority of the patients were male (2.2 times higher than female) who required longer time to recover compared to females (p &lt; 0.01), urban resident (54.35%) and belonged to the age group of 18–40 years (73.33%).
