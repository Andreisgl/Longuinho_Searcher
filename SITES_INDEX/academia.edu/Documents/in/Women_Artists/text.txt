Sin embargo, no bastan ni cien años para que la mujer oriental deje de resultar un verdadero intríngulis dentro de la perspectiva occidental. La fotógrafa iraní Shadi Ghadirian (Teherán, 1974) otorga su visión sobre la mujer de Oriente Próximo mediante su exposición ‘’Como todos los días’’. Se trata de su primera muestra en el Centro Cultural Internacional Oscar Niemeyer, la cual fue estrenada el 11 de enero y se clausura el 31 de marzo. La exhibición en la ciudad asturiana de Avilés marca un recorrido por las series fotográficas de Ghadirian que prueban la evolución de su trayectoria artística desde la perspectiva de género hasta un punto de vista más experiencial, aunque sin diluir la primera reflexión. Abstract: She already has less than 340 days for the new 20 years. However, there are not enough years for the Oriental woman. The Iranian photographer Shadi Ghadirian (Tehran, 1974) gives her vision on the woman of the Middle East through her exhibition "Like every day." It is his first show at the International Cultural Center, Oscar Niemeyer, which was released on January 11 and closed on March 31. The exhibition in the Asturian city of Avilés marks a journey through the photographic series of Ghadirian that prove the evolution of his artistic career from the perspective of the genre to the most experiential point of view, although without diluting the first reflection.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrea García Casal•  20  Iranian Studies, The Iran-Iraq War, Qajar photography, Women ArtistsWoman artist or feminist artist: Approaching the female gaze in Francesca WoodmanThis BA thesis defines and differentiates the concepts “feminist artist” and “woman artist” and in this, offers a more comprehensive examination of Francesca Woodman and her oeuvre by resolving whether she was a feminist artist or an... moreThis BA thesis defines and differentiates the concepts “feminist artist” and “woman artist” and in this, offers a more comprehensive examination of Francesca Woodman and her oeuvre by resolving whether she was a feminist artist or an artist who happened to be a woman.Save to LibraryDownloadby María Peguero Fontcuberta•  13  Gender Studies, Art History, Women's Studies, Contemporary ArtBecoming-cat or what a woman's body can doDrawing on a body of literature that considers narrative meaning emerging in intraspecies entanglements, in this paper I read Gwen John's letters revolving around her relationship with the many cats she lived with throughout her life.

I am particularly interested in throwing light at moments when a woman's body makes strong connections with the animal's body blurring the boundaries between humans and nonhumans through a cosmological ethics of care. In doing so, I follow trails of Deleuze's and Guattari's idea of becoming-animal, as it is fleshed out through a narrative analysis of a modernist woman artist's letters.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria  Tamboukou•  4  Narrative, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Women Artists, Epistolarity50/50; Fifty Works by Fifty British Women Artists 1900 - 1950This is the catalogue to an exhibition of the same name, which took place at the Worshipful Company of Mercers and Leeds University Art Gallery.

Rollins Prize for Best Book of the Year from the Northeast Popular Culture Association*An investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures.The Bauhaus (1919–1933) is one of the twentieth century's most influential art schools, celebrated as the archetypal movement of rational modernism and famous for bringing functional and elegant design to the masses. In Haunted Bauhaus, art historian Elizabeth Otto liberates Bauhaus history, uncovering a movement that is vastly more diverse and paradoxical than previously assumed. Otto traces the surprising trajectories of the school's engagement with occult spirituality, gender fluidity, queer identities, and radical politics. The Bauhaus, she shows us, is haunted by these untold stories.The Bauhaus is most often associated with a handful of famous artists, architects, and designers―notably Paul Klee, Walter Gropius, László Moholy-Nagy, and Marcel Breuer. Otto enlarges this narrow focus by reclaiming the historically marginalized lives and accomplishments of many of the more than 1,200 Bauhaus teachers and students (the so-called Bauhäusler), arguing that they are central to our understanding of this movement. Otto reveals Bauhaus members' spiritual experimentation, expressed in double-exposed “spirit photographs” and enacted in breathing exercises and nude gymnastics; their explorations of the dark sides of masculinity and emerging female identities in design; the “queer hauntology” of certain Bauhaus works; and the school's communist period (1928–1932), when Bauhäusler put their skills into the service of the revolution―even as Nazism emerged and entered the Bauhaus itself.With Haunted Bauhaus, Otto not only expands our knowledge of a foundational movement of modern art, architecture, and design, she also provides the first sustained investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures. This is a fresh, wild ride through the Bauhaus you thought you knew.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Otto•  20  German Studies, Gender Studies, Queer Studies, DesignPainting and Humanism in Early Modern Florentine ConventsSave to LibraryDownloadby Sheila Barker•  12  Art History, Women's Studies, Feminist Theory, Renaissance StudiesContemporary Artists as Shamans - Archival Exploration, full text and referencesShamans and artists have been perceived as similar across a variety of dimensions.

Nonetheless, these similarities have not been systematically explored and are poorly understood. This study was designed to investigate these similarities.Stanley Krippner (personal communication, January 12, 2010) provided the initial definition of a shaman that, after minor modifications to more fully represent knowledge about shamans, became: A shaman is a socially designated spiritual practitioner who obtains information in ways not available to the shaman’s community through the voluntary regulation of the shaman’s own attention, which is used for the benefit of the shaman’s community and its members.  Defining constructs were operationalized and validated cross-culturally to support multidirectional comparisons between artists and shamans using archival data from psychology, archaeology, anthropology, philosophy, art history, and creativity studies. Previous publications about 24 well-known artists provided archival data for comparisons with shamans. The dimensions explored included familial influence, talent, neurological functions, calling to vocation, social support, personality, training, initiation, inspiration, positive disintegration, transliminality, imaginal realms, altered states, purported psi experiences, mental health issues, soul retrieval, spiritual emergence, transpersonal orientation, intent to benefit, and creativity. Tables, charts, and diagrams organized archival information that, supported by descriptive comparisons, explored the nature and extent of similarities between artists and shamans. The integration of visual art, poetry, and stories provided an emic artist’s perspective and alternate ways of knowing for the reader.The study found that four artists from traditional cultures fulfilled all defining constructs of shaman, comprising a set of prototypical shamanic artists. In contrast, twenty artists fulfilled some, but not all, constructs defining shaman. These shamanlike artists were noncentral members in a fuzzy set where the shamanlike artists had family resemblances to traditional shamans and shamanic artists.The study identified and articulated gaps in knowledge as well as establishing a broad, well-grounded theoretical model that can serve as a foundation for future research on relationships between contemporary artists and shamans, and, potentially, contribute towards transformation of art experiences in artists, art audiences, and art institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Denita M Benyshek, PhD MFA MA LMHC•  12  Performing Arts, Creativity studies, Creativity, Contemporary ArtArtemisia GentileschiThis second volume in the Illuminating Women Artists series delves into the life and work of the Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi.

Today she is arguably the doyenne of the British art scene and attracts more acclaim than controversy. Her work is known by a wide audience, yet rarely receives the critical attention it deserves.In Tracey Emin: Art Into Life, writers from a range of art historical, artistic and curatorial perspectives examine how Emin's art, life and celebrity status have become inextricably intertwined. This innovative collection explores Emin's intersectional identity, including her Turkish-Cypriot heritage, ageing and sexuality, reflects on her early years as an artist, and debates issues of autobiography, self-presentation and performativity alongside the multi-media exchanges of her work and the tensions between art and craft. With its discussions of the central themes of Emin's art, attention to key works such as My Bed, and accessible theorization of her creative practice, Tracey Emin: Art into Life will interest a broad readership.Table of contentsIntroduction: The Last Great Adventure is MeDeborah Cherry, University of the Arts London UK and Alexandra Kokoli, Middlesex University, UK1.

These studies assert that even though Jewish women shared the annihilation threat with the men, Jewish women also underwent unique experiences resulting from their female physiology, their female socialization, and the National Socialist Weltanschauung directed against them. These different experiences were also expressed visually in numerous works of art made by women during the Holocaust era (1939–49). Their art is rife with images of pregnancy, motherhood, feminine crafts such as domestic chores, cooking, female solidarity and mutual assistance, loss of femininity, and sexual violence. This article focuses especially on women's artistic expression of three of these topics: mutual assistance among women, loss of femininity, and sexual violence, all of which have received little attention in Holocaust art research.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mor Presiado•  32  Gender Studies, Art History, Jewish Studies, Women's StudiesTHE REPRESENTATION OF VIOLENCE IN LATINAMERICAN WOMEN ARTISTS: The Disappeared of the South Cone and Las Muertas of JuárezSave to LibraryDownloadby Elina Norandi•  10  Argentina, Feminism, Women Artists, Frida Kahlo20. gadsimta sākuma modernā Rīgas grafiķe Alise Dmitrijeva [Early 20th Century Riga's Modern Graphic Artist Alice Dmitrijew]Save to LibraryDownloadby Baiba Vanaga•  3  Art History, Baltic Studies, Women ArtistsW Magazine: Interview with Eva StenramSave to LibraryDownloadby William J Simmons•  19  Photographs, Photogrammetry, Photography, Digital PhotographyArt, ordinary work and conceptuality: sculpting the social relations of the art worldThis research reveals the social relations of the art world through an investigation of visual artists’ ordinary art-making practices.

Drawing on extended ethnographic research, the article attends to art and ordinary work, clarifying how visual artists’ work, is not only shaped socially and historically, but also reveals tensions about what counts as art and who counts as an artist. The article clarifies how today’s art world valorises conceptual approaches – centred on mobilising concepts and ideas, while devaluing expressivist approaches – centred on accessing intuition or inspiration. The article makes visible an increasingly conceptual, academic art world in which an expressivist practice is harder to sustain. By tracing shifting forms of work and shifting social relations, the study contributes to educational research on art, while calling attention to organisational processes that deeply shape artists’ lives.KEYWORDS: Artists, feminist ethnography, social organisation, workSave to LibraryDownloadby Janna Klostermann•  7  Feminist Sociology, Education, Ethnography, Work and LabourBenjamin ConstantYour series of untitled portraits mimic and critique the colonial postcard used in the production of the "Muslim" Other and the justi cation of the "civilizing mission.

Her eloquent narrative paintings, colorful stained-glass designs, and otherworldly book illustrations conveyed morally uplifting messages for audiences in New York, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere in the United States. Between 1922 and 1924, Oakley executed a monumental, Gothic-revival painting called The Great Wonder: A Vision of the Apocalypse for the living room of Vassar College’s newly built Alumnae House. The artist also designed and furnished the living room in a hybrid medieval and Renaissance style, creating a peaceful yet visually stimulating environment which the Vassar community and visitors enjoy to this day. Drawing on the rich holdings of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center and Vassar’s Special Collections Library, this exhibition features drawings, watercolors, illustrated books, and other objects that illuminate Violet Oakley’s original decorative scheme for Alumnae House. These artworks reveal how the painter developed the dynamic composition of The Great Wonder and designed even the most intricate details of its architectural setting. Oakley’s talent for creating a total artistic environment is evident not only in this undertaking – her only surviving interior-design project – but also in the elaborate medieval pageant she orchestrated for the dedication of Alumnae House in June 1924. Considered alongside The Great Wonder and the Alumnae House living room, the objects on display attest to Oakley’s creativity and dedication to inspiring others through highly original visual means.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher Platts and +1Elizabeth Nogrady•  17  Painting, Interior Design, Women in Art, Interior Design (Architecture)Yoshimoto Into Performance Kusama ChapterThis is Chapter Three of Into Performance: Japanese Women Artists in New York.

It charts Kusama's early career from Japan to her development in New York. The 1960s was a time of incredible freedom and exploration in the art world, particularly in New York City, which witnessed the explosion of New Music, Happenings, Fluxus, New Dance, pop art, and minimalist art. Also notable during this period, although often overlooked, is the inordinate amount of revolutionary art that was created by women.Into Performance fills a critical gap in both American and Japanese art history as it brings to light the historical significance of five women artists-Yoko Ono, Yayoi Kusama, Takako Saito, Mieko Shiomi, and Shigeko Kubota. Unusually courageous and self-determined, they were among the first Japanese women to leave their country-and its male-dominated, conservative art world-to explore the artistic possibilities in New York. They not only benefited from the New York art scene, however, they played a major role in the development of international performance and intermedia art by bridging avant garde movements in Tokyo and New York.This book traces the pioneering work of these five women artists and the socio-cultural issues that shaped their careers. Into Performance also explores the transformation of these artists' lifestyle from traditionally confined Japanese women to internationally active artists. Yoshimoto demonstrates how their work paved the way for younger Japanese women artists who continue to seek opportunities in the West today.Save to LibraryDownloadby Midori Yoshimoto•  15  Contemporary Art, Multimedia, Performance Art, FluxusWas Fanny Palmer the Powerhouse Behind Currier & Ives?http://artinprint.org/article/was-fanny-palmer-the-powerhouse-behind-currier-ives/Save to LibraryDownloadby Marie-Stéphanie Delamaire•  10  Nineteenth Century United States, American art/ Art of the United States, American Visual Culture, Women ArtistsALBA PAGÁN, Ester y PÉREZ OCHANDO, Luis (Eds.): Me veo luego existo.

D'un côté, les femmes dési-reuses d'accomplir leur vocation artistique ont désormais accès à une formation publique. Il est également entendu que la réali-sation d'une carrière artistique suppose une sociabilité exté-rieure au foyer domestique considéré au XIX e siècle comme l'espace naturel de la femme : participation à des collectifs, pré-sence aux cimaises d'expositions, contact avec les acteurs du marché de l'art… Mais d'un autre côté, avec le recul historique dont nous disposons aujourd'hui, on voit que les avant-gardes ont été peu enclines à intégrer la contribution des femmes à leur essor. Ce paradoxe entre une liberté acquise de haute lutte et un champ d'action restreint au sein des avant-gardes traverse les musées publics et constitue, en cela, un angle de vue particuliè-rement intéressant sur les collections de la Ville de La Louvière.Save to LibraryDownloadby Denis Laoureux•  6  Women Artists, Belgian Artist, Hainaut, Belgian ArtThe Power of Quiet-The Work of Fiber Artist Mi-Kyoung Lee: Creating World Premiere Italian Operas in Citta' della Pieve, ItalySave to LibraryDownloadby Karen Saillant•  8  Set-based design, Women Artists, Costume Design, Fiber Arts"The Künstlerehepaar: Ideal and reality," in: Meskimmon and West, eds., Visions of the 'Neue Frau': Women and the Visual Arts in Weimar Germany, pp.28-41.The essay is a chapter in the book, "Visions of the 'Neue Frau': Women and the Visual Arts in Weimar Germany."
