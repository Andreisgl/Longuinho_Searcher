She holds a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Studies (Egyptology) from the Johns Hopkins University, 2017. She started her doctoral studies in the United States as a Fulbright scholar in 2010-12. Before this she had completed a 5-year BA (Spanish 'Licenciatura', equivalent to a British BA+MA) in History at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, being awarded at its completion the First Place National Award of Excellence in Undergraduate Academic Performance, Class of 2009 (Primer Premio Nacional de Fin de Carrera, Promoción de 2009). From 2018 to 2021 she worked as full-time fixed-term Lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool, where she returned in 2022 after spending one year as full-time permanent Lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Manchester. From 2019 to 2021 she held a Research Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen (host: Prof. Dr. Christian Leitz). Her research focuses on the literature, religion, philosophy, and society of Graeco-Roman Egypt. She is particularly interested in the study of the intellectual milieu of the Egyptian temples of the Graeco-Roman period, and the role of the Egyptian priesthood in the creation and transmission of knowledge in the Ancient and Late Antique worlds. Within this research area, she currently works on the analysis of Graeco-Egyptian astronomical/astrological and early alchemical sources, as well as the Greek Hermetica from an Egyptological perspective. She is also involved in the edition of papyri and ostraca from different international collections. She is part of the project "Traditions of Magical Knowledge. The Papyrus Magical Handbooks in Context" of the University of Chicago, which is preparing a new edition of the Graeco-Egyptian magical formularies. She is also part of the Athribis-Projekt of the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen as specialist in astronomy/astrology, in which she is editing newly discovered Demotic astrological texts.She combines her philological work with fieldwork in Egypt since 2007. She was a member of the Egypt Exploration Society/Durham University archaeological expedition to Saïs (Sa el-Hagar, Egypt) between 2007 and 2010. From 2011 to 2018 she was part of the team of the Johns Hopkins University archaeological expedition to the Mut Temple at Karnak (Luxor, Egypt), where she worked as trench supervisor and archaeological illustrator. She also has extensive archaeological experience in Spain, having worked in sites from prehistoric to medieval times.Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Richard Jasnow and Prof. Dr. Betsy Bryanless1,957 Followers506 Following10 Co-authorsTotal Views ;119 Public MentionsFollowFollowingall4 Books6 Book Chapters and Contributions in Books6 Articles (peer reviewed)1 Book Reviews11 Online Publications (link with each item)More  10 Museum Catalogue Entries1 Posters4 Articles for the General Public5 Lectures available online (link with each item) 1 Conference announcements BooksOne Who Loves Knowledge.

Despite his claiming to be “just a demoticist,” Richard Jasnow’s research interests and specialties are broad, spanning religious and historical topics, along with new editions of demotic texts, including most particularly the Book of Thoth. A number of the authors demonstrate their appreciation for Jasnow’s contributions to the understanding of this difficult text. The volume also includes other studies on literature, Ptolemaic history, and even the god Thoth himself, and features detailed images and abundant hieroglyphic, hieratic, demotic, Coptic, and Greek texts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Greek and Egyptian Magical Formularies: Text and Translation, Vol. 1by Edward O D Love, Sofia Torallas Tovar, Korshi Dosoo, Marina Escolano-Poveda, Raquel Martín-Hernández, and Panagiota  SarischouliGreek and Egyptian Magical Formularies: Text and Translation, Vol. 1,  2022The magical formularies on papyrus are precious witnesses to practices and processes of cultural ... more The magical formularies on papyrus are precious witnesses to practices and processes of cultural transmission: i.e. the creation, communication, transformation and preservation of knowledge, both in text and image, across history and between the cultures of Egypt and Greece. More than eighty such handbooks survive, some of them in a fragmentary state. This book, the work of an international team of papyrologists and historians of magic, replaces Papyri graecae magicae edited by K. Preisendanz, which appeared almost a century ago and has been used as one of the most important sources for the study of Greek magic, augmented in the 1990s by the excellent work of R. Daniel and F. Maltomini, the Supplementum Magicum. This project has collected all the known magical formularies and fully studied both their materiality and their texts.  The facing English translation with notes replaces The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, edited by H.D. Betz.  This volume, the first of two, presents the earliest of the handbooks, fifty-four in all, spanning the period from second century BCE to third century CE, in a new edition which includes the original texts in the three languages (Greek, Demotic, Coptic) with a full material description and a facing translation with commentary.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Egyptian Priests of the Graeco-Roman Period. An Analysis on the Basis of the Egyptian and Graeco-Roman Literary and Paraliterary Sources. SSR 29. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz (2020) [Table of Contents, Preface, and first pages of Introduction]Throughout Egyptian history, high-ranking Egyptian priests were the scholars responsible for the ... more Throughout Egyptian history, high-ranking Egyptian priests were the scholars responsible for the creation of the very material that constituted the core of Egyptian intellectual culture. During the first millennium BCE, and particularly in the Graeco-Roman period (late fourth century BCE–fourth century CE), they were the social group in charge of mediating and negotiating the terms of the relationship between traditional Egyptian culture and the new foreign rulers of the country. As such, they are fundamental figures for our understanding of the greater Mediterranean and Near Eastern world of the time.Marina Escolano-Poveda offers for the first time a detailed analysis of the most relevant Egyptian priestly characters from Egyptian and Graeco-Roman literary and paraliterary sources. The examination of these sources contrasts the self-presentation of Egyptian priests in texts created and circulated within the temple environment with images presented by outside sources, providing a solid base to analyze how these figures were seen in their historical milieu. In the second part of the book, the results of the previous analysis are contrasted with a series of widely-used models employed to understand the historical and intellectual context of Egyptian religion and the Egyptian priesthood in the Graeco-Roman period, questioning the usefulness and applicability of such models. Escolano-Poveda proposes new ways of understanding the role of the Egyptian priests in this context as fundamental actors in the development of the philosophical, scientific, and literary culture of the Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Antique worlds.https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/The_Egyptian_Priests_of_the_Graeco-Roman_Period/title_6581.ahtmlSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its antecedent wꜣḫ.j “columned hall” is connected to the verb wAḫj “to be inundated, to be green, to rejoice,” to suggest a more nuanced translation of wrḫ as “inundation hall.” The viability of the doublet wꜣḫj ~ wꜣḏ is examined, and the space is identified as a hall in the palace or a temple, decorated with papyriform columns, evoking a marshy environment during the most important moment in the year, the inundation. A distinction from wrḥ (“courtyard”), with which it has been erroneously conflated, is also proposed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The representation of Kalasiris as a priest, and Egyptian magic in the Aithiopika of HeliodorosAblanathanalba. Magia, cultura y Sociedad en el Mundo antiguo,  2020The Egyptian priest Kalasiris of Heliodoros’ Aithiopika is one of the most complex characters in ... more The Egyptian priest Kalasiris of Heliodoros’ Aithiopika is one of the most complex characters in the ancient Greek novels. While many studies have been devoted to him from the fields of classics and ancient philosophy, no in-depth analysis of Kalasiris has been pursued from the field of Egyptology so far. In this paper I analyze two passages of the Aithiopika: Kalasiris’ description of the two types of Egyptian wisdom in 3.16.3–4, and the necromantic ritual of the old woman of Bessa in 6.14–15. I compare the presentation of Egyptian magic and necromancy in these passages with two descriptions of necromancy in Demotic literature: the reanimations of the scribe of the divine book in the beginning of the Fight for the Armor of Inaros, and of the wife and son of Naneferkaptah in Setne I. By means of this comparison I demonstrate that the difference in Kalasiris’ dichotomy between the two types of Egyptian wisdom does not reside in the magical practices themselves, but in the degree of initiation of their practitioners and the nature of their motivations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The images that Zosimos employed in his presentation of alchemical procedures and apparatus offer us an insight into his cultural context. This paper will examine a series of passages from the works of Zosimos of Panopolis from an Egyptological perspective, contrasting them with textual and iconographic sources from the Egyptian temple milieu of Graeco-Roman Egypt. The results of this inquiry will be used to elaborate a more nuanced presentation of Zosimos’ identity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Athribis 17-36-5/1741), and the reedition of ANAsh.Mus.D.O.633, identified as part of the same group of horoscopes originating from Athribis. The first three horoscopes date to the reign of Augustus (27, 21, and 6 BCE), and the Ashmolean text to year 8 of Cleopatra, 44 BCE. The Athribis group constitutes the earliest attestation of horoscopes from Egypt. They include the date of birth, name, and origin of the native, entries for the two luminaries and the planets, and the position of the four cardines and Places. Relevant features not commonly present in other Demotic horoscopes are a series of lunar dates following the 25-year cycle of P. Rylands IV 589, the complete listing of the Places, Term rulers in the longitudes, and a short phrase that may be connected to the calculation of the length of life.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It preserves a section of two columns that record the movement of the planets for two consecutive years (Venus and a hint of Mercury in column 1, and Jupiter and Mars in column 2), indicating month, day, zodiac sign, longitude in degrees and minutes, and synodic phenomena if present. From the analysis of the information recorded I propose a dating of the data to the years 71–73 CE. The table contains the first evidence for the designation of synodic phenomena in Demotic, and allows for the proposal of an interpretation of the origin of the sign for first and last visibility used in Greek papyri. It also contains evidence for a secondary use of the sign for zero, attested in Babylonian astronomical texts as well. P. Monts.Roca inv. 314 thus provides further evidence for the transmission of astronomical knowledge from Mesopotamia to the Greek world through the mediation of Egypt.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

En muchas ocasiones, deslumbrados por la belleza de los signos, olvidamos que la escritura jeroglífica es precisamente eso, un sistema de escritura, cuya finalidad primera fue codificar la lengua en la que se expresaban los antiguos egipcios. Más adelante hablaré en detalle sobre la escritura jeroglífica, así como sobre la hierática, la demótica y la copta.

Entre ambos elementos, lengua y literatura, no obstante, nos falta por explorar una pieza clave, el elemento fundamental que nos permite acceder al estudio de los dos primeros. Estoy hablando de la escritura. La lengua egipcia no sería accesible a nosotros si no hubiese sido puesta por escrito, y su literatura, si hubiese sido transmitida únicamente de forma oral, no habría llegado hasta nosotros salvo, quizá, de forma indirecta a través de relatos inseridos en otras fuentes. Afortunadamente, los egipcios nos dejaron multitud de textos escritos sobre diversos soportes, que nos permiten emprender este estudio, tanto, digamos, del contenido (el texto en sí, lo que dice), como del continente (tanto la lengua utilizada como el sistema de escritura empleado para plasmar la primera por escrito).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cada uno de sus signos nos acerca a un aspecto del contexto vital de los egipcios antiguos, y nos permite conocer algo más sobre su cultura. Algunas inscripciones presentan tal perfección y detalle en la representación de los signos que pueden ser consideradas como verdaderas obras de arte, como las talladas en la Capilla Blanca de Sesostris I, en Karnak. En los signos de estas inscripciones, el plumaje de las aves presenta un detalle excepcional, los escarabajos están representados con una fidelidad anatómica sobresaliente, y cada signo, en definitiva, parece querer escapar de la piedra, pese a la falta de policromía, que se ha perdido y que añadiría todavía más viveza a cada uno de los jeroglíficos.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They are characterized by a central representation of Horus as a young boy, holding in his hands a series of dangerous animals, such as snakes, scorpions, lions, etc. On the back they are inscribed with magical texts. These stelae developed into specimens of smaller size that could be carried to protect their owners. This talk will present my research on the amulet-stela 2231 D, which is one example of these portable cippi. It will explore the style of the carving on the obverse, and the text on its reverse, to find its place in the artistic tradition of this type of amulets.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It combines images and texts taken from two sections of the so-called Book of Amduat, a feature that is not common in this type of papyri. This makes this piece an exceptional document for the study of textual transmission, religion and funerary beliefs in ancient Egypt.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

En efecto, uno de los elementos que configuraban la imagen que del mundo tenían los egipcios antiguos era este gran río, que hizo posible la vida a sus orillas, creando la oposición de otros dos conceptos: la Tierra Negra, es decir, el fértil valle, y la Tierra Roja, el estéril desierto. Este eje sur-norte se complementaba con otro, este-oeste, dibujado por el sol en su recorrido diario a través del cielo. Articulada en torno a estos dos puntos de referencia, la cosmovisión egipcia presenta muchos otros elementos simbólicos cuyo estudio nos permite acercarnos al modo de pensar egipcio y comprender un gran número de aspectos de esta civilización. A lo largo de esta conferencia exploraremos algunos de estos elementos simbólicos que configuraban la idea egipcia del mundo, así como las explicaciones que los egipcios crearon para el origen del mismo, sus cosmogonías. Entre otros aspectos, veremos cómo analizaban y representaban la geografía tanto de Egipto, como de los países extranjeros y del Más Allá. Por último, compararemos la cosmovisión egipcia con la de otros pueblos del Próximo Oriente para disponer de una perspectiva más amplia.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
