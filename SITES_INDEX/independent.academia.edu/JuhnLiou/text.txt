The aim was to identify evidence shedding light on the timing of the change from passive to active tectonics for this part of the continental margin since South China separated from the supercontinent of Rodinia. The results lead to two age groups, 190–200 and 88–90 Ma. These age groups, augmented by the previously published age data, suggest that they could have resulted from two Mesozoic accretion/subduction events. In addition, this mid‐late Mesozoic Tailuko belt might have also been reactivated and structurally complicated by the late Cenozoic collision/accretion of the Luzon arc with the Eurasian continent. Records of older tectonic events, such as those derived from the Japanese Islands, are absent in this metamorphic basement. An important finding of this study is the existence of the 191±10 Ma Talun metagranite, the oldest granitic intrusion ever reported in the Taiwan region and along the eastern coast area of South China. In spite of a large age uncertainty, the occurrence of this metagranite is not consistent with the apparent younging trend of Jurassic‐Cretaceous igneous activity toward the coastline in South China, and should be taken into consideration by future studies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Observed talc- and tremolite-bearing assemblages within the coexisting mafic and ultramafic rocks together with established phase relations for the simple system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O constrain the P-T path for retrograde metamorphism. This, together with reported talc occurrences from the Dora Maira massif, leads to the conclusion that UHP talc assemblages are confined to mafic and pelitic rocks of unusual chemistry, and are not stable at ultrahigh pressures in ultramafic rocks. Thus, talc cannot be an important H2O-bearing phase in deep mantle ultramafic rocks.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the eclogites, phengite is absent from the matrix but only occurs as inclusions in clinopyroxene. The clinopyroxene is zoned; the core augite contains K2O up to 0.24 wt%, whereas the rim omphacite contains secondary K-feldspar inclusions. Phengite may have been consumed during prograde reactions, and K was fixed in clinopyroxene or in a fluid/melt phase. Inclusions of clinopyroxene and garnet were identified in zircon cores, whereas garnet, rutile, quartz, and composite inclusions are present in the mantles and quartz occurs in the rims. Distribution of mineral inclusions in zoned zircons indicates that zircon cores grew at the peak UHP stage, whereas the rims grew in the quartz stability field during decompression. The composite inclusions have assemblages of albite + glass + epidote, rutile + ilmenite, quartz + rutile, and rutile + albite. The former three-phase composite inclusions have rounded outlines and triple-junction grain boundaries, suggesting crystallization from fluid or melt. During the growth of zircon from core to mantle, phengite was consumed, and new garnet, rutile and fluid/melt were formed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
