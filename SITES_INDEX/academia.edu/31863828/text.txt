Neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease, is the fastest-growing cause of death in the world. It’s getting worse every day thanks to mismanagement and misinformation. Infectious proteins known as prions are involved with most forms of neurodegenerative disease. Prion disease is known in neurology as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The operative word is “transmissible.” The global epidemic has more to do with the prion contagion than age. Dr. Stanley Prusiner, an American neuroscientist from the University of California at San Francisco, earned a Nobel Prize in 1997 for discovering and characterizing deadly prions and prion disease. Prusiner claims that all TSEs, including Alzheimer’s disease, are caused by prions. President Obama awarded Prusiner the National Medal of Science in 2010 to recognize the importance of his research. According to Prusiner, TSEs are a spectrum disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is extremely aggressive and extremely transmissible, is at the extreme end of the spectrum. Unfortunately, Prusiner’s science is being ignored and we are facing a public health disaster because of the negligence.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLand Application Of Sewage Sludge Spreading Brain DiseaseGary ChandlerIn 1972, world leaders realized that dumping millions of tons of sewage sludge into the oceans killed entire underwater ecosystems. Some nations stopped the dumping immediately, while others did not. The U.S., for example, finally passed the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988. It required dumping all municipal sewage sludge and industrial waste on land. That meant dumping it into landfills or dumping it openly on land, including farms, ranches, national forests, city parks, golf courses, playgrounds, sport fields and beyond. The Act went into effect in 1992 and it sparked a public health disaster. The practice is spreading pathogens to people, livestock, wildlife and beyond every day.Download Free PDFView PDFAlzheimer's Disease Spreading Faster Via Biosolids, Reused WaterGary ChandlerApproximately 44 million people around the world already have Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. It’s the fastest-growing cause of death in the world. Alzheimer’s disease is a member of an aggressive family of neurodegenerative diseases known as Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE). The operative word is “transmissible.” Related diseases are killing wildlife and livestock. The TSE epidemic represents an environmental nightmare that threatens every mammal on Earth. TSEs include Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. TSEs also include mad cow disease and chronic wasting disease in deer. Few, if any, mammals are immune. There is no cure and there is no species barrier. TSEs are caused by a deadly protein called a prion (PREE-on). Prion disease is unstoppable and the pathogen spreads through bodily fluids and cell tissue. Prions linger in the environment, homes, hospitals, nursing homes, dental offices, restaurants and many other places infinitely. They migrate, mutate, multiply and kill with unparalleled efficiency. Prions defy all attempts at sterilization and inactivation. Victims of the disease can spread the disease even further via bodily fluids and cell tissue. Victims often are contagious long before they appear sick.Download Free PDFView PDFMad Cow Disease A Symptom Of Bigger ProblemsGary ChandlerPrion Disease Never An Isolated Event Mad cow disease has again raised its ugly head in the United States. Thanks to misinformation and mismanagement by government, the problem will persist. Government and industry representatives announced yesterday that an 11-year-old beef cow in Alabama tested positive for prion disease. Also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the disease is always fatal and a major concern for producers and consumers alike. It was detected after the cow showed clinical signs of sickness at an Alabama livestock market. This animal never entered slaughter channels and at no time presented a risk to the food supply, or to human health in the United States, the U.S.D.A. said. Unfortunately, this producer did attempt to sell a very sick animal to an unsuspecting buyer. He obviously has a farm or ranch that is contaminated. The sick animal added to the contamination on the farm with its urine, feces and saliva. It also infected the livestock auction site. Sun and oxygen do not deplete prions. In fact, they can mutate and multiply in some soil and migrate away via the wind and water runoff. The Problem With Prions Each prion victim is a symptom of a much bigger threat to food safety, water quality and public health. Prion disease has been detected in livestock around the world. Of the five confirmed occurrences of BSE in cattle in the United States, this is the second in Alabama., but the vast majority of beef and dairy cattle are not tested thanks to intense lobbying from cattle producers and food companies. Unfortunately, livestock producers, farmers and other land owners are being duped into a false sense of security and many are unwittingly participating in high-risk production practices that expose livestock, wildlife and people to deadly prions. To purge the threat of prion disease from the food supply, it’s time to manage prion pathways like we handle all biohazards. It’s time for government agencies to stop spreading misinformation and stop promoting risky production practices, including the dumping of infectious waste on farms, ranches, golf courses, parks and playgrounds. Cities are now dumping their highly infectious sewage sludge, also known as biosolids, on open land across the U.S.—especially in rural areas. It’s bioterrorism. It’s fueling the spike in Alzheimer’s disease, autism, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, chronic wasting disease and mad cow disease. It’s also fueling cancer, endocrine disruption and more.Download Free PDFView PDFAlzheimer's Disease Fueled By Mismanaged SewageGary ChandlerThe Alzheimer's disease epidemic is spreading rapidly.

Why the divergence? Unfortunately, a pathogen associated with neurological disease is spreading uncontrollably. Research suggests that food and water supplies around the world have been contaminated with an unstoppable form of protein known as a prion (PREE-on). Ignorance, negligence, fraud and corruption are fanning the flames today. We’re facing an environmental nightmare. According to health officials, the epidemic will spread exponentially. The protein epidemic includes Alzheimer’s disease, mad cow disease, chronic wasting disease (deer) and many others. There is no species barrier. Some people die within weeks of symptoms, while others take years. There is no cure. At least 45 million people around the world already have Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. Millions of other cases are undiagnosed and misdiagnosed. Doctors have suppressed millions of other diagnoses. The epidemic is worse than the public knows. Misinformation is compounding the problem and contributing to the spread of a deadly pathogen.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Environmental EngineeringPrions: Novel Pathogens of Environmental Concern?2006 • Joel PedersenDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental Science & TechnologyPersistence of Pathogenic Prion Protein during Simulated Wastewater Treatment Processes2008 • Joel PedersenDownload Free PDFView PDFArchives of Medical ResearchPrions: Who Should Worry about Them?2005 • Javier EnaDownload Free PDFView PDFVirus ResearchTubulovesicular structures are a consistent (and unexplained) finding in the brains of humans with prion diseases2008 • Jean-jacques Hauw, Pawel LiberskiDownload Free PDFView PDFPRION PROTEIN AS A PATHOGEN: A REVIEWScholar Science JournalsPrion proteins (PrP) are associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), which are invariably fatal diseases characterized by loss of motor control, dementia, and paralysis wasting. The " protein-only " hypothesis proposes that TSEs are caused by the conversion of a ubiquitous " cellular form " of PrP (PrP C) into an aggregated " scrapie form " (PrP Sc). According to this model, the prion protein (PrP) would at the same time be target and infectious agent in TSEs, which could explain that this class of diseases can be traced to infectious, inherited, and spontaneous origins. PrP Sc is characterized by high β-sheet content whereas PrP C is a soluble protein with a high content of α-helices and high susceptibility to proteolytic digestion. Human TSEs include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and kuru, and there is bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle and scrapie in sheep.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
