Abstract
The new economy and its neoliberal ethos raise questions about the “capital” of hyperpolyglots, and whether they perceive it as such, particularly with regards to the hegemonic growth of English as deployed in the new economy. This paper explores the literature on languages in the new economy, and suggests that the International Association of Hyperpolyglots does not share the neoliberal ethos of the new economy, even as its members appear adept at navigating its dynamics. 
Keywords: polyglot, hyperpolyglot, HYPIA, polyglotism, multilingualism, language acquisition
