This article presents 41 contemporary viewpoints on transpersonal psychology, solicited from international scholars and new voices as well as from leading theorists and practitioners. These responses represent a sizeable spectrum of perspectives, and offer a framework around which the reader is invited to contemplate both foundational themes and shifting emphases within transpersonal psychology. The diversity of views is offered as a document to reflect the contemporary conversation about the field, as a stimulus for further dialogue and critical reflection, and as a support for innovative and emerging perspectives within transpersonal psychology.

Following this historical overview to transpersonal research methods, the essay explores some of the unique characteristics of transpersonal researchers and scholars and unique risks involved in transpersonal research and scholarship especially projection and narcissism. The essay concludes, with a brief discussion of the role of independent scholarship among the next generation of transpersonal researchers and scholars, their needs for training and networking, and recent progress made to meet some of these needs worldwide. Note that the content of this article results from an interview with Jacqui Linder for the Alubrat Transpersonal Conference 2015 in Brazil recorded and produced by Canadian Broadcaster Mike Linder. This interview can be found on Rosemarie Anderson's YouTube website, https://www.youtube.com/c/RosemarieandersonVideo. Spanish Abstract: Resumen Este breve ensayo relata la historia sobre cómo Rosemarie Anderson y el recientemente fallecido William Braud, llegaron a la conclusión de que la dinámica esencial para la investigación y estudio de lo transpersonal, es la voluntad de los investigadores para comprometerse con lo Sagrado, en un viaje de transformación −un viaje que implica tanto la propia comprensión del tema de estudio como a ellos mismos como seres humanos. Siguiendo una visión histórica de los métodos de in-vestigación transpersonal, el ensayo explora algunas de las únicas características de los investiga-dores y estudiosos transpersonales, así como los riesgos involucrados en la investigación y estudio transpersonal, especialmente la proyección y el narcisismo. El ensayo concluye con una breve re-flexión sobre el papel que tiene la formación para la nueva generación de investigadores y acadé-micos transpersonales, sus necesidades de aprendizaje y trabajo en equipo, así como los logros conseguidos hasta ahora para satisfacer estas necesidades en todo el mundo.

This question is critical in regard to the status of transpersonal psychology. There can be no doubting the level of general and popular interest in the integration of spiritual and/or mystical systems 1 with psychology which transpersonal psychology promotes. However, the extent to which transpersonal psychology sits easily amongst other academic disciplines, or indeed within the broad church of psychology, is far from clear. From Wikipedia we learn that ―An academic discipline, or field of study, is a branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level.‖ 2 The area of knowledge that interests me as a transpersonal psychologist concerns the nature of consciousness and the mind specifically in relation to the transformative potential of attaining enriched, or more fulfilling, states of being. The term ‗transpersonal' applies as a consequence of such states entailing going beyond the mundane aspect of personality. I recognise that there is much in the foregoing that needs clarifying, but my major concern in this short article lies with the ways of advancing such knowledge—the issue of research, and how transpersonal psychology meets this criterion of being a discipline. After all, the primary connotation of the term ‗discipline' involves adhering to rules, and a fundamental question revolves around the extent to which transpersonal psychology adheres to the rules that govern research in psychology. The fact is that it is not the knowledge base that has led to transpersonal psychology having an uneasy relationship with mainstream academic psychology. 3 Indeed, many of the topics that would have been viewed as lying within the domain of transpersonal psychology in its formative period in the 1970s—altered states of consciousness, and the effects of meditation, including mindfulness, for example—have clearly entered the mainstream. But they have done so devoid of any ‗transpersonal' tag. Why should this term be problematic? In this article I identify three issues which have contributed to the questionable status of transpersonal psychology for many. My major purpose is not simply to identify these issues (nor to sweep them under the carpet, as some have done) but to extol them and point out why they make of transpersonal psychology not only a distinctive discipline but one which is vital for psychology as a whole.Download Free PDFView PDFTranspersonal psychology: Defining the past, divining the future2007 • Glenn HarteliusABSTRACT: Retrospective analysis of definitions published over some 35 years suggests the major subject areas of the field can be summed up in three themes: beyond-ego psychology, integrative/holistic psychology, and psychology of transformation. Theme frequency analysis reveals that early emphasis on alternative states of consciousness has moderated into a broader approach to human transcendence, wholeness, and transformation. This expanded definition of transpersonal psychology suggests the field has much in common with integral psychology. As a comprehensive, historically based content summary, this tripartite definition contributes a small but vital piece to the foundation of a transpersonal vision that is spreading across the globe. While transpersonal psychology still needs to embody the inclusiveness and diversity that it represents, its vision is one of great relevance to the contemporary human condition.Download Free PDFView PDFPhilosophical Foundations of Transpersonal Psychology: An Introduction to Some Basic Issues2002 • Donald RothbergIn this essay, I want to provide some of the groundwork for an articulation of the philosophical foundations of transpersonal psychology. I will first show the centrality of the theory of a &quot;hierarchical ontology&quot; in transpersonal work, and the need for clarification and examination of the core claims associated with such a theory. Then I will identify some basic objections to a hierarchical ontology associated with three main approaches in contemporary philosophy. Finally, I willsuggest the outlines of a response to and resolution of these main objections. My thesis is that these objections are misguided when directed against the most profound aspects of hierarchical ontologies, but that taking the objections seriously can be helpful if the objections are re-interpreted as pointing to typical distortions of transpersonal approaches. Hence, it is important to appropriate insights into such distortions while transcending the typically reductionistic conclusions and limited ...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Transpersonal StudiesTranspersonal is a Whole Person Psychology (Editor’s Introduction)2016 • Glenn HarteliusDownload Free PDFView PDFClarifying issues in transpersonal psychology: Beyond the myths.
