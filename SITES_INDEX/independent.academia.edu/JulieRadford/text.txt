We include children with specific speech and language difficulties (SSLD) (Dockrell et al 2006). We also include deaf children from hearing families who are being educated in a natural oral environment (using hearing aids or cochlear implants). Our main research interest concerns how such children are provided with opportunities for language learning through discourse with their teacher (a familiar adult), the ways in which they demonstrate uptake of these opportunities and the role of non-verbal resources of gaze and gesture in such discourse. Although sharing a storybook is a frequently used context for language learning with all young children, rarely has the discourse been examined from a multi-modal perspective. In particular, in this chapter we intend to explore how the child’s use of speech, gesture and gaze is coordinated with the adult’s verbal and non-verba...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Increasing Learner Authority in the Classrooms of Children with Speech, Language and Communication NeedsClassroom talk is typically asymmetric since teachers retain high authority for the information. ... more Classroom talk is typically asymmetric since teachers retain high authority for the information. Yet downgrading teacher authority is crucial for the education of children with special needs. The data involve teachers and children with primary language difficulties. Teacher topic initiations (e.g. ‘tell me about’) signal that the child has more authority for talking about the topic at hand. Topic invitations are strongly suited to the children’s involvement in decisions about topical content. When teachers correct the children’s grammar or phonology, without exposure, the children do not tend to produce the correct item; but when they expose the corrections the children do tend to produce the correct item. Finally, correction-initiations that target the location or the nature of the trouble generate more information from the children and their authority is increased.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As most of the business that is conducted in classrooms is through language, the quality of the interaction is of paramount importance. High quality spoken language is needed for children’s learning (of both their native language and curriculum subjects) because it fosters active and empowered pupils. The best possible discourse in classrooms is therefore a major priority in children’s early years (DCSF 2008a). The international inclusion agenda has meant that youngsters with special educational needs (SEN) are educated largely in the general education classrooms (Giangreco, Doyle and Suter 2013). The main purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to show how to increase the participation of children with SEN through high quality classroom interaction. In order to meet the interests of readers of this volume, rather than all children with SEN, the fo...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
