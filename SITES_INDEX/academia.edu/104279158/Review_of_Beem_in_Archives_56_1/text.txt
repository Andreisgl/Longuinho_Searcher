The book begins promisingly, with an introduction sporting useful definitions and a literature survey that assesses the status of queenship studies today in a way that is inviting and engaging. Indeed, the lucid writing throughout the book is one of its strengths. The next five chapters take on each of the case studies (with Russia being separated out from the Baltic kingdoms into its own chapter). Each chapter highlights one queen or empress (respectively Mary, Queen of Scots; Anne of Austria, queen of France; Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary and sovereign of the Habsburg lands; Bona Sforza, queen of Poland and grand duchess of Lithuania; and Catherine II the Great, empress of Russia), but actually treats the entire early modern period (and more than just one queen). We learn that 'British queenship went through several distinct phases' (p. 78), with Mary I, Elizabeth I and perhaps Anne creating a template for regnant queens that was acknowledged and consulted well outside England for centuries; and Elizabeth of York, Catherine of Aragon and perhaps Mary of Modena perfecting in their own ways the early modern archetype of queens as consorts. In France, we see queens as dynastic figures who sometimes, as in the cases of Marie de Medici and Anne of Austria, could exercise vast powers as dowagers, though few had what Beem calls 'companionate' marriages with their royal husbands; while in Spain the traditional roles of motherhood, piety and beneficence became linked and identified with the formal affections of their spouses. The Habsburg and Polish queens dutifully followed the 'companionate marriage model' (p. 201), focusing on motherhood, religious observance andSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSlavonic and Eastern Review, 91/4 (2013) 787-819The Ethiopian and the Elephant: Louise-Marie Gonzaga and queenship in an elective monarchy, 1645–1667’2013 • Robert I FrostMost of the literature on queenship in early modern Europe concentrates on queens consort in hereditary monarchy, where the role of the queen as the mother of the heir could confer upon her considerable influence. This article examines the very different dynamics of queenship in an elective monarchy This article analyses the position of queens consort in an elective monarchy through an examination of the relationship between Louise Marie Gonzaga, queen of Poland-Lithuania (1645-48; 1649-67) and her second husband, King John Casimir (1648-68). It suggests that this relationship was far more complex than the traditional picture of a weak and subservient husband dominated by his forceful wife. It shows how Louise Marie was able to establish an important political role for herself, and argues that the royal marriage was far more of a political partnership than is usually suggested.Download Free PDFView PDFFemale Rule in Imperial Russia: Is Gender a Useful Category for Historical Analysis?Orel BeilinsonThis synthesis chapter seeks to explain and briefly analyze the phenomenon of female rule in eighteenth-century Russia.

Glorification of Power2017 • Liya OkroshidzeThe victory of the Earl of Richmond (the future Henry VII) over Richard III marked the beginning of the new era. The reign of the first member of the Tudor's dynasty was a transitional step between the Middle Ages and Early New Age. The crucial moment has allowed England to re-open to foreign artists who attached art of the country to European Renaissance culture. Events of English history always had reflected on pages of manuscripts during the Middle Ages. In XVIth century portrait painting was also reflecting the sociopolitical life of the country. A great number of members of noble families died in the struggle for the throne. And when the Tudors took the power, they had to “tell things” about themselves and the portrait was perfect for this purpose. Despite the many different circumstances, Henry VII obtained the English throne. That's why he tried to prove the legitimacy of his presence on the English throne all his life. The deification of the monarch was paralleled with attempts to describe his personal features. First mentioning about his appearance belongs to contemporaries like Polydore, Virgil and Bernard André. It is noteworthy that these descriptions are very reliable – we can verify this just by looking at the many portraits of the king.Download Free PDFView PDFVirtuous or Villainess?
