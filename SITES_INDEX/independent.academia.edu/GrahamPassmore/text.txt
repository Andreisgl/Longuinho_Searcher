It explores how through a combination approach, ISA and mentoring can help develop and enhance professional identity by providing insights into issues, conflicts and concerns that trainee teachers can work through with the help of a mentor. The chapter builds on previous work that considered how the combined approach can help trainee teachers develop their professional identity during their training. In its consideration of a combined ISA and mentoring approach to identity crisis, the chapter also explores the psychology of stress and how knowledge of professional identity can be applied to mediate the negative effects of high stress in the workplace. This is also discussed in terms of professional development programmes and mentoring schemes which aim to increase the retention of qualified teachers, currently experiencing a crisis within the United Ki...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The need to increase our understanding of structural knowledge through improved assessment is made evident in a review of research that indicates that its quality is related to problem-solving abilities. The new scale is derived from Biggs and Collis&#39; (1982) Structure of the Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy and Rumelhart and Norman&#39;s (1978) modes of learning (structuring, accretion, and tuning). It is applied to link descriptions in an enhanced concept map structure that has been dubbed the &quot;concept map+.&quot; Eight levels link quality can be recognized with the new scale. This builds on the original concept assessment scale of Novak and Gowin (1984) where just three types of link quality were acknowledged.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Use of Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) As an Aid to Assessment and Formulation of Social AnxietyInternational Journal of Indian PsychologyThis case study takes an approach to the assessment and formulation of social anxiety that makes ... more This case study takes an approach to the assessment and formulation of social anxiety that makes use of Identity Structure Analysis (Weinreich, 2003) alongside ratings obtained from the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Identity Structure Analysis uses a socio-developmental psychological approach to identity formation that places emphasis on biographical development in socio-historical settings. In doing so it offers insights into the nature of social anxiety. More particularly, ISA reveals (at various biographical stages) construals of identities of self and of the identities of influential others in various life domains (social, home, and work). It is proposed that ISA findings offer insights that might be used alongside conventional psychometrics serving as an aid to the assessment and formulation of social anxiety for the purposes of augmented CBT.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study, nine pre-service teachers worked in group (three groups of two and one group of three) to deliver a series of seven lessons via desktop videoconference from a Faculty of Education to elementary students in their classroom. Method. Each group delivered 2 lessons over a 4-week period. During delivery, the lessons were archived to disk. Each pre-service teacher viewed the performance and submitted reflec-tive advice for improvement to an asymnchronous text thread before planning for the next lesson began. The archived lessons where subsequently examined for evidence of high and low-level teaching practice against performance indicators of a modified version of the On-tario Teacher Performance Appraisal Manual. The modified Manual contains 37 indicators in three teaching domains: professional knowledge, teaching practice, commitment to pupils and pupil learning. Results. Low scores were found on all seven indicators of professional knowledge and there was a ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
