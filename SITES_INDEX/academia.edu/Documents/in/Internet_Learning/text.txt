The Quality Matters (QM)™ rubric presents a set of research-based standards on which to judge the quality of online courses. The authors of this study investigated how students’ perceptions of online course quality compare to those put forth in the QM rubric. Participants in this study n = 3,160 included students currently taking an online college-level course were invited to rate the importance of each QM standard restated from the student perspective. Students’ ratings of each item were compared to the ranking of each item received by QM (3-Essential, 2-Very Important, or 1-Important). The student rating for each item was at least 1.0 indicating that students do value the QM criteria as important to their success in an online course.

This idea intersects with lifestyle choice and reactions to the domination of the West's world view through the e-Learning of the internet. There are real terrorists who use the internet as a means of camouflage, concealment and a way to organise virtually. Secondly, there are also those who use the internet as a hacking playground, subverting dominant codes in a different way to the terrorists. Thirdly, there is the negativity, boredom and repetition that endless access to information can induce. This type of virtual terrorism is best described through affect and a new form of western nihilism.Save to LibraryDownloadby David R  Cole•  84  Social Change, Information Science, Music, PhilosophyContinuous Improvement of the QM Rubric and Review Processes: Scholarship of Integration and ApplicationQuality Matters (QM) is a faculty-centered, peer review process that is designed to certify the quality of online and blended courses.

QM is a leader in quality assurance for online education and has received national recognition for its scalable, peer-based approach and continuous improvement in online education and student learning. Regular, robust review and refreshment of the Quality Matters RubricTM and processes keep them current, practical, and applicable across academic disciplines and academic levels. The review ensures validity in the set of quality standards that make up the Rubric. An overview of the regular review of the QM RubricTM and process, as well as examples of the use of data to continuously improve the Rubric and process are presented. The guiding principles of QM–a process that is continuously improved upon and that is collegial and collaborative–are discussed in relationship to Boyer’s scholarship of application and scholarship of integration.
