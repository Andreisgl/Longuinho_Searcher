The focus is on biographical profiles of West African people during the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which is an innovative approach to social history. The representation of enslaved Africans has typically been numbers recorded in logs and accounts compiled by slave merchants and captains. Freedom Narratives is an open-source relational database that reveals the people who constitute those numbers.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHistory in AfricaEditors’ Introduction: “The Future of the African Past”2021 • egodi uchenduWe signed on as the new editorial team of History in Africa (HIA) without knowing that we all sat on the precipice of tumultuous times. After over a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, global unrest calling for a reckoning on racial justice, and events that exposed the limits and fragility of democratic institutions, we are reminded of the importance of how people experience, remember, and chronicle the past. It is a weighty and fortuitous time to think about our craft as historians and how we develop methods for analyzing and revisiting sources. How do we want to highlight our unique approaches as historians of Africa, and how do we want to push our field of African history and our discipline of history, more broadly, in new directions? We salute and thank the previous team of HIA editors – Jan Jansen, Michel Doortmont, John Hanson, and Dmitri van den Bersselaar – for their excellent stewardship of the journal over many years.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of African History(2019) AFRICAN VOICES FROM THE CONGO COAST: LANGUAGES AND THE POLITICS OF IDENTIFICATION IN THE SLAVE SHIP JOVEM MARIA2019 • Marcos Abreu Leitão de AlmeidaDownload Free PDFView PDFHistory in AfricaThe "Ketu Nation" of Brazilian Candomblé in Historical Context2021 • Lisa Earl CastilloThe Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomblé arose during the Atlantic slave trade and has unmistakable Yorùbá influences. In the city of Salvador, the term nação ketu [Ketu nation] is used among the oldest temples in describing Yorùbá heritage. This has led some scholars to assume that the founders came from the Yorùbá kingdom by that name. This paper critically examines the idea of Kétu origins, taking as a case study the temple Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká, a national historic heritage site in Brazil that is recognized by UNESCO as a site of diasporic memory. The paper shows that the first generations of leadership were dominated by people from Ọ̀yo ̣́and that the term ketu emerged not as an allusion to ethnic origins but perhaps as a metaphor for a heterogeneous cultural context in which Yorùbá speakers from disparate regions lived in close coexistence. Résumé: La religion afro-brésilienne du Candomblé est née pendant la traite des esclaves de l'Atlantique et connait des influences yoruba indéniables. Dans la ville de Salvador, le terme nação ketu [nation Ketu] est utilisé parmi les plus anciens temples pour décrire l'héritage Yorùbá. Cela a conduit certains chercheurs à supposer que les fondateurs venaient du royaume Yorùbá de ce nom. Cet article examine de manière critique l'idée des origines de Kétu, en prenant comme étude de cas le temple Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká, un site du patrimoine historique national du Brésil reconnu par l'Unesco comme site de mémoire diasporique. L'article montre que les premières générations de dirigeants de ce temple étaient dominées par des personnes d'Ọỳo ̣́et que le terme « ketu » n'est pas apparu comme une allusion aux origines ethniques, mais comme la métaphore d'un contexte culturel hétérogène dans lequel les locuteurs de yorùbá de régions disparates vivaient en étroite coexistence.Download Free PDFView PDFDireito PúblicoOs Livros de Batismo e a Arte de Burlar a Legislação de Proibição do Tráfico Internacional de EscravizadosErika Melek Delgado, Nina BorbaEste artigo objetiva questionar as razões pelas quais um número significativo de africanos escravizados teve seus batismos registrados na Igreja de Santo Amaro de Ipitanga, apesar de viverem em Salvador, muitas léguas de distância da dita Matriz. A hipótese aberta é de que após o alvará de 1831 (que proibia o tráfico internacional de escravos), senhores de engenho na região de Brotas começaram a batizar seus escravizados em capelas privadas e registrá-los em locais distantes, como a Igreja de Santo Amaro de Ipitanga. Tais atos eram uma estratégia para contornar as leis brasileiras de proibição do tráfico internacional de escravizados. Para a análise de vasta documentação que aborda um período de cem anos, pré e pós proibição do tráfico, utilizamos os dados pessoais de africanos que constam no banco de dados do projeto Freedom Narratives. A análise de trajetórias pessoais e movimentação espacial foi feita a partir de um exame comparativo possível através da metodologia criada pelo pr...Download Free PDFView PDFSocial Science HistorySocioeconomic Status and Group Belonging: Evidence from Early-Nineteenth-Century Colonial West Africa2022 • Stefania GalliThis study provides a novel analysis of occupational stratification in Sierra Leone from a historical perspective. By employing census data for early-nineteenth-century colonial Sierra Leone, the present study offers a valuable snapshot of a colony characterized by a heterogenous population of indigenous and migratory origin. The study shows that an association between colonial group categorization and socioeconomic status existed despite the colony being of very recent foundation implying a hierarchical structure of the society. Although Europeans and "mulattoes" occupied most high-status positions, as common in the colonies, indigenous immigrants were also represented in high socioeconomic strata thanks to the opportunities stemming from long-and short-distance trading. However, later arrivals, especially liberated slaves, belonged within the lowest socioeconomic strata of the society and worked as farmers or unskilled labor, suggesting that the time component may also have influence socioeconomic opportunities.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of African HistoryThe Diaspora of Africans Liberated from Slave Ships in the Nineteenth Century2014 • David EltisThis article uses the extensive documentation of Africans liberated from slave vessels to explore issues of identity and freedom in the nineteenth-century Atlantic world. It tracks the size, origin, and movement of the Liberated African diaspora, offers a preliminary analysis of the ‘disposal’ of African recaptives in societies on both sides of the Atlantic, and assesses the opportunities Liberated Africans had in shaping their post-disembarkation experiences. While nearly all Liberated Africans were pulled at least partly into the Atlantic wage economy, the article concludes that recaptive communities in Freetown and its hinterland most closely met the aspirations of the Liberated Africans themselves while the fate of recaptives settled in the Americas paralleled those who were enslaved.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of AfricanHistoryAbolition and the Registration of Slaves and Libertos in Portuguese Mozambique, 1856-762021 • Edward AlpersBeginning in 1856 and ending in 1876, Portuguese colonial authorities in Mozambique registered almost 55,000 enslaved and freed Africans (libertos). The sources for these twinned registration processes are located in the national archives of Portugal and Mozambique. Fragments of the originals survive for only six of the ten districts of the colony, but contemporary copies exist for nearly all districts. Combined, they provide a unique opportunity to understand both the extent of slaveryas opposed to the export slave tradeand the process of abolition in late-nineteenth-century Mozambique. In this article we first describe the registers themselves, then focus on the registration of enslaved and freed Africans, the resistance of slaveholders, and the kinds of information that we can glean from the registers. We also explore the ways in which freed Africans were employed after registration and the extent to which being a liberto implied 'freedom'. Finally, we consider how the registration led to new laws and policies in Portuguese Africa, opening a new era of European colonialism and imperial expansion.Download Free PDFView PDFHistory in AfricaRedefining African Regions for Linking Open-Source Data2019 • Edward AlpersIn recent years, an increasing number of online archival databases of primary sources related to the history of the African diaspora and slavery have become freely and readily accessible for scholarly and public consumption. This proliferation of digital projects and databases presents a number of challenges related to aggregating data geographically according to the movement of people in and out of Africa across time and space. As a requirement to linking data of open-source digital projects, it has become necessary to delimit the entire continent of precolonial Africa during the era of the slave trade into broad regions and sub-regions that can allow the grouping of data effectively and meaningfully.Download Free PDFView PDFUsing African Names to Identify the Origins of Captives in the Transatlantic Slave Trade: Crowd-Sourcing and the Registers of Liberated Africans, 1808-1862Daniel  Domingues, Richard P Anderson, Alex BoruckiBetween 1808 and 1862, officers primarily from the British navy liberated approximately 175,000 enslaved Africans from transatlantic slavers. Information on more than half of this group has survived in bound ledger books. Based on the assessment of extant data for more than 92,000 Liberated Africans whose information was copied in at times duplicate and triplicate form in both London- and Freetown-based registers, this essay explores the pitfalls and possibilities associated with using the Registers for Liberated Africans as sources for historical analysis of the slave trade. The article explains the relationship of multiple copies of the registers to each other, demonstrates the link between the African names they contain and ethnolinguistic identities, argues for crowd-sourcing – drawing on the knowledge of the diasporic public and not just scholars – and, finally, shows the importance of such an approach for pre-colonial African history.Entre 1808 et 1862, les officiers de la Marine Britannique libérèrent environ 175,000 esclaves africains des négriers transatlantiques. Ils furent amenés par la suite à Freetown, à la Havane, et à d’autres ports où leurs noms et des informations personnelles furent inscrits dans les régistres relies. En se servant des données sur plus de 92,000 de ces Africains libérés, cet article s’interroge sur la possibilité d’utiliser les Registers for Liberated Africans comme sources d’analyse historique de la traite des esclaves. La relation entre les régistres différents mentionnant les mêmes individus est examinée, ainsi que les liens possibles entre noms africains et identités ethnolinguistiques. En proposant comme méthode d’analyse le “crowd-sourcing,” à savoir, l’appel aux connaissances des publiques diasporiques au lieu de se limiter au savoir des experts, l’étude montre le besoin d’une telle approche dans l’étude de l’histoire de l’Afrique précoloniale.Download Free PDFView PDFComparative Studies in Society and HistoryThe Adjudication of Slave Ship Captures, Coercive Intervention, and Value Exchange in Comparative Atlantic Perspective, ca. 1839–18702020 • jake richardsWhat were the consequences of creating jurisdictions against the transatlantic slave trade in the nineteenth-century Atlantic world? Answering this question requires a comparative focus on the courts of mixed commission that adjudicated naval captures of slave ships, located at Sierra Leone (the foremost site of British abolition) and Brazil (the primary mid-century target). Court jurisdiction conflicted with sovereign jurisdiction regarding the presence of recaptives (“liberated Africans”), the risk of re-enslavement, and unlawful naval captures. To rescue the re-enslaved and compensate the loss of property, regulating anti-slave-trade jurisdiction involved coercive strategies alternating with negotiated value exchanges. Abolition as a legal field emerged from interactions between liberated Africans, British diplomatic and naval agents, and local political elites in Brazil and on the Upper Guinea Coast.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
