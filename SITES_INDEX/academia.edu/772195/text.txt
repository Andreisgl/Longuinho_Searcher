At this time, the sickness or death of a child was a common occurrence – over a quarter of young people died before the age of fifteen – and yet this subject has received little scholarly attention. The book takes three perspectives: first, it investigates medical understandings and treatments of children. It argues that a concept of ‘children’s physic’ existed amongst doctors and laypeople: the young were thought to be physiologically distinct, and in need of special medicines. Secondly, the book examines the family’s experience, demonstrating that parents devoted considerable time and effort to the care of their sick offspring, and experienced feelings of devastating grief upon their illnesses and deaths. Thirdly, the book takes the viewpoint of sick children themselves, offering rare and intimate insights into the emotional, spiritual, physical, and social dimensions of sickness, pain, and death. It asserts that children’s experiences were characterised by profound ambivalence: whilst young patients were often tormented by feelings of guilt, fears of hell, and physical pain, sickness could also be emotionally and spiritually uplifting, and a source of much attention and love from parents. Drawing on a wide array of printed and archival sources, The Sick Child will be of interest to scholars working in the interconnected fields of the history of medicine, childhood, parenthood, bodies, emotion, pain, death, religion, and gender.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMedical History''"Very Sore Nights and Days": The Child's Experience of Illness in Early Modern England, c. 15801720', Medical History, 55 (2011), 153–182 2011 • Hannah  NewtonSick children were ubiquitous in early modern England, and yet they have received very little attention from historians. Taking the elusive perspective of the child, this article explores the physical, emotional, and spiritual experience of illness in England between approximately 1580 and 1720. What was it like being ill and suffering pain? How did the young respond emotionally to the anticipation of death? It is argued that children’s experiences were characterised by profound ambivalence: illness could be terrifying and distressing, but also a source of emotional and spiritual fulfilment and joy. This interpretation challenges the common assumption amongst medical historians that the experiences of early modern patients were utterly miserable. It also sheds light on children’s emotional feelings for their parents, a subject often overlooked in the historiography of childhood. The primary sources used in this article include diaries, autobiographies, letters, the biographies of pious children, printed possession cases, doctors’ casebooks, and theological treatises concerning the afterlife.Download Free PDFView PDFSocial History of Medicine'Children's Physic: Medical Perceptions and Treatment of Sick Children in Early Modern England, c. 15801720', Social History of Medicine, 23 (2010), 456-742010 • Hannah  NewtonDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Dying Child in Seventeenth-Century EnglandHannah  NewtonThe emerging field of pediatric palliative care recommends that terminally ill children and their parents engage in compassionate and honest communication about the end of life. Extensive clinical experience and research attests that young patients often derive comfort from asking questions, sharing their hopes and fears, and receiving loving reassurance. Nevertheless, these conversations can be extremely challenging, both for parents and clinicians. Seeing how parents in the past approached this sensitive subject provides food for thought. The following discussions draw on my book, The Sick Child in Early Modern England, which is based on the analysis of hundreds of diaries, letters, and medical texts from c.1580 to 1720. At this time, almost a third of children died before the age of fifteen. Rather than shielding their offspring from these foreboding facts, parents encouraged their children to think about their own mortality, even before illness struck. The intention was make mortality familiar to the young, thereby taking the fear out of the unknown. It was part of the ‘preparation for death’, a religious process that was designed to help the individual to reach a state of peaceful acceptance, and even happiness, about dying. The article explores this preparation process.Download Free PDFView PDFChildren's Physic: Medical Perceptions and Treatment of Sick Children in Early Modern England, c.1580-1720Hannah  NewtonDownload Free PDFView PDFHistoire culturelle de l'EuropeThe medical gaze on early childhood between the 16th and 18th centuries2017 • CLAUDIA PANCINODownload Free PDFView PDFMisery to Mirth: Recovery from Illness in Early Modern EnglandHannah  NewtonThe history of early modern medicine often makes for depressing reading. It implies that people fell ill, took ineffective remedies, and died. This book seeks to rebalance and brighten our overall picture of early modern health by focusing on the neglected subject of recovery from illness in England, c.1580-1720. Drawing on an array of archival and printed materials, Misery to Mirth shows that recovery did exist conceptually at this time, and that it was a widely reported phenomenon. The book takes three main perspectives: the first is physiological or medical, asking what doctors and laypeople meant by recovery, and how they thought it occurred. This includes a discussion of convalescent care, a special branch of medicine designed to restore strength to the patient’s fragile body after illness. Secondly, the book adopts the viewpoint of patients themselves: it investigates how they reacted to the escape from death, the abatement of pain and suffering, and the return to normal life and work. At the heart of getting better was contrast – from ‘paine to ease, sadnesse to mirth, prison to liberty, and death to life’. The third perspective concerns the patient’s loved ones; it shows that family and friends usually shared the feelings of patients, undergoing a dramatic transformation from anguish to elation. This mirroring of experiences, known as ‘fellow-feeling’, reveals the depth of love between many individuals. Through these discussions, the book opens a window on some of the most profound, as well as the more everyday, aspects of early modern existence, from attitudes to life and death, to details of what convalescents ate for supper and wore in bed.Download Free PDFView PDFEighteenth-Century StudiesIn Sickness and in Health, the British Experience: 1650-18501990 • Dorothy PorterDownload Free PDFView PDFA Cultural History of Medicine in the Middle AgesA Cultural History of Medicine in the Middle Ages - front matter2021 • Iona McCleery, Naama Cohen Hanegbi, Wendy J Turner, F. Eliza Glaze, Gemma WatsonThe Middle Ages are well-known for the growth of universities and urban regulations, plague pandemics, increasingly sophisticated ways of causing injury in warfare, and abiding frameworks for health and illness provided by religion. Increasingly, however, archaeologists, historians and literary specialists have come together to flesh out the daily lives of medieval people at all levels of society, both in Christian Europe and the Islamic Mediterranean. A Cultural History of Medicine in the Middle Ages follows suit, but also brings new approaches and comparisons into the conversation. Through the investigation of poems, pottery, personal letters, recipes and petitions, and through a breadth of topics running from street-cleaning, cooking and amulets to religious treatises and death rituals, this volume accords new meaning and value to the period and those who lived it. Its chapters confirm that the study of latrines, patterns of manuscript circulation, miracle narratives, sermons, skeletons, metaphors and so on, have as much to tell us about attitudes towards health and illness as do medical texts. Delving within and beyond texts, and focusing on the sensory, the experiential, the personal, the body and the spirit, this volume celebrates and critiques the diverse and complex cultural history of medieval health and medicine.Download Free PDFView PDF'Rapt Up with Joy': Children's Emotional Responses to Death in Early Modern EnglandHannah  NewtonThis is a chapter from Kimberley Reynolds, Katie Barclay, and Ciara Rawnsley (eds), Death, Emotion and Childhood in Premodern Europe (Palgrave Macmillan: 2017), 87-107; ISBN: 978-1-137-57198-4.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Devil and the Mother: Demonology and Medicine in early modern EnglandMézes ÁdámDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
