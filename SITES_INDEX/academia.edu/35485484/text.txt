Berlin Studies of the Ancient World 45 (Berlin: edition topoi 2017).Kerstin P.  Hofmann2017How do societies remember their past? And how did they do so before the age of computers, printing, writing? This book takes stock of earlier work on memory in the fields of history and the social sciences. Our collection also takes a new look at how past and present social groups have memorialized events and rendered them durable through materializations: contributors ask how processes and incidents perceived as negative and disruptive are nonetheless constitutive of group identities. Papers also contrast the monumentalizing treatment given to singular events imbued with a hegemonic meaning to more localized, diverse memory places and networks. As case studies show, such memory scapes invite divergent, multivocal and subversive narratives. Various kinds of these imagined geographies lend themselves to practices of manipulation, preservation and control. The temporal scope of the volume reaches from the late Neolithic to the recent past, resulting in a long-term and multi-focal perspective that demonstrates how the perception of past events changes, acquires new layers and is molded by different groups at different points in time. As several contributions show, these manipulations of the past do not always produce the anticipated results, however. Attempts at “post-factual history” are countered by the socially distributed, but spatially and materially anchored nature of the very process of memorialization.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers2017 - R.

Hofmann, Ulrike SommerOur introduction to the volume sets the discussion about memory in archaeology into current contexts, establishes our reasons for producing this book and discusses a number of crucial aspects of memory, space, and identity. We provide a brief history of memory studies with a focus on contributions from archaeology and discuss a number of topics that play important roles in the papers. These include the relations between forgetting and remembering , and between space, place and memory. Along with our authors, we emphasize that memory is a matter of practices, not just of mindsets. A further element in our discussions is the interface between memory, duration, and history. All of these issues coalesce in an important background theme, the political nature of various modes of memory.Download Free PDFView PDFAnnual Review of AnthropologyArchaeology and Social Memory2019 • Ruth Van DykeThis review provides a road map through current trends and issues in archaeological studies of memory. Many scholars continue to draw on Halbwachs for collective memory studies, emphasizing how the past can legitimate political authority. Others are inspired by Bergson, focusing on the persistent material intrusion of the past into the present. "Past in the past" studies are particularly widespread in the Near East/Classical world, Europe, the Maya region, and Native North America. Archaeologists have viewed materialized memory in various ways: as passively continuous, discursively referenced, intentionally invented, obliterated. Key domains of inquiry include monuments , places, and lieux de mémoire; treatment and disposal of the dead; habitual practices and senses; the recent and contemporary past; and forgetting and erasure. Important contemporary work deploys archaeology as a tool of counter-memory in the aftermath of recent violence and trauma. 207Download Free PDFView PDFRoymans, N. and Fernández-Götz, M.

Scheffer, Stockholm 2014, 255–265Ida  ÖstenbergBattles and battlefield strategies have long held a prime place of interest among Roman scholars. In recent years, attention has also turned to martial rituals, war memorials and the sense of oneness as shaped by joint experiences of war. These current discussions focus almost without exception on Roman victories. In contrast, this paper aims at exploring aspects of defeat, asking how battlefield failures were received, remembered and how they contributed to the creation of identities in ancient Rome. The basic questions are these. How did Rome handle her own defeats? Which losses were forgotten and which were remembered? How were defeats committed to memory (or consigned to oblivion)—what rituals, monuments and narratives were employed? This paper will argue that, while contemporary battle losses must have triggered enormous sorrow and fear, there are very few traces of former defeats visible in Roman ceremony and cityscape. Only a very limited set of failures from the distant past were embraced as specific events by the communal Roman memory. Most defeats were instead taken up by the writers of the Early Empire as preludes to later victories and were thus absorbed into the larger picture of constant Roman success.Download Free PDFView PDFFrom Sicily with Love: The Myth of Galatea and Polyphemos in Ian Fleming's MoonrakerPatrick CallahanDownload Free PDFView PDF “The Owl of Athena.” Ask a Classicist.
