This is the second in a series of reports on that subject. The leeuwengroot (gros au lion, gros compagnon, socius, gezel) was a (nominally) silver coin, struck in the 14 th century in Western Europe, in particular, in the Low Countries. The type was first minted in Flanders (or perhaps in Brabant) in 1337, in response to the devaluation of silver coins in France earlier that same year. The type was quickly imitated in the regions around Flanders, sometimes as a "coin of convention" mandated by agreements between these regions. leeuwengroot of Flanders Louis of Nevers (1322-1346) Elsen 132-523 / 3.46 g. shown actual size Minting of this type ended in Flanders in 1364, and the imitations in other regions ceased as well. Minting of the plak series of lion-with-helm coins began in 1365 in Flanders, and was widely imitated in other places as the leeuwengroot had been before it. A short resurgence of leeuwengroten occurred in Brabant 1381-1383, with a few imitations in small regions such as Megen and Batenburg. Our interest therefore lies in medieval records dating c. 1337-c. 1364, while also keeping an eye out for records from c. 1381-1383 (especially those from Brabant).Download Free PDFView PDF"Deceptive Imitation" MONETA FLAND LeeuwengrotenPaul TorongoThe leeuwengroot (gros au lion, gros compagnon) was a (nominally) silver coin, struck in the 14 th century in Western Europe, particularly in the Low Countries. The type was first minted in Flanders (or perhaps in Brabant) in 1337, in response to the devaluation of silver coins in France earlier that same year. The type was quickly imitated in the regions around Flanders, and was minted (on and off) until 1364. Medieval records tell us that there were 8 "issues" of leeuwengroot in Flanders under count Louis of Male (1346-1384), each with a reduction of either the weight or fineness (silver content) of the coins compared to the previous issue. We have at our disposal numerous coin specimens that show a number of different sets of characteristics, which, in theory, can be "matched up" with the known issues minted in Flanders. In addition to these fairly uniform sets of characteristics, there are a small number of coins showing "anomalous" characteristics that do not match the majority. These anomalous coins remain enigmatic; they are usually partially illegible, and many of them display so many unusual traits that it seems likely that they are not "new sub-types", but rather examples of "deceptive imitations", i.e. medieval counterfeits struck in reasonably good silver and produced with a reasonably high degree of quality and workmanship.Download Free PDFView PDFA Preliminary Examination of the Leeuwengroot (Socius, Gezel) as Mentioned in Medieval Accounts Part Five: The ILV Den BoschPaul TorongoThis is Part Five of our report on the leeuwengroot (gros compagnon, gros au lion, socius, gezel) as found in medieval documents. This report concerns the accounts of the Illustere Lieve Vrouwe Broederschap in Den Bosch, The Netherlands. An (incomplete) transcription of these accounts was published by Oldewelt (ref. 32), and a discussion the ILV accounts and the coins found therein was published by van Hengel (ref. 22).Download Free PDFView PDFA Preliminary Examination of the Leeuwengroot as Mentioned in Medieval Accounts Part One: Jan Meester Lams ZoonPaul TorongoPart of our ongoing investigation into the leeuwengroot (gros au lion, gros compagnon, gezel, socius) of all regions involves studying the accounting records made in the Middle Ages that pertain to this coin type.

The type was first minted in Flanders (or perhaps in Brabant) in 1337, in response to the devaluation of silver coins in France earlier that same year. It was quickly imitated in the regions around Flanders, sometimes as a “coin of convention” mandated by agreements between these regions. The earliest leeuwengroten of 1337 were minted in Flanders and Brabant, and probably in Holland as well. Based upon the coins at our disposal for study, it does not appear that Hainaut was one of the realms that were minting leeuwengroten from the very beginning (1337), but that minting began slightly later (1338?). The study of the leeuwengroten (of all regions) is analogous to doing a large jigsaw puzzle. But you don’t have a picture on the box top to work from, you don’t know for sure what the final picture is supposed to look like, and a great many of the pieces are definitely missing. Sometimes you find small clusters of pieces that fit together, but you cannot (yet) see where this new cluster fits into the main puzzle. The example of Hainaut illustrates this analogy well: there are only two main types and very few sub-types, but the story of the Hainaut leeuwengroten is not as simple as one might expect at first glance.Download Free PDFView PDFA Preliminary Look at the Leeuwengroten of the County of Holland Including the Fractional CoinsRaymond van Oosterhout, Paul TorongoThe 14th century leeuwengroten (gros au lions) coins of the County of Holland have never been accurately documented until now.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Leeuwengroten of the County / Duchy of Luxembourg: A Preliminary Overview (REVISED VERSION)Paul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutPreliminary catalog of the leeuwengroten of Luxembourg, struck for John the Blind and for Wenceslas.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Flemish Petit Blanc Quarter Groot of Louis of Nevers (1322-1346)Paul TorongoI.
