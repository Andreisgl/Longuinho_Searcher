I loved this even more than I loved The Silent Patient and that's saying something!"—Lucy Foley, New York Times bestselling author of The Guest ListFrom the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Silent Patient comes a spellbinding tale of psychological suspense, weaving together Greek mythology, murder, and obsession, that further cements “Michaelides as a major player in the field” (Publishers Weekly).Edward Fosca is a murderer. Of this Mariana is certain. But Fosca is untouchable. A handsome and charismatic Greek tragedy professor at Cambridge University, Fosca is adored by staff and students alike—particularly by the members of a secret society of female students known as The Maidens.Mariana Andros is a brilliant but troubled group therapist who becomes fixated on The Maidens when one member, a friend of Mariana’s niece Zoe, is found murdered in Cambridge.Mariana, who was once herself a student at the university, quickly suspects that behind the idyllic beauty of the spires and turrets, and beneath the ancient traditions, lies something sinister. And she becomes convinced that, despite his alibi, Edward Fosca is guilty of the murder. But why would the professor target one of his students? And why does he keep returning to the rites of Persephone, the maiden, and her journey to the underworld?When another body is found, Mariana’s obsession with proving Fosca’s guilt spirals out of control, threatening to destroy her credibility as well as her closest relationships. But Mariana is determined to stop this killer, even if it costs her everything—including her own life.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextSuspenseThrillersLanguageEnglishPublisherMacmillan PublishersRelease dateJun 15, 2021ISBN9781250304476Switch to audiobookStart your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to The MaidensRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextRock Paper Scissors: A NovelEbookRock Paper Scissors: A NovelbyAlice FeeneyRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Rock Paper Scissors: A Novel for laterThe Plot: A NovelEbookThe Plot: A NovelbyJean Hanff KorelitzRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Plot: A Novel for laterThe Wife Upstairs: A NovelEbookThe Wife Upstairs: A NovelbyRachel HawkinsRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Wife Upstairs: A Novel for laterThe Good Sister: A NovelEbookThe Good Sister: A NovelbySally HepworthRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Good Sister: A Novel for laterThe Club: A Summer Beach ReadEbookThe Club: A Summer Beach ReadbyEllery LloydRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Club: A Summer Beach Read for laterHis & Hers: A NovelEbookHis & Hers: A NovelbyAlice FeeneyRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save His & Hers: A Novel for laterThe Therapist: A NovelEbookThe Therapist: A NovelbyB A ParisRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Therapist: A Novel for laterThe Shadows: A NovelEbookThe Shadows: A NovelbyAlex NorthRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Shadows: A Novel for laterZero DaysEbookZero DaysbyRuth WareRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Zero Days for laterWe Begin at the EndEbookWe Begin at the EndbyChris WhitakerRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save We Begin at the End for laterThe Survivors: A NovelEbookThe Survivors: A NovelbyJane HarperRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Survivors: A Novel for laterNotes on an Execution: An Edgar Award WinnerEbookNotes on an Execution: An Edgar Award WinnerbyDanya KukafkaRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Notes on an Execution: An Edgar Award Winner for laterThe Cloisters: A NovelEbookThe Cloisters: A NovelbyKaty HaysRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Cloisters: A Novel for laterThe Writing Retreat: A NovelEbookThe Writing Retreat: A NovelbyJulia BartzRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Writing Retreat: A Novel for laterThe Golden Spoon: A NovelEbookThe Golden Spoon: A NovelbyJessa MaxwellRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save The Golden Spoon: A Novel for laterEvery Last Fear: A NovelEbookEvery Last Fear: A NovelbyAlex FinlayRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Every Last Fear: A Novel for laterBeautiful World, Where Are You: A NovelEbookBeautiful World, Where Are You: A NovelbySally RooneyRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Beautiful World, Where Are You: A Novel for laterDark Roads: A NovelEbookDark Roads: A NovelbyChevy StevensRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Dark Roads: A Novel for laterThe Couple at Number 9: A NovelEbookThe Couple at Number 9: A NovelbyClaire DouglasRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Couple at Number 9: A Novel for laterThe Only Survivors: A NovelEbookThe Only Survivors: A NovelbyMegan MirandaRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save The Only Survivors: A Novel for laterStolen VirusEbookStolen VirusbyGary F.

Where he says about his asshole father shot the family's poor dog instead of the idiot mother who was threatening the father to kill him cause she cared more for the dog then the father and the son apparently I would too put animal in front of people who I don't like and if I was in her shoes I would have killed him for shooting the poor dog. And also I had a feeling who was the killer in the story from the middle of the book till all most towards the end of it. In one of the chapters in the maidens towards the end of the chapter on the last page i noticed the character was mentioned from the silent patient by Alex Michealides which I gave a 5 stars, I didn not care for the 4 or 5 girls that Mariana met in a grpup that she was going to have a session with they seemed quite bitchy. And saying how Tara and Veronica's death's were their fault and calling everyone and something and Mariana had to say was stupid how they believed that Edward Fosca says. He had brainwashed all of the girls saying he wouldn't kill any of them. I have a feeling that Edward Fosca is the killer and also I did not like the chief inspector Sangha either. I did not see that twist towards the end with Zoe was the one doing the killings cause apparently Sebastian was the one who was telling her and they were both in on it plus since Sebastian and Zoe some how were getting to close and he should have got in trouble for having sex with Zoe when she was underage and I didn't blame Mariana for not wanting to do with the bitch Zoe.Read morejenn88-1Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Long, boring book with an unsatisfying, weird ending. I don't understand the purpose of the story.Read moretuusannuuska-1Rating: 1 out of 5 stars1/5What an underwhelming book. Especially having really enjoyed The Silent Patient.Right from the beginning, I found myself very disinterested in the characters and the story. I'm trying to think if there was anything I actually enjoyed here which would warrant even a two star rating, and maybe I'll go with the writing. The writing was alright, it was the actual contents of the book I had a problem with.This book is a parade of red herrings, one more implausible and irrelevant than the last, culminating in a reveal that not only came out of nowhere, but was also completely stupid. I had a inkling of the murderer, but the motivation the murderer was driven by was fucking ridiculous. And pretty much all the side characters are paper thin. Particularly Henry and Fred's sole purpose was to throw the reader off, without bringing anything else of substance to the story. I have no idea how I was supposed to believe the ending where the main character entertains the idea of "maybe something more" with someone who was basically a stalker who wouldn't take no for an answer.I feel like I lost so many hours on this that I could have spent reading something that's actually good. So dumb. You know what, no. This is a one star, I'm so pissed.Read more1 person found this helpfuljonez-6Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/52.75-3.0 ( I just can't decide)This is my first Michaelides book, and I can say his prose is great. I love dark academia, and I think the idea for this story was a bit more of an original take than others in the genre. I did somewhat predict the who, although I was off in predicting the why of the twist. I enjoyed the surprise in the twist. It was a bit darker than I imagined. For the most part, I enjoyed where it was going...it just didn't...get there.  There was so much to explore that just wasn't explored.But where this story came unraveled for me is the loose threads left hanging everywhere. There was so much that was barely explored, and people introduced that I am just unsure why they were even introduced. If they were to serve as red herrings, they just were not developed enough characters to be good red herrings. I don't want to get into too much to spoil things for anyone, but just know that while this book has satisfying elements, it will most likely leave you unsatisfied.Read moreroeschleisureRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5I was conflicted with this book.  The references to Tennyson, artworks, and classical drama were wonderful.  Setting the action in Cambridge was also wonderful.  Finally, Michaelides's protagonist, Mariana, has the makings of a solid recurring-character series.  What disappointed me was the dependence on very short chapters and a somewhat fractured approach.Read moreakblanchard_1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Despite the title and packaging, The Maidens is not, as I had thought, a Secret History clone. I wouldn’t even call it a dark academia narrative, despite its Cambridge setting. Rather, the novel tells the story of Mariana, a therapist with troubles of her own. She turns into an amateur detective when Cambridge girls start dying mysterious, violent deaths. The dialogue is predictable and the ending is unsatisfying. Still, the novel kept me reading, so I can’t fault it too much.Read moremojomomma_1Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5The dead husband and the niece try to kill the widow.Read moresparemethecensorRating: 1 out of 5 stars1/5It's like someone read Donna Tartt's fantastic novel The Secret History and went on a two-day coke bender to write this piece of garbage in its 21st century place. AVOID.As a note: I thought that Michaelides's first, The Silent Patient, was fine. Not great, not terrible. Totally serviceable thriller in the space it occupies. This, by contrast? Garbage.Read moredelphimo_1Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Alex Michaelides presents an interesting and suspenseful novel with The Maidens.  The main character, Mariana Andros, ranges from intelligent to oblivious.  Michaelides includes many lines from Alfred Lord Tennyson.  And also delves into tidbits of Tennyson’s life and loves.  The cast of characters runs amok and so many red herrings concerning who kills these young and beautiful girls.  Mariana plummets into grief on the drowning death of her husband, Sebastian.  Mariana’s niece, Zoe, convinces Mariana to travel to Cambridge University to help solve the brutal murder of a young girl.  Mariana remembers Cambridge from her years as a student and her meeting with Sebastian.  Michaelides dares the reader with numerous clues and the books mentioned.  The final chapters bring resolution, but at a dear cost.Read moreridgewaygirlRating: 1 out of 5 stars1/5This is marketed as a literary thriller and beyond being set in Cambridge, I can't figure out how they decided that was a good idea. Everything other than the setting and the degrees held by several characters, is a run-of-the-mill mystery and is predictably written, predictably plotted, predictably structured, and with the predictable characters. If that's what you're in the mood for, enjoy it, but I didn't love the bait and switch that had me picking up a copy, in hardcover no less, with the expectation of at least being mildly entertained.Read morekatherinegreggRating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5This dark, gothic thriller was too far-fetched for me to get into. Mariana Andros, a widowed therapist, rushes to Cambridge to comfort her niece whose roommate had just been murdered. Mariana sticks around to be there for her niece and soon starts investigating the murder. Another murder occurs and everything is pointing to Professor Fosca who teaches Greek tragedy. Fosca has a group of student "maidens" from class with whom he meets outside of class. Two of the maidens are now dead. Some chapters are narrated by the presumed murderer in a journal-style format. As it turns out, these chapters are pages written from the journal of Mariana's husband who had drowned while swimming on a vacation off the coast of Naxos in Greece. He and Zoe, the niece who called Mariana to Cambridge, had secretly fallen in love and were planning to murder Mariana and inherit her fortune. Zoe is carrying out her ex-lover's wises by trapping Mariana and attempting to stab her to death. The story line was ridiculous and totally unrealistic. However the book was well written and very atmospheric which is good for a thriller.Read morewaldhaus1Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5The main narrator is a part Greek girl who Is a psychotherapist living in England.

More young women will die all part of a group that calls themselves the maidens because of their election by a professor of Greek tragedy. The narrator struggles to discover who the killer is. Well plotted and the setting is clearly evoked.Read morethebookqueensxRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5I will have to admit, I was a little nervous about reading The Maidens by Alex Michaelides. I read The Silent Patient at the beginning of the year because there was so much hype on bookstagram, BookTube, BookTwt, and GoodReads, and I was just getting into reading more mysteries and thrillers so I figured it was a good option. I was so bored reading it that I had to switch to the audiobook, and even then I kept getting lost. So, obviously, my hopes were not very high going into The Maidens. I was honestly blown out of the waters with this one, however.The storyline follows Mariana, a woman who just lost her husband and is now helping her niece Zoe navigate the grief of losing her best friend. Mariana is certain that Cambridge professor Edward Fosca is the murderer, but she doesn't know how to prove it.I enjoyed the mystery of this whole book and the subtle tie-ins with Greek literature and history. And I was honestly surprised by the ending. It was not something that I was expecting to happen at all. I am excited to see what Michaelides writes next, and I will be picking up whatever it is!Read moremenagerie_1Rating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5Same formula as The Silent Patient, only far more red herrings, unlikely villians, and a lot of plot points that make zero sense. Don't waste your time, and wait for the inevitable TV movie if you are so inclined.Read moreshazjhbRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Very good book although there was a disconnect between the two stories.  It never quiet meshed.Read moredrapple_1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5The victims in the mystery are all beautiful students of a magnetic classics professor at Cambridge.  Our heroine, Marianna, still grieving from the death of her husband, becomes involved because the niece she and her husband raised is a student there. She immediately identifies the person whom she believes is the killer, but there are a number of other suspects.  The ending is a surprise.Read morebodagirlRating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5I found Mariana to be a flailing character, obsessed with Fosca's guilt because she finds him smarmy (and yes, he was) and because she had nothing else in her life. She was terribly flat and not really that sympathetic. What was her motivation? Why did she have to solve the crime? I never understood that. The reveal of the murderer wasn't entirely unexpected and the man-behind-the-curtain trope was a little trite and exploitative.Read morewrite5reviewRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5You Won’t Believe ThisReaders who enjoyed Michaelides’ debut, The Silent Patient, might be intrigued to find the protagonist of that novel, Theo Faber, make an appearance in a consultive role. Like the first, the novel follows a psychologist, group therapist Marianna Andros, as she ties solving the mystery of serial killing of several female students at Cambridge University. Unlike the first, it ends by making no sense to the point where readers will feel duped into consuming a couple of hundred pages of Marianna's personal angst over the unexpected, accidental death of her husband.Marianna and her deceased husband Sebastian took in her niece Zoe after the girl’s parents died in an accident. They raised her and sent her off to Cambridge. One day she calls Marianna grieving over the murder of her best friend Tara. Marianna decides to go up to Cambridge to comfort her. Once there she involves herself in finding Tara’s killer. This leads her to the charismatic professor Edward Fosca. So popular, he has a court of maidens who nearly worship him. We meet them first as a group at the memorial service for Tara, unmistakeable as they parade into the chapel all dressed in white capes. Could any of them be the killer as rivals for the attention and affection of Fosca? Maybe not, as several of them meet Tara’s fate. Other suspicious characters begin showing up in droves, among them Conrad, the local drug dealer to students and faculty; a young porter, odd by virtue of his youth; an abrasive housekeeper who seems to harbor a grudge; a loony patient of Marianna who doesn’t get the concept of group therapy; a freshman physics student obsessed with Marianna. Since a psychopath doesn’t need what most would consider a rational excuse for murder and has the ability to blend in, any of these could be the culprit. Sorting the likely from the unlikely is the fun of reading a murder mystery, but when the killer descends from the heavens like a Hera manifesting her jealous nature, well, that puts a damper on things. By the way, readers might want to keep the queen of the gods in mind as they try figuring out who will reveal their self in the end.The Maidens might have been a decent murder mystery if Michaelides hadn’t buried the identity of the real killer under a thick covering of self-analytical mumbo jumbo. Readers can take that as both a hint at a solution and a warning of dissatisfaction ahead. Read morekhoyt-43756Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I was ready to read "The Maidens" because I was completely blown away by "The Silent Patient". It was well worth the wait! Too bad only five stars are allowed. I thought I had it all figured out. Nope. Each page, each chapter work together to set one's teeth on edge. All information given about the characters, the thought processes of the main character, Mariana, lead you to believe one thing and then another with determined efficiency. All the references to the Greek tragedies, group therapy, dysfunctional childhoods are calculated to make one think they are on the correct path. In reality, one is on a roller coaster ride of differing outcomes until it comes to a screeching halt at the conclusion. WOW! Read both of his books and hope he can write another one faster than you can read them.Read morebookczukRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Liked another book by this author.

When her niece, a student at Cambridge University, calls Mariana in distress over a female student's body found near the college campus, Mariana rushes to comfort her.  But then another female student death occurs, and Mariana becomes increasingly suspicious of a particular young Greek tragedy professor.  Despite warnings from the local authorities, she sets out to solve the mystery of the murders herself, discovering ties to a mysterious campus group known as "The Maidens".  This book will easily pull you in.  There were lots of red herrings in this one, and some surprises along the way.  It was perhaps a bit unrealistic and farfetched near the end, but I was willing to go with it.  The only thing I really did not like was Mariana's character.  If I'm going to get behind a heroine, I want to at least kind of like him/her, but I really didn't care for Mariana at all.  Other than that, a good story that keeps the reader guessing.Read morehemlokgangRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Two for two!  This second thriller from Alex Michaelides is just shy of being as good as "The Silent Patient".  Young "maidens" are being killed at Cambridge University and the murders seem to be linked to the niece of the psychotherapist sleuth, Marianna.  Filled with allusions and parallels to the Greek tragedy of Iphigenia, the plot builds in that manner of a good mystery, reeling in the reader page by page.  Themes include the relationship between abuser & abused and the blindness of love.  A really good thriller!Read morekarenherndonRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5A lot of hype about a just so, so read.

We see the story’s development through the viewpoint of Mariana, a psychotherapist who has a therapy group in London. She is a quarter Greek. Her beloved partner, Sebastian, recently drowned and Mariana is still mourning him. She gets a distressed phone call from her niece, Zoe, and rushes to Cambridge to be with her and see what she can do to help. The body of a young woman has been found murdered; Zoe fears it is her friend, Tara, who has been missing for a few days. They are both students at St Christopher’s College at Cambridge University. The victim of the murder does turn out to be Tara. The story is suspenseful and filled with characters, each one suspicious in some way. Later, there is a second murder. Who can the murderer be?; there are almost too many suspects. There is Professor Edward Fosca, who is Zoe’s professor and that of the murdered girls. There is a man called Conrad, who is quickly proved to be innocent. There is Henry, a troubled member of Mariana’s group in London, who seems to be stalking her. There is Fred, a young man she meets on a train who also keeps pursuing her and seems besotted with her. There is Morris, the head porter at the college. There is a group of female students called The Maidens, to which group the murdered women belonged. There is Julian, a forensic psychologist, who is helping the police solve the murders, and has “a prurient delight in madness and death”. And then there is Zoe. Could it possibly be she, in love with the professor and jealous of the Maidens, who is attempting to dispose of them? In connection with the murders, postcards are found, each carrying a quotation in Ancient Greek from a play by Euripides. Professor Fosca is “dazzling”, charismatic and extremely popular, and is the prime suspect for the murders in Mariana’s view; he teaches Greek tragedy and is proficient in Ancient Greek. He holds a lecture on the secret rite of Eleusis, which is the story of Persephone - the goddess of death, queen of the underworld. Fosca also seems to be pursuing Mariana, and invites her to dinner. He tells her that the murders are “a sacrificial act – a ritual of rebirth and resurrection”. Throughout the book we are occasionally given access to letters written by an unnamed person, someone split in two, a good person but also a villain. I found the book exceedingly readable and suspenseful, though at first rather irritated by the many suspects; but at the end I felt the author had excelled himself and the book was just as good as his first one, perhaps better. I highly recommend it.Read morekulmonaRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5A lonely, loveless childhood. Tragic loss. Both of these make group therapist Mariana well-suited for her profession. She is able to empathize and relate to those under her care. But, as in any group,  there is comraderie and conflict. There's a dynamic. And some members are more challenging than others. While in the midst of dealing with a troubled member, Mariana receives an urgent call from her beloved niece. Zoe, a student at Cambridge, is beside herself with grief. Her best (and only) friend has gone missing. She implores her aunt to come and Mariana doesn't hesitate for a second. Of course, she'll go. Back at her alma mater, Mariana feels like she's stepped back in time. She's again that young woman who stepped off the boat from Greece into a new world. Everything's the same and, yet, so much has changed.Before she gets settled in, it becomes apparent that the situation is more serious and complicated than she expected or could even imagine. She shouldn't get involved. It's none of her business. But...she has to. For Zoe, right? Next thing she knows, she's in over her head.The hype surrounding this book piqued my curiosity. Did it live up to the hype? In my opinion, yes! It held my interest and I looked forward to picking it up whenever I got the chance. And when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. It had  elements that I enjoy : an academic setting, secret societies, and murder mystery. The vivid and disturbingly graphic descriptions. The fleshed-out characters.  Last, but not least, the mythology, a genre that has always intrigued me, was a bonus. It made for an entertaining and informative read. And that ending...BREATHTAKING!Read moresheriawilkinsonRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5The Maidens by Alex MichaelidesMariana is a therapist who once attended Cambridge University.

This was a fact. This wasn’t something Mariana knew just on an intellectual level, as an idea. Her body knew it. She felt it in her bones, along her blood, and deep within every cell. Edward Fosca was guilty. And yet—she couldn’t prove it, and might never prove it. This man, this monster, who had killed at least two people, might, in all likelihood, walk free. He was so smug, so sure of himself. He thinks he’s got away with it, she thought. He thought he had won. But he hadn’t. Not yet. Mariana was determined to outsmart him. She had to. She would sit up all night and remember everything that had happened. She would sit here, in this small, dark room in Cambridge, and think, and work it out. She stared at the red bar of the electric heater on the wall, burning, glowing in the dark, willing herself into a kind of trance. In her mind, she would go back to the very beginning and remember it all. Every single detail. And she would catch him. Part One No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. —C. S. LEWIS, A Grief Observed 1 A few days earlier, Mariana was at home, in London. She was on her knees, on the floor, surrounded by boxes. She was making yet another halfhearted attempt to sort through Sebastian’s belongings. It wasn’t going well. A year on from his death, the majority of his things remained spread around the house in various piles and half-empty boxes. She seemed unable to complete the task. Mariana was still in love with him—that was the problem. Even though she knew she’d never see Sebastian again—even though he was gone for good—she was still in love and didn’t know what to do with all this love of hers. There was so much of it, and it was so messy: leaking, spilling, tumbling out of her, like stuffing falling out of an old rag doll that was coming apart at the seams. If only she could box up her love, as she was attempting to do with his possessions. What a pitiful sight it was—a man’s life reduced to a collection of unwanted items for a jumble sale. Mariana reached into the nearest box. She pulled out a pair of shoes. She considered them—the old green trainers he had for running on the beach. They still had a slightly sodden feel about them, with grains of sand embedded in the soles. Get rid of them, she said to herself. Throw them in the bin. Do it. Even as she thought this, she knew it was an impossibility. They weren’t him; they weren’t Sebastian—they weren’t the man she loved and would love forever—they were just a pair of old shoes. Even so, parting with them would be an act of self-harm, like pressing a knife to her arm and slicing off a sliver of skin. Instead, Mariana brought the shoes close to her chest. She cradled them tight, as she might a child. And she wept. How had she ended up like this? In the space of just a year, which once would have slipped by almost imperceptibly—and now stretched out behind her like a desolate landscape flattened by a hurricane—the life she had known had been obliterated, leaving Mariana here: thirty-six years old, alone and drunk on a Sunday night; clutching a dead man’s shoes as if they were holy relics—which, in a way, they were. Something beautiful, something holy, had died. All that remained were the books he read, the clothes he wore, the things he touched. She could still smell him on them, still taste him on the tip of her tongue. That’s why she couldn’t throw away his possessions—by holding on to them, she could keep Sebastian alive, somehow, just a little bit—if she let go, she’d lose him entirely. Recently, out of morbid curiosity, and in an attempt to understand what she was wrestling with, Mariana had reread all of Freud’s writings about grief and loss. And he argued that, following the death of a loved one, the loss had to be psychologically accepted and that person relinquished, or else you ran the risk of succumbing to pathological mourning, which he called melancholia—and we call depression. Mariana understood this. She knew she should relinquish Sebastian, but she couldn’t—because she was still in love with him. She was in love even though he was gone forever, gone behind the veil—behind the veil, behind the veil—where was that from? Tennyson, probably. Behind the veil. That’s how it felt. Since Sebastian died, Mariana no longer saw the world in color. Life was muted and gray and far away, behind a veil—behind a mist of sadness. She wanted to hide from the world, all its noise and pain, and cocoon herself here, in her work, and in her little yellow house. And that’s where she would have stayed, if Zoe hadn’t phoned her from Cambridge, that night in October. Zoe’s phone call, after the Monday-evening group—that was how it started. That was how the nightmare began. 2 The Monday-evening group met in Mariana’s front room. It was a good-sized room. It had been given over to the use of therapy soon after Mariana and Sebastian moved into the yellow house. They were very fond of that house. It was at the foot of Primrose Hill in Northwest London, and painted the same bright yellow as the primroses that grew on the hill in the summer. Honeysuckle climbed up one of the outside walls, covering it with white, sweet-smelling flowers, and in the summer months their scent crept into the house through the open windows, climbing up the stairs and lingering in the passages and rooms, filling them with sweetness. It was unseasonably warm that Monday evening. Even though it was early October, the Indian summer prevailed, like an obstinate party guest, refusing to heed the hints from the dying leaves on the trees that it might be time to go. The late-afternoon sun flooded into the front room, drenching it with a golden light, tinged with red. Before the session, Mariana drew the blinds, but left the sash windows open a few inches to let in some air. Next, she readjusted the chairs into a circle. Nine chairs. A chair for each member of the group, and one for Mariana. In theory, the chairs were meant to be identical—but life didn’t work like that. Despite her best intentions, she had accumulated an assortment of upright chairs over the years, in different materials and in various shapes and sizes. Her relaxed attitude to the chairs was perhaps typical of how she conducted her groups. Mariana was informal, even unconventional, in her approach. Therapy, particularly group therapy, was an ironic choice of profession for Mariana. She had always been ambivalent about groups—even suspicious of them—ever since she was a child. She’d grown up in Greece, on the outskirts of Athens. They’d lived in a large ramshackle old house, on top of a hill that was covered with a black-and-green shroud of olive trees. As a young girl, Mariana would sit on the rusty swing in the garden and ponder the ancient city beneath her, sprawling all the way to the columns of the Parthenon on top of another hill in the distance. It seemed so vast, endless; she felt so small and insignificant, and she viewed it with a superstitious foreboding. Accompanying the housekeeper on shopping trips to the crowded and frenetic market in the center of Athens always made Mariana nervous. And she was relieved, and a little surprised, to return home unscathed. Large groups continued to intimidate her as she grew older. At school, she found herself on the sidelines, feeling as if she didn’t fit in with her classmates. And this feeling of not fitting in was hard to shake. Years later, in therapy, she came to understand that the schoolyard was simply a macrocosm of the family unit: meaning her uneasiness was less about the here and now—less about the schoolyard itself, or the market in Athens, or any other group in which she might find herself—and more to do with the family in which she grew up, and the lonely house she grew up in. Their house was always cold, even in sunny Greece. And there was an emptiness to it—a lack of warmth, physical and emotional. This was due in large part to Mariana’s father, who, although a remarkable man in many ways—good-looking, powerful, razor sharp—was also highly complicated. Mariana suspected he had been damaged beyond repair by his childhood. She never met her father’s parents, and he rarely mentioned them. His father was a sailor, and the less said about his mother, the better. She worked at the docks, he said, with such a look of shame, Mariana thought she must have been a prostitute. Her father grew up in the slums of Athens and around the port of Piraeus—he started working on the ships as a boy, quickly becoming involved with trade and the import of coffee and wheat and—Mariana imagined—less savory items. By the time he was twenty-five, he had bought his own boat, and built his shipping business from there. Through a combination of ruthlessness, blood, and sweat, he created a small empire for himself. He was a bit like a king, Mariana thought—or a dictator. She was later to discover he was an extremely wealthy man—not that you would have guessed it from the austere, Spartan way they lived. Perhaps her mother—her gentle, delicate English mother—might have softened him, had she lived. But she died tragically young, soon after Mariana was born. Mariana grew up with a keen awareness of this loss. As a therapist, she knew a baby’s first sense of self comes through its parents’ gaze. We are born being watched—our parents’ expressions, what we see reflected in the mirror of their eyes, determines how we see ourselves. Mariana had lost her mother’s gaze—and her father, well, he found it hard to look at her directly. He’d usually glance just over her shoulder when addressing her. Mariana would continually adjust and readjust her position, shuffling, edging her way into his sight line, hoping to be seen—but somehow always remaining peripheral. On the rare occasions she did catch a glimpse into his eyes, there was such disdain there, such burning disappointment. His eyes told her the truth: she wasn’t good enough. No matter how hard she tried, Mariana always sensed she fell short, managing to do or say the wrong thing—just by existing, she seemed to irritate him. He disagreed with her endlessly, no matter what, performing Petruchio to her Kate—if she said it was cold, he said it was hot; if she said it was sunny, he insisted it was raining. But despite his criticism and contrariness, Mariana loved him. He was all she had, and she longed to be worthy of his love. There was precious little love in her childhood. She had an elder sister, but they weren’t close. Elisa was seven years her senior, with no interest in her shy younger sibling. And so Mariana would spend the long summer months alone, playing by herself in the garden under the stern eye of the housekeeper. No wonder, then, she grew up a little isolated, and uneasy around other people. The irony that Mariana ended up becoming a group therapist was not lost on her. But paradoxically, this ambivalence about others served her well. In group therapy, the group, not the individual, is the focus of treatment: to be a successful group therapist is—to some extent—to be invisible. Mariana was good at this. In her sessions, she always kept out of the group’s way as much as possible. She only intervened when communication broke down, or when it might be helpful to make an interpretation, or when something went wrong. On this particular Monday, a bone of contention arose almost immediately, requiring a rare intervention. The problem—as usual—was Henry. 3 Henry arrived later than the others. He was flushed and out of breath, and he seemed a little unsteady on his feet. Mariana wondered if he was high. She wouldn’t have been surprised. She suspected Henry was abusing his medication—but being his therapist, not his medical doctor, there was little she could do about that. Henry Booth was only thirty-five years old, but he looked older. His reddish hair was speckled with gray, and his face was covered with creases, like the crumpled shirt he wore. He also wore a perpetual frown, and gave the impression of being permanently tense, like a coiled spring. He reminded Mariana of a boxer or a fighter, preparing to give—or receive—the next blow. Henry grunted an apology for being late; then he sat down—clutching a paper coffee cup. And the coffee cup was the problem. Liz spoke up immediately. Liz was in her mid-seventies, a retired schoolteacher; a prim stickler for things being done properly, as she put it. Mariana experienced her as rather trying, even irritating. And she had guessed what Liz was about to say. That’s not allowed, Liz said, pointing a finger, quivering with indignation, at Henry’s coffee cup. "We’re not allowed to bring in anything from outside. We all know that." Henry grunted. Why not? Because it’s the rules, Henry. Fuck off, Liz. What? Mariana, did you hear what he just said to me? Liz promptly burst into tears, and things degenerated from there—ending in yet another heated confrontation between Henry and the other members of the group, all united in fury against him. Mariana was watching closely, keeping a protective eye on Henry, to see how he was taking this. For all of his bravado, he was a highly vulnerable individual. As a child, Henry had suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his father before he was taken into care and shunted around a series of foster homes. And yet, despite all this trauma, Henry was a remarkably intelligent person—and it had seemed, for a while, as if his intelligence might be enough to save him: at eighteen he got a place at university, to study physics. But he only lasted a few weeks before his past caught up with him; he had a massive breakdown—and never fully recovered. There followed a sad history of self-harm, drug addiction, and recurring breakdowns landing him in and out of hospital—until his psychiatrist referred him to Mariana. Mariana had a soft spot for Henry, probably because he’d had such rotten luck. But even so, she was unsure about admitting him into the group. It wasn’t just that he was significantly more unwell than the other members: seriously ill patients could be held and healed very effectively by groups—but they could also disrupt them to the point of disintegration. As soon as any group establishes itself, it always arouses envy and attack—and not just from forces on the outside, those excluded from the group, but also from dark and dangerous forces within the group itself. And ever since he’d joined them a few months ago, Henry had been a constant source of conflict. He brought it with him. There was a latent aggression in him, a bubbling anger, that was often difficult to contain. But Mariana didn’t give up easily; as long as she was able to maintain control of the group, she felt determined to work with him. She believed in the group, in these eight individuals sitting in a circle—she believed in the circle, and its power to heal. In her more fanciful moments, Mariana could be quite mystical about the power of circles: the circle in the sun, the moon, or the earth; the planets spinning through the heavens; the circle in a wheel; the dome of a church—or a wedding ring. Plato said the soul was a circle—which made sense to Mariana. Life was a circle too, wasn’t it?—from birth to death. And when group therapy was working well, a kind of miracle would occur within this circle—the birth of a separate entity: a group spirit, a group mind; a big mind, it was often called, more than the sum of its parts; more intelligent than the therapist or the individual members. It was wise, healing, and powerfully containing. Mariana had seen its power firsthand many times. In her front room, over the years, many ghosts had been conjured up in this circle, and laid to rest. Today, it was Liz’s turn to be spooked. She just couldn’t let go of the coffee cup. It brought up so much anger and resentment in her—the fact Henry thought the rules didn’t apply to him, that he could break them with such disdain; then Liz suddenly realized how much Henry reminded her of her older brother, who had been so entitled, and such a bully. All Liz’s repressed anger toward her brother started surfacing, which was good, Mariana thought—it needed to surface. Provided Henry could stand being used as a psychological punching bag. Which, of course, he couldn’t. Henry leaped up suddenly, letting out an anguished cry. He flung his coffee cup onto the floor. It split open in the center of the circle—and a growing pool of black coffee spread out onto the floorboards. The other members of the group were immediately vocal and somewhat hysterical in their outrage. Liz burst into tears again, and Henry tried to leave. But Mariana persuaded him to stay and talk through what had happened. It’s just a fucking coffee cup, what’s the big deal? Henry said, sounding like an indignant child. It’s not about the coffee cup, said Mariana. It’s about boundaries—the boundaries of this group, the rules we abide by here. We’ve spoken about this before. We can’t take part in therapy if we feel unsafe. Boundaries make us feel safe. Boundaries are what therapy is about. Henry looked at her blankly. Mariana knew he didn’t understand. Boundaries, by definition, are the first thing to go when a child is abused. All Henry’s boundaries had been torn to shreds when he was just a little boy. Consequently, he didn’t understand the concept. Nor did he know when he was making someone uncomfortable, as he usually was, by invading their personal or psychological space—he would stand too near when he spoke to you, and exhibited a level of neediness Mariana had never experienced in a patient before. Nothing was enough. He would have moved in with her if she’d let him. It was up to her to maintain the boundary between them: to define the parameters of their relationship in a healthy way. That was her job as his therapist. But Henry was always pushing at her, needling at her, trying to get under her skin … and in ways she was finding increasingly hard to handle. 4 Henry hung around afterward, after the others had left—ostensibly to help clean up the mess. But Mariana knew there was more to it; there always was with him. He hovered silently, watching her. She gave him some encouragement: Come on, Henry. Time to go … Is there something you want? Henry nodded but didn’t answer. Then he reached into his pocket. Here, he said. I got you something. He pulled out a ring. A red gaudy plastic thing. It looked like it had come out of a cereal box. It’s for you. A present. Mariana shook her head. You know I can’t accept that. Why not? You need to stop bringing me things, Henry. Okay? You should really go home now. But he didn’t move. Mariana thought for a moment. She hadn’t been planning on confronting him like this, not now—but somehow it felt right. Listen, Henry, she said. There’s something we need to talk about. What? On Thursday night—after my evening group finished, I looked out of the window. And I saw you, outside. Across the street, by the lamppost. Watching the house. It wasn’t me, mate. Yes, it was. I saw your face. And it’s not the first time I’ve seen you there. Henry went bright red and evaded eye contact. He shook his head. Not me, not— "Listen. It’s okay for you to be curious about the other groups I conduct. But that’s something we talk about here, in the group. It’s not okay to act on it. It’s not okay to spy on me. That kind of behavior makes me feel invaded and threatened, and—" I’m not spying! I was just standing there. So fucking what? So you admit you were there? Henry took a step toward her. "Why can’t it just be us? Why can’t you see me without them?" You know why. Because I see you as part of a group—I can’t see you individually as well. If you need individual therapy, I can recommend a colleague— "No, I want you—" Henry made another, sudden move toward her. Mariana stood her ground. She held up her hand. No. Stop. Okay? That’s way too close. Henry— Wait. Look— Before she could prevent him, Henry lifted up his heavy black sweater—and there, on his pale, hairless torso, was a grisly sight. A razor blade had been used, and deep crosses carved into his skin. Bloodred crosses, different sizes, cut into his chest and abdomen. Some of the crosses were wet, still bleeding, dripping blood; others were scabby, and weeping hard red beads—like congealed, bloody tears. Mariana felt her stomach turn. She felt sick with repulsion, and wanted to look away, but wouldn’t let herself. This was a cry for help, of course it was, an attempt to elicit a caregiving response—but it was more than that: it was also an emotional attack, a psychological assault upon her senses. Henry at last had managed to get under Mariana’s guard, under her skin, and she hated him for it. What have you done, Henry? I—I couldn’t help it. I had to do it. And you—had to see it. And now I’ve seen it, how do you think it makes me feel? Can you conceive of how upset I am? I want to help you but— But what? He laughed.
