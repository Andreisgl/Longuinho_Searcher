I'm happy to announce the availability of the first release candidate of the
new MediaWiki 1.18 release series.
Please try it out and let us know what you think. Don't run it on any wikis
that you really care about, unless you are both very brave and very
confident in your MediaWiki administration skills.
MediaWiki 1.18 is a large release that contains many new features and bug
fixes. This is a summary of the major changes of interest to users. You can
consult the RELEASE-NOTES file for the full list of changes in this version.
*********************************************************************
                             What's new?

plugins.

  supplement the "magic words" present in MediaWiki.

  user accounts.

  along the Vector skin.
Major features
- --------------
Better gender support
-- ---------------------
Until version 1.17, MediaWiki used neutral nouns to address and identify
users on their user page.
In English, this was not an issue since "User" matches both genders, but in
some languages the neutral gender is always masculine; for example, this
would cause French-speaking female Wikipedia users to be referred to as
"Utilisateur" (male user) instead of "Utilisatrice" (female user).
With version 1.18, user pages reflect the user's gender, if they have
specified it in their preferences.
More gender support (for instance in logs and user lists) will be available
in MediaWiki 1.19.
Improved file metadata support
-- -----------------------------
MediaWiki   now detects the camera orientation from Exif metadata, and
rotates the picture
preview accordingly. The original file remains  unchanged.
The   overall metadata support in MediaWiki has been greatly extended.
Previously, MediaWiki could only
extract limited Exif metadata, and   showed a subset of it on file
description pages. Since 1.18, MediaWiki can extract IPTC and XMP metadata
from uploaded files, and  more Exif information. This includes an embedded
description, author  information,  GPS coordinates, or copyright statement.
Improved directionality support
-- -------------------------------
A lot of work has been done to fix directionality bugs (Left-To-Right,
Right-To-Left). Most notably bug 6100 is fixed, which allows to display an
RTL interface on an LTR wiki properly (and vice versa). This was developed
under $wgBetterDirectionality, which is now no longer used because the
improvements are merged with the core code.
A positive consequence is that the page content on wikis with multiple
scripts is aligned according to the direction of the selected variant. For
example, on a Kazakh language wiki, selecting the Arabic script variant will
align the text as RTL, while selecting the Latin or Cyrillic variant will
align it as LTR.
Easily find where to customize interface messages
-- ---------------------------------------------
MediaWiki allows you to customize the user interface by editing pages in the
MediaWiki namespace.
However, even though they can be viewed at Special:AllMessages] the sheer
number of these messages makes it difficult to find which one needs to be
customized. In MediaWiki 1.18, a new pseudo-language is introduced (qqx) to
help people find such messages, by displaying the messages' key instead of
the actual messages. All one has to do is append ?uselang=qqx to the page's
index.php/ URL (see
https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki_1.18&uselang=qqx as an
example).
New plugin for collapsible elements
-- -----------------------------------
The new jQuery.makeCollapsible allows you to create collapsible tables,
lists and so on, by adding the class mw-collapsible to the elements.
See the manual for details:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Collapsible_elements
Protocol-relative URLs
-- ----------------------
MediaWiki now supports protocol- relative URLs in links, interwiki targets
and $wgServer.
Protocol-relative URLs look like //example.com/wiki/Foo ; the browser will
recognize this as http://example.com/wiki/Foo when following a link from an
HTTP page, and https://example.com/wiki/Foo when following a link from an
HTTPS page.
This way, protocol-relative URLs enable a wiki to support HTTP and HTTPS
while serving the same HTML for both, which means the parser cache doesn't
have to be split.
More personalisable styles and scripts
-- --------------------------------------
MediaWiki now automatically loads javascript and stylesheets more specific
to each user.
There is a separate CSS and JS file for each usergroup
(MediaWiki:Group-sysop.css, MediaWiki:Group-autoconfirmed.js, etc), and also
a CSS file for users viewing without JavaScript (MediaWiki:Noscript.css).
Other changes
-- -------------
$wgEnableDublinCoreRdf and $wgEnableCreativeCommonsRdf no longer work in
core, and the functionality has been moved to the relevant extensions.
See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DublinCoreRdf and
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CreativeCoreRdf as appropriate
Math
-  ----
$wgUseTeX has been superseded by the Math extension. To re-enable math
conversion after upgrading, obtain the Math extension from SVN or from
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Math and add to LocalSettings.php:
require_once "$IP/extensions/Math/Math.php";
Language support
- ----------------
As with every release, MediaWiki 1.18 brings improved support for languages
in MediaWiki, with improved translation and features for the many supported
languages.
New languages:
* Angika (anp)
* Brahui (brh)
* Central Dusun (dtp)
* Jamaican Creole English (jam)
* Khowar (khw)
* Liv (liv)
* Kichwa (qug)
API
- ---
API bug fixes and new features have been added to 1.18, providing more
options for input and output.
    * API modules were added to access QueryPage based special
      pages, to Compare pages, Revert files, and to be able to access
      other special pages such as Special:UnwatchedPages,
      Special:MimeSearch and Special:ActiveUsers
    * The output of the generated help page has been improved
The API contains a breaking changes against previous releases:
    * action=watch now requires POST and token.
Other
- -----
Our thanks go to everyone who helped to improve MediaWiki by testing the
beta release and submitting bug reports and patches.
