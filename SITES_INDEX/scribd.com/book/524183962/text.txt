Moreover, it has the instructions to test oneself to become a dowser. Dowsing locates all objects that I refer to as targets, then to also measure the depths no matter how deep it is to the targets. Targets are can be mapped or traced from the surface, enabling the dowser to determine what the target is. Dowsing works better than ground-penetrating radar, which is limited to a shallow depth and requires electrical power. Ive been a proficient dowser for sixty-five years.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextNatureBotanyAgricultureArtLanguageEnglishPublisherXlibris USRelease dateJan 7, 2016ISBN9781514438244Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to Ancient Art of DowsingRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextDowsing: How to dowse, how dowsing works, pendulum dowsing, and more!EbookDowsing: How to dowse, how dowsing works, pendulum dowsing, and more!byPeter LongleyRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Dowsing: How to dowse, how dowsing works, pendulum dowsing, and more! for laterPendulum, L-Rod, Y-Rod: The Ultimate Guide To DowsingEbookPendulum, L-Rod, Y-Rod: The Ultimate Guide To DowsingbyBarbara Dowdy-TrabkeRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Pendulum, L-Rod, Y-Rod: The Ultimate Guide To Dowsing for laterL-Rods: Secrets of Energy DowsingEbookL-Rods: Secrets of Energy DowsingbyBarbara Dowdy-TrabkeRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save L-Rods: Secrets of Energy Dowsing for laterThe Essential Dowsing GuideEbookThe Essential Dowsing GuidebyDennis WheatleyRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Essential Dowsing Guide for laterHow To Dowse - Experimental And Practical RadiesthesiaEbookHow To Dowse - Experimental And Practical RadiesthesiabyMarguerite MauryRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save How To Dowse - Experimental And Practical Radiesthesia for laterDowsing ManualEbookDowsing ManualbyCharles GodwynRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Dowsing Manual for laterAncient Art of DowsingEbookAncient Art of DowsingbyDuane Arthur OseRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Ancient Art of Dowsing for laterThe Beginner's Handbook of DowsingEbookThe Beginner's Handbook of DowsingbyDr. Krishna N.
