Modeling studies based on long integrations of global circulation models (GCM) are normally carried out at very low resolution (typically coarser than 100 km) due to their high computational demand. On local scales, snow cover plays an important socioeconomic role, ranging from water management applications to outdoor recreation. These latter applications vary in horizontal resolution from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers, where small scale topography, land cover and local circulation effects play a significant role. In this study our focus will be on horizontal scales ranging from typical GCM global climate modeling to high resolution global weather forecasts. In the land surface component of a GCM (land surface model - LSM), snow cover temporal and spatial variability is mainly determined by the overlying atmospheric conditions. However, once snowfall settles on the ground, the sub-grid scale variability associated with complex terrain and land cover variability (not resolved at the model resolution) is parameterized following simple physical and/or empirical relations. The present study intends to access the impact of horizontal resolution in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) land surface model (HTESSEL). HTESSEL is forced by the ECMWF operational weather forecasts since March 2006 to December 2009 (runs in offline/stand-alone mode). The control run is carried out at the horizontal resolution of the forecasts at TL799 (gaussian reduced grid N400 -about 25 km). Two lower horizontal resolutions are then tested: TL255 (gaussian reduced grid - about 80 km, same as the ERA-Interim reanalysis), and TL95 (gaussian reduced grid N48 - about 200 km). The length of the simulations is rather small (only 46 months), however global meteorological forcing at 25 km can only be accessed through the ECMWF recent weather forecasts. Such high resolution associated with the state of the art modeling and assimilation frameworks guarantees that the atmospheric conditions seen by the LSM are as close as possible to reality. To assure that the two lower horizontal resolution simulations have a good quality forcing, an energy/mass conserving remapping was applied when upscaling the forcing fields. Special care was taken for the upscaling of temperature, specific humidity, surface pressure and downward longwave radiation considering the changes in mean orography between resolutions. Snow cover simulations are validated against two daily observational products: 1) IMS Daily Northern Hemisphere Snow and Ice Analysis at 4 km resolution (National Snow and Ice Data Center) and 2) SNOWCLIM snow depth daily European domain at 0.1° resolution (German Weather Service). The present work is focused over Europe, namely in four domains: Alps, Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, where conditional spatial sampling is performed in order to distinguish between complex versus flat terrain and forest versus exposed (low vegetation and bare ground) areas. The results are model dependent, but allow deriving important relations between resolution, orography and vegetation variability impacts on snow cover simulations.Save to Libraryby Pedro Miranda•  17  Eastern Europe, Outdoor Recreation, Atmospheric Modeling, Water ManagementOceanic processes as potential trigger and amplifying mechanisms for Heinrich eventsSave to LibraryDownloadby Reto Knutti•  18  Geochemistry, Oceanography, Climate Change, PaleoceanographyEstimation of surface long wave radiation and broadband emissivity using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature/emissivity productsSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael  Sparrow•  9  Remote Sensing, Climate Change, Multidisciplinary, Standard DeviationFunctional ANOVA and regional climate experiments: a statistical analysis of dynamic downscalingSave to LibraryDownloadby Linda Mearns•  8  Functional Analysis, Environmetrics, Statistical Analysis, SeasonalityEvaluation of global wind powerSave to LibraryDownloadby Dimple Garg•  23  Statistics, Energy, Multidisciplinary, Great Lakes RegionFuture projections of heat waves around Japan simulated by CMIP3 and high-resolution Meteorological Research Institute atmospheric climate modelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Masuo Nakano•  3  Multidisciplinary, Global Warming, Global Climate ModelUsing the Radiative Kernel Technique to Calculate Climate Feedbacks in NCAR’s Community Atmospheric ModelClimate models differ in their responses to imposed forcings, such as increased greenhouse gas concentrations, due to different climate feedback strengths.

Feedbacks in NCAR’s Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) are separated into two components: the change in climate components in response to an imposed forcing and the “radiative kernel,” the effect that climate changes have on the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative budget. This technique’s usefulness depends on the linearity of the feedback processes. For the case of CO2 doubling, the sum of the effects of water vapor, temperature, and surface albedo changes on the TOA clear-sky flux is similar to the clear-sky flux changes directly calculated by CAM. When monthly averages are used rather than values from every time step, the global-average TOA shortwave change is underestimated by a quarter, partially as a result of intramonth correlations of surface albedo with the radiative kernel. The TOA longwave flux changes do not depend o...Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeffrey Kiehl•  20  Oceanography, Climate Change, Climate, Sensitivity AnalysisSimulation of the tropospheric sulfur cycle in a global climate modelSave to LibraryDownloadby Henning Rodhe•  7  Environmental Engineering, Atmospheric Science, Atmospheric sciences, Atmospheric CirculationPotential impact of climate change on carbon in agricultural soils in Canada 2000–2099Save to LibraryDownloadby Brian Grant and +1Ward Smith•  16  Climate Change, Multidisciplinary, Global Warming, Climate ModellingPhysical interpretation of the correlation between multi-angle spectral data and canopy heightSave to LibraryDownloadby Sangram Ganguly•  18  Remote Sensing, Carbon Cycle, Multidisciplinary, Global changeThe long-term effect of increasing the albedo of urban areasSave to LibraryDownloadby Donny Seto•  8  Multidisciplinary, Global Warming, Emission reduction, Human SettlementClimate change and wildfire in CaliforniaSave to LibraryDownloadby Anthony Westerling•  10  Climate Change, Multidisciplinary, Wildfire, Climatic ChangeClimate change and future populations at risk of malariaSave to LibraryDownloadby Pim  Martens•  8  Climate Change, Global Environmental Change, Multidisciplinary, SeasonalityCharacterizing the urban heat island in current and future climates in New JerseySave to LibraryDownloadby Lily Parshall and +1Cynthia Rosenzweig•  20  Climate Change, Carbon Dioxide, Climate variability, MultidisciplinaryGlobal precipitation measurement: Methods, datasets and applicationsSave to LibraryDownloadby W.

EUCAARI started on 1 January 2007 and ended on 31 December 2010 leaving a rich legacy including: (a) a comprehensive database with a year of observations of the physical, chemical and optical properties of aerosol particles over Europe, (b) the first comprehensive aerosol measurements in four developing countries, (c) a database of airborne measurements of aerosols and clouds over Europe during May 2008, (d) comprehensive modeling tools to study aerosol processes fron nano to global scale and their effects on climate and air quality. In addition a new Pan-European aerosol emissions inventory was developed and evaluated, a new cluster spectrometer was built and tested in the field and several new aerosol parameterizations and computations modules for chemical transport and global climate models were developed and evaluated. This work enabled EUCAARI to improve our understanding of aerosol radiative forcing and air quality-climate interactions.

Here we assess its performance in the stratosphere. We present basic and derived dynamical and chemical model results and compare to ERA-40 reanalyses and satellite climatologies. Polar temperatures and the lifetime of the southern polar vortex are well captured, indicating that the model is suitable for assessing the ozone hole; this is partly a consequence of a good representation of meridional heat fluxes in the model. Ozone and long- lived tracers compare favourably to observations. Chemical-dynamical coupling, as evidenced by the anticorrelation between winter-spring northern polar ozone columns and the strength of the polar jet, is also well captured. We discuss remaining weaknesses and ways to improve the model. The simulation presented here forms part of our contribution to the CCMVal-2 model intercomparison.Save to LibraryDownloadby Scott Osprey•  5  Heat Flux, Ozone, Unified Model, System modelingTransient climate simulation forced by natural and anthropogenic climate forcingsNumerical experiments have been carried out with a two-dimensional sector-averaged global climate model coupled to a diffusive ocean in order to assess the potential impact of four hypothesized mechanisms of decadal to century-scale... moreNumerical experiments have been carried out with a two-dimensional sector-averaged global climate model coupled to a diffusive ocean in order to assess the potential impact of four hypothesized mechanisms of decadal to century-scale climate variability, both natural and anthropogenically induced: (1) solar variability; (2) variability in volcanic aerosol loading of the atmosphere; (3) anthropogenic increase of sulphate aerosols' concentration; (4) anthropogenic increase of greenhouse gas concentrations.Our results suggest that neither the individual responses nor the combined natural or anthropogenic forcings allow one to reproduce all of the recorded major temperature fluctuations since the latter half of the 19th century. They show that these temperature variations are the result of both naturally driven climate fluctuations and the effects of industrialization.By contrast, the dominant cause of decade-to-century-scale variability of the 21st century is likely to be changes in atmospheric trace-gas concentrations. Indeed, when the solar, volcanic, and tropospheric aerosols forcings used in our experiments are extended into the future, they are unable to counter the expected greenhouse warming.
