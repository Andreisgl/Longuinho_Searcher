Luci Callipari-MarcuzzoIndependent Researcher,  Contemporary Visual & Performance Art, Writing, Curatorial Studies, Southern Italian Diaspora Studies,  Graduate StudentPerformance Art+26Based near Mildura in North-West Victoria, Australia, I am a multi-disciplinary artist, mother, researcher, arts worker, curator and writer. Born to Calabrian migrants at Mildura in North-West Victoria, my arts practise explores notions of belief, religion, spirituality, Italian cultural practices and customs, the Italian immigrant experience, a woman’s “place” in traditional Italian-Australian society, memory and family relationships.Utilising modes of narrative enquiry and autoethnography, my multidisciplinary arts practice-based research investigates, interprets and translates the experiences of Calabrian settlers to North West Victoria (Australia) in a contemporary visual art and sociological context. Notions of belief and religious practices, gender roles and stereotypes, family relationships, nostalgia, memory and postmemory , cultural loss and preservation are also explored in my work. Through the methodology of live art performance, my work attempts to actively engage with my familial and feminine history. An integral part of my practice-led research is my self-transformation into an imagined version of my Calabrian grandmothers. During these enactments, I make artefacts utilising traditional women’s modes of making – sewing, embroidery and crochet. The work is a manifestation of the hopes, dreams and desires  of migrant women and strives to honour their voices which were not always heard due to the dominant gender roles within the Calabrian diaspora.In 2017, I completed a Master of Visual Arts (Research) at La Trobe University, Mildura campus, with my project 'Tracing the threads of the Calabrian diaspora to North-West Victoria.

Like other recently arrived migrants following WWII, settlers from regional Calabria immersed themselves in the familiar and clung to the traditions and customs of their homeland. They placed importance on maintaining cultural attributes because of the belief that back in their place of origin, the same thing was happening. Their new sites of settlement defined their sense of italianità1, as they maintained contact with other paesane2, Calabrians and Italians. By clinging to their culture, it was a way of preserving it.Italian Australian scholar, Gerardo Papalia stated; “immigrants themselves created their own little homeland within domestic walls. However, this homeland was fabricated with crystallised memories and inhabited with behaviour patterns deriving from what they had left.”3Based on this premise, the aim of my arts practice-based research is to investigate the experience of Calabrian migrants from the Aspromonte region of the province of Reggio Calabria (with a focus on the towns of Platì and Natile) who left Italy in the 1950s (in some cases earlier). Through scholarly articles, books, personal interviews and my own experiences, I will explore how these migrants transported a microcosm of their culture and cultural practices particular to their region to their new home in Mildura, in Victoria’s North-West.Through the modes of narrative enquiry, autoethnography, and traditional methods of making and women's work, my multidisciplinary arts practice-based research investigates, interprets and translates the experiences of Calabrian settlers to Victoria’s North-West, in a contemporary visual art and sociological context.Notions of belief and religious practices, gender roles and stereotypes, family relationships, nostalgia, cultural loss and preservation are also explored in my work.My research also explores broadly the global experience of migration, the factors which led to the Italian migrants to Australia, cultural loss and preservation and nostalgia in second and subsequent generations.1 Italianità: sense of Italianness or Italianism.2 Paesane: townspeople3 Gerardo Papalia, "From 'terrone' to 'wog': 'post' colonial perspectives on Italian immigration into Australia."
