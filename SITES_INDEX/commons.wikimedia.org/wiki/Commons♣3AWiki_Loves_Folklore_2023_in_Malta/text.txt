Wiki Loves Folklore 2023 - 1 February to 31 March  2023
Sharing Malta's intangible cultural heritage with the world
Wiki Loves Folklore is an international photographic competition to enjoy and celebrate the cultural diversity from around the World through Wikimedia projects (mainly Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons). Everybody can participate.
In Malta, we are calling on people to dive into their photo archives or visit local sites with connections of Maltese culture, folklore or storytelling and upload them to win!
The basic aim of the competition is to collect photos of human cultural diversity to illustrate articles in the worldwide free encyclopaedia Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects. The photos provided must match the theme, including, but not limited to festivals, material culture, dances, cuisine, clothing or daily life routine emphasizing on folk culture of Malta. 
To find out about all the other national competitions taking place, visit the international website.
The contest in Malta is organized by Wikimedia Community Malta, in collaboration with the international team for Wiki Loves Folklore.
There is also a writing competition running throughout March for Feminism & Folklore

Criteria
The jury will judge individual entries based on the following criteria (in no particular order):
Technical quality
Originality
Potential usefulness and overall value of the image (including its licensing) to the Wikimedia projects
Out and about
Please be respectful and considerate to your fellow photographers, and to others.
If you are photographing building interiors, stop straight away if you are asked to do so.  Some places prohibit interior photography, but in others you may be allowed to continue if you ask for permission.
Do not trespass on private property (it is perfectly OK, though, to take photographs while standing in a public place such as the street).
Where possible avoid photographing vehicles, and particularly vehicle numberplates.
Please do not upload photographs of posters, noticeboards, signs, or anything else having text or two-dimensional images that might be copyright-protected. That applies even to text or images that are in a public place and that everyone else is taking pictures of. Ancient wall paintings in churches are fine, as are photos of stained glass windows of any date.
