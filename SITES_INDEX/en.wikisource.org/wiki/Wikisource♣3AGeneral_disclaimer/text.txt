This page cautions readers and editors concerning the use of Wikisource. Essentially: use Wikisource at your own risk, and do not use Wikisource for legal or medical advice.
Please carefully read this general disclaimer. For the sake of simplicity, Wikisource (or this project, we, et cetera) refers to the authors, contributors, sponsors, or anyone else connected with the Wikisource website (including the Wikimedia Foundation).

Disclaimers
Accuracy
Wikisource makes no guarantee of validity or accuracy. This project is an online collection of free content source texts, that is, a voluntary association of individuals who are developing a common resource of primary material. Therefore, material found here may not be reviewed by professionals who are knowledgeable in the particular areas of expertise necessary to ensure the accuracy of the texts. Further, texts are hosted as-is; mistakes made by the author are deliberately left as-is to maintain the work's integrity.
That's not to say that you won't find many valuable and accurate texts on Wikisource, but we cannot guarantee (in any way whatsoever) the validity of the documents found here. In particular, medical or legal texts on Wikisource may be incorrect or out of date. We suggest contacting a qualified professional for such information.
Liability
None of the authors, contributors, sponsors, or anyone else connected with Wikisource in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate or libelous information or your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.
No damages can be sought against Wikisource for aforementioned inaccuracies or invalidities, as it is a voluntary association of individuals developed freely to create various open source online educational, cultural and informational resources. Further, Wikisource is not responsible should someone change, edit, modify, or remove any information that you may post on Wikisource or any of its associated projects.
Licensing
You may use the content on this website under the terms described by the license template and the general terms described at Wikisource:Copyright policy. In most cases, works are in the public domain or compatible with the GNU Free Documentation License.
You are free to reproduce Wikisource content freely and gratuitously just as we are doing. No agreement, contract, or liability is created between you and the site (or anyone related to the site). While we try to ensure that accurate copyright information is provided, you are responsible for verifying the copyright status of any work you use or copy.
Violation of local laws
Please note that content found here may be in violation of the laws of the country or jurisdiction from where you are viewing this information. Wikisource does not encourage the violation of any laws, but as this information is stored on servers in the United States, it is being maintained in reference to the protections afforded to all under the United States Constitution's First Amendment and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations. 
The laws in your country may not recognize as broad a protection of free speech as the United States or the principles under the UN Charter, or have restrictions not recognized in those jurisdictions, and so Wikisource cannot be responsible for any potential violations of such laws should you link to this domain or use any of the information contained herein in any way whatsoever.
