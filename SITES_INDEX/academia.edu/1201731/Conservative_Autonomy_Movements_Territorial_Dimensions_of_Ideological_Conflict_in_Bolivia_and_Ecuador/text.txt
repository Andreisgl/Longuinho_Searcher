First, it identifies the causes that help explain why we are seeing more territorial heterogeneity within countries in terms of the pursuit of ideologically disparate development models at different levels of government. Second, the article assesses the importance of this trend by analyzing the chief advantages and disadvantages of policy regime juxtaposition. Third, I turn to the question of why subnational officials are able to defend ideologically deviant policy regimes in some cases, but not in others. Based on the Bolivian, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian cases, my argument emphasizes the importance of two key factors: capacity and coalitions.Download Free PDFView PDFConference paperLeftist Governments and Economic Elites in Bolivia and Ecuador:  From conflict to rapprochement?2014 • Jonas WolffIn comparative studies on the so-called leftist turn in South America, Bolivia and Ecuador are usually placed close to the radical leftist edge represented by Venezuela. Indeed, the govern-ments led by Evo Morales and Rafael Correa have implemented processes of far-reaching political change which included the rewriting of the countries’ constitutions and the turning away from previous neoliberal recipes towards a much more state-centered development model. These political changes met with fierce resistance, in particular from the traditional political and economic elites. In the political arena, this polarization continues until today (further aggravated by increasing conflicts between the governments and former allies) – but below the level of official politics, remarkable changes have taken place that have yet to be studied systematically. These changes concern the relationship of the two governments with important business sectors. Most notably is the rapprochement between the Bolivian govern-ment and the economic elites from Santa Cruz, which had been fiercely oppositional during Morales’s first term in office. The turn from conflict to rapprochement is not that clear-cut in the Ecuadorian case, but also here recent years have seen some notable changes. The paper analyzes whether there has been, indeed, such a change from conflict to rapprochement in the relationship between the two governments and the respective business sectors. It aims at (1) empirically assessing and comparing the dynamics of conflict and rapprochement in the two countries, (2) identifying the causes that explain change, and (3) analyzing the implications for democracy and the overall processes of change. A revised version of this paper entitled "Business Power and the Politics of Post-Neoliberalism: Business-Government Relations in Bolivia and Ecuador" will be published in Latin American Politics & Society.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Centralism of 'Twenty-First-Century Socialism': Recentralising Politics in Venezuela, Ecuador and BoliviaKent EatonDownload Free PDFView PDFPolitics & SocietyBacklash in Bolivia: regional autonomy as a reaction against indigenous mobilization2007 • Kent EatonDownload Free PDFView PDFLatin American PerspectivesOpportunity Squandered? Elites, Social Movements, and the Government of Evo Morales2019 • Linda FarthingOver its 12 years in power, Bolivia’s MAS government has made significant advances in expanding inclusion and reducing poverty. In the process, it has steadily been transformed into a hegemonic force that is increasingly dependent on expedient and pragmatically based compromises with economic elites. Concurrently, social movement influence and participation in the government have steadily declined. After 2009, when an uprising by Eastern elites had been quashed and MAS gained a congressional majority, the MAS missed an opening to advance its original project of structural change, opting instead for a more expedient strategy that has kept it in power at the cost of accommodating elites and debilitating social movements. Durante sus 12 años en el poder, el gobierno MAS de Bolivia ha logrado avances significativos en expandir la inclusión y reducir la pobreza. En el proceso, se ha transformado continuamente en una fuerza hegemónica que depende cada vez más de compromisos oportunos y basados en pragmatismo con las élites económicas. Al mismo tiempo, la influencia y la participación en el gobierno de los movimientos sociales ha disminuido continuamente. Después de 2009, cuando un levantamiento de las élites del Este se suprimió y el MAS ganó una mayoría en el Congreso, el MAS perdió una oportunidad para avanzar en su proyecto original de cambio estructural, optando por una estrategia más conveniente que lo mantuvo en el poder a costa de acomodar a las élites y debilitar los movimientos sociales.Download Free PDFView PDFPost-Neoliberalism’s Difficult Hegemonic Consolidation. A Comparative Analysis of the Ecuadorean and Bolivian ProcessesIñigo Errejón GalvánThe current governments of Ecuador and Bolivia came to power after across-the-board crises of the political system. One of their immediate challenges is to consolidate the hegemony forged in the struggles against the neoliberal state. However, the allegiances created through the conflict are hard to transfer to an institutionalization of the new correlation of forces, and some groups have experienced disenchantment with the progressive governments. A comparative analysis of the hegemonic transition in the two cases suggests that, in contrast to that of Bolivia’s Movimiento al Socialismo, the hegemonic capacity of Ecuador’s electoral alliance, weakly organized and centered around the charismatic leadership of an “outsider,” depends more on its ability to dismantle possible opponents than on the appeal of its official identity, forcing it into constant reaffirmation of political boundaries.Download Free PDFView PDFEllner 2012 Chavez Morales CorreaNapathrarad SumpunkulapakDownload Free PDFView PDFLatin America's Resurgent Centre: National Government Strategies after DecentralisationKent EatonDownload Free PDFView PDFTwenty-First Century Socialism? The Elusive Search for a Post-Neoliberal Development Model in Bolivia and EcuadorGreg Weeks, Amy KennemoreThe recent political, economic and social histories of Bolivia and Ecuador point to a broader, post-neoliberal trend emerging in Latin America. Presidents Evo Morales and Rafael Correa have closely followed the basic model of twenty-first-century socialism as an alternative to free market capitalism. In theory, both leaders have successfully re-founded their countries with new constitutions that encompass the interests of all sectors of society. In practice, however, we argue that a volatile economic climate, poorly implemented reforms, increased opposition, and low political tolerance all indicate limitations to the viability of twenty-first-century socialism as a post-neoliberal development model.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
