This prospective pilot study investigates the effects of OMT on tongue behaviour in children with AOB and a visceral swallowing pattern. The study comprised of 22 children (11 boys, 11 girls; age range: 7.1-10.6 years). They were randomly assigned into OMT and non-OMT subjects. The randomization was stratified on the presence of a transversal crossbite. At baseline (T0), at the end of treatment (T1) and at 6 months after T1 (T2) maximum tongue elevation strength was measured with the IOPI system (IOPI MEDICAL LLC, Redmond, Washington, USA). Functional characteristics such as tongue posture at rest, swallowing pattern and articulation and the presence of an AOB were observed. OMT did significantly change tongue elevation strength, tongue posture at rest, and tongue position during swallowing of solid food. At T2 more OMT subjects had contact between the lower central incisors and their antagonists or palate (P = 0.036). More OMT subjects performed a physiological pattern of water swallowing than non-OMT children at T1 and T2, although the differences were not significant. Articulation of /s,l,n,d,t/ was not improved by OMT. No interaction between OMT and expansion was found for any of the parameters. OMT can positively influence tongue behaviour. However, further research is recommended to clarify the success of OMT as an adjunct to orthodontic treatment and to identify possible factors influencing the outcome.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Three hundred and six patients (188 female, 118 male; mean age, 14.7 years; standard deviation, 5.6; range, 8.4-47.2 years) were included in the study. In total, 406 impacted maxillary canines were studied, from 206 patients with unilateral impaction and from 100 patients with bilateral impaction. Initial 2D panoramic radiography was available, and 3D CBCT imaging was obtained upon clinical indication. The generated radiographic variables and specific features investigated were collected on 2D panoramic imaging and were correlated to the presence/absence of RR detected on CBCT. A validation sample consisting of 55 canines from 45 patients with maxillary canine impactions was collected to validate the outcome of the present study. The incidence of RR of the adjacent teeth was 33.8%. A prediction model using panoramic images for the possible presence of RR was established [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.79] and validated by applying leave-one-out cross-validation (AUC = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.77). For the subgroup of presence of severe RR the discriminative ability increased to 0.80. In this prediction model, patient gender, canine apex, vertical canine crown position, and canine magnification were the strongest predictors for RR. The final prediction model for RR based on available panoramic radiographs could be a helpful tool in justifying the need of additional CBCT examination.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nevertheless, quantifiying this parameter is a challenge. In this study, the reliability of repeated water content measurements with Corneometer CM825(®) on (burn) scars was investigated. Intra-observer reliability, inter-observer reliability and day-by-day variability were examined on 30 scars by means of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (WSCV). Bland-Altman plots with &amp;amp;amp;#39;95% limits of agreement&amp;amp;amp;#39; were constructed. Results revealed excellent ICC values (ICCintra  = 0.985; ICCinter  = 0.984) with relatively low WSCV (WSCVintra  = 6.3%; WSCVinter  = 10.6%) for respectively intra- and inter-observer reliability. However, the Bland-Altman plot showed that more than 5% of differences were expected to exceed 4 a.u., the limit of what has been defined as a clinically acceptable difference. Results for day-by-day variability showed good ICC value (ICCday-by-day  = 0.849) and higher WSCV (WSCVday-by-day  = 20.5%). The Corneometer CM825(®) is an objective and sensitive instrument for water content measurements. On the basis of our results, we concluded that the instrument can be used in clinical trials, but only under very strict conditions with standardized test protocol, preferably in combination with the evaluation of other physiological parameters.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Comparing 14 country-specific populations on third molars development: consequences for age predictions of individuals with different geographic and biological originby Steffen Fieuws, Salem  Altalie, and S. LeeABSTRACT Due to the migration aspect, frequently the age of an unaccompanied young fugitive with ... more ABSTRACT Due to the migration aspect, frequently the age of an unaccompanied young fugitive with a particular geographical and biologic origin was estimated using methods or models developed on a reference sample, including subjects with unlike origins. Since dental age estimations in the sub-adult group are based on third molar development, it has to be investigated whether differences in third molar development between populations with different geographic and biological origin exist. Furthermore the consequences on the age prediction performance, estimating the age of an individual from a different geographic and biological origin as the reference sample has to be examined. In an ongoing data collection, previously 9 country specific samples (Belgium, China, Japan, Korea, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, Saudi-Arabia and South-India) were investigated on third molar development (Thevissen et al., 2010a,b). In the present study 5 new country specific datasets (Brazil, Italy, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Croatia) were added, analyzed and compared. The aim of this study is to collect country-specific databases of third molar development, to evaluate and compare third molar development between the collected countries and to detect the impact on the age prediction performance, using a validation sample from a different geographic and biological origin as the reference sample.. A total of 11.250 panoramic radiographs from subjects out of the above described 14 countries were collected. For each country the individuals were, sex specific, homogenously distributed in the age range between 16 and 22 years. Third molar development of all present third molars was registered, according the ten stages technique of Köhler et al. (1994). Missing third molars received a zero score. Consequently each subject received a third molar score sequence for the upper right, upper left, lower left and lower right third molar respectively. To obtain for each subject a factor score, representing the degree of third molar development in the total dataset, a generalized linear mixed model for multivariate ordinal data was fitted on the third molar score sequences of all subject from the 14 countries. Differences in degree of third molar development between countries were analyzed using gender specific regression models for these factor scores with age and country as predictors. Comparisons between countries revealed differences in speed and onset of third molar development. Over the different ages the degree of third molar development changed between countries in an unordered way. No clear patterns of differences in degree of third molar development could be distinguished between the countries. Compared to all other countries, Belgium subjects were generally developing fastest. As such, using for age estimations purposes, third molar development information from Belgium instead of country specific information results in under estimated age predictions. This is the best judicial reference if country specific reference information is lacking. Indeed, legally spoken an advantage of the doubt for the individual under examination is then provided. No evidence was detected for important differences in degree of third molar development between the 14 examined countries. This implicates that geographical differences in third molar development between examined individuals are of clinically negligible influence using age predictions based on third molars development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The risk of death was increased in patients with low or elevated hematocrit, while it was minimal with values around 38%. The occurrence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events after successful renal transplantation not only relates to baseline cardiovascular risk factors present at transplantation, but also to immunosuppressive drugs and posttransplantation traditional and nontraditional risk factors.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This prospective cohort study evaluated the accuracy of clinical models in predicting CBDS for patients who will undergo cholecystectomy for lithiasis. From October 2005 until September 2006, 335 consecutive patients with symptoms of gallstone disease underwent cholecystectomy. Statistical analysis was performed on prospective patient data obtained at the time of first presentation to the hospital. Demonstrable CBDS at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was considered the gold standard for the presence of CBDS. Common bile duct stones were demonstrated in 53 patients. For 35 patients, ERCP was performed, with successful stone clearance in 24 of 30 patients who had proven CBDS. In 29 patients, IOC showed CBDS, which were managed successfully via laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, with stone extraction at the time of cholecystectomy. Prospective validation of the existing model for CBDS resulted in a predictive accuracy rate of 73%. The new model showed a predictive accuracy rate of 79%. Clinical models are inaccurate in predicting CBDS in patients with cholelithiasis. Management strategies should be based on the local availability of therapeutic expertise.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

If more than on... more Mixed models are widely used for the analysis of one repeatedly measured outcome. If more than one outcome is present, a mixed model can be used for each one. These separate models can be tied together into a multivariate mixed model by specifying a joint distribution for their random effects. This strategy has been used for joining multivariate longitudinal profiles or other types of multivariate repeated data. However, computational problems are likely to occur when the number of outcomes increases. A pairwise modeling approach, in which all possible bivariate mixed models are fitted and where inference follows from pseudo-likelihood arguments, has been proposed to circumvent the dimensional limitations in multivariate mixed models. An analysis on 22-variate longitudinal measurements of hearing thresholds illustrates the performance of the pairwise approach in the context of multivariate linear mixed models. For generalized linear mixed models, a data set containing repeated measurements of seven aspects of psycho-cognitive functioning will be analyzed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-one patients. Between July 2005 and October 2007, 61 consecutive medically uncontrolled glaucoma patients scheduled for first-time trabeculectomy were randomized to 1 of 3 study topical medication groups: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketorolac), steroids (fluorometholone), or placebo (artificial tears). Patients instilled 1 drop 4 times daily for 1 month before the procedure and were examined on days 1 and 2, at weeks 1, 2, and 4, and at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after trabeculectomy. Incidence of postoperative surgical or medical interventions (needling, laser suture lysis, needling revision, and intraocular pressure [IOP]-lowering medication). Fifty-four patients (54 eyes) were entered for analysis. The mean number of preoperative medications was 2.3+/-0.9. The mean baseline IOP was 21.0+/-6.0 mmHg. The mean postoperative target IOP was 16.5+/-1.8 mmHg. The mean follow-up was 23.6+/-4.0 months. The percentage of patients requiring needling within the first year was 41% in the placebo group, 6% in the NSAID, and 5% in the steroid group (P = 0.006). The percentage of patients requiring IOP-lowering medication to reach the target IOP at 1 year was 24% in the placebo group, 18% in the NSAID group, and 0% in the steroid group (P = 0.054 overall; P = 0.038 for steroids vs. others). The log-rank test showed a significant (P = 0.019) difference in medication-free survival curves between the different groups. More specifically, patients in the steroid group needed significantly less medication over the total follow-up (P = 0.007). Topical ketorolac or fluorometholone for 1 month before surgery was associated with improved trabeculectomy outcomes in terms of likelihood of postoperative needling. In the steroid group, there was a significantly reduced need for additional postoperative IOP-lowering medication compared with the other groups.

The effect of using CBCT in the diagnosis of canine impaction and its impact on the orthodontic treatment outcomeJournal of orthodontic science,  2014To investigate the added-value of using CBCT in the orthodontic treatment method of maxillary imp... more To investigate the added-value of using CBCT in the orthodontic treatment method of maxillary impacted canines and treatment outcome. The sample consisted of 118 treated patients. The CBCT group (n = 58) (39 females/19 males with the mean age of 14.3 years) included those with conventional treatment records consisting of panoramic and cephalometric radiographs, intra-and extra-oral photographs, and dental casts and complemented with a CBCT scan for additional diagnostic information. The conventional group (n = 60) (31 females/29 males with mean age 13.1 years) included those with similar conventional treatment records but without CBCT imaging. There were significant differences in the canine-related variables between both groups. The CBCT group had the higher level of difficulty and more severely displaced canines when compared with the conventional group. However, no significant difference was found between groups either in the number of treatment methods used or in the use of inte...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Reliability of Repeated Measurements on Post-Burn Scars with Corneometer CM 825 ®Skin Research and Technology,  2014The water content in burn scars, the parameter of stratum corneum water holding capacity, is an i... more The water content in burn scars, the parameter of stratum corneum water holding capacity, is an important feature in evaluation of biophysical properties of scars. Nevertheless, quantifiying this parameter is a challenge. In this study, the reliability of repeated water content measurements with Corneometer CM825(®) on (burn) scars was investigated. Intra-observer reliability, inter-observer reliability and day-by-day variability were examined on 30 scars by means of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (WSCV). Bland-Altman plots with &amp;amp;amp;#39;95% limits of agreement&amp;amp;amp;#39; were constructed. Results revealed excellent ICC values (ICCintra  = 0.985; ICCinter  = 0.984) with relatively low WSCV (WSCVintra  = 6.3%; WSCVinter  = 10.6%) for respectively intra- and inter-observer reliability. However, the Bland-Altman plot showed that more than 5% of differences were expected to exceed 4 a.u., the limit of what has been defined as a clinically acceptable difference. Results for day-by-day variability showed good ICC value (ICCday-by-day  = 0.849) and higher WSCV (WSCVday-by-day  = 20.5%). The Corneometer CM825(®) is an objective and sensitive instrument for water content measurements. On the basis of our results, we concluded that the instrument can be used in clinical trials, but only under very strict conditions with standardized test protocol, preferably in combination with the evaluation of other physiological parameters.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Comparing 14 country-specific populations on third molars development: consequences for age predictions of individuals with different geographic and biological originby Steffen Fieuws, Salem  Altalie, and S. LeeABSTRACT Due to the migration aspect, frequently the age of an unaccompanied young fugitive with ... more ABSTRACT Due to the migration aspect, frequently the age of an unaccompanied young fugitive with a particular geographical and biologic origin was estimated using methods or models developed on a reference sample, including subjects with unlike origins. Since dental age estimations in the sub-adult group are based on third molar development, it has to be investigated whether differences in third molar development between populations with different geographic and biological origin exist. Furthermore the consequences on the age prediction performance, estimating the age of an individual from a different geographic and biological origin as the reference sample has to be examined. In an ongoing data collection, previously 9 country specific samples (Belgium, China, Japan, Korea, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, Saudi-Arabia and South-India) were investigated on third molar development (Thevissen et al., 2010a,b). In the present study 5 new country specific datasets (Brazil, Italy, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Croatia) were added, analyzed and compared. The aim of this study is to collect country-specific databases of third molar development, to evaluate and compare third molar development between the collected countries and to detect the impact on the age prediction performance, using a validation sample from a different geographic and biological origin as the reference sample.. A total of 11.250 panoramic radiographs from subjects out of the above described 14 countries were collected. For each country the individuals were, sex specific, homogenously distributed in the age range between 16 and 22 years. Third molar development of all present third molars was registered, according the ten stages technique of Köhler et al. (1994). Missing third molars received a zero score. Consequently each subject received a third molar score sequence for the upper right, upper left, lower left and lower right third molar respectively. To obtain for each subject a factor score, representing the degree of third molar development in the total dataset, a generalized linear mixed model for multivariate ordinal data was fitted on the third molar score sequences of all subject from the 14 countries. Differences in degree of third molar development between countries were analyzed using gender specific regression models for these factor scores with age and country as predictors. Comparisons between countries revealed differences in speed and onset of third molar development. Over the different ages the degree of third molar development changed between countries in an unordered way. No clear patterns of differences in degree of third molar development could be distinguished between the countries. Compared to all other countries, Belgium subjects were generally developing fastest. As such, using for age estimations purposes, third molar development information from Belgium instead of country specific information results in under estimated age predictions. This is the best judicial reference if country specific reference information is lacking. Indeed, legally spoken an advantage of the doubt for the individual under examination is then provided. No evidence was detected for important differences in degree of third molar development between the 14 examined countries. This implicates that geographical differences in third molar development between examined individuals are of clinically negligible influence using age predictions based on third molars development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
How do patients score cosmesis after laparoscopic NOSE-colectomy?Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,  Jan 24, 2014Laparoscopic colorectal resection results in improved cosmetic outcome and better presumed body i... more Laparoscopic colorectal resection results in improved cosmetic outcome and better presumed body image. Laparoscopic NOSE-colectomy omits an incision for specimen extraction and is supposed to improve further the postoperative cosmesis. This study aimed to assess the cosmetic benefit. Forty-nine patients who underwent a NOSE-colectomy for bowel endometriosis from September 2009 to September 2013 were matched for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class (ASA score) and body mass index (BMI) with patients who underwent a conventional laparoscopic colectomy for the same indication. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of a body scale and a cosmetic scale and a Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) including five subscales (appearance, symptoms, scar consciousness, satisfaction with appearance and satisfaction with symptoms). Patient demographics were similar between both groups.

The impact of liver transplantation after surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinomaFrontiers in surgery,  2014The impact of liver transplantation (LTx) after surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (... more The impact of liver transplantation (LTx) after surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undefined. The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of LTx and of selection criteria for LTx on the survival of patients who underwent surgery for HCC. Between 2004 and 2009, 119 patients underwent surgical treatment for HCC. Cirrhosis was present in 85 patients. Of all patients, 77 fulfilled the Milan criteria, 88 the UCSF and 87 the up-to-7 criteria. Finally, 35 patients received an LTx, of whom 31 met the Milan, 33 the UCSF, and 33 the up-to-7 criteria. The relation between LTx and survival was evaluated using a Cox regression model with LTx as a time-dependent factor. Median [95% confidence interval (CI)] disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of the entire patient population was 9.4 (7-12.2) and 49.1 (37.7-64) months, respectively.

The aims of ... more Cardiovascular disease is a frequent cause of morbidity after renal transplantation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of cardiovascular events and to identify the main risk factors for cardiovascular complications and mortality in 2071 white adults with a renal transplant functioning for at least 1 year. Clinical events, routine biochemistry, and prescribed drugs at month 1, month 6, and yearly after transplantation were analyzed. The incidence of cardiovascular events increased over time. At 15 years after transplantation, only 47% of surviving patients had not experienced any cardiovascular event. Risk factors associated with cardiovascular complications were male gender (P=0.04), age (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.0001), arterial hypertension before transplantation (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.0001), longer pretransplant dialysis (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.0001), cardiovascular event before transplantation (P&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.0001), older era of transplantation (P=0.0009), center-specific effect (P=0.003), posttransplant diabetes mellitus (P=0.01), increased pulse pressure after transplantation (P=0.02), intake of corticosteroids (P=0.016), intake of azathioprine (P=0.016), lower serum albumin after transplantation (P=0.004), and higher serum triglyceride levels after transplantation (P=0.007). The risk of death was increased in patients with low or elevated hematocrit, while it was minimal with values around 38%. The occurrence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events after successful renal transplantation not only relates to baseline cardiovascular risk factors present at transplantation, but also to immunosuppressive drugs and posttransplantation traditional and nontraditional risk factors.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Clinical models are inaccurate in predicting bile duct stones in situ for patients with gallbladderby Raymond Aerts and Steffen FieuwsSurgical Endoscopy,  2009The probability that a patient has common bile duct stones (CBDS) is a key factor in determining ... more The probability that a patient has common bile duct stones (CBDS) is a key factor in determining diagnostic and treatment strategies. This prospective cohort study evaluated the accuracy of clinical models in predicting CBDS for patients who will undergo cholecystectomy for lithiasis. From October 2005 until September 2006, 335 consecutive patients with symptoms of gallstone disease underwent cholecystectomy. Statistical analysis was performed on prospective patient data obtained at the time of first presentation to the hospital. Demonstrable CBDS at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was considered the gold standard for the presence of CBDS. Common bile duct stones were demonstrated in 53 patients. For 35 patients, ERCP was performed, with successful stone clearance in 24 of 30 patients who had proven CBDS. In 29 patients, IOC showed CBDS, which were managed successfully via laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, with stone extraction at the time of cholecystectomy. Prospective validation of the existing model for CBDS resulted in a predictive accuracy rate of 73%. The new model showed a predictive accuracy rate of 79%. Clinical models are inaccurate in predicting CBDS in patients with cholelithiasis. Management strategies should be based on the local availability of therapeutic expertise.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

If more than on... more Mixed models are widely used for the analysis of one repeatedly measured outcome. If more than one outcome is present, a mixed model can be used for each one. These separate models can be tied together into a multivariate mixed model by specifying a joint distribution for their random effects. This strategy has been used for joining multivariate longitudinal profiles or other types of multivariate repeated data. However, computational problems are likely to occur when the number of outcomes increases. A pairwise modeling approach, in which all possible bivariate mixed models are fitted and where inference follows from pseudo-likelihood arguments, has been proposed to circumvent the dimensional limitations in multivariate mixed models. An analysis on 22-variate longitudinal measurements of hearing thresholds illustrates the performance of the pairwise approach in the context of multivariate linear mixed models. For generalized linear mixed models, a data set containing repeated measurements of seven aspects of psycho-cognitive functioning will be analyzed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-one patients. Between July 2005 and October 2007, 61 consecutive medically uncontrolled glaucoma patients scheduled for first-time trabeculectomy were randomized to 1 of 3 study topical medication groups: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketorolac), steroids (fluorometholone), or placebo (artificial tears). Patients instilled 1 drop 4 times daily for 1 month before the procedure and were examined on days 1 and 2, at weeks 1, 2, and 4, and at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after trabeculectomy. Incidence of postoperative surgical or medical interventions (needling, laser suture lysis, needling revision, and intraocular pressure [IOP]-lowering medication). Fifty-four patients (54 eyes) were entered for analysis. The mean number of preoperative medications was 2.3+/-0.9. The mean baseline IOP was 21.0+/-6.0 mmHg. The mean postoperative target IOP was 16.5+/-1.8 mmHg. The mean follow-up was 23.6+/-4.0 months. The percentage of patients requiring needling within the first year was 41% in the placebo group, 6% in the NSAID, and 5% in the steroid group (P = 0.006). The percentage of patients requiring IOP-lowering medication to reach the target IOP at 1 year was 24% in the placebo group, 18% in the NSAID group, and 0% in the steroid group (P = 0.054 overall; P = 0.038 for steroids vs. others). The log-rank test showed a significant (P = 0.019) difference in medication-free survival curves between the different groups. More specifically, patients in the steroid group needed significantly less medication over the total follow-up (P = 0.007). Topical ketorolac or fluorometholone for 1 month before surgery was associated with improved trabeculectomy outcomes in terms of likelihood of postoperative needling. In the steroid group, there was a significantly reduced need for additional postoperative IOP-lowering medication compared with the other groups.
