For this purpose, the organism has an antioxidant defense system, which eliminate these reactive species, maintaining the redox homeostasis. This system includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. The significant increase in reactive species produced by the imbalance between generation and elimination generates oxidative stress. This situation may produce loss of cellular integrity and enzymatic function, as well as genomic instability. This oxidative damage would be involved in aging and degenerative diseases. To prevent the oxidative effects and damage, the intake of antioxidant compounds such as herbal drug or dietary supplement is proposed. These compounds may act by suppressing the formation or scavenging the reactive species, as well as increasing or protecting...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It... more Yerba Mate is the trivial name of the species Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae). It has a high reputation in the countries of origin for its psycho-stimulant properties, where the folia are used as a social drink. It is widely distributed in South America. The folium contains caffeine (0.3-1.7%) as principal xanthine, but theobromine is also present. In addition, it contains tannins, essential oils, triterpenes, saponins, resin, and phenolics, principally flavonoids and caffeoyl derivatives, being chlorogenic, isochlorogenic and neochlorogenic acids the most relevant compounds of this last group. The caffeine confers psycho-stimulant properties as well as cardiovascular and respiratory stimulant properties, which are the base of its anti-fatigue and stimulatory effects. Other properties as thermogenic, digestive, and hypocholesterolemic are also due to the presence of caffeine. The second relevant group of compounds is the phenolics, that confer anti-oxidant properties...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The amastigote stage was obtained by means of temperature changes and human plasma added to the culture medium. Epimastigotes (clon BraC15C2) were first grown in F69 medium at 27 degrees C during 96 h and then at 36.5 degrees C. After three subcultures of 96 h each at the latter temperature a subsequent incubation in the presence of 5% human plasma, was needed to obtain a population of amastigotes that could be maintained indefinitely in the F69 or F29 media. This amastigote population was similar morphologically to that obtained through other methods. The kinetic of growth depended on the culture medium used (F29 or Brain-Heart Infusion, BHI). When culture was incubated at 27 degrees C in both media, the pre-exponential and logarithmic phases of growth were observed at 72-96 h and 24-48 h respectively.

After administration of a diet supplemented with 25 mg% (w/w) lovastatin for 30 days the growth of HLMC was not inhibited. Liver and tumor phospholipid/cholesterol ratio was increased in lovastatin group but serum cholesterol was unaffected. Treatment with lovastatin increased delta 5 and delta 9 desaturation in tumor microsomes, whereas delta 6 desaturation did not change in tumors of treated mice. The changes were not reflected in the fatty acid composition of total tumor lipids.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Without human plasma, blood stream trypomastigotes performed only one cycle before disappearing and the culture kept growing as amastigotes and epimastigotes until the end of the experiment. In contrast, human plasma induced multiple cycles of transformation. The sequence was blood stream trypomastigotes, regressive parasites, amastigotes, progressive parasite and again trypomastigotes. Human plasma preserved the trypomastigote stage, produced a blockade of the epimastigote stage and inhibited the division of amastigotes. In this experimental model, human plasma modified the biological cycle of T. cruzi by inducing or inhibiting different stages.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An Aqueous Extract of Ilex paraguariensis Reduces Carrageenan-Induced Edema and Inhibits the Expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 and Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase in Animal Models of InflammationPlanta Medica,  2014Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is a highly popular herbal beverage in South America due to its high c... more Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is a highly popular herbal beverage in South America due to its high content of caffeine. Its hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties are of increasing interest in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders and for weight control. In the present study, we show for the first time both the local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous extract of mate in three classic in vivo models, namely acute and chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced mouse ear edema and acute carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema. Caffeine, rutin, chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicafeoyl quinic acid, and 4,5-dicafeoyl quinic acid, accompanied by a complex mixture of other simple phenolic acids, were identified in the extract by HPLC-UV analyses. In the acute edema model, mate extract applied topically (1 mg/ear) halved the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced acute edema (50 %) and almost suppressed neutrophil infiltration (93 %), while in the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced subchronic inflammation, the edema was significantly reduced by 62 % (1 mg/ear/day × seven doses). The oral administration of the mate extract (250 mg/kg) significantly reduced the carrageenan-induced edema at all time points, an effect which was accompanied by a 43 % and 53 % reduction of the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, respectively. Histological analyses confirmed a reduction of epithelium thickness, dermis with mild inflammation, hair follicles with some secretory cells of sebaceous glands, and hypodermic adipocytes. In conclusion, mate is endowed with in vivo preventative or therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects in both local and systemic inflammatory processes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A new dual inhibitor of arachidonate metabolism isolated from Helichrysum italicumEuropean Journal of Pharmacology,  2003Six acetophenones (1-6) and one gamma-pyrone (7), previously isolated from Helichrysum italicum, ... more Six acetophenones (1-6) and one gamma-pyrone (7), previously isolated from Helichrysum italicum, were tested for their ability to inhibit enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation, the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycryl-hydrazyl free radical, superoxide scavenging and arachidonic acid metabolism. In addition, they were studied in different experimental models such as the chronic inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), the phospholipase A(2)-induced mouse paw oedema test, the carrageenan-induced mouse paw oedema test, and the writhing induced by acetic acid in the mouse. Of the assayed compounds, only 1 inhibited enzymatic lipid peroxidation but had no effect on non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation. None of them scavenged the superoxide radical. Study of the inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism demonstrated that 1 was an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, whereas 2 was a selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. In the assay of phospholipase A(2)-induced mouse paw oedema, the gamma-pyrone derivative inhibited oedema formation, showing a similar profile to that obtained with cyproheptadine. The acetophenones were effective at 30 and 60 min. In the carrageenan test, acetophenone 1 gave the best results and had analgesic effects in the acetic acid writhing test. In conclusion acetophenone 1 (4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)acetophenone) is a new dual inhibitor of arachidonate metabolism, and could be a useful tool for obtaining anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

After having demonstrated their effect on the xanthine oxidase-regulated superoxide production, the active compounds were tested for the direct inhibition of this enzyme. Methylated dicaffeoylquinic conjugates competitively inhibited the enzyme and the highest potency was obtained for the 4,5-diester, with an IC50 value of 3.6 microM, nearly ten times lower than that of the 3,5-analogue. In conclusion, the presence of the caffeoyl moiety is essential for both the antiperoxidative and radical scavenging activities, and the methylation of the quinic carboxyl group enhances the potency on xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As B-CLL cells spontaneously produce high amounts of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) having an altered redox state in relation to that of normal B lymphocytes, we decided to probe different metal Zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) and quantify the levels of Singlet Oxigen (SO) to see if variations of its intracellular concentrations could execute and accelerate deadly programs in leukemic cells rather than in normal B lymphocytes, when applied with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). In this way, we developed and tested a variety of metal ZnNPs of which one made of 0.5% Manganese Doped Zinc Oxide (ZnO:Mn) was finally selected for further testing as it had the best fludarabine resistant B-CLL cells in vitro killing activity, specially when combined with PDT.

Phenolics, especially flavonoids and phlorotannins, have been considered as modulators of the BZD-site of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), with sedative, anxiolytic or anticonvulsant effects. However, the wide chemical structural variability of flavonoids shows their potential action at more than one additional binding site on GABAARs, which may act either negatively, positively, by neutralizing GABAARs, or directly as allosteric agonists. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to compile and discuss an update of the role of phenolics, namely as pharmacological targets involving dysfunctions of the GABA system, analyzing both their different compounds and their mechanism as GABAergic modulators. We focus this review on articles written in English since the year 2010 until the present. O...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In addition, they were studied in different experimental models such as the chronic inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), the phospholipase A(2)-induced mouse paw oedema test, the carrageenan-induced mouse paw oedema test, and the writhing induced by acetic acid in the mouse. Of the assayed compounds, only 1 inhibited enzymatic lipid peroxidation but had no effect on non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation. None of them scavenged the superoxide radical. Study of the inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism demonstrated that 1 was an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, whereas 2 was a selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase.

Viability was assessed by dimethylthiazol diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). To distinguish between the two modes of cell death, apoptosis and necrosis, we examined differences in morphological and biochemical changes of cells stained with annexin V- FITC (An) and/or propidium iodide (PI) using two different assays based on flow cytometry Results: Th...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Autophagyc Cell Death by the Use of Manganese Doped Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles and Photo-Dynamic TherapyInternational Journal of Drug Delivery Technology,  2015B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) usually follows an adverse, relentless clinical course by ... more B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) usually follows an adverse, relentless clinical course by slowly developing drug resistance to fludarabine and other chemotherapeutic agents, as well as by acquiring new different genetic abnormalities. As B-CLL cells spontaneously produce high amounts of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) having an altered redox state in relation to that of normal B lymphocytes, we decided to probe different metal Zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) and quantify the levels of Singlet Oxigen (SO) to see if variations of its intracellular concentrations could execute and accelerate deadly programs in leukemic cells rather than in normal B lymphocytes, when applied with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). In this way, we developed and tested a variety of metal ZnNPs of which one made of 0.5% Manganese Doped Zinc Oxide (ZnO:Mn) was finally selected for further testing as it had the best fludarabine resistant B-CLL cells in vitro killing activity, specially when combined with PDT.

Phenolics as GABAA Receptor Ligands: An Updated ReviewMolecules,  2022Natural products can act as potential GABA modulators, avoiding the undesirable effects of tradit... more Natural products can act as potential GABA modulators, avoiding the undesirable effects of traditional pharmacology used for the inhibition of the central nervous system such as benzodiazepines (BZD). Phenolics, especially flavonoids and phlorotannins, have been considered as modulators of the BZD-site of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), with sedative, anxiolytic or anticonvulsant effects. However, the wide chemical structural variability of flavonoids shows their potential action at more than one additional binding site on GABAARs, which may act either negatively, positively, by neutralizing GABAARs, or directly as allosteric agonists. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to compile and discuss an update of the role of phenolics, namely as pharmacological targets involving dysfunctions of the GABA system, analyzing both their different compounds and their mechanism as GABAergic modulators. We focus this review on articles written in English since the year 2010 until the present. O...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Don -synonym H. hispanicum Spach - is an endemic species of the East of Spain, with topical anti- inflammatory and antitrypanosome activities. In this work we aim to further gain insight into these activities by A) evaluating the efficacy of the methanolic plant extract in a TPA-induced chronic model of topical inflammation in mouse ear&#39;s and B) test the effect of two arylnaphthalene lignans, diphyllin apioside (1) and diphyllin acetylapioside (2) against epimastigotes of T. cruzi in axenic cultures. Our results, show that the diphyllin derivatives (1) and (2) present therein are only endowed with a mild in vitro antitrypanosome activity, with IC50 values of 62.9 and 60.1 µM, respectively, being toxic to normal mammal cells at the same concentration. On the other hand the plant methanolic extract exhibits a potent topical toxicity, causing necrosis of the skin, when applied chronically. The benefits and risks of therapies involving H. linifolium (L.) G. Don ex...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis): A Psycho-stimulant Plant with Anti-oxidant PropertiesYerba Mate is the trivial name of the species Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae). It... more Yerba Mate is the trivial name of the species Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae). It has a high reputation in the countries of origin for its psycho-stimulant properties, where the folia are used as a social drink. It is widely distributed in South America. The folium contains caffeine (0.3-1.7%) as principal xanthine, but theobromine is also present. In addition, it contains tannins, essential oils, triterpenes, saponins, resin, and phenolics, principally flavonoids and caffeoyl derivatives, being chlorogenic, isochlorogenic and neochlorogenic acids the most relevant compounds of this last group.The caffeine confers psycho-stimulant properties as well as cardiovascular and respiratory stimulant properties, which are the base of its anti-fatigue and stimulatory effects. Other properties as thermogenic, digestive, and hypocholesterolemic are also due to the presence of caffeine.The second relevant group of compounds is the phenolics, that confer anti-oxidant properties to yerba mate, which are closely related with its cardio-protective, anti-mutagenic and cellular protective effects. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in different pathologies, especially in cardiovascular diseases but also in digestive disorders and other systems and organs. In particular, a key factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac damage, atherogenesis, or arterial injuries, is the membrane damage caused by lipid peroxidation. In these cases, the use of anti-oxidants, such as carotenes or vitamin E is widely accepted; however, there are evidences that they could be innocuous or deleterious. For this reason, the administration of an anti-oxidant therapy based on the use of natural products with good bioavailability or with activity on anti-oxidant enzymes may protect against the direct injurious effects described for some oxidants.In the present chapter, we make a critical review on the properties of yerba mate, focusing on the anti-oxidant effects and the differences with other anti-oxidants used for medical purposes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
