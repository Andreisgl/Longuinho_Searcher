5th-Century BC Himera and the Campanian Connection: Petrographic and Archaeological Studies on Western Greek Amphorae from Poseidonia and Elea Unearthed in the Necropolis of HimeraMinerals,  Mar 2, 2020Within the frame of an in‐depth study of the corpus of about 560 western Greek transport

Based on archaeological considerations, nearly 100 items have been attributedto southern Campania, specifically to Poseidonia and Elea. The present paper proposes a detailedcombined archaeological‐archaeometric investigation of 16 samples discovered at Himera and oneat Jerba (Tunisia), of presumed Campanian provenance, compared with 4 local reference samplesfrom Poseidonia and 6 samples of western Greek amphorae found at Pithekoussai and Elea,attributed to Poseidonia by previous archaeometric analysis. All samples have been submitted to amacroscopic fabric examination according to the standard methods of FACEM (Fabrics of the CentralMediterranean) and to petrographic investigation (polarised light microscopy) and digital imageanalyses of microstructures. Our study points to a Campanian provenance of the investigatedamphorae and their distinction in a large group from Poseidonia and a small group from Elea. Theidentification of a numerous assemblage of 5th century BC Poseidonian transport vessels at Himerasubstantially underlines an earlier hypothesis about its ‘Campanian connection’ and allows for thereconstruction of an important Tyrrhenian commercial axis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

BC.In the last years archaeological research as well as a series of interdisciplinary and archaeometric analyses madeclear that the choice of a model for the Western Greek amphorae did not depend on the ethnic origin of producersor consumers, but from a variety of factors. Among these, the repertory of transport amphorae available in theregion evidently played an important role. Thus on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy until the 6th c. BC the prototypefor transport amphorae was chosen from Phoenician-oriental models, while the productions of the Ionic-Adriaticregion were influenced by Corinth. In this area we observe a plurality of types from the 6th c. onwards, whichcontinues at least until the 4th c. BC.Keywords: Greek amphora, typology, archaeometrySave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Napoli and F. Krinzinger. In 1997-1999 the Austrian team under the direction of F. Krinzinger re-examined wall B in the lower town where the intact stratigraphy brought crucial new results for the development of the fortification which evidently was more complex than assumed in the 1970s. They revealed a new, yet unknown part of the fortifications (wall G) which constituted the earliest seaward boundary of the city. At the same time, they allowed to divide further and readjust the dating of the three periods of the city walls (midth of 5th c. – 1st half of 2nd c. B.C.) and brought new arguments for the location of the harbour. They also underlined the determining importance of natural factors, like constant landslides and violent sea storms, for the development of the city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Questo contributo si occupa soprattutto dei contesti nella città bassa, dove F.

Verosimilmente le case in mattoni crudi erano costruite nell’immediata vicinanza della spiaggia e vennero distrutte due volte da frane staccatesi dalle sovrastanti pendici collinari.

Such a monumental terrace, already excavated and partly rebuilt in the last century, represents the largest sanctuary of Velia and is – together with the overlying terrace of cult place no. 9 – the last of a series of sanctuaries chiefly active f rom the late 4th to the 2nd cent. b.C. An inquiry into the building technique, as well as into the typology of the complex, with parallels in the Eastern Aegean, allows to suppose that this large terrace was built in the course of the 3rd cent. b.C. on the site of an older cult place completely destroyed by the new construction. Important new insights were obtained by the study of the famous altar for which now two phases seem to be likely. The investigations included also the period prior to the building of the terrace and led to the discovery of a large quarry presumablyconnected with the reconstruction of the city walls at the beginning of the 4th cent. b.C.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Come hanno provato gli scavi recenti, un ruolo decisivo è svolto dafattori ecologici come l’interazione fra alluvioni e frane e grandi mareggiate.Elea, Velia, urbanismo, fortificazioniDieser Beitrag stellt neue Überlegungen zur urbanistischen Entwicklung der Stadt Velia vom 6. bis zum 3. Jh. v.Chr. vor. Ein Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Korrelierung der unterschiedlichen urbanistischen Richtungen auf derAkropolis, auf dem Hügel von Sektor II und in der Unterstadt, die eine übergeordnete Planung vermuten lassen.Eine entscheidende Rolle spielten zweifellos auch ökologische Faktoren, besonders die Interaktion von großenMuren im Tal des Frittolo mit heftigen Meeresstürmen.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

G. K. Kunst - E. Gal - V. Gassner, Choice beef for the worshippers - the cattle record from the sanctuary of Jupiter Heliopolitanus at Carnuntum (Austria)by Verena Gassner and Erika GálKolloquien zur Vor-und Frühgeschichte 26Presented here are three large animal bone assemblages recovered from three pits from the area of... more Presented here are three large animal bone assemblages recovered from three pits from the area of the sanctuary of Jupiter  Heliopolitanus  at  Carnuntum. Two  of  them (G7 and G11) are from inside the precinct and are possibly linked to a reconstruction phase of the sanctuary at around the end of the  2nd /beginning of the 3rd century AD. They are believed to represent leftovers from communal meals of large groups of people. A third large pit (M/37) was situated immediately outside of the sanctuary and may represent a normal garbage pit, although its taphonomic history is less clear. This object is included mainly for comparative purposes. Summary data (NISP, bone weight) of the faunal remains are presented for the first time. After special reports were dedicated to bone artefacts, the bird remains and the butchery record from G11, this paper is devoted to the cattle remains in general, which form the core part of all three assemblages. Skeletal part representation and osteometry are important tools in recognising special features and similarities of  the  three  assemblages.  The  skeletal  part  representations of the cattle remains from pit G7 and G11 indicate both  butchery  and  consumption. Bone  measurements suggest the presence of a uniform cattle population during certain phases of the sanctuary.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

„Einheimisch“ oder „römisch“? – Überlegungen zur frühen Küchenkeramik in CarnuntumP.C. Ramsl, K. Rebay-Salisbury & P. Trebsche (Hrsg.) Schichtengeschichten. Festschrift für Otto H. Urban.

The conservative and problematic use of the terminus „indigenous“ for „in the tradition of La Tène Culture“, often found in Austrian studies on pottery, is pointed out and the regional differences within „Roman“ pottery are discussed. The type of the Auerberg vessel clearly developed from the La Tène tradition, but was also part of the repertory of kitchen ware in Northern Italy, the former Gallia Cisalpina, and most probably was brought to Carnuntum by soldiers of the 15th legion, recruited mainly from this area.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a starting point, a joint team of researchers from Turkey and Austria used the documentation from the 1922 and 1925 excavation campaigns led by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the Fogg Museum of Art at Harvard University. The new team explored the city using extensive surveys, geophysical exploration, and LiDAR scans. The results from this research give context to the American excavations, provide new information on the extent of the city and its necropolis areas, and create a preliminary model of the settlement patterns in the ancient city.

The aim was to improve current knowledge of the urban organization and diachronic development of the city. Both the geophysical investigations and the fieldwalking yielded new and interesting evidence for the urban organization of the city in the phase that followed its refoundation at the end of the fourth century BC. At this time, the city was laid out in long insulae with a width of 21 m, whose orientation matches that of the stoa on the acropolis, which was built in the same phase. The extension of the archaic city, instead, remains less clear, although there are some clues that it extended over quite a large area. It is especially interesting that the numberof finds considerably decreases at the beginning of the third century BC, at the very time when the first finds appear in nearby Notion.This very likely indicates that the old city of Colophon lost its importance to the new settlement of Notion, also known in this period as “Colophon on the Sea”.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As this survey represents the first major research project at the site of Colophon since almost 90 years, after an excavation campaign under Hetty Goldman and Carl Blegen in 1922 and a short stay in 1925, a large variety of research questions lay ahead at the beginning. The main focus was to study the ancient city’s extension, development and spatial organization over time by using modern survey methods during the annual field campaigns. After an initial orientation within the modern topography, the Turkish team decided to concentrate its activities on the Acropolis, while the Austrian team started research in the plain and the adjacent hills where the necropoleis are located. The Austrian team started 2010 with the retracing of the course of the Early Hellenistic city walls, documented by W. Schuchhardt and H. Wolters in 1886, which are – apart from the buildings on the Acropolis – the only built structure of the city still visible. In the year 2011 we also began with a study of the modern village of Değirmendere. In the same year we initiated our studies on the archive material of the 1922/1925 excavations at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. Between 2012 and 2014 our focus was on the exploration of the extension of the ancient city with surveys inside and outside the fortification walls. This work comprised extensive and intensive surveys, documentation of microtopography features as well as interviews with owners and tenants of fields. As field work of the Austrian team has been terminated after five seasons in 2014, we give a preliminary résumé here that concentrates on the results of the survey inside the fortification walls.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This contribution presents the exploration of the fortifications of these area (wall D), conducted by F. Krinzinger in the 1970ies, which are compared by us to the results of our more recent excavations of the fortifications in the Lower town of Velia. These studies of the years 1997–1999 allowed a better chronological classification of the development of the defensive architecture of Velia and in consequence some insights into the urban development of the quarter, which are supported by few recent observations in the area after a great fire in 2017. Finally, we present a catalogue of the tombs of the Roman period, found during the excavation of Porta Marina Nord.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
