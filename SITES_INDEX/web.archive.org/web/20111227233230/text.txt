Continuing its efforts to advance customer adoption of Linux, HP today announced the contribution of its Tru64 UNIX Advanced File System (AdvFS) source code to the open source community.
The AdvFS source code includes capabilities that increase uptime, enhance security and help ensure maximum performance of Linux file systems. HP will contribute the code as a reference implementation of an enterprise Linux file system under the terms of General Public License Version 2 for compatibility with the Linux kernel, as well as provide design documentation, test suites and engineering resources.
Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free software and open source development, and source code continues to draw interest from developers, the user community and customers. HP, which ships a Linux server at the rate of one per minute, has long provided open source alternatives to customers and contributed to the open source community to speed market development.
The source code serves as a rich technology base to advance ongoing development of Linux by providing a comprehensive foundation for Linux kernel developers to leverage and improve Linux file system functionality. 
Developed by HP, AdvFS has been deployed for more than 16 years by enterprises throughout the world. It simplifies file and storage management, enables online system backups and increases data availability. The integration of key AdvFS file system features also accelerates the roadmap of future solutions designed to strengthen Linux for enterprise customers.
To ensure the highest levels of data security and availability, Linux customers need full and immediate access to established technology, said Martin Fink, senior vice president and general manager, Business Critical Systems, HP. We continue to invest our engineering resources in the development of that technology, while working with the open source community to ensure accessibility and seamless integration. 
Increasing Linux performance and advancing productivity
Business demands for improved solutions are driving the Linux kernel development community to focus on the advancement of file system functionality. Currently, file systems are being developed through an open community process. HPs contribution fuels these efforts. 
HPs contribution of the Advanced File System code, coupled with their overall resource commitment to Linux, will greatly accelerate the development and commercial availability of improved system functionality for Linux, said Jim Zemlin, executive director, Linux Foundation. The technology and engineering resources being made available for next-generation file system projects are proof that HP is a true open source community leader.
Linux market leader
HP extended its worldwide lead in the Linux market with 38.6 percent of revenue market share for the first quarter of 2008, according to IDC. HP also holds the No. 1 Linux server market position in unit shipments, with 36.4 percent of market share worldwide.(1) 
HPs contribution accelerates the development of future Linux file systems, ensuring enhanced system performance to meet our increasingly demanding needs, said Professor Giovanni Aloisio, chief executive officer of the Italian Southern Partnership for Advance Computational Infrastructures (SPACI) in southern Italy. Linux is playing a significant role in our building of a supercomputing grid environment running HP Integrity servers. We have used many technologies over the years, including Tru64 UNIX with the Advanced File System, and this announcement assures SPACI of continued Linux growth to conduct significant new research. 
The Tru64 UNIX Advanced File System source code, design documentation and test suites are available by visiting http://advfs.sourceforge.net. More information on open source and Linux at HP is available at www.hp.com/go/linux.
