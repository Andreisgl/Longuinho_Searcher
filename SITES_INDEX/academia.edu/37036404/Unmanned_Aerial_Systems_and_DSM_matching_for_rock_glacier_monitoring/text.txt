Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are today an efficient tool to perform data acquisition in rough or difficult terrain, both safely and quickly, avoiding hazards and risks for the operators while at the same time containing the survey costs. Since 2012 ARPAVdA (the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Aosta Valley, Italy) periodically surveys with UAS photogrammetry the Gran Sometta rock glacier, the Agency main monitoring site for the climate change impacts on high-mountain areas and related infras-tructures. A Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophoto of the rock glacier are produced after each survey flight. In order to accurately georeference them in a stable reference system, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) campaign is carried out at each epoch, to update the coordinates of signalised Ground Control Points (GCPs), since they partly lay in unstable (moving) areas. In late August 2015 a survey flight has been executed with a senseFly eBee RTK, with differential corrections sent from a ground reference station. The block has been adjusted without GCP using, as control information, only the projection centres coordinates encoded in the images. The RMS of the differences found on twelve Check Points were about 4 cm in horizontal and 7 cm in elevation, i.e. practically the same accuracy found using GCP. Differences between the DSMs produced at the same epoch with block orientation performed with GCP and with GNSS-determined projection centres were also investigated. To evaluate the rock glacier displacement fields between two epochs, corresponding features were at first manually identified on the orthophotos by a trained operator. To avoid the manual time-consuming procedure and increase the density of displacement information, two automatic procedures, the former using Least Squares Matching (LSM) and the latter a proprietary implementation of Semi-Global Matching (SGM) have been implemented. Both techniques were applied to pairs of orthophotos as well as to pairs of DSMs at different epochs. A discussion of the characteristics of the implemented methods is provided and the results of the comparison of the two methods with manual measurements are illustrated. Overall, results using DSM matching provided higher completeness of the displacement field than orthophoto matching, especially if long-term (year-to-year) comparisons are considered. At the same time, SGM in both cases produced less mismatches and more smooth and reliable displacement fields than LSM.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersUSE OF UAS IN A HIGH MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE: THE CASE OF GRAN SOMMETTA ROCK GLACIER (AO)Marina Santise, Umberto Di  Cella, R. Delaloye, R. RoncellaPhotogrammetry has been used since long time to periodically control the evolution of landslides, either from aerial images as well as from ground. Landslides control and monitoring systems face a large variety of cases and situations: in hardly accessible environments, like glacial areas and high mountain locations, it is not simple finding a survey method and a measurement control system, which are capable to reliably assess, with low costs, the expected displacement and its accuracy. For this reason, the behaviour of these events presents the geologists and the surveyor each time with different challenges. The use of UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) represents, in this context, a recent and valid option to perform the data acquisition both in safety and quickly, avoiding hazards and risks for the operators while at the same time containing the costs. The paper presents an innovative monitoring system based on UAS-photogrammetry, GNSS survey and DSM change detection techniques to evaluate the Gran Sommetta rock glacier surface movements over the period 2012-2014. Since 2012, the surface movements of the glacier are monitored by ARPAVdA (a regional environmental protection agency) as a case study for the impact of climate change on high-mountain infrastructures. In such scenarios, in fact, a low-cost monitoring activity can provide important data to improve our knowledge about glacier dynamics connected to climate changes and to prevent risks in anthropic Alps areas. To evaluate the displacements of the rock glacier different techniques were proposed: the most reliable uses the orthophoto of the area and rely on a manual identification of corresponding features performed by a trained operator. To further limit the costs and improve the density of displacement information two automatic procedures were developed as well.Download Free PDFView PDFDrones Assessing the Accuracy of Digital Surface Models Derived from Optical Imagery Acquired with Unmanned Aerial Systems2019 • Salvatore Manfreda, Jana  Mullerová, Pietro VuonoSmall unmanned aerial systems (UASs) equipped with an optical camera are a cost-effective strategy for topographic surveys. These low-cost UASs can provide useful information for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction even if they are equipped with a low-quality navigation system. To ensure the production of high-quality topographic models, careful consideration of the flight mode and proper distribution of ground control points are required. To this end, a commercial UAS was adopted to monitor a small earthen dam using different combinations of flight configurations and by adopting a variable number of ground control points (GCPs). The results highlight that optimization of both the choice and combination of flight plans can reduce the relative error of the 3D model to within two meters without the need to include GCPs. However, the use of GCPs greatly improved the quality of the topographic survey, reducing error to the order of a few centimeters. The combined use of images extracted from two flights, one with a camera mounted at nadir and the second with a 20 • angle, was found to be beneficial for increasing the overall accuracy of the 3D model and especially the vertical precision.Download Free PDFView PDFSystematic Analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Derived Product QualityAsgan NasrullahUnmanned aerial vehicles are used today as a standard tool to derive very high-resolution geospatial data (e.g. 3D height models, orthophotos). The workflow from images to products is very often just an easy-to-use black box processing. However, in contrast to traditional photogrammetry with very high-quality hardware and proven processing standards, in the case of current UAV-based production such reliable hardware and processes are not available. This means that the user does not have good control over the achievable quality, or in other words, the user does not know which parameters influence the final product quality. This thesis will show and discuss results of a systematic analysis of the most mentioned influencing parameters. In the block adjustment process, several tests conducted to analyse the influence of camera lens types, quality of image initial positions, number and distribution of ground control points, flight altitudes, motion blur disturbances, additional cross strips and oblique configurations, and the percentage of forward overlapping images. Several tests also arranged to check the influence of some parameters on the dense image matching results such as image exposure, motion blur, and surface covers. Various flight configurations have been carried out using three different UAV platforms, in total performing 19 flights above a test area in Gronau, Germany. The results demonstrate that accurate initial positions and the number and distribution of ground control points become the main influencing parameters in reducing the deformation in the block adjustment processes. The impact of flight altitude changes varies with different types of lenses. Motion blurred images and forward overlap reductions tend to aggravate the achievable accuracy. Additional cross strips are only beneficial in the bundle block adjustment with fewer control points while oblique configurations give a better achievable accuracy in most scenarios. A rigid and textured surface cover will generate a denser yet more accurate point cloud than a non-rigid surface cover.

Nowadays, in the scientific community, the use of these systems is not a novelty, but a deeper analysis of the literature shows a lack of codified complex methodolo-gies that can be used not only for scientific experiments but also for normal codified emergency operations. RPASs can acquire on-demand ultra-high-resolution images that can be used for the identification of active processes such as landslides or volcanic activities but can also define the effects of earthquakes, wildfires and floods. In this paper, we present a review of published literature that describes experimental methodologies developed for the study and monitoring of natural hazards.Download Free PDFView PDFGeneration of Digital Terrain Model from Un-manned Aerial Vehicle Image DataMustafa ZeybekNowadays, Un-manned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms are useful data source for analyzing of terrain, surveying and three dimensional (3D) modeling of structures and façades of constructions. Low-cost platforms with rotary or fixed wing UAVs are capable of performing the multi view geometry and structure from motion with amateur cameras in autonomous mode. For the purpose of UAV flights gathering images are become powerful technique for many applications including change detection, deformation monitoring and forestry applications in small scale areas. Mostly procedure of gathering raw data is easier than a traditional photogrammetric pipeline gathering images on image blocks calculations of similar pixels on multi view images. Generation of very dense point clouds are possible after image alignment and estimating of camera pose. Processing of raw point clouds can result with highly accurate Digital Surface model (DSM), with further analysis digital terrain model, in other words bare earth extraction can be done. This paper presents the latest developments of UAV image processing methods for computer vision applications, surveying and 3D modeling issues for landslide area. Automation steps are mentioned for image processing, camera orientation, DSM generation and orthomosaics production stage.Download Free PDFView PDFSuitability of ground-based SfM–MVS for monitoring glacial and periglacial processesLivia  Piermattei, F. BlasiPhoto-based surface reconstruction is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique to lidar (light detection and ranging) in many fields of geoscience fostered by the recent development of computer vision algorithms such as structure from motion (SfM) and dense image matching such as multi-view stereo (MVS). The objectives of this work are to test the suitability of the ground-based SfM–MVS approach for calculating the geodetic mass balance of a 2.1 km 2 glacier and for detecting the surface displacement of a neighbouring active rock glacier located in the eastern Italian Alps. The photos were acquired in 2013 and 2014 using a digital consumer-grade camera during single-day field surveys. Airborne laser scanning (ALS, otherwise known as airborne lidar) data were used as benchmarks to estimate the accuracy of the photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) and the reliability of the method. The SfM–MVS approach enabled the reconstruction of high-quality DEMs, which provided estimates of glacial and periglacial processes similar to those achievable using ALS. In stable bedrock areas outside the glacier, the mean and the standard deviation of the elevation difference between the SfM–MVS DEM and the ALS DEM was −0.42 ± 1.72 and 0.03 ± 0.74 m in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The overall pattern of elevation loss and gain on the glacier were similar with both methods, ranging between −5.53 and + 3.48 m. In the rock glacier area, the elevation difference between the SfM–MVS DEM and the ALS DEM was 0.02 ± 0.17 m. The SfM–MVS was able to reproduce the patterns and the magnitudes of displacement of the rock glacier observed by the ALS, ranging between 0.00 and 0.48 m per year. The use of natural targets as ground control points, the occurrence of shadowed and low-contrast areas, and in particular the suboptimal camera network geometry imposed by the morphology of the study area were the main factors affecting the accuracy of photogrammetric DEMs negatively. Technical improvements such as using an aerial platform and/or placing artificial targets could significantly improve the results but run the risk of being more demanding in terms of costs and logistics.Download Free PDFView PDFIMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF UAV IMAGE BLOCK ORIENTATION WITHOUT GCPSHonoré NiyonsengaNowadays drones were very used in civil applications and this technology has known a very fast spread in many sectors where it is adopted to compensate the limitations in traditional aerial photogrammetry. This is due to the high speed in rural-urban migration and economic development where there is an apparent growing need of more up-to-date, detailed and accurate maps for more diverse applications. Thereof, the UAV technology is used in many countries for various applications such as land administration, urban planning, agriculture and archaeology. The very fast popularity of this technology is attributable to its particular advantages like very high resolution, manoeuvrability, low cost and availability. However, the UAV photogrammetry has limitations related to low accuracy because of a consumer grade digital camera combined with low-cost GNSS/INS system on board in most of the cases. As this accuracy can only be increased by an indirect orientation, more accurate ground truth information is required. In this regard, this project was conducted in order to find a solution to the low accuracy of UAV image block without using ordinary GCPs. And the main motivation is to maintain the low cost, flexibility and efficiency of this technology. Thereof, manual and automated methods were developed, implemented and tested using ISPRS Benchmark from Multiplatform Photogrammetry. In both methods, control points were detected, and measured from already available aerial orthophoto and elevation model in comparison to the UAV images block to be adjusted. As a result, a set of 3D control points were produced in aerial map coordinates system and used as ground truth to indirectly orient the UAV image block. The experiments showed that the proposed two methods can reliably increase the accuracy in the image block oriented based only on geotags. In both manual and automated methods, the horizontal accuracy was increased from around 1 to 2 meters up to about 5cm, and the relative errors considerably corrected. From the current research and experiment, one can conclude that the proposed methods were effective and can be proposed in applications where such level of accuracy is sufficient.

The main goal of this research is to evaluate the quality of photogrammetry-based digital surface model (DSM) from low-cost UAV’s images collected in non-optimal weather (windy and cloudy weather) and environmental (inaccessibility for regular spatial distribution of ground control points - GCPs) conditions. Materials and Methods: The UAV-based DSMs without (DSMP) and with using GCPs (DSMP-GCP) were generated. The vertical agreement assessment of the UAV-based DSMs was conducted by comparing elevations of 60 checkpoints of a regular 100 m sampling grid obtained from LiDAR-based DSM (DSML) with the elevations of planimetrically corresponding points obtained from DSMP and DSMP-GCP. Due to the non-normal distribution of residuals (vertical differences between UAV- and LiDAR-based DSMs), a vertical agreement was assessed by using robust measures: median, normalised median absolute deviation (NMAD), 68.3% quantile and 95% quantile. Results: As expected, DSMP-GCP shows higher accuracy, i.e. higher vertical agreement with DSML than DSMP. The median, NMAD, 68.3% quantile, 95% quantile and RMSE* (without outliers) values for DSMP are 2.23 m, 3.22 m, 4.34 m, 15.04 m and 5.10 m, respectively, whereas for DSMP-GCP amount to -1.33 m, 2.77 m, 0.11 m, 8.15 m and 3.54 m, respectively. Conclusions: The obtained results confirmed great potential of images obtained by low-cost UAV for forestry applications, even if they are surveyed in non-optimal weather and environmental conditions. This could be of importance for cases when urgent UAV surveys are needed (e.g. detection and estimation of forest damage) which do not allow careful and longer survey planning. The vertical agreement assessment of UAV-based DSMs with LiDAR-based DSM confirmed the importance of GCPs for image orientation and DSM generation. Namely, a considerable improvement in vertical accuracy of UAV-based DSMs was observed when GCPs were used.Download Free PDFView PDFUAV PHOTOGRAMMETRY IMPLEMENTATION TO ENHANCE LAND SURVEYING, COMPARISONS AND POSSIBILITIES.Rani  EL MEOUCHEDownload Free PDFView PDFISPRS International Journal Geo-informationSemi-Automatic 3D City Model Generation from Large-Format Aerial ImagesÜmit Işıkdağ3D city models have become crucial for better city management, and can be used for various purposes such as disaster management, navigation, solar potential computation and planning simulations. 3D city models are not only visual models, and they can also be used for thematic queries and analyzes with the help of semantic data. The models can be produced using different data sources and methods. In this study, vector basemaps and large-format aerial images, which are regularly produced in accordance with the large scale map production regulations in Turkey, have been used to develop a workflow for semi-automatic 3D city model generation. The aim of this study is to propose a procedure for the production of 3D city models from existing aerial photogrammetric datasets without additional data acquisition efforts and/or costly manual editing. To prove the methodology, a 3D city model has been generated with semi-automatic methods at LoD2 (Level of Detail 2) of CityGML (City Geographic Markup Language) using the data of the study area over Cesme Town of Izmir Province, Turkey. The generated model is automatically textured and additional developments have been performed for 3D visualization of the model on the web. The problems encountered throughout the study and approaches to solve them are presented here. Consequently, the approach introduced in this study yields promising results for low-cost 3D city model production with the data at hand.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
