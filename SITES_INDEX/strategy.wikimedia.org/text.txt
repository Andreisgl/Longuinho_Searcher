Who are our stakeholders?
Non-readers (six billion people old enough to read who do not benefit from Wikimedia projects directly)
Readers (three hundred two million unique visitors each month, viewing 950 million pages a day)
Contributors and other volunteers, whether called users, editors, wikers (some ten million registered users, a million contributors, a hundred thousand active and ten thousand very active editors,[1] of which three thousand care enough about WMF to vote in trustees elections, while 17,462 voted for the licensing update).
Foundation – trustees, staff, advisory board
Chapters – perhaps two thousand participants who have been members of a chapter at some point.[2]
MediaWiki Developers – perhaps ten thousand active users of the software, two hundred of which contribute patches, bugs, and ideas[3] and another thousand of which contribute to localizations.[4]
Extension developers
Localization, internationalization, translatewiki.net africanlocalisation.net (Anloc)
Donors (approximately a quarter million people have ever donated to the foundation)
Partners / allies, for example Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM) or educational institutions (schools)
Re-users (people who seek to re-purpose or re-present Wikimedia content)
MediaWiki users (outside Wikimedia)
Content subjects (people and organisations who have Wikimedia content written about them)
"Suppliers" like Creative Commons Corporation and Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Computer hardware sellers like Sun, IBM and others, for example One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)
Big telco like Orange, T-Mobile ... (selling cellphones featuring Wikipedia ...)
