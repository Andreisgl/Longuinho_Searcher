It builds on the authors&#39; observations on various languages, tonal and non-tonal; much of the evidence reviewed concerns tonal languages of Asia. With a view to providing beginners with an adequate methodological apparatus for studying tone and intonation, the present notes emphasize two salient dimensions of linguistic diversity. The first is the nature of the lexical tones: we review the classical distinction between (i) contour tones that can be analyzed into sequences of level tones, and (ii) contour tones that are non-decomposable (phonetically complex). A second dimension of diversity is the presence or absence of intonational tones: tones of intonational origin that are formally identical with lexical (and morphological) tones.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRepresentational implications of the phonologization of contour tones2014 • Ben MacaulayThis thesis bridges accounts of tonogenesis to representations of contour tones in the dominant framework, autosegmental phonology. Accounts of tonogenesis reference phonetic features and structures that are unable to be represented in autosegmental phonology. As these features are required for the phonologization of contour tones, it is argued that they must also receive some representation in the synchrony. This is done under the Evolutionary Phonology framework of sound change. An attempt to reconcile the disparity between perceived phonetic features and synchronic structure is made by discussing the implications of the sequencing of targets within autosegmental contours. This innovation would better reflect the tonal systems of the world’s languages as well as other asymmetries in segmental phonology.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Tonal and Intonational Phonology of Lhasa TibetanJonathan KS LimThis dissertation provides a comprehensive description of the tonal and intona- tional phonology of Lhasa Tibetan (LT) in the Autosegmental-Metrical framework. It is based on recorded data elicited from members of the Tibetan-Canadian community in Ottawa and Toronto. The first two chapters of the dissertation contain background information about LT, a summary of previous research on LT tones and intonation, and an overview of the theoretical framework and conceptual tools used in the rest of the dissertation. The third chapter deals with word tonology. I establish that the prosodic structure of LT brings evidence for four main constituents at or below the word level: a) the mora encodes vowel length contrasts, b) the syllable is the tone-bearing unit (TBU), c) the prosodic word, which is maximally binary, delimits the application of most tonal processes, and d) the prosodic word group, which matches grammatical words, is the domain of downstep. This prosodic structure provides evidence against the universality of the Prosodic Hierarchy (Selkirk, 2002; Nespor and Vogel, 2007) in that it has no phonological phrase, but has two word-level constituents. I then argue that LT has three lexical tones (H, LH, and L) – L being limited to some suffixes – and propose that these lexical tones are subject to tone rules applying within the prosodic word and the prosodic word group. These tone rules are similar to those proposed by Duanmu (1992), but have been improved to accurately predict the tone patterns of long polysyllabic words. Based on phonetic evidence, I also come to the conclusion that LT no longer has stress, and that the stress pattern found in other Bodic varieties has been reinterpreted as a part of the tonal system. The fourth chapter analyses phrasal prosody. I argue that LT forms intona- tional phrases around clauses and marks them with nal lengthening, pitch reset, and a limited set of boundary tones (H% and L%). Although communicative functions and information structure are mostly realized by means of final particles and morphosyntactic devices in LT, I show that boundary tones, focal tones, and deac- centing interact with word tones to form complex melodic patterns. In the fifth chapter, I present a phonologically-based F0 synthesis model to verify the adequacy of the proposed Autosegmental-Metrical model of LT. This F0 synthesis model consists of three main components: a) the tonal targets defined in previous chapters, b) an F0 interpolation component based on the PENTA model (Xu, 2004), and c) an evaluation component allowing a comparison of the F0 contours of real LT utterances with resynthesized F0 contours of the same utterances. The F0 synthesis model is able to generate F0 contours that approximate the F0 contours of real LT recordings, suggesting that the proposed phonological model adequately captures the overall tonal and intonational phonology of LT.Download Free PDFView PDFPhonetic insights into a simple level-tone system: ‘careful’ vs. ‘impatient’ realizations of Naxi High, Mid and Low tonesMinh-Châu  NGUYÊNDownload Free PDFView PDFPhoneticaTonal contrasts and initial consonants: a case study of Tamang, a ‘missing link’ in tonogenesis2008 • Martine MazaudonTamang (Bodic division of Tibeto-Burman) is spoken at the edge of the East Asian &#x27;tone-prone&#x27;zone, next to the almost tone-free Indian linguistic area, and is, chronologically, at the late end of the tone multiplication wave which has swept through East Asia in the course of the last two millennia. It can be regarded as a &#x27;missing link&#x27;in tonogenesis: following the loss of voicing contrasts on syllableinitial consonants, Tamang has four tonal categories instead of its earlier two-tone system; the present state of the prosodic system ...Download Free PDFView PDFLanguage Documentation & ConservationStudying emergent tone-systems in Nepal: Pitch, phonation and word-tone in Tamang2014 • Martine MazaudonThis paper focuses on the particular kinds of difficulties which arise in the study of an emergent tone-system, exemplified by Tamang in Nepal, where pitch, phonation and other laryngeal features combine in the definition of a tone. As a consequence, conducting a well-ordered analysis in stages first of phonetic transcription, then variation in context, then interpretation is not possible. Rather we have to discover the contrasting categories first, and study their phonetic realization next, or do both at the same time. This also leads to questioning the validity of the traditional distinction of features into “distinctive” and “redundant” and proposing instead an analysis of an abstract “tone” as a bundle of cues. We will only sketch the second characteristic of the Tamang tone system, the extension of tone over the phonological word. The contributions of instrumental studies and of a comparative-historical perspective are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFLanguage Documentation & ConservationStrategies for analyzing tone languages2014 • Alexander  CoupeThis paper outlines a method of auditory and acoustic analysis for determining the tonemes of a language starting from scratch, drawing on the author’s experience of recording and analyzing tone languages of north-east India. The methodology is applied to a preliminary analysis of tone in the Thang dialect of Khiamniungan, a virtually undocumented language of extreme eastern Nagaland and adjacent areas of the Sagaing Division, Myanmar (Burma). Following a discussion of strategies for ensuring that data appropriate for tonal analysis will be recorded, the practical demonstration begins with a description of how tone categories can be established according to their syllable type in the preliminary auditory analysis. The paper then uses this data to describe a method of acoustic analysis that ultimately permits the representation of pitch shapes as a function of absolute mean duration. The analysis of grammatical tones, floating tones and tone sandhi are exemplified with Mongsen Ao data, and a description of a perception test demonstrates how this can be used to corroborate the auditory and acoustic analysis of a tone system.Download Free PDFView PDFRevue ELA (Études de linguistique appliquée)L'intonation dans les langues tonales : des réflexions générales et deux études de cas2021 • Alexis  Michaud, Minh-Châu  NGUYÊNen: The present work illustrates what the study of tonal languages can contribute to the study of intonation. Studying the intonation of a tonal language leads to maintaining a consistent distinction between tones and intonation as separate levels. This perspective is instrumental in bringing out the specificity, richness and complexity of intonation. After recapitulating the essentials of a conceptual framework, we present a modest pilot experiment on Vietnamese and French which confirms the existence of crosswalks between tones and intonation. We then address the question of the nature of the prosodic phenomena that occur on final particles in Muong (a close relative of Vietnamese). Do these particles carry a lexical tone? What contribution does sentence intonation make to their realization? The current context of widespread bilingualism leads to the formulation of an innovative hypothesis: that a Vietnamese lexical tone provided Muong speakers with a prosodic pattern from which they created an “intonational tone”. fr: Le présent travail illustre ce que l'étude des langues tonales peut apporter à celle de l'intonation. Étudier l'intonation d'une langue tonale amène à distinguer de façon conséquente le niveau des tons de celui de l'intonation, ce qui aide à bien reconnaître la spécificité, la richesse et la complexité de l'intonation. Après avoir rappelé les bases d'un cadre conceptuel, nous exposons une modeste expériencepilote au sujet du vietnamien et du français qui confirme l'existence de passerelles entre tons et intonation. Nous abordons ensuite la question de la nature des phénomènes prosodiques qui se réalisent sur les particules finales en langue muong (proche parente du vietnamien). Ces particules portent-elles un ton lexical ? Quelle contribution l'intonation de phrase apporte-t-elle à leur réalisation ? Le contexte de bilinguisme actuel amène à la formulation d'une hypothèse novatrice : un ton lexical vietnamien a fourni aux locuteurs muong un patron prosodique dont ils ont créé un « ton intonatif ».Download Free PDFView PDFUsage Frequency & Articulatory Reduction in Vietnamese TonogenesisJeff StebbinsVietnamese (Vietic, Mon-Khmer, Austroasiatic) is monosyllabic and tonal. Most Mon-Khmer (MK) languages are multisyllabic and atonal. Evidence suggests that Vietnamese (VN) has had its tones less than one millennium, and that other languages (both MK and non-MK) are also acquiring tones, a process called tonogenesis. Comparing VN’s phonology to that of closely related languages, Haudricourt has identified several stages of tonogenesis. We know that Vietnamese tonogenesis included monosyllabization, loss of onset voicing distinctions, and loss of laryngeal codas, but how and why, and in what order? And why do other languages follow similar paths? Usage-based phonology claims that language change is driven by articulatory reduction, which motivates similar paths of change across related and unrelated languages. If speakers use a word often, they conserve effort by saying it the ‘easy’ way. And even if a word is reduced, its frequency helps listeners to perceive it. Frequent words reduce first, then infrequent words. I argue that tonogenesis can be given such an articulatory account, and I detail what such an account should include. Comparing VN’s sound changes to those in other MK languages, and to reductive processes noted by vocal physiology and articulatory phonetics, I demonstrate that each change along the tonogenetic path is an articulatory reduction. There is much about past tonogenetic processes that we cannot test, but the most recent of those processes are still synchronically evident in comparisons of frequent to infrequent words. To show that a usage-based account of tonogenesis is supported by synchronic facts, I analyze the spontaneous conversations and directed readings of 16 VN speakers in Hanoi and near Saigon. Acoustic measurements reveal that (relative to infrequent words) VN’s frequent words are reduced in three ways: they exhibit less negative spectral tilt, less duration, and less pitch excursion. The significance of each is explained. Empirical results support the usage-based, articulatory account that I propose. Future studies of sound change will gain useful diachronic insights by including considerations of usage frequency and articulatory reduction.Download Free PDFView PDFStatistical Modelling of Phonetic and Phonologised Perturbation Effects in Tonal and Non-Tonal Languages2017 • Chen Si, Adam G McCollum, Ratree Wayland, Sarah ChenThis study statistically models perturbation effects of consonants on f0 values of the following vowel in order to quantify the differences between phonetic perturbation effects (i.e., phonetic variation) and phonologised perturbation effects (i.e., tone distinctions). We investigated perturbation effects in a non-tonal language, Japanese and a tonal language, Chongming Chinese. Traditional methods of modelling cannot distinguish phonetic and phonologised effects on surface f0 contours, as variation caused by both effects reached statistical significance. We therefore statistically modelled and tested the differences in underlying pitch targets, which successfully distinguished between phonetic and phonologised effects, and is robust to data variability. The methods used in this study can be further applied to examine perturbation effects cross-linguistically and shed light on the development of tones and stages of phonologisation more broadly.Download Free PDFView PDFSoutheast Asian tone in areal perspectiveMarc Brunelle, James  KirbyIn this chapter, we address the role of contact in the evolution of tone in mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). We present an overview of the phonetic, phonological, and genetic characteristics of MSEA tone systems, emphasizing the rich variability of tonal realization found in the region. Next, we discuss the ways in which languages can become tonal, reviewing evidence for the spread of tone through contact as well as for the idea that much of the observed tonality on the ground in modern MSEA might be traced to a small number of ‘tonogenetic events’ rather than a large number of borrowings. In light of this discussion, we consider whether a re-evaluation of the notion of tone as a canonical indicator of ‘linguistic area’ more generally is warranted.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
