The Characteristics of Meter in Verse Portions of the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka: With Comparisons to Similar Verses in Early Buddhist TextsJournal of Indian and Buddhist Studies,  Dec 2021The text of the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is written in a mixture of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), Buddh... more The text of the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is written in a mixture of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, and Classical Sanskrit (Skt.). For this reason, the early version of SP has been thought to have been compiled in MIA and then Sanskritized as it was handed down through time. However, there are many objections, and a unified view has not been arrived at yet.One suggestion is that some verses in SP are unmetrical. In general, in Skt. prosody, short vowels before prefixes pr°, jñ°, st°, etc. are considered as long, but if this would be followed strictly, some verses in SP would be considered unmetrical. Many scholars claim that if those prefixes are regarded as a single consonant, they would then accord with metrical requirements. For this linguistic phenomenon, scholars also claim that the early SP was rewritten from MIA prefixes p°, ñ°, etc. to Skt. prefixes pr°, jñ°, etc., due to Sanskritization. However, there are also some verses that require the Skt. prefixes to be understood to cause lengthening to be metrically correct. Therefore, the suggestion is debatable.In this paper, I present parallel and similar verses from several early Buddhist texts (Suttanipāta, Dhammapada, Theragathā, Therīgathā, Jātaka), Mahāvastu, Lalitavistara and SP, focusing on the verses containing the prefix pr°. I will also discuss the possibility of Sanskritization in SP verses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Possibility of Verifying Sanskritization in the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka: A Study of Kern's Variant ReadingsJournal of Indian and Buddhist Studies,  Apr 5, 2021The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra, Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is regarded as one of the earliest examples of ... more The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra, Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is regarded as one of the earliest examples of Mahayana Buddhist texts. There are three classical Chinese translations of the Lotus Sutra in existence, including Kumārajīva's translation, Myōhōrenge-kyō ( 鳩摩羅什『妙法蓮華経』 ), which is one of the most important sutras in East Asia, especially Japan. It has had a major inﬂuence on the formation and development of other sutras, ideas and cultures. It is vital to study the SP in its original language when literary problems and issues arise between the SP and the Chinese translations of the Lotus Sutra, particularly with regard to the correct interpretation of Myōhō-renge-kyō. The earliest witness we have of the SP is in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) and also contains word forms of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) and Classical Sanskrit (Skt.). Edgerton named the unique vocabulary, word forms, and syntax that appear in Mahayana sutras as BHS. The extant SP manuscripts can be broadly divided into two:  the Central Asia tradition (CA) and the Gilgit-Nepal tradition (G-N). Kern and Edgerton advocated that the original SP was compiled in MIA and was converted to Sanskrit as it was passed down over the years (Kern-Edgerton`s hypothesis). Tsuji studied the SP in detail, and pointed out the following: (i) The BHS forms frequently appear in the verse texts, and Skt. forms in the prose texts, but some BHS forms are found in the prose texts. (ii) The original SP was compiled in not MIA but Skt. While it’s being handed down, various degrees of Sanskritization occurred following the tradition, which caused some diﬀerences in hybridity, and it is considered that the still-existing manuscripts were made (Tsujii`s points). However, there are many researchers who argue against this theory, and no uniﬁed conclusion has been reached yet.In my previous study, I noted the following three examples in relation to this discussion. In the additional notes of Kern, there is a list of variant readings of the correspondences between Kashgar manuscript (O) of CA and Nepal manuscript (N) of G-N. However, these corresponding word forms were not examined in detail, and not as many SP manuscripts were available to him as there are today.This paper studies in detail Kern-Edgerton's hypothesis and Tsujii`s point (ii), that is Sanskritization, by examining the Kern's list.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prajñā in the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka. (In Japanese)
梵文法華経における prajñāBulletin of Chuo Academic Research Institute （Chuo Gakujutsu Kenkyūjo Kiyō ）,  Nov 15, 2020The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra, Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP), which represents the earlier Mahayana Buddhist... more The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra, Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP), which represents the earlier Mahayana Buddhist texts, was handed down, accepted, and developed in many regions of East Asia with the advent of the Chinese Lotus Sutra translated by Kumārajīva, Miàofǎliánhuá Jīng [406 CE] (鳩摩羅什訳『妙法蓮華経』), which is considered to be a Chinese translation of the SP. Especially since the Japanese Buddhist tradition, the Lotus Sutra has become the scripture of choice for many traditional and new religious orders. For this reason, the study of the Lotus Sutra has been very active, but there are many problems due to the lack of comprehensive research on the vocabulary, word forms, word usage, transcriptions, prosody, etc. of the existing SP manuscripts. One of these unsolved problems is the discrepancy between the SP manuscript and the Chinese Lotus Sutra. Among the many discrepancies, this paper focuses on prajñā "wisdom"; although there have been many studies in the prajñā, there seems to be little discussion of prajñā case studies in SP, including the "wisdom" of the Lotus Sutra, in the canonical view. From this perspective, this paper examines the contrasted Chinese translations of prajñā and the Lotus Sutra in all extant SP manuscripts and presents the word meanings of prajñā in SP.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Examining the Sanskritization of the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka －A Study of Synonyms in the Text－Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies,  2019The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra, Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is regarded as one of the earliest examples ... more The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra, Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is regarded as one of the earliest examples of Mahayana Buddhist texts. There are three classical Chinese translations of the Lotus Sutra in existence, including Kumārajīva’s translation, Myōhō-renge-kyō (鳩摩羅什『妙法蓮華経』), which is one of the most important sutras in East Asia. It has had a major influence on the formation and development of other sutras, ideas and cultures. Where literary problems and issues arise in relation to the SP and the Chinese translations of the Lotus Sutra, in particular with regard to the correct interpretation of the Myōhō-renge-kyō, it is vital to study the SP in its original language.   The original SP is a sutra of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) texts and contains frequent usage of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) word forms and language. MIA is a language which incorporates both Pāli and BHS. EDGERTON classified Mahayana texts broadly into three classes. EDGERTON calls the unique vocabulary, word forms and syntax that appear in Mahayana sutras BHS.    The extant SP manuscripts can be broadly divided into the Central Asia tradition (CA) and the Gilgit-Nepal tradition (G-N). KERN and EDGERTON advocated that in its prototype form, the SP was compiled in MIA and was converted to Sanskrit as it was passed down over the years (KERN-EDGERTON’s hypothesis). TSUJI studied SP in detail, and pointed out the following: (1) The BHS forms frequently appear in the verse texts, and Skt forms in the prose texts, but some BHS forms are found in the prose texts. (2) Various degrees of Sanskritization occurred during the tradition, which caused some differences in hybridity, and it is considered that manuscripts that still exist were made.   In a previous study, I noted the following two examples of synonyms in relation to this discussion: (1) A set of two synonyms: MIA krīḍāpanaka- (BHS), Skt krīḍanaka-, and (2) a set of three synonyms: MIA sāntika- (BHS), MIA santika- (Pāli), Skt antika-. The results of this study support the points made by TSUJI. There is another example of the use of synonyms that can be highlighted. This is a set of three synonyms: MIA acintika- (BHS), MIA acintiya- (Pāli), Skt acintya-. For the purposes of this paper, 16 SP recensions have been used (5 manuscripts and 11 fragments). Using the KERN-NANJO (KN) revision as a reference, passages in the individual SP recensions that clearly correspond to KN have been identified. Based on this, the corresponding passages in each of the manuscripts and fragments have been identified. The methods used for identifying the three sets of synonyms highlighted above are discussed in another paper. This paper looks in detail at the third set of synonyms in the context of KERN-EDGERTON’s hypothesis and TSUJI’s points.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Examples of sāntika-, santika- and antika- in the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (in Japanese)Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies,  2017The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is one of the representative sutras in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. Ther... more The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is one of the representative sutras in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. There occurs many Middle Indo-Arya (MIA) expressions in the text. There are many different Saddhp manuscripts, and these can be generally classified into the Central Asia recension and the Gilgit-Nepal one. I have found so far an example of MIA krīḍāpanaka- / classical Sanskrit krīḍanaka- which supports the hypothesis advocated by Kern and Edgerton, that is, the progressive Sanskritization of the text in MIA. By investigating the six major manuscripts of the two recensions, I find another sample of synonym as sāntika-, santika-, antika- which supports the above hypothesis: MIA sāntika-, MIA santika- (=Pāli) appear in the older manuscript parts, on the other hand, classical Sanskrit antika- in the new corresponding part of the manuscripts. There may be a possibility to acquire a new viewpoint for elucidating the formation process of Saddhp by extending and evolving these investigations further.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'krīḍāpanaka-' in Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Central Asian Manuscript (in Japanese)The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapuṇḍarīka, Saddhp) is considered to be the source texts of Myo... more The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapuṇḍarīka, Saddhp) is considered to be the source texts of Myohōrenge-kyō (妙法蓮華経); however, there is not yet unanimous agreement with regard to an original text. The biggest reason for this is because individual research on each manuscript has not almost seen any progress.In order to distinguish the Saddhp source texts for the Chinese translations and to verify similarities and differences in transcribed words, vocabulary, word forms, and grammar between manuscripts, it is necessary to have strict and literal translations for each edition in the Romanized transcription of all Saddhp’s manuscripts against the KERN-NANJIO Edition which voluntarily had picked out different wordings that appeared in different source manuscripts written in different eras. However, this has not yet been done. Regarding vocabulary, word forms, and grammar, it would be expected that there are similarities and differences in Saddhp manuscripts belonging to different groups; however, there are also similarities and differences in manuscripts within the same group. This fact suggests that there may have been various chances for change in the formative process and the transmission of Saddhp. The language used in Saddhp is a mixture of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) and Classical Sanskrit. In the Central Asian recension of the Saddhp, MIA, word formations and syntax are very prevalent. Many scholars, including Hendrik KERN and Franklin EDGERTON, advocate the hypothesis that, in its original form of the Saddhp manuscripts was in MIA, and that it was changed to Classical Sanskrit during the process of compilation and editing. The Central Asian manuscripts have not been subject to a strict word-by-word analysis. There is no concrete basis for EDGERTON’s hypothesis.I have an example in support of this thesis. KERN, Naoshiro TSUJI and Kobun TODA point out how two synonyms meaning “toy” or “plaything” change between the MIA form, krīḍāpanaka- , in the Central Asian recension and the Classical Sanskrit form, krīḍanaka, in the Gilgit-Nepal recension. I have looked at all the examples of the usage of these words, using a variety of indexes, and I have checked for particularly high concentrations of these usages anywhere in the texts.On the surface, it looks as if MIA form words appear frequently in verse, based on the restrictions of poetic meter. However, in the Central Asia recension, MIA language forms are common even in prose. It may be possible to explain this as follows: the Saddhp was originally compiled using the form, MIA krīḍāpanaka-, in both verse and prose. This format of the word was then retained, even though the Kashgar manuscript is in prose. In order to philologically verify the actual circumstances with regard to the transmission (Th) of the Kashgar (O), one of the Central Asian manuscripts, for the purpose of preparing an edition of the Central Asian manuscripts, based on the suggestion of Dr. N. TSUJI I have been translating and making notes on O. In these days, I am focusing and making effort to read and comprehend Chapter 3 “Metaphor” since the chapter is considered to belong to the oldest layer of Saddhp. Proceeding with my translations and annotations while comparing Th and KN with each other, I have come to notice there are two variations for the word meaning “toy” —krīḍāpanaka- which can be considered to be MIA and krīḍanaka- in Classical Sanskrit.This is one example which supports this thesis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Where literary problems and issues arise in relation to the SP and the Chinese translations of the Lotus Sutra, in particular with regard to the correct interpretation of the Myōhō-renge-kyō, it is vital to study the SP in its original language.   The original SP is a sutra of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) texts and contains frequent usage of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) word forms and language. MIA is a language which incorporates both Pāli and BHS. EDGERTON classified Mahayana texts broadly into three classes. EDGERTON calls the unique vocabulary, word forms and syntax that appear in Mahayana sutras BHS.    The extant SP manuscripts can be broadly divided into the Central Asia tradition (CA) and the Gilgit-Nepal tradition (G-N). KERN and EDGERTON advocated that in its prototype form, the SP was compiled in MIA and was converted to Sanskrit as it was passed down over the years (KERN-EDGERTON’s hypothesis). TSUJI studied SP in detail, and pointed out the following: (1) The BHS forms frequently appear in the verse texts, and Skt forms in the prose texts, but some BHS forms are found in the prose texts. (2) Various degrees of Sanskritization occurred during the tradition, which caused some differences in hybridity, and it is considered that manuscripts that still exist were made.   In a previous study, I noted the following two examples of synonyms in relation to this discussion: (1) A set of two synonyms: MIA krīḍāpanaka- (BHS), Skt krīḍanaka-, and (2) a set of three synonyms: MIA sāntika- (BHS), MIA santika- (Pāli), Skt antika-. The results of this study support the points made by TSUJI. There is another example of the use of synonyms that can be highlighted. This is a set of three synonyms: MIA acintika- (BHS), MIA acintiya- (Pāli), Skt acintya-. For the purposes of this paper, 16 SP recensions have been used (5 manuscripts and 11 fragments). Using the KERN-NANJO (KN) revision as a reference, passages in the individual SP recensions that clearly correspond to KN have been identified. Based on this, the corresponding passages in each of the manuscripts and fragments have been identified. The methods used for identifying the three sets of synonyms highlighted above are discussed in another paper. This paper looks in detail at the third set of synonyms in the context of KERN-EDGERTON’s hypothesis and TSUJI’s points.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Examples of sāntika-, santika- and antika- in the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (in Japanese)Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies,  2017The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is one of the representative sutras in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. Ther... more The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (SP) is one of the representative sutras in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. There occurs many Middle Indo-Arya (MIA) expressions in the text. There are many different Saddhp manuscripts, and these can be generally classified into the Central Asia recension and the Gilgit-Nepal one. I have found so far an example of MIA krīḍāpanaka- / classical Sanskrit krīḍanaka- which supports the hypothesis advocated by Kern and Edgerton, that is, the progressive Sanskritization of the text in MIA. By investigating the six major manuscripts of the two recensions, I find another sample of synonym as sāntika-, santika-, antika- which supports the above hypothesis: MIA sāntika-, MIA santika- (=Pāli) appear in the older manuscript parts, on the other hand, classical Sanskrit antika- in the new corresponding part of the manuscripts. There may be a possibility to acquire a new viewpoint for elucidating the formation process of Saddhp by extending and evolving these investigations further.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'krīḍāpanaka-' in Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Central Asian Manuscript (in Japanese)The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapuṇḍarīka, Saddhp) is considered to be the source texts of Myo... more The Sanskrit Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapuṇḍarīka, Saddhp) is considered to be the source texts of Myohōrenge-kyō (妙法蓮華経); however, there is not yet unanimous agreement with regard to an original text. The biggest reason for this is because individual research on each manuscript has not almost seen any progress.In order to distinguish the Saddhp source texts for the Chinese translations and to verify similarities and differences in transcribed words, vocabulary, word forms, and grammar between manuscripts, it is necessary to have strict and literal translations for each edition in the Romanized transcription of all Saddhp’s manuscripts against the KERN-NANJIO Edition which voluntarily had picked out different wordings that appeared in different source manuscripts written in different eras. However, this has not yet been done. Regarding vocabulary, word forms, and grammar, it would be expected that there are similarities and differences in Saddhp manuscripts belonging to different groups; however, there are also similarities and differences in manuscripts within the same group. This fact suggests that there may have been various chances for change in the formative process and the transmission of Saddhp. The language used in Saddhp is a mixture of Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) and Classical Sanskrit. In the Central Asian recension of the Saddhp, MIA, word formations and syntax are very prevalent. Many scholars, including Hendrik KERN and Franklin EDGERTON, advocate the hypothesis that, in its original form of the Saddhp manuscripts was in MIA, and that it was changed to Classical Sanskrit during the process of compilation and editing. The Central Asian manuscripts have not been subject to a strict word-by-word analysis. There is no concrete basis for EDGERTON’s hypothesis.I have an example in support of this thesis. KERN, Naoshiro TSUJI and Kobun TODA point out how two synonyms meaning “toy” or “plaything” change between the MIA form, krīḍāpanaka- , in the Central Asian recension and the Classical Sanskrit form, krīḍanaka, in the Gilgit-Nepal recension. I have looked at all the examples of the usage of these words, using a variety of indexes, and I have checked for particularly high concentrations of these usages anywhere in the texts.On the surface, it looks as if MIA form words appear frequently in verse, based on the restrictions of poetic meter. However, in the Central Asia recension, MIA language forms are common even in prose. It may be possible to explain this as follows: the Saddhp was originally compiled using the form, MIA krīḍāpanaka-, in both verse and prose. This format of the word was then retained, even though the Kashgar manuscript is in prose. In order to philologically verify the actual circumstances with regard to the transmission (Th) of the Kashgar (O), one of the Central Asian manuscripts, for the purpose of preparing an edition of the Central Asian manuscripts, based on the suggestion of Dr. N. TSUJI I have been translating and making notes on O. In these days, I am focusing and making effort to read and comprehend Chapter 3 “Metaphor” since the chapter is considered to belong to the oldest layer of Saddhp. Proceeding with my translations and annotations while comparing Th and KN with each other, I have come to notice there are two variations for the word meaning “toy” —krīḍāpanaka- which can be considered to be MIA and krīḍanaka- in Classical Sanskrit.This is one example which supports this thesis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We found many parallel pādas among the early Buddhist texts and the Mahāvastu known by MIZUNO 1981-1995, YAMAZAKI 2018 and others.However, since the above scholars did not present the parallel and similar chanters but only the chanter numbers, it was impossible to confirm directly how parallel and similar each chanter was to the other. To make this possible, we have developed a program with a collaborator (an information engineer) to analyze the calculation of the edit distance of the chanters using the Levenshtein distance (see this book’s explanatory notes) on a PC, and this book presents the results.Like these studies, we hoped that this book would contribute to the study of many other Buddhist texts.This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP21K00058.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I’m wondering if there’s a possibility of getting a grant to catalogue the collections that aren’t catalogued and to digitize a selection of manuscripts. A retired librarian of 92 seems to be the leading expert on manuscripts, and it would be good to take advantage of his knowledge while he is still active.” This is my reply: “I think your note on the work of ‘catalogue the corrections ...’ is very attractive. How do you think of going about getting a grant for this work? Do you need my help?”Then I tried and succeeded to obtain a number of grants as noted in the first article by Pruitt. He actively led many research trips in Myanmar starting in February 2013, and he supervised taking photos of palm-leaf manuscripts and parabaiks in the U Pho Thi Library in the Saddhamma- jotikā-rāma Monastery in Thaton, Myanmar.We intended to produce digital books in PDF format from the photo image data. In this monastery there are about 788 manuscripts with some 900 texts. Since it takes a long time to process the images, especially since the work is very complicated, we needed to create computer programs to help with the work. So I asked Masahiro Miyao to make programs in the autumn of 2013. He succeeded in making two programs to do the main work and also provided some useful freeware tools as described in the third article. I revised them in order to make it easier to use them, and I also found some other useful freeware tools. I discussed the best way to explain these programs to scholars with Nishi, who was very helpful.By using these computer tools I have produced PDFs of all the manuscripts. We, Pruitt and I, checked the PDFs many times, and were able to revise the previous catalog list published in 2014. The revised list is in the second article. Pruitt is collaborating with Dr Christoph Emmrich of the University of Toronto, Canada, and uploading the PDFs to a website specially designed for the project as part of the university website.We would like to express our sincere thanks to collaborators in Myanmar, Mr U Nyunt Maung (Librarian), the head Sayadaw of the Sadhamma-jotikā-rāma Monastery, Thaton, the group of lay people supporting the U Pho Thi Library in Thaton, U Aung Moe Oo (photographer), and Daw Thinn La (Librarian). We would also like to give our thanks to Prof. Sunao Kasamatsu, and Dr Yutaka Kawasaki for all their support.This research is supported by Pali Text Society and Chuo Academic Research Institute of Rissho Kosei-kai.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
