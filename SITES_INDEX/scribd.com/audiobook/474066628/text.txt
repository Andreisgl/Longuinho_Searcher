BUT WHY?Eight kids, ages nine to seventeen, awaken to find that almost everything they have ever known has been stolen from them. They were ripped from their beds in the middle of the night and transported to an unfamiliar and unforgiving new world where there are strict rules, and they are punished if they refuse to obey.As the kids grapple with their mysterious new reality, they struggle with disconcerting questions. Where in the world are they? Why were they taken away from their families? Will they ever get to go back home? And the most frightening question of all: Will this be the place where they die?Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextMysteries & ThrillersDystopianYoung AdultLanguageEnglishPublisherTantor AudioRelease dateOct 13, 2020ISBN9781705238684Start your free  daysPlay sampleSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to The UnknownRelated audiobooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextBefore I DisappearAudiobookBefore I DisappearbyDanielle StinsonRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Before I Disappear for laterStungAudiobookStungbyBethany WigginsRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Stung for laterVariantAudiobookVariantbyRobison WellsRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Variant for laterThe DetourAudiobookThe DetourbyS.
