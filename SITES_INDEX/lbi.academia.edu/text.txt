However, if one is among the steadily increasing number of heritage professionals and academics that value these short-lived creations, their digital documentation can be considered a part of our legacy to future generations. To document the geometric and spectral properties of a graffito, digital photographs seem to be appropriate. This also holds true when documenting an entire graffiti-scape consisting of 1000s of individual creations. However, proper photo-based digital documentation of such an entire scene comes with logistical and technical challenges, certainly if the documentation is considered the basis for further analysis of the heritage assets. One main technical challenge relates to the photographs themselves. Conventional photographs suffer from multiple image distortions and usually lack a uniform scale, which hinders the derivation of dimensions and proportions. In addition, a single graffito photograph often does not reflect the meaning and setting intended by the graffitist, as the creation is frequently shown as an isolated entity without its surrounding environment. In other words, single photographs lack the spatio-temporal context, which is often of major importance in cultural heritage studies. Here, we present AUTOGRAF, an automated and freely-available orthorectification tool which converts conventional graffiti photos into high-resolution, distortion-free, and georeferenced graffiti orthophotomaps, a metric yet visual product. AUTOGRAF was developed in the framework of INDIGO, a graffiti-centred research project. Not only do these georeferenced photos support proper analysis, but they also set the basis for placing the graffiti in their native, albeit virtual, 3D environment. An experiment showed that 95 out of 100 tested graffiti photo sets were successfully orthorectified, highlighting the proposed methodology’s potential to improve and automate one part of contemporary graffiti’s digital preservation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
History and Archaeology in Discourse on the Dernberg–Reconstructing the Historical Landscape of a Medieval Motte-and-Bailey Castle and Deserted Villageby Roland Filzwieser, David Ruß, Geert J J Verhoeven, and Georg ZottiHeritage,  2022Investigating deserted medieval castles and villages in remote rural areas paired with a scarcity... more Investigating deserted medieval castles and villages in remote rural areas paired with a scarcity of meaningful written sources is a challenging task that can be significantly enhanced by the use of non-invasive archaeological prospection methods. Furthermore, the interpolation of stratigraphic relationships among maps by analysing paths and field boundaries, as performed by Klaus Schwarz in the 1980s, can also contribute significantly. Thus, in order to resolve numerous unanswered questions, a multidisciplinary approach is required. In this paper we present preliminary archaeological prospection data using magnetics and airborne laser scanning (ALS) as well as methodological considerations on the systematic analysis of historical maps on the site of Dernberg, a medieval motte-and-bailey castle with an adjoining deserted village. The magnetic data and corresponding aerial images, although not providing decisive information on internal structures, show several historical roads that allow for the localisation of the village at the foot of the castle hill, as well as other pathways and defensive structures. Data derived from laser scanning surveys carried out by uncrewed aerial vehicles, respectively, drone flights allow for a significant gain in information compared to publicly available ALS data. In a methodological discussion on the systematic analysis of historical maps, the site of Dernberg is used to illustrate not only how such an analysis can determine chronological sequences with respect to the pattern of former agricultural field systems and road networks, but that these assumptions can be confirmed in part by geophysical surveys.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To study these questions, regular GPR surveys were conducted over a period of 14 months across a test area covering a hall building at the Iron and Viking Age site of Borre in Norway. In order to obtain in situ measurements of environmental factors relevant for electromagnetic wave propagation including volumetric water content, bulk electrical conductivity, ground temperature, and precipitation, three monitoring stations were erected at the test site. Soil and sediment samples taken from the profiles at the respective monitoring stations were analysed to gain a basic description of their physical and chemical properties. Twelve GPR surveys were conducted roughly once a month between August 2016 and September 2017 and the results clearly indicated differences in the quality of the data collected. To better understand the underlying causes for this variation, GPR data were compared against and integrated with the in situ measurements gathered using the monitoring stations. The results of this analysis emphasised the benefit of dry conditions, which, if prevailing over a longer period of time, proved to generate GPR data of the highest quality. Seasonality could not be attested; instead, data quality was governed by small-scale weather patterns, where the time and intensity of rainfall events prior to the surveys as well as sudden changes in air temperature played a decisive role. While the results of this study are only valid for sites with similar settings such as Borre, they emphasise the importance of considering the environmental factors during all stages of a GPR survey and highlight the need for further studies investigating other settings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prospecting the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Müstair (Switzerland)by Jona Schlegel, Geert J J Verhoeven, Hannes  Schiel, Walser Christoph, Thomas Reitmaier, and Christoph WalserRemote Sensing,  2021The Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the e... more The Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the eastern part of Switzerland close to South Tyrol’s border (Italy). Known as a well-preserved Carolingian building complex housing Carolingian and Romanesque frescoes, the convent has received much academic attention. However, all research activities so far have been concentrated on the area enclosed by the convent’s walls, even though the neighbouring fields to the east and south are also part of the convent’s property. This paper reports on the archaeological magnetic and ground-penetrating radar surveys of these areas, executed as part of a pilot project exploring the convent’s immediate environment. At present, these fields are used for agriculture and located on a massive alluvial fan of the mountain stream Valgarola. Dense geophysical sampling revealed an intricate network of distributary channels with stream and mudflow deposits, constituting a natural border of the convent’s territory. In addition to different field systems, a newly discovered broad pathway appears to be an original Roman road. Numerous structural elements, mapped within the convent’s walls, could be attributed to specific building phases. Over 40 large and deep burial shafts, arranged in three rows, were discovered outside the convent’s burial ground. Their specific design and arrangement are characteristic of early medieval burials, such as those of the 6th century Lombards on the edge of the eastern Alps.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To answer specific research questions about the creation of a mural painting located in the Bishop's Gate porch of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, the three-dimensional geometry of the entire painted surface was digitised in minuscule detail using thousands of overlapping photographs. After a brief introduction to the basics of image-based surface digitisation, this paper describes in detail how the photographs were taken and how they were processed to create a digital three-dimensional surface. To appreciate the subtle surface variations encoded in this digital model, various relief visualisation techniques have been applied. The paper ends with a discussion of the new insights into the creation of this painting that are enabled by these visualisations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Integrating Geophysical and Photographic Data to Visualize the Quarried Structures of the Roman Town of Bassianaeby Roland Filzwieser, Vujadin M Ivanišević, Geert J J Verhoeven, Christian Gugl, Ivan Bugarski, Nemanja Marković, and Mario WallnerRemote Sensing,  2021Large parts of the urban layout of the abandoned Roman town of Bassianae (in presentday Serbia) a... more Large parts of the urban layout of the abandoned Roman town of Bassianae (in presentday Serbia) are still discernible on the surface today due to the deliberate and targeted quarrying of the Roman foundations. In 2014, all of the town's intramural (and some extramural) areas were surveyed using aerial photography, ground-penetrating radar, and magnetometry to analyze the site's topography and to map remaining buried structures. The surveys showed a strong agreement between the digital surface model derived from the aerial photographs and the geophysical prospection data. However, many structures could only be detected by one method, underlining the benefits of a complementary archaeological prospection approach using multiple methods. This article presents the results of the extensive surveys and their comprehensive integrative interpretation, discussing Bassianae's ground plan and urban infrastructure. Starting with an overview of this Roman town's research history, we present the details of the triple prospection approach, followed by the processing, integrative analysis, and interpretation of the acquired data sets. Finally, this newly gained information is contrasted with a plan of Roman Bassianae compiled in 1935.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Taking Vegetation Marks into the Next Dimension. Mapping the Hilltop Settlement of Montarice (Central Adriatic Italy) by a Multi-dimensional Analysis of Aerial Imageryby Geert J J Verhoeven, Frank Vermeulen, Devi Taelman, and Lieven VerdonckThe processing of aerial imagery acquired over Montarice hill (central Adriatic Italy) during the... more The processing of aerial imagery acquired over Montarice hill (central Adriatic Italy) during the Potenza Valley Survey will form the key focus of this paper. Since this site has repeatedly revealed itself in terms of interesting vegetation and soil marks, the most interesting footage, acquired during two observer-directed sorties more than a decade ago, will be examined. First, the potential of state-of-the-art image-based modelling (IBM) techniques is explored to create high-resolution orthophotographs from these analogue frame images. Since dense image matching-as a part of IBM-allows to model the vegetation surface at the moment of the photographic survey, a geometrical three-dimensional representation of the plant canopy is possible. This contribution shows how the latter can be the focus of its own information extraction process, using techniques mainly developed in the field of airborne laser scanning. However, the true interpretative power lies in the combination of the co-registered spectral and geometrical dimensions of the vegetation. Using Montarice as a case study, it will become clear that crop height data allows for powerful visualisations that can aid and even alter interpretative mapping that is solely based on colour differences in orthophotographs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Resolving some spatial resolution issues - Part 2: When diffraction takes overIn part 1 “Between line pairs and sampling distances” of this split entry on spatial resolution, ... more In part 1 “Between line pairs and sampling distances” of this split entry on spatial resolution, it was mentioned that this second part would focus on some fundamental laws of electromagnetic radiation to shed more light on the concepts of spatial resolving power and spatial resolution. The numbering of chapters, illustrations and equations simply continues so that one can easily merge both parts into one larger text. However, and in contrast to what was initially stated, this entry will not be the final part about spatial resolution. Because there is quite some, but still basic, ground to cover once the physical views on spatial resolution start to complement the geometrical ones, there will also be a third part. This approach also prevents any of these entries from becoming too lengthy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Leonardo Depicted America: Misread as the Moonby stefaan missinne and Geert J J VerhoevenLeonardo da Vinci must have been aware that Columbus discovered new territories in the West. Unti... more Leonardo da Vinci must have been aware that Columbus discovered new territories in the West. Until now, no material evidence had been found to substantiate this assumption. Here we show that Leonardo not only read Amerigo Vespucci's letter (derived from a painted star constellation), but that he even drew a map including the New World, a drawing which was previously interpreted as a depiction of the Moon. Finally, Leonardo engraved his notion of this new continent on an ostrich egg globe (now known as the Da Vinci Globe) and made a copper cast of this. Both the cosmographic and carto-graphic clues demonstrate that Leonardo da Vinci knew about the fourth continent, to be named "America" in 1507, less than a decade after Columbus embarked upon its shores. This expansion of Leonardo's cartographic legacy comes at a time of increased interest for such multidisciplinary insights, as the world commemorates in 2019 the 500 th anniversary of his death.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Zerstörungsfreie archäologische Prospektion des römischen Carnuntum – erste Ergebnisse des Forschungsprojekts „ArchPro Carnuntum“by Mario Wallner, Wolfgang Neubauer, Tanja Trausmuth-Wallner, Geert J J Verhoeven, Roland Filzwieser, Jakob  Kainz, and Ranko ManojlovicCarnuntum Jahrbuch,  2018Over the course of four years (2012–2015) the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prosp... more Over the course of four years (2012–2015) the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology (LBI ArchPro), in collaboration with the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) and on behalf of the provincial government of Lower Austria, has conducted the comprehensive, non-invasive archaeological prospection project entitled “ArchPro Carnuntum”. The purpose of this project has been to generate a basis for future archaeological research and the sustainable spatial planning and cultural heritage management in the area. By combining new information on buried archaeology using different aerial and ground-based archaeological prospection methods and a thorough archaeological interpretation of the combined data within the framework of a GIS environment, it was possible to document Carnuntum’s archaeological heritage, which is threatened by a dramatic increase in erosion and destruction through ploughing, infrastructure development and looting by treasure hunters. In total, an area covering eight square kilometres was explored at very high sampling resolution using magnetic prospection methods, while 2.5 square kilometres were mapped with ultra-high resolution ground-penetrating radar measurements. The results of the project and the spatio-temporal analysis and interpretation of the prospection data are presented here as a preliminary report.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Modelling building costs from 3D building models – Estimating the construction effort from image-based surface models of dry-stone shepherd shelters (Kras, Slovenia)by Seta Štuhec, Geert J J Verhoeven, and Iztok ŠtuhecISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences,  Feb 1, 2019In the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, sheep shepherds have built dry-stone shelt... more In the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, sheep shepherds have built dry-stone shelters all over the Slovene Kras (or Karst) region. Despite being made out of stones that are interlocked without the use of any binding material, many of these vernacular constructions survived – even though sometimes only partially – the ravages of time. The fact that over one hundred fifty shepherd shelters are currently known is mainly due to the craftsmanship of their builders and thanks to (and even despite) their present location. A majority of these stone constructions can be found in areas that are nowadays forested, thus shielding them from weather-related or anthropogenic damage (because they are difficult to spot). This paper reports on the geometric documentation of those shelters using a photogrammetric computer vision pipeline, thereby mainly focussing on the difficulties that were encountered during this process. However, such image-based modelling approaches merely yield digital three-dimensional (3D) approximations of the shelters’ surface geometry (along with some sub-optimal colour data). Although these 3D surface models might be suitable to digitally preserve vulnerable vernacular buildings to some extent, they do not magically advance our understanding of them. The second part of this article focuses, therefore, on the extraction of archaeological information from these digital 3D constructions. More specifically, the total amount of stones, the total building time and the building cost regarding caloric energy expenditure are estimated for each of the digitised shelters. Although this assessment of architectural energetics provided useful insight into the building efforts and nutrient uptake of the shepherds, it also revealed many assumptions and shortcomings that often characterise archaeological information extraction from digital 3D models of buildings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Despite its abundant use and because the concept is often misjudged as uncomplicated, most modern literature relies on rather sloppy ‘resolution’ definitions that sometimes even contradict each other within the same text. In part, this confusion and misconception arises from the fact that technical as well as broader, application‐specific explanations for resolution exist, both of them even relying on different ways to describe resolution characteristics. As a result, the term ‘resolution’ has been used for many years as a handy go‐to term to cover many concepts: “this satellite produces images with a resolution of 30 m”; “there is an increasing number of high‐resolution camera sensors on the market” or “the resolution of the human eye is coarser than an eagle’s eye”. Nowadays, one might wonder if resolution is a particular image characteristic, a property of the imaged scene or instead related to the imaging sensor or maybe the camera’s lens.It is thus fair to say that the technical concept of resolution – or more specifically spatial resolution – and all its implications are commonly poorly understood, which leads to many popular, accepted but completely wrong statements. In the photographic literature, a widespread example is to refer to the total number of camera image pixels (i.e. the pixel count) as the image resolution of that specific digital camera. This is erroneous since the same 24‐megapixel camera can capture a photograph of an Attic black‐figure amphora as well as a complete submerged Greek temple. The resulting two photographs, although both are counting 24 megapixels, might reveal scene details of 0.01 cm and 2 cm respectively. In the remote sensing community, a prevalent misconception is that a satellite image with a 1 m resolution automatically means that we can recognise all objects in that image which have a width equal to or larger than 1 m.In this two‐part entry of our series, we will combine simple geometrical relationships (part 1) and fundamental laws of electromagnetic radiation (part 2) to shed some light on the term spatial resolution and explain its difference with the related concept of spatial resolving power. Similar to the previous two entries, this two‐pieced text can only scratch the surface of this very complex topic. Notwithstanding, the aim is still to provide solid definitions and enough background knowledge to easily correct many of the “common knowledge” but ill‐founded statements such as the ones mentioned above.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Focusing on out-of-focus: assessing defocus estimation algorithms for the benefit of automated image maskingISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences,  2018Acquiring photographs as input for an image-based modelling pipeline is less trivial than often a... more Acquiring photographs as input for an image-based modelling pipeline is less trivial than often assumed. Photographs should be correctly exposed, cover the subject sufficiently from all possible angles, have the required spatial resolution, be devoid of any motion blur, exhibit accurate focus and feature an adequate depth of field. The last four characteristics all determine the " sharpness " of an image and the photogrammetric, computer vision and hybrid photogrammetric computer vision communities all assume that the object to be modelled is depicted " acceptably " sharp throughout the whole image collection. Although none of these three fields has ever properly quantified " acceptably sharp " , it is more or less standard practice to mask those image portions that appear to be unsharp due to the limited depth of field around the plane of focus (whether this means blurry object parts or completely out-of-focus backgrounds). This paper will assess how well-or ill-suited defocus estimating algorithms are for automatically masking a series of photographs, since this could speed up modelling pipelines with many hundreds or thousands of photographs. To that end, the paper uses five different real-world datasets and compares the output of three state-of-the-art edge-based defocus estimators. Afterwards, critical comments and plans for the future finalise this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Are We There Yet?

Despite the many technological and theoretical evolutions that have characterised this field of archaeology, the dominant aerial photographic surveys, but also less common approaches to archaeological airborne reconnaissance, still suffer from many inherent biases imposed by sub-par sampling strategies, cost, instrument availability and post-processing issues. This paper starts with the concept of landscape (archaeology) and uses it to frame archaeological airborne remote sensing. After introducing the need for bias reduction when sampling an already distorted archaeological population and expanding on the ‘theory-neutral’ claim of aerial survey, the paper presents eight key characteristics that all have the potential to increase or decrease the subjectivity and bias when collecting airborne optical imagery with passive sensors. Within this setting, the paper then offers some technological-methodological reflection on the various passive airborne optical imaging solutions that landscape archaeology has come to rely upon in the past decades. In doing so, it calls into question the effectiveness and suitability of these highly subjective approaches for landscape archaeology. Finally, the paper proposes a new, more objective approach to aerial optical image acquisition with passive sensors. In the discussion, the text argues that the suggested exhaustive (or total) airborne sampling of the preserved archaeological record might transcend particular theoretical paradigms, while the data generated could span various interpretational perspectives and oppositional analytical approaches in landscape archaeology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Unfolding Leonardo da Vinci’s globe (AD 1504) to reveal its historical world mapby Geert J J Verhoeven and stefaan missinneISPRS Ann. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci.,  Aug 27, 2017This paper reports in detail on the image-based modelling and unwrapping approach used to create ... more This paper reports in detail on the image-based modelling and unwrapping approach used to create a two-dimensional projected map of an astonishing ostrich egg globe from AD 1504. This miniature egg globe is not only the oldest extant engraved globe, but it is also the oldest post-Columbian globe of the world and the first ever to depict Newfoundland and many other territories. The intention of digitally recording the surface geometry and colour of this unique artefact was to portray the original layout of the world map used by the Florentine Renaissance artist to make this globe. In addition, it was expected to substantiate iconographical details, which are hard to study at its scale of 1:80,000,000. The ostrich egg globe is the prototype of the Lenox Globe kept at the New York Public Library. The latter is very beneficial to examine how the egg globe looked like before being glued together at its equator. On the other hand, unfolding the map engraved in the ostrich egg halves enables a more detailed study of the remarkable details visible on both globes, since the engravings on the quasi-white egg surface are much easier to discern than those of the highly reflective red copper Lenox Globe. Finally, a detailed study of the unwrapped 3D surface is essential to learn more about the world vision of its creator and the incredible efforts that went into making this globe. Thanks to some particular pictographic details as well as the way in which the engravings are applied (by a left-handed person), the globe artist can be identified as Leonardo da Vinci.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In addition to different field systems, a newly discovered broad pathway appears to be an original Roman road. Numerous structural elements, mapped within the convent’s walls, could be attributed to specific building phases. Over 40 large and deep burial shafts, arranged in three rows, were discovered outside the convent’s burial ground. Their specific design and arrangement are characteristic of early medieval burials, such as those of the 6th century Lombards on the edge of the eastern Alps.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To answer specific research questions about the creation of a mural painting located in the Bishop's Gate porch of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, the three-dimensional geometry of the entire painted surface was digitised in minuscule detail using thousands of overlapping photographs. After a brief introduction to the basics of image-based surface digitisation, this paper describes in detail how the photographs were taken and how they were processed to create a digital three-dimensional surface. To appreciate the subtle surface variations encoded in this digital model, various relief visualisation techniques have been applied. The paper ends with a discussion of the new insights into the creation of this painting that are enabled by these visualisations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Integrating Geophysical and Photographic Data to Visualize the Quarried Structures of the Roman Town of Bassianaeby Roland Filzwieser, Vujadin M Ivanišević, Geert J J Verhoeven, Christian Gugl, Ivan Bugarski, Nemanja Marković, and Mario WallnerRemote Sensing,  2021Large parts of the urban layout of the abandoned Roman town of Bassianae (in presentday Serbia) a... more Large parts of the urban layout of the abandoned Roman town of Bassianae (in presentday Serbia) are still discernible on the surface today due to the deliberate and targeted quarrying of the Roman foundations. In 2014, all of the town's intramural (and some extramural) areas were surveyed using aerial photography, ground-penetrating radar, and magnetometry to analyze the site's topography and to map remaining buried structures. The surveys showed a strong agreement between the digital surface model derived from the aerial photographs and the geophysical prospection data. However, many structures could only be detected by one method, underlining the benefits of a complementary archaeological prospection approach using multiple methods. This article presents the results of the extensive surveys and their comprehensive integrative interpretation, discussing Bassianae's ground plan and urban infrastructure. Starting with an overview of this Roman town's research history, we present the details of the triple prospection approach, followed by the processing, integrative analysis, and interpretation of the acquired data sets. Finally, this newly gained information is contrasted with a plan of Roman Bassianae compiled in 1935.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Taking Vegetation Marks into the Next Dimension. Mapping the Hilltop Settlement of Montarice (Central Adriatic Italy) by a Multi-dimensional Analysis of Aerial Imageryby Geert J J Verhoeven, Frank Vermeulen, Devi Taelman, and Lieven VerdonckThe processing of aerial imagery acquired over Montarice hill (central Adriatic Italy) during the... more The processing of aerial imagery acquired over Montarice hill (central Adriatic Italy) during the Potenza Valley Survey will form the key focus of this paper. Since this site has repeatedly revealed itself in terms of interesting vegetation and soil marks, the most interesting footage, acquired during two observer-directed sorties more than a decade ago, will be examined. First, the potential of state-of-the-art image-based modelling (IBM) techniques is explored to create high-resolution orthophotographs from these analogue frame images. Since dense image matching-as a part of IBM-allows to model the vegetation surface at the moment of the photographic survey, a geometrical three-dimensional representation of the plant canopy is possible. This contribution shows how the latter can be the focus of its own information extraction process, using techniques mainly developed in the field of airborne laser scanning. However, the true interpretative power lies in the combination of the co-registered spectral and geometrical dimensions of the vegetation. Using Montarice as a case study, it will become clear that crop height data allows for powerful visualisations that can aid and even alter interpretative mapping that is solely based on colour differences in orthophotographs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The numbering of chapters, illustrations and equations simply continues so that one can easily merge both parts into one larger text. However, and in contrast to what was initially stated, this entry will not be the final part about spatial resolution. Because there is quite some, but still basic, ground to cover once the physical views on spatial resolution start to complement the geometrical ones, there will also be a third part. This approach also prevents any of these entries from becoming too lengthy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Leonardo Depicted America: Misread as the Moonby stefaan missinne and Geert J J VerhoevenLeonardo da Vinci must have been aware that Columbus discovered new territories in the West. Unti... more Leonardo da Vinci must have been aware that Columbus discovered new territories in the West. Until now, no material evidence had been found to substantiate this assumption. Here we show that Leonardo not only read Amerigo Vespucci's letter (derived from a painted star constellation), but that he even drew a map including the New World, a drawing which was previously interpreted as a depiction of the Moon. Finally, Leonardo engraved his notion of this new continent on an ostrich egg globe (now known as the Da Vinci Globe) and made a copper cast of this. Both the cosmographic and carto-graphic clues demonstrate that Leonardo da Vinci knew about the fourth continent, to be named "America" in 1507, less than a decade after Columbus embarked upon its shores. This expansion of Leonardo's cartographic legacy comes at a time of increased interest for such multidisciplinary insights, as the world commemorates in 2019 the 500 th anniversary of his death.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The purpose of this project has been to generate a basis for future archaeological research and the sustainable spatial planning and cultural heritage management in the area. By combining new information on buried archaeology using different aerial and ground-based archaeological prospection methods and a thorough archaeological interpretation of the combined data within the framework of a GIS environment, it was possible to document Carnuntum’s archaeological heritage, which is threatened by a dramatic increase in erosion and destruction through ploughing, infrastructure development and looting by treasure hunters. In total, an area covering eight square kilometres was explored at very high sampling resolution using magnetic prospection methods, while 2.5 square kilometres were mapped with ultra-high resolution ground-penetrating radar measurements. The results of the project and the spatio-temporal analysis and interpretation of the prospection data are presented here as a preliminary report.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Modelling building costs from 3D building models – Estimating the construction effort from image-based surface models of dry-stone shepherd shelters (Kras, Slovenia)by Seta Štuhec, Geert J J Verhoeven, and Iztok ŠtuhecISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences,  Feb 1, 2019In the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, sheep shepherds have built dry-stone shelt... more In the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, sheep shepherds have built dry-stone shelters all over the Slovene Kras (or Karst) region. Despite being made out of stones that are interlocked without the use of any binding material, many of these vernacular constructions survived – even though sometimes only partially – the ravages of time. The fact that over one hundred fifty shepherd shelters are currently known is mainly due to the craftsmanship of their builders and thanks to (and even despite) their present location. A majority of these stone constructions can be found in areas that are nowadays forested, thus shielding them from weather-related or anthropogenic damage (because they are difficult to spot). This paper reports on the geometric documentation of those shelters using a photogrammetric computer vision pipeline, thereby mainly focussing on the difficulties that were encountered during this process. However, such image-based modelling approaches merely yield digital three-dimensional (3D) approximations of the shelters’ surface geometry (along with some sub-optimal colour data). Although these 3D surface models might be suitable to digitally preserve vulnerable vernacular buildings to some extent, they do not magically advance our understanding of them. The second part of this article focuses, therefore, on the extraction of archaeological information from these digital 3D constructions. More specifically, the total amount of stones, the total building time and the building cost regarding caloric energy expenditure are estimated for each of the digitised shelters. Although this assessment of architectural energetics provided useful insight into the building efforts and nutrient uptake of the shepherds, it also revealed many assumptions and shortcomings that often characterise archaeological information extraction from digital 3D models of buildings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Despite its abundant use and because the concept is often misjudged as uncomplicated, most modern literature relies on rather sloppy ‘resolution’ definitions that sometimes even contradict each other within the same text. In part, this confusion and misconception arises from the fact that technical as well as broader, application‐specific explanations for resolution exist, both of them even relying on different ways to describe resolution characteristics. As a result, the term ‘resolution’ has been used for many years as a handy go‐to term to cover many concepts: “this satellite produces images with a resolution of 30 m”; “there is an increasing number of high‐resolution camera sensors on the market” or “the resolution of the human eye is coarser than an eagle’s eye”. Nowadays, one might wonder if resolution is a particular image characteristic, a property of the imaged scene or instead related to the imaging sensor or maybe the camera’s lens.It is thus fair to say that the technical concept of resolution – or more specifically spatial resolution – and all its implications are commonly poorly understood, which leads to many popular, accepted but completely wrong statements. In the photographic literature, a widespread example is to refer to the total number of camera image pixels (i.e. the pixel count) as the image resolution of that specific digital camera. This is erroneous since the same 24‐megapixel camera can capture a photograph of an Attic black‐figure amphora as well as a complete submerged Greek temple. The resulting two photographs, although both are counting 24 megapixels, might reveal scene details of 0.01 cm and 2 cm respectively. In the remote sensing community, a prevalent misconception is that a satellite image with a 1 m resolution automatically means that we can recognise all objects in that image which have a width equal to or larger than 1 m.In this two‐part entry of our series, we will combine simple geometrical relationships (part 1) and fundamental laws of electromagnetic radiation (part 2) to shed some light on the term spatial resolution and explain its difference with the related concept of spatial resolving power. Similar to the previous two entries, this two‐pieced text can only scratch the surface of this very complex topic. Notwithstanding, the aim is still to provide solid definitions and enough background knowledge to easily correct many of the “common knowledge” but ill‐founded statements such as the ones mentioned above.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Photographs should be correctly exposed, cover the subject sufficiently from all possible angles, have the required spatial resolution, be devoid of any motion blur, exhibit accurate focus and feature an adequate depth of field. The last four characteristics all determine the " sharpness " of an image and the photogrammetric, computer vision and hybrid photogrammetric computer vision communities all assume that the object to be modelled is depicted " acceptably " sharp throughout the whole image collection. Although none of these three fields has ever properly quantified " acceptably sharp " , it is more or less standard practice to mask those image portions that appear to be unsharp due to the limited depth of field around the plane of focus (whether this means blurry object parts or completely out-of-focus backgrounds). This paper will assess how well-or ill-suited defocus estimating algorithms are for automatically masking a series of photographs, since this could speed up modelling pipelines with many hundreds or thousands of photographs. To that end, the paper uses five different real-world datasets and compares the output of three state-of-the-art edge-based defocus estimators. Afterwards, critical comments and plans for the future finalise this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Are We There Yet?

Despite the many technological and theoretical evolutions that have characterised this field of archaeology, the dominant aerial photographic surveys, but also less common approaches to archaeological airborne reconnaissance, still suffer from many inherent biases imposed by sub-par sampling strategies, cost, instrument availability and post-processing issues. This paper starts with the concept of landscape (archaeology) and uses it to frame archaeological airborne remote sensing. After introducing the need for bias reduction when sampling an already distorted archaeological population and expanding on the ‘theory-neutral’ claim of aerial survey, the paper presents eight key characteristics that all have the potential to increase or decrease the subjectivity and bias when collecting airborne optical imagery with passive sensors. Within this setting, the paper then offers some technological-methodological reflection on the various passive airborne optical imaging solutions that landscape archaeology has come to rely upon in the past decades. In doing so, it calls into question the effectiveness and suitability of these highly subjective approaches for landscape archaeology. Finally, the paper proposes a new, more objective approach to aerial optical image acquisition with passive sensors. In the discussion, the text argues that the suggested exhaustive (or total) airborne sampling of the preserved archaeological record might transcend particular theoretical paradigms, while the data generated could span various interpretational perspectives and oppositional analytical approaches in landscape archaeology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Unfolding Leonardo da Vinci’s globe (AD 1504) to reveal its historical world mapby Geert J J Verhoeven and stefaan missinneISPRS Ann. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci.,  Aug 27, 2017This paper reports in detail on the image-based modelling and unwrapping approach used to create ... more This paper reports in detail on the image-based modelling and unwrapping approach used to create a two-dimensional projected map of an astonishing ostrich egg globe from AD 1504. This miniature egg globe is not only the oldest extant engraved globe, but it is also the oldest post-Columbian globe of the world and the first ever to depict Newfoundland and many other territories. The intention of digitally recording the surface geometry and colour of this unique artefact was to portray the original layout of the world map used by the Florentine Renaissance artist to make this globe. In addition, it was expected to substantiate iconographical details, which are hard to study at its scale of 1:80,000,000. The ostrich egg globe is the prototype of the Lenox Globe kept at the New York Public Library. The latter is very beneficial to examine how the egg globe looked like before being glued together at its equator. On the other hand, unfolding the map engraved in the ostrich egg halves enables a more detailed study of the remarkable details visible on both globes, since the engravings on the quasi-white egg surface are much easier to discern than those of the highly reflective red copper Lenox Globe. Finally, a detailed study of the unwrapped 3D surface is essential to learn more about the world vision of its creator and the incredible efforts that went into making this globe. Thanks to some particular pictographic details as well as the way in which the engravings are applied (by a left-handed person), the globe artist can be identified as Leonardo da Vinci.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This collection of papers aims to contribute to the exploration of developing practice and theory in remote sensing archaeology for the 21st century. The scope of this volume is the use of remotely sensed data from either air- or spaceborne platforms for the benefit of archaeology and cultural heritage in general, with a specific focus on better defining the roles and contexts that detail why archaeologists may apply remote sensing techniques. With this focus, it is our hope that remotely sensed data will be better and more intrinsically integrated into the symbiosis of archaeological practice and theory.The editorial for this volume suggests that many aspects of archaeological practice can be characterised as ‘beg, borrow and steal’. This collection provides the reader with thoughtful papers that contribute to the development of archaeological remote sensing as a mature interdisciplinary field characterised by explicit and theoretically engaged approaches to understanding the past.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At the time, we - a group of ‘mere’ doctoralstudents - were already happy enough to have pulled off the organisation of aninternational conference; the idea of having it flow over into a publication wasprobably the farthest from our mind as we were enjoying our well-earnedclosing dinner. But after the dust of those hectic final weeks had settled and theideas put forward in the presentations had sunk in, we began to play with theidea nonetheless.And so a year later, we are pleased to present this volume on behalf of allwho contributed before, during and after the conference. We expressly opted tomake the leap from a ‘conference proceedings’ to a stand-alone volume ofselected essays, as we felt the latter would better lend itself to the distribution ofthe interdisciplinary and supra-regional scope that we deem an absolutenecessity of landscape research. The selected texts as a result take diverse anglesat tackling the ‘landscape problem’, covering ground from the CentralMediterranean to the Middle-East and from semi-automated remote sensing tocuneiform historical geography. By including contributions from beginning andmore established researchers alike, we aimed to produce a volume of potentialinterest to both the student and the specialist. Aside from offering concreteexamples of applied methodology, we hoped the book might through thisintentionally broad gaze also help further interdisciplinary awareness.Thanks go out firstly to the authors who contributed to this volume; we alsoregret that, given the preset publication size, not all papers which we receivedcould be included. A special acknowledgement must be made to Prof. TonyWilkinson, whose contribution to the conference and key-note lecture provedmore stimulating than we could ever have hoped for and who has kindly agreedto write the introduction to this book. Finally, we thank our colleagues here atthe university: Sarah Deprez, Joke Dewulf, Tanja Goethals and Wouter Gheyle;for their shared enthusiasm, hours of overtime and combined expertise whichmade Broadening Horizons possible.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although much declassified panchromatic spy footage and some more recent commercial multispectral imagery has already been used with great success in archaeological research, it is expected that the importance and utility of multi‐ and hyperspectral (together denoted spectral) spaceborne imagery will become more important in the near future. This is mainly due to the constant and simultaneous improvements in the spatial and spectral resolving power of these imaging systems. Together with the temporal and radiometric properties, these four characteristics define any remotely‐sensing spaceborne spectral imaging platform. Thus, these parameters allow one to decide on the archaeological usability of the footage acquired.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Multi‐ and hyperspectral imaging (together denoted spectral imaging) are two techniques that evolved from conventional color photography, having overcome its spectral limitations. Instead of imaging in three broad spectral bands, multispectral imaging acquires data in up to ten more or less equally wide and nonoverlapping spectral bands. Hyperspectral imaging goes beyond the multispectral approach by generating images in tens to hundreds of narrow, contiguous (i.e., adjacent but not overlapping) spectral bands. Most spectral imaging techniques are limited to the optical electromagnetic spectrum and acquire the reflected portion of the radiation that is used to illuminate the scene. However, imaging the emitted thermal radiation or active techniques based on laser scanners do exist as well. In cultural heritage, all these techniques are used to gain a better, noninvasive insight into the chemical and physical properties of the object(s) under investigation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Graffiti verärge... more Graffiti sind eine kurzlebige und polarisierende Form unseres kulturellen Erbes. Graffiti verärgern, erfreuen, provozieren und regen zum Nachdenken an. Der Wiener Donaukanal zählt zur längsten ununterbrochenen Graffiti-Landschaften weltweit und ist damit einer der wichtigsten Graffiti-Hotspot. Heutzutage bedeutet das Sprayen eines neuen Graffito am Donaukanal meist die teilweise oder vollständige Zerstörung eines darunterliegenden Graffito. Daher verändert sich auch die Graffiti Landschaft entlang des Donaukanals täglich. Das Projekt INDIGO hat es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, die 13 km Graffiti-bedeckten Oberflächen des Donaukanals systematisch zu dokumentieren und in Form einer interaktiven und aktuellen online 3D-Plattform der Wissenschaft und einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit zugänglich und auch für kommende Generationen erlebbar zu machen. Am Ende des Projekts INDIGO soll es unter anderem möglich sein, einen virtuellen Spaziergang entlang des Donaukanals zu machen und längst übersprühte Graffiti im Detail zu analysieren. Die 3D Geometrie des Donaukanals wird durch Structure from Motion (SfM) und mittels eines Multi-View Stereo (MVS) Ansatzes aus ca. 27000 Fotos abgeleitet, die im Herbst 2021 aufgenommen wurden. Zusätzlich zu den Fotos wurden mehr als 500 Passpunkte entlang des Donaukanals terrestrisch vermessen, um die Georeferenzierung des 3D Modells zu gewährleisten und akkumulierte Drifteffekte der berechneten Kameraorientierungen zu minimieren. Eine der größten Herausforderungen von INDIGO ist es, alle neuen Graffito-Fotos in ein (ortho-)rektifiziertes, georeferenziertes und farbtreues Bild zu verwandeln. Um dies zu ermöglichen, entwickelt INDIGO maßgeschneiderte und hochautomatisierte Workflows, die der Öffentlichkeit als open-source Software für andere Dokumentationsprojekte kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Die Orthorektifizierung erfolgt mittels eines sogenannten inkrementellen SfM Ansatzes, in dem die neuen Bilder nach und nach in den bestehenden Bündelblock hinzugefügt und orientiert werden. Um dieses Verfahren zu beschleunigen nutzt INDIGO Messdaten von GNSS und IMU Sensoren, die auf der Kamera montiert sind. In diesem Vortrag werden die Ziele des INDIGO Projekts vorgestellt und diverse photogrammetrischen Lösungsansätze präsentiert, die das digitale Fortbestehen der Graffiti Landschaft am Donaukanal sicherstellen.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Becoming a NIR-Sensitive Aerial ArchaeologistSince the astronomer and composer Sir Frederick William Herschel (1738-1822) discovered in 1800 t... more Since the astronomer and composer Sir Frederick William Herschel (1738-1822) discovered in 1800 the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, many other scientists became interested in this kind of invisible radiation. It lasted, however, until 1904 for the first near-infrared photograph to be taken. From the 1930s onwards, this unusual type of imaging was practised more elaborately, specifically to examine damaged and censored writings or study blood patterns for medical purposes. After 1935 – the year in which one of the earliest infrared aerial photographs was taken from a stratosphere balloon – the trend was set. Less than a decade afterwards, aerial infrared colour film became extensively used for its camouflage detection capabilities in WWII. Today, orbital and aerial NIR recording serves a great number of applications, being intensively used by the military as well as the scientific fields of hydrology, geology, forestry and archaeology.Up till now, NIR radiation was mostly captured in an analogue way by infrared sensitive plates or film emulsions (black-and-white or colour), or digitally by satellites or high-tech multispectral sensors. For various reasons (cost, resolving power, lack of hardware etc.), aerial archaeologists use(d) the analogue NIR approach to study their objects (some examples are – amongst others – the work of Bradford, Strandberg, Solecki, Edienne and Martin). Such a film-based workflow is however very error-prone, as the emulsions need to be stored cooled and developed by specialised labs directly after exposing them. Moreover, determining the right exposure is not as straightforward as with conventional/standard (i.e. visible light) photography. Together with some ignorance and/or lack of knowledge about the subject, this critical imaging process severely restricted NIR radiation to be captured by aerial archaeologists so far.However, this changed completely with the advent of digital cameras. As their sensors are very sensitive to NIR radiation, the whole process of taking NIR photographs is much less of a cumber stone.

For many years, various research fields have been trying to integrate imagery of different modalities – not at least in the medical and geoscience communities – to facilitate a better understanding and interpretation of particular phenomena. This topic is also becoming increasingly applicable in archaeology, as imagery and data sources become more diverse and complex. In order to implement such an approach, a dedicated MATLAB toolbox TAIFU (the Toolbox for Archaeological Image Fusion) has been created. TAIFU serves as a platform for testing of current state-of-the-art image fusion methods and facilitates the development of new data integration routines. This toolbox is thus designed to benefit archaeological interpretive mapping of diverse prospection datasets. For example, the data from a magnetogram can be fused with an aerial image to aid the archaeologist in correlating feature locations for a more trustworthy information extraction and better interpretation of hidden geo-cultural features. TAIFU is currently programmed in such a way that the user has to load two images. Upon import, the toolbox verifies and stores the metadata of the images (such as georeferencing, Exif and IPTC tags). Subsequently, a variety of image fusion processes (some with additional options) can be chosen to create a fused image from the initial displayed images. As a pre- or post-fusion step, the user can also choose among a variety of contrast enhancement algorithms. When a useful result is obtained, the fused image can be saved with all the proper metadata embedded, although the latter can also be stored as a sidecar ASCII file. These new metadata do not only originate from both input images, they also contain data about the contrast enhancement and fusion algorithms that were used to obtain the final result. At this stage, TAIFU is still in development. So far, about thirty image fusion methods have been implemented next to two different image fusion metrics. Although a visual assessment of the result will normally determine which method is best suited for a specific case, these metrics can help to identify which fusion approaches preserve most information of both input images.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Danube Channel), Vienna's central waterway and one of the largest and most active graffiti-scapes worldwide, this metaphor applies like hardly anywhere else. Every day a multitude of graffiti is destroyed by the creation of new works. Recently, efforts have been made to mitigate this constant loss of cultural heritage along the Donaukanal by systematically documenting the graffiti, mainly using photography and photogrammetry. However, keeping track of the newly added works is very time-consuming and often like finding needles in a haystack, considering the large extent and high volatility of the monitored area. Thus, an automated graffiti change detection would significantly reduce the effort and avoid overlooking graffiti.This contribution outlines the main challenges in image-based change detection for cultural heritage and proposes a hybrid graffiti change detection method. The investigated method exploits and combines an established pixel-based change detection algorithm, the Iteratively Multivariate Alteration Detection, with a novel descriptor-based method. The latter relies on image features, rather than pixels as analysis unit and can robustly filter false alarms from the high-performing but noise-prone pixel-based approach. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed method can largely automate image-based change detection of graffiti-scapes. It can uncover graffiti-related changes and robustly distinguish them from other image differences such as shadows but tends to overlook small-scale graffiti, indicating the need for further fine-tuning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Catching the Urban Chameleonby Jona Schlegel and Geert J J VerhoevenThis presentation will introduce the online platform UrbanChameleon, which we have been developin... more This presentation will introduce the online platform UrbanChameleon, which we have been developing to facilitate the analysis and dissemination of contemporary graffiti in Vienna, Austria. The platform is designed to visualise and analyse data collected in the scope of project INDIGO, which is funded by the Heritage Science Austria programme of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) and focuses on circa 13 km of graffiti-covered surfaces along the Danube Canal.Project INDIGO utilises OpenAtlas, an open-source, web-based database system that leverages the CIDOC CRM (Conceptual Reference Model) to manage and visualise historical, archaeological, and cultural heritage data. The CIDOC CRM is an international standard ontology for exchanging and integrating heterogeneous cultural heritage data and information, enabling the representation of complex relationships and events in a structured manner. The online platform seamlessly connects to OpenAtlas through an API (Application Programming Interface), a set of protocols and tools that enables different software applications to communicate and share data. This integration allows the platform to efficiently fetch and incorporate graffiti data, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly exploration experience.A key feature of the online platform is a 4D viewer that allows users to visualise graffiti in its original location and context, as well as track its temporal changes. This is achieved via Cesium-based tools, open-source software libraries designed to create and visualise 3D geospatial data in web applications. Known for their powerful and flexible capabilities, these tools enable the rendering of high-quality, realistic 3D environments. By incorporating Cesium-based tools into UrbanChameleon, the platform provides immersive and detailed visualisations of graffiti, making it easier for users to understand their spatial context.UrbanChameleon benefits from enhanced stability, performance, and scalability, providing a seamless and efficient user experience when exploring graffiti in Vienna. The platform features a user-friendly interface with an interactive map component, offering valuable insights into the distribution and context of contemporary graffiti. By focusing on the core functionalities and user experience, the platform allows researchers to study and understand the cultural heritage and significance of graffiti in an intuitive manner.In conclusion, the UrbanChameleon platform provides researchers with a comprehensive tool to explore, search, and filter graffiti in Vienna, specifically at the Hall of Fames along the Danube Canal. It enables them to uncover layers of meaning and contextual significance. To truly engage with those graffiti records and unlock their analytical potential, smooth data streaming and proper treatment of the temporal dimension are key, which UrbanChameleon enables via various technical means. In the end, we hope that the platform can be used to digitally explore the colourful walls of the Danube Canal over time and space, but also facilitate the creation of valuable insights into the evolution of graffiti and its role in our contemporary society.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

GRAPHIS—A free tool to save, annotate and visualise regions in graffiti photosA digital photo file consists of two (or more) parts: one contains the pixel values that encode t... more A digital photo file consists of two (or more) parts: one contains the pixel values that encode the visible light reflected from (or emitted by) real-world objects, while one or more file segments hold the metadata. Storing these photo metadata is enabled by various standards. For instance, the Exif (Exchangeable image file format) standard records technical photo metadata such as the camera's serial number and model, lens aperture and focal length, shutter speed, possible flash compensation, and the date plus time of photo creation. All Exif-defined tags are created by the camera and stored simultaneously upon photo creation.Besides Exif, IPTC Photo Metadata exist. These metadata – structured in a standard proposed by the IPTC – are the widely accepted norm for storing administrative, copyright, and descriptive information in images (unedited photos, edited pictures, and AI-generated images). In its 2019.1 version, the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard enabled the storage of image regions. These image regions are shapes like rectangles, circles or any possible polygon that can be marked and saved within an image.Since the authors are unaware of a tool that allows straightforwardly working with such image regions, and given their potential for graffiti photo annotation, project INDIGO created GRAPHIS. GRAPHIS is an open-source, freely available Python-based software to create image regions, annotate them with graffiti descriptions or transcriptions, and visualise them. The backbones of GRAPHIS are an SQLite database and ExifTool. Besides storing links to the photos of interest, the SQLite database keeps track of every image region operation. This principle enables users to start/exit the software at will without the risk of losing work. It also enables collaboration on various photo collections, as each can have its database. At any moment, the user can write the image regions back into the photo's metadata segment, an operation for which GRAPHIS utilises ExifTool.GRAPHIS adheres to the IPTC standard at every stage. For example, the IPTC stipulates that every region ideally features a concept that clarifies the role and content type of the region. These concepts must come from a controlled vocabulary: a confined list of terms, each with a definition and a URI. Since none of IPTC's controlled vocabularies features graffiti-related concepts, project INDIGO also created a separate GRAPHIS Image Region vocabulary to contain all relevant concepts. This presentation will first explain the inner workings of GRAPHIS and its underlying vocabulary, after which the software and its functionality will be shown live on some graffiti photographs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
One polygon at a time – trying to manage a graffiti-scape's spatio-temporalityby Geert J J Verhoeven and Jona SchlegelProject INDIGO aims to document, disseminate and analyse the contemporary graffiti-scape surround... more Project INDIGO aims to document, disseminate and analyse the contemporary graffiti-scape surrounding the Viennese Danube Canal (Austria). Despite its focus on present-day graffiti, INDIGO is considered an archaeological project. The authors take the stance that archaeology is an academic discipline trying to understand (our complex relationships with) the material remains of the stratified past, whether that past was centuries (i.e. the remote or ancient past) or days (i.e. the contemporary or recent past) ago. From this point of view, it should not be surprising that INDIGO applies (and improves) various tools and workflows commonly used for acquiring and managing data in more conventional archaeological projects.However, outsiders might find it strange to hear that a discipline examining space- and time-bound anthropogenic activities has only developed tools to properly analyse and visualise the two-dimensional spatial component of archaeological data. Effective practical approaches to handling the third spatial dimension, let alone the temporal aspect, are generally lacking. INDIGO wants to leverage its focus on "less old" things to advance the management, visualisation and analysis of the uncertain spatio-temporal boundaries characterising "older things".Post-depositional processes like erosion, ploughing, animal digging, and soil formation increasingly bias and fuzzyfy the spatial and temporal information obtainable from common archaeological remains like Bronze Age ditches or Celtic ceramics. Because modern artefacts like graffiti are typically less influenced by post-depositional processes, and since their continuous "layering" (which archaeologists call stratification) can be documented in situ, contemporary graffiti-scapes lend themselves well to develop archaeologically-relevant ways of dealing with spatio-temporal complexities.Despite considerable effort, monitoring the dynamic nature of graffiti along the Danube water channel still poses problems concerning data quality and completeness. INDIGO's initial spatial and temporal (meta)data only accounts for when (and if) a graffito was photographed. Whether the graffito production occurred hours or days before typically remains unknown, while some graffiti even go undocumented. INDIGO relies on a polygon for each graffito to address these challenges. This polygon is first indicated on – and stored within – each graffito's overview photo via the bespoke software GRAPHIS. AUTOGRAF – another tool coded within INDIGO – transforms this image-bound two-dimensional polygon into a three-dimensional geometric entity correctly located in a real-world coordinate reference system.A GeoJSON file stores each graffito-polygon. This human- and machine-readable file complements the polygon coordinates with various attribute fields for temporal data. Some fields can be populated upon creating the polygon, while other temporal data might be automatically inferred from subsequent polygons. At the end of the process, each polygon should provide a digital, nuanced representation of one graffito's spatial and temporal dimensions. Through their combination, we hope that INDIGO's online visualisation platform can extract the various explicit or implicit spatial and temporal relationships among the thousands of documented graffiti.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Achieving colour-accurate data from images: challenges and solutionsColour is a powerful communication element of graffiti and many other forms of cultural heritage.... more Colour is a powerful communication element of graffiti and many other forms of cultural heritage. This importance of colour notwithstanding, the documentation of cultural heritage typically only focuses on the geometrical aspects and seldom on the spectral characteristics of the object. This is party because colour and the science of colour – called colourimetry – are non-trivial. In addition, it remains tough to capture accurate colour data with standard digital cameras, certainly when the illumination conditions are constantly varying, like in outdoor photography. As a result, not many research teams have furthered accurate colour data acquisition with regular photo cameras for spectrally documenting cultural heritage. Given the importance of colour in graffiti, obtaining correct image colours is essential from an analytical and digital preservation point of view. As such, the acquisition of colour-accurate digital images is one of the primary research topics in the international graffiti project INDIGO.The problem with colour is that it is a matter of perception. In other words: colour is subjective. In addition, the colour data registered by consumer digital cameras (usually in the well-known RGB colour model) are not strictly colourimetric. The camera’s built-in imaging sensor does not satisfy the Luther-Ives condition, which means that its three spectral sensitivity curves (one for Red, one for Green and one for Blue) do not entirely mimic those of the human eye. Moreover, these spectral curves are device-dependent; in other words: they differ from camera to camera. Finally, every camera brand processes the images in their proprietary way to yield a pleasing photograph, not a colour-accurate one.A digital camera is thus not suitable for rigorous colour determination without any colour correction procedure. Due to all the challenges involved, INDIGO has set itself two aims: 1) to develop a rigorous colourimetric image processing workflow and 2) to implement it into an intuitive, user-friendly and open-source toolbox. This toolbox will provide any user complete control when processing images into colour-accurate products. At the same time, users can also learn about each processing step. We are confident that this research will benefit future graffiti and other heritage documentation projects, as well as any application where digital cameras play a fundamental role in acquiring correct colour values.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Towards a Graffiti Thesaurus in SKOSby Jona Schlegel, Massimiliano Carloni, and Geert J J VerhoevenAwareness of the 20th-century graffiti phenomenon spread globally with movies like Wild Style (19... more Awareness of the 20th-century graffiti phenomenon spread globally with movies like Wild Style (1983) and photo books like Subway art (1984). To educate the public on the graffiti movement, graffiti specific terms were described and discussed throughout such books or added at the end in the form of a glossary – an alphabetical list of words. However, these glossaries aimed only to explain the graffiti community terms to the broader public rather than to build up a fixed set of terms (and synonyms) or guidelines for the description of graffiti.This talk will illustrate how the INDIGO project attempts to fill this gap by building a thesaurus, i.e. a structured, controlled (and thus finite) dictionary of hierarchically related terms. The creation of such a thesaurus must tackle particular challenges characteristic of graffiti, including: regional terms that can differ widely (international: stencil; French: pochoir); constantly changing terminology (hit → tag; masterpiece → piece); lack of connection between modern-day graffiti and historical forms of personalised expression like cave art and petroglyphs (studied in archaeology).These challenges require technical solutions that make it possible to precisely structure the thesaurus items while also describing the relationships between the terms in different ways and reconciling inconsistent terminology. Therefore, this presentation will detail how INDIGO profits from modern Semantic Web technologies. Thanks to these, single pieces of information can be represented according to formally defined models, linked to each other, and made available on the web for reference and reuse by a wider audience.More specifically, the talk will illustrate the advantages of the model being used by the INDIGO thesaurus, the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium employed in a wide range of fields, including cultural heritage. This model allows to document the thesaurus terms accurately (e.g. providing historical information about them), describe their hierarchical (and non-hierarchical) relationships, and link them to existing initiatives, such as Wikidata and the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.The development of the INDIGO thesaurus will allow the project team to have a clear, explicit, and reproducible way to describe graffiti and their constituent parts. At the same time, since the thesaurus will also be the product of the experience and feedback provided by external experts, it is envisaged that it will serve as a reference for the broader (academic) graffiti community.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Towards the automatic production of graffiti orthophotosGraffiti and street art are unique forms of cultural heritage which have not yet received the sci... more Graffiti and street art are unique forms of cultural heritage which have not yet received the scientific attention they deserve. The potential of graffiti research to answer a variety of social and cultural research questions is underexploited. One reason for this lack of academic rigor lies within the very sparse availability of well-curated and publicly accessible graffiti data. One obvious foundation for a graffiti dataset is images depicting the various pieces, tags or throw-ups. The few existing graffiti image databases do not allow the study of the graffiti’s exact shapes and dimensions as the photographs suffer from various distortions which are introduced by topography, perspective, or the camera itself. Orthophotos have the great advantage of removing above-mentioned image distortions. The creation of orthophotos, however, is time-consuming and requires considerable manual interaction, which poses a significant obstacle considering that comprehensive and up-to-date graffiti databases often deal with hundreds of images per week.Here, we present a novel methodology which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations in present-day graffiti documentation by deriving graffiti orthophotos in a highly automated way. In contrast to conventional photographs, orthophotos are adjusted for the graffiti surface topography and had all perspective and lens distortions removed. As a result, orthophotos allow the measurement of coordinates, distances, and areas of the depicted graffiti, enabling the derivation of exact proportions and relating the object to a real-world geographic coordinate reference system. Orthophotos in this context are therefore accurate maps of graffiti. The derivation of orthophotos, however, is complex and requires not only exact knowledge about the three-dimensional surface geometry of the object but also about the camera’s internal geometry and its exact location and orientation in space. We are developing a photogrammetric methodology and associated tool that derives the required information based on graffiti photos and outputs the desired orthophotos without any manual intervention during the process.In this talk, we present this bespoke photogrammetric approach which is currently investigated in the framework of the graffiti documentation and dissemination project INDIGO and is built as a Python add-on to the commercial package Agisoft Metashape Professional. First tests were conducted at the Donaukanal (Eng. Danube Canal), a central waterway through Vienna and a famous graffiti hotspot. The results indicate a reliable performance of our approach: the majority (ca. 85%) of the tested graffiti images were successfully and automatically turned into orthophotos. We will present those results and discuss where further finetuning is needed and demonstrate why the presented tool has the potential to largely automize the way graffiti are being documented. This approach will enable the building of a solid and extensive database for advanced graffiti research.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Discovering & recording new graffiti within project INDIGOby Geert J J Verhoeven and Jona SchlegelProject INDIGO wants to ensure the digital survival of a large part of Vienna's graffiti-scape by... more Project INDIGO wants to ensure the digital survival of a large part of Vienna's graffiti-scape by creating a long-term, accurate, exhaustive, open access and interactive online archive. The digital photographs of graffiti constitute one of the archive's main backbones. Not only do they represent the spectral and spatial data about every graffito, but they are also used to extract the three-dimensional surface geometry needed to turn these photographs into colour-accurate, distortion-free orthophotographs. That is why INDIGO photographs are taken according to specific rules and with dedicated hardware.This talk will explain the rationale of INDIGO's photographic approach and detail the entire photo acquisition process: from the logistics for the bi-annual total coverage surveys (targeting the whole research area) to the camera settings and newly developed hardware for the bi-weekly photo tours (aiming to record new graffiti). The presentation will expand on INDIGO's current reliance on human memory and social media combined with specific apps to keep track of must-record changes in the graffiti-scape. However, the talk also reviews plans for a more automated change detection approach.Overall, this contribution wants to clarify that photographs, whether of graffiti or any other form of cultural heritage, typically serve a specific purpose. To reach that purpose, photographs should usually be more than mere snapshots. Via this talk's focus on INDIGO-specific photography strategies and hardware, the INDIGO team hopes to get critical feedback, valuable suggestions and collaboration proposals. These would benefit everybody involved and ideally lead to the joint development of more dedicated photo acquisition workflows for any cultural heritage recording or monitoring project.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The 3D datafication of cultural heritage: more than just a flash in the pan?Keynote at CIPA 2019 Ávila - The 27th CIPA Heritage Documentation international symposium "Documenting the past for a better future",  Sep 2, 2019The epistemological foundation of archaeology and cultural heritage at large is based mainly on t... more The epistemological foundation of archaeology and cultural heritage at large is based mainly on the connections between imperfectly preserved material culture and humans. The tangible part of cultural heritage is thus a lot about materiality, which is reflected in the amalgam of data recording and documentation practices. Whether distinguishing a painting’s anthropogenic stratification created by its layers of overpainting, or spotting buried geo-archaeological marks from an aeroplane, faster, more accurate, more precise, more reliable and more affordable digital techniques are enabling new and better digital approximations of our tangible cultural heritage.A typical example is the 21st-century hype of using image-based modelling or scanning techniques to acquire three-dimensional (3D) surface geometries. However, the general prioritisation of digital 3D data acquisition over added heritage knowledge results in an undeniable tension between cultural heritage, and the aims and strategies of the Geomatics industry from which it borrows tools and practices. Too often, this 3D datafication wave is fed by the belief that the mere creation of digital surface models will allow scholars all over the world to study heritage in ways previously unheard of. Although partly correct, statements like these distract from the fact that these digital 3D data only represent one of the many essential characters of a heritage asset (such as spectral reflectance, mass, building material), while the creation of a comprehensive narrative does not come overnight either. Archival records, archaeological databases, historical sources and other analytical techniques must supplement these digital geometry data to generate new historical-archaeological-cultural insights.Moreover, digital surface approximations of cultural heritage assets do not diminish the threats faced by natural disasters and human conflicts. Since most heritage places cannot be expected to last into the coming centuries or even decades due to their fragile nature, their meticulous 3D surface recording by planet-traversing teams will do nothing to protect and conserve them. Although organisations like CyArk would want everybody to believe otherwise, a digital approximation of merely one aspect (i.e. the surface) of a complete building, artefact or place will never bring the original back. Even if it might support digital or physical recreation (thereby unleashing the cultural identity/heritage authenticity debate), the 3D data still have to withstand the digital ravages of time. Accidentally deleted data, data destroyed by fire, data on failed hard drives, data in undocumented formats or simply technology obsolescence; all these issues of digital 3D data longevity are known all too well.Finally, this 3D datafication industry is still plagued with fundamental issues related to terminology, data protection and ownership, accuracy, reliability, standardisation and perception. Given these numerous critical problems and questions, should one really praise the current 3D datafication hype? Are the countless 3D models actually that transformative for cultural heritage as is often claimed?By highlighting some of these concerns, this talk wants to question whether the ongoing 3D datafication (r)evolution will stand the test of time or prove to be just a flash in the pan that failed to bring paradigm-shifting, heritage-beneficial developments along. This talk will be provocative and hopes to function as a starting point for a more in-depth debate about this topic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Modelling building costs from 3D building modelsby Geert J J Verhoeven and Seta ŠtuhecVerhoeven, G, Štuhec, S., Štuhec, I., 2019.

Despite being made out of stones that are interlocked without the use of any binding material, many of these vernacular constructions survived – even though sometimes only partially – the ravages of time. The fact that over one hundred fifty shepherd shelters are currently known is mainly due to the craftsmanship of their builders and thanks to (and even despite) their present location. A majority of these stone constructions can be found in areas that are nowadays forested, thus shielding them from weather-related or anthropogenic damage (because they are difficult to spot). This paper reports on the geometric documentation of those shelters using a photogrammetric computer vision pipeline, thereby mainly focussing on the difficulties that were encountered during this process. However, such image-based modelling approaches merely yield digital three-dimensional (3D) approximations of the shelters’ surface geometry (along with some sub-optimal colour data). Although these 3D surface models might be suitable to digitally preserve vulnerable vernacular buildings to some extent, they do not magically advance our understanding of them. The second part of this article focuses, therefore, on the extraction of archaeological information from these digital 3D constructions. More specifically, the total amount of stones, the total building time and the building cost regarding caloric energy expenditure are estimated for each of the digitised shelters. Although this assessment of architectural energetics provided useful insight into the building efforts and nutrient uptake of the shepherds, it also revealed many assumptions and shortcomings that often characterise archaeological information extraction from digital 3D models of buildings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since t... more This presentation ponders the aerial archaeology part of the Potenza Valley Survey (PVS). Since the project start in 2000, the main aim of the PVS has been the study of the settlement dynamics along circa 400 km² of the Potenza river valley in central Adriatic Italy (Marche).The talk contains three parts (past, present and future), of which the first deals with the airborne data acquisition approaches employed in the PVS during the first decade. Although the gathering of aerial imagery predominantly relied on standard photography from small Cessna’s using observer-based sorties, non-visible imaging and unmanned platforms were also part of the toolkit the PVS came to rely upon.The second part will offer some present-day technological-methodological-theoretical reflection on these airborne imaging solutions. Using “what-if” scenarios, the effectiveness and suitability of the past PVS approach for “doing landscape archaeology” at the scale of a river valley will be called into question. Could we have employed strategies to decrease the subjectivity and bias when collecting airborne imagery?In the third and final part, the presentation will discuss some future challenges and opportunities for interpretative mapping. Irrespective of the possible data acquisition issues tackled in part two, most forms of aerial photography can deliver meaningful insight about the past if proper post-acquisition pipelines are in place. Two recent PVS mapping projects will illustrate this. Mapping of the Montarice shows how to avoid slow single-image workflows and extract new topographical clues. The Monte Primo case study illustrates how to obtain a full 3D interpretative map.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Focusing on out-of-focusAcquiring photographs as input for an image-based modelling pipeline is less trivial than often a... more Acquiring photographs as input for an image-based modelling pipeline is less trivial than often assumed. Photographs should be correctly exposed, cover the subject sufficiently from all possible angles, have the required spatial resolution, be devoid of any motion blur, exhibit accurate focus and feature an adequate depth of field. The last four characteristics all determine the “sharpness” of an image and the photogrammetric, computer vision and hybrid photogrammetric computer vision communities all assume that the object to be modelled is depicted “acceptably” sharp throughout the whole image collection. Although none of these three fields has ever properly quantified “acceptably sharp”, it is more or less standard practice to mask those image portions that appear to be unsharp due to the limited depth of field around the plane of focus (whether this means blurry object parts or completely out-of-focus backgrounds). This paper will assess how well- or ill-suited defocus estimating algorithms are for automatically masking a series of photographs, since this could speed up modelling pipelines with many hundreds or thousands of photographs. To that end, the paper uses five different real-world datasets and compares the output of three state-of-the-art edge-based defocus estimators. Afterwards, critical comments and plans for the future finalise this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Computer graphics meets image fusionSince a few years, structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo pipelines have become omnipresent ... more Since a few years, structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo pipelines have become omnipresent in the cultural heritage domain. The fact that such Image-Based Modelling (IBM) approaches are capable of providing a photo-realistic texture along the threedimensional (3D) digital surface geometry is often considered a unique selling point, certainly for those cases that aim for a visually pleasing result. However, this texture can very often also obscure the underlying geometrical details of the surface, making it very hard to assess the morphological features of the digitised artefact or scene. Instead of constantly switching between the textured and untextured version of the 3D surface model, this paper presents a new method to generate a morphology-enhanced colour texture for the 3D polymesh. The presented approach tries to overcome this switching between objects visualisations by fusing the original colour texture data with a specific depiction of the surface normals. Whether applied to the original 3D surface model or a lowresolution derivative, this newly generated texture does not solely convey the colours in a proper way but also enhances the smalland large-scale spatial and morphological features that are hard or impossible to perceive in the original textured model. In addition, the technique is very useful for low-end 3D viewers, since no additional memory and computing capacity are needed to convey relief details properly. Apart from simple visualisation purposes, the textured 3D models are now also better suited for on-surface interpretative mapping and the generation of line drawings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Tracking the urban chameleon – Towards a hybrid change detection of graffitiISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences,  Jun 23, 2023Colourful and ever-changing: Graffiti can be considered the urban chameleon skin. At the Donaukan... more Colourful and ever-changing: Graffiti can be considered the urban chameleon skin. At the Donaukanal (Eng. Danube Channel), Vienna's central waterway and one of the largest and most active graffiti-scapes worldwide, this metaphor applies like hardly anywhere else. Every day a multitude of graffiti is destroyed by the creation of new works. Recently, efforts have been made to mitigate this constant loss of cultural heritage along the Donaukanal by systematically documenting the graffiti, mainly using photography and photogrammetry. However, keeping track of the newly added works is very time-consuming and often like finding needles in a haystack, considering the large extent and high volatility of the monitored area. Thus, an automated graffiti change detection would significantly reduce the effort and avoid overlooking graffiti. This contribution outlines the main challenges in image-based change detection for cultural heritage and proposes a hybrid graffiti change detection method. The investigated method exploits and combines an established pixel-based change detection algorithm, the Iteratively Multivariate Alteration Detection, with a novel descriptor-based method. The latter relies on image features, rather than pixels as analysis unit and can robustly filter false alarms from the high-performing but noise-prone pixel-based approach. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed method can largely automate image-based change detection of graffiti-scapes. It can uncover graffiti-related changes and robustly distinguish them from other image differences such as shadows but tends to overlook small-scale graffiti, indicating the need for further fine-tuning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The challenges of preservation: digitizing graffiti in the urban landscapeLa memoria digitale: forme del testo e organizzazione della conoscenza.

Although they have increasingly been accepted as museum objects or study topics, in many cases they are neglected or even actively rejected as human expressions worth documenting and (digitally) preserving. However, some scholarly initiatives have tried to overcome this lack of coverage of the graffiti scene. INGRID, for example, collects images from Germany over a span of forty years, while SprayCity archives photos of graffiti from all over Austria and beyond. The limitations with pre-existing solutions, however, is that they do not have standardized criteria to create and process the digital surrogates of graffiti, especially because they derive the photos from different sources. Project INDIGO aims to overcome these difficulties by offering a systematic, standardized and extensive coverage of a specific area of the city of Vienna, the Danube Canal, which has been a hotspot for graffiti production since the 1980s. For this purpose, INDIGO has developed a highly reliable and reproducible workflow that ensures color accuracy and automated orthorectification of the pictures, and has combined it with a curated digital preservation strategy that involves different services, such as the digital repository ARCHE and the spatial database application OpenAtlas. While drawing on the specific experience and knowledge acquired in the course of project INDIGO, this paper aims to offer an overview of the challenges that must be faced when digitizing, documenting and preserving contemporary graffiti. It will focus on three key aspects: (1) heritagization, i.e. the process by which an object made by humans such as a graffito becomes a valuable sample of cultural heritage; (2) FAIRness, the compliance with the so-called FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability) in the development of a digital preservation strategy for graffiti; (3) sustainability, i.e. how we can ensure that the data and services provided can integrate into the existing research environment, in order to safeguard the continuous relevance of the products of the research project. While graffiti are an edge case in the field of current studies, this paper aims to show that discussing the challenges linked to the digital preservation of graffiti can also help us think more carefully about possible improvements in digital preservation strategies for other, more traditionally accepted, kinds of cultural heritage assets.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although most of these professions rely on a digital representation of graffiti at a particular stage of their research, there has been strikingly little attention to how graffiti can effectively be monitored and digitally documented. And this is precisely one of the gaps that the heritage science project INDIGO is trying to fill. Through collaboration between geomatics, photography, data management and graffiti specialists, INDIGO aims to develop technical and logistical solutions that facilitate the systematic documentation, monitoring, and analysis of extensive graffiti-scapes. This paper focuses on the graffiti-discovering and data acquisition strategies INDIGO has been applying during its first project year. At the same time, the text explores new avenues for improving the existing approaches.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This importance of... more Colour is a powerful communication element in most forms of cultural heritage. This importance of colour notwithstanding, the documentation of cultural heritage typically captures the geometrical aspects and seldom the spectral dimensions of an artefact. This is partly because the science of colour (called colorimetry) is non-trivial. In addition, capturing accurate colour data with digital cameras remains challenging due to the operating principle of standard imaging sensors and the need for a stable and well-characterised illumination source. Despite these limitations, the heritage science project INDIGO made it one of its central aims to generate colour-accurate photos from graffiti captured with standard digital cameras in varying outdoor illumination conditions. This paper first discusses the importance of colour accuracy in graffiti documentation. Afterwards, the text details (in a non-mathematical manner) essential colorimetric and camera principles that underlie the generation of colour images from raw image sensor data. This in-depth coverage supports clarifying the main hurdles to accurate photo colours. Finally, the paper introduces the open-source COOLPI software resulting from this research. We are confident that COOLPI will benefit any other heritage documentation project, or any application where digital cameras play a fundamental role in acquiring correct colour values.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Urban Creativity Meets Engineering. Automated Graffiti Mapping along Vienna's Donaukanalby Benjamin Wild and Geert J J VerhoevenDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes. Proceedings of the goINDIGO2022 international graffiti symposium,  May 11, 2023Graffiti are polarising. Some consider them vandalism, others part of our cultural heritage.

If we consider graffiti to be part of our cultural heritage, we should also treat them as such. However, long-term and detailed graffiti documentation initiatives are sparse, so many of the existing archives with graffiti records are biased and incomplete. In addition, graffiti records usually suffer from decontextualisation, that is the lack of environmental information (be it spatially, temporally, but also smell and weather conditions). This means that graffiti documentation might not reflect the intended setting or meaning by the creator. INDIGO, a graffiti-centred academic project, largely overcomes the issue of decontextualisation by designing and implementing photogrammetric engineering approaches that support the ongoing documentation of an extensive graffiti-scape. The latter is situated along the Donaukanal, Vienna's central waterway and one of the most prominent graffiti hotspots worldwide. One innovation developed in the framework of INDIGO is a freely available Metashape add-on called AUTOGRAF. AUTOGRAF employs photogrammetric computer vision techniques to automatically create ortophotographs from all photographed graffiti. Orthophotographs or orthophotomaps are distortion-free images, combining photographs' visual qualities with characteristics of maps. They allow embedding the graffiti in their native, albeit virtual, 3D environment and can thus largely overcome decontextualisation. In this contribution, we showcase the significant advantages of orthophotomaps over conventional photographs and introduce the AUTOGRAF-based workflow that allows the automated derivation of graffiti orthophotos. INDIGO will use this tailor-made tool to enable graffiti analysis in unprecedented detail by mapping and displaying graffiti in their original setting along the Donaukanal.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Making a mark—Towards a graffiti thesaurusby Jona Schlegel, Massimiliano Carloni, and Geert J J VerhoevenDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes.

Graffiti and street art ... more What does it mean to create graffiti? What exactly is (or are) graffiti? Graffiti and street art differ, right? Almost everyone has an opinion on what constitutes (modern) graffiti. Consequently, the term has taken on the most varied meanings in the conversations of academics, in media coverage, or in daily life. So how can one be sure about the meaning of the term (or any graffiti-related term, for that matter)? This is why glossaries, dictionaries, and other types of lists with definitions exist on websites, at the beginning or end of coffee-table books, and in scientific articles. However, there is currently no generally available, updateable, broadly accepted and easy-to-expand list of graffiti-related terms. Therefore, in order to meet the need for systematisation and consistency required for a more comprehensive study of graffiti, project INDIGO embarked on the journey to create a graffiti thesaurus. Being a finite set of terms (i.e. a controlled vocabulary) with hierarchical relations, this thesaurus will make INDIGO's graffiti classification explicit and hopes to serve as a reference for the broader (academic) graffiti community.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Manche sehen in Graffiti schützenswertes kulturelles Erbe, andere Vandalis-mus. Graffiti sind Teil des öffentlichen Raums und damit Teil unseres öffentlichen Lebens, unserer Gesellschaft.

A variety of techniques are currently implemented in cameras and camcorders: some involve hardware solutions, other are software approaches. In general, IS for still photography entails hardware in-camera or in-lens solutions. Video stabilisation, on the other hand, can be accomplished with software algorithms, either in real-time within the camera or in post-processing. Whereas IS aids photography and video making, its influence on the photogrammetric 3D modelling process has not been investigated. This article addresses this aspect. To this purpose, several laboratory and real-world tests were carried out, whose results showed that IS must be disabled when accuracy matters in photogrammetric projects.

Graffiti makes people laugh, wonder, angry, think. These conflicting traits are all present along Vienna's Donaukanal (Eng. Danube Canal), a recreational hotspot – located in the city's heart – famous for its endless display of graffiti. The graffiti-focused heritage science project INDIGO aims to build the basis to systematically document, monitor, and analyse circa 13 km of Donaukanal graffiti in the next decade. The first part of this paper details INDIGO's goals and overarching methodological framework, simultaneously placing it into the broader landscape of graffiti research. The second part of the text concentrates on INDIGO's graffiti documentation activities. Given the project's aim to create a spatially, spectrally, and temporally accurate record of all possible mark-makings attached in (il)legal ways to the public urban surfaces of the Donaukanal, it seems appropriate to provide insights on the photographic plus image-based modelling activities that form the foundation of INDIGO's graffiti recording strategy. The text ends with some envisioned strategies to streamline image acquisition and process the anticipated hundreds of thousands of images.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To answer specific research questions about a 16 thcentury mural painting located in the Bischofstor of Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral, the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the entire painted surface was digitised in minuscule detail using thousands of overlapping photographs. Although this article provides image acquisition and processing specifics, it aims to assess which image-based modelling workflow can achieve the most detailed, noise-free, two-and-a-half dimensional (2.5D) raster surface of this mural painting. Other than their full 3D counterparts and in contrast to the focus of most academic research, 2.5D raster surfaces are ideally suited for visualising and analysing sizeable, detailed surfaces. They are, therefore, still the preferred surface encoding of many heritage projects that want to leverage digital surface approximations to further heritage insights (and not just use them as mere eyecatchers). In the end, only a combination of different 2.5D rasters was able to accurately represent the variable surface of this mural painting with the right amount of spatial detail.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From deposit to point cloud – A study of low-cost computer vision approaches for the straightforward documentation of archaeological excavationsby Geert J J Verhoeven, Martin Fera, and Wolfgang NeubauerProceedings of the XXIIIrd International CIPA Symposium,  2011Stratigraphic archaeological excavations demand high-resolution documentation techniques for 3D r... more Stratigraphic archaeological excavations demand high-resolution documentation techniques for 3D recording. Today, this is typically accomplished using total stations or terrestrial laser scanners. This paper demonstrates the potential of another technique that is low-cost and easy to execute. It takes advantage of software using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms, which are known for their ability to reconstruct camera pose and three-dimensional scene geometry (rendered as a sparse point cloud) from a series of overlapping photographs captured by a camera moving around the scene. When complemented by stereo matching algorithms, detailed 3D surface models can be built from such relatively oriented photo collections in a fully automated way. The absolute orientation of the model can be derived by the manual measurement of control points. The approach is extremely flexible and appropriate to deal with a wide variety of imagery, because this computer vision approach can also work with imagery resulting from a randomly moving camera (i.e. uncontrolled conditions) and calibrated optics are not a prerequisite.For a few years, these algorithms are embedded in several free and low-cost software packages. This paper will outline how such a program can be applied to map archaeological excavations in a very fast and uncomplicated way, using imagery shot with a standard compact digital camera (even if the images were not taken for this purpose). Archived data from previous excavations of VIAS-University of Vienna has been chosen and the derived digital surface models and orthophotos have been examined for their usefulness for archaeological applications. The absolute georeferencing of the resulting surface models was performed with the manual identification of fourteen control points. In order to express the positional accuracy of the generated 3D surface models, the NSSDA guidelines were applied. Simultaneously acquired terrestrial laser scanning data – which had been processed in our standard workflow – was used to independently check the results. The vertical accuracy of the surface models generated by SfM was found to be within 0.04 m at the 95 % confidence interval, whereas several visual assessments proved a very high horizontal positional accuracy as well.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although the well-preserved remains of the school were revealed using high-resolution geophysics, some questions about the surrounding soil landscape remained unanswered. Therefore, a proximal soil sensing procedure based on a single electromagnetic induction (EMI) survey with a multireceiver EMI instrument was applied to map the school of gladiators and its surroundings covering a 5.6 ha area. We investigated both the complementarity of the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and apparent magnetic susceptibility (MSa) measurements for mapping the school and its soil landscape. As a result, an integrated visualisation of the school in its soil landscape was obtained. This study proved the huge potential of EMI soil sensing to interpret the soil landscape and to discern smallscale natural and archaeological features without any invasive practice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
