L., . American trypanosomiasis: In situ and generalized features of parasitism and inflammation kinetics in a murine model. Experimental Parasitology 83, 267-274. Mimicking the natural conditions of mammalian infection, metacyclic trypomastigote forms of a Mexican isolate (Ninoa) of Trypanosoma cruzi were inoculated into mice in order to study inflammation kinetics and parasite clearance at the inoculation site, parasite tropism to different organs, and local inflammatory cell infiltrates. Polymorphonuclear cells were detected at the inoculation site as early as 1 hr after inoculation. Peak cell infiltrate was observed at 24 hr; at 96 hr polymorphonuclear cells had disappeared. Mononuclear cell infiltrates began at 24 hr, peaking at Day 15, and then stared disappearing by Day 30. Antigens and parasites were detected by conventional techniques up to 15 min and thereafter became undetectable.

We describe the molecular and biological characteristics of the T. cruzi VD strain isolated from a congenital Chagas disease patient. The VD strain was typified as DTU TcVI; in vitro sensitivity to nifurtimox (NFX) and beznidazole (BZ) were 2.88 μM and 6.19 μM respectively, while inhibitory concentrations for intracellular amastigotes were 0.24 μM for BZ, and 0.66 μM for NFX. Biological behavior of VD strain was studied in a mouse model of acute infection, resulting in high levels of parasitemia and mortality with a rapid clearence of bloodstream trypomastigotes when treated with BZ or NFX, preventing mortality and reducing parasitic load and intensity of inflammatory infiltrate in skeletal and cardiac muscle.

These patients had chagasic megaesophagus and underwent corrective surgery. Parasitologic (xenodiagnosis, hemoculture, or both), histopathologic (hematoxylin and eosin, and peroxidase-anti-peroxidase staining), and molecular (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] followed by slot-blot hybridization) tests were used in the analysis. The presence of T. cruzi, its genomic fragments, or its antigens could be detected in 98% (51 of 52) of the patients. The parasite was randomly identified in 76.9% of esophageal tissues and in 90.4% by PCR and in 73.1% by parasitologic methods from the blood. Fifty percent (26 of 52) of tissue samples had inflammation, 80.8% of which was associated with the parasite. Trypanosoma cruzi was also identified unassociated with inflammatory alterations. Higher tissue parasitism and intense inflammatory processes were observed in esophag...Download Free PDFView PDFThe American journal of tropical medicine and hygieneImpact of Benznidazole on Infection Course in Mice Experimentally Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi I, II, and IV2015 • Edilson KaneshimaAmerican trypanosomiasis is an emerging zoonosis in the Brazilian Amazon. Studies on benznidazole (BZ) chemotherapy with Trypanosoma cruzi from this region have great relevance, given the different discrete typing units (DTUs) that infect humans in the Amazon and other regions of Brazil. We performed a parasitological, histopathological, and molecular analysis of mice inoculated with strains of T. cruzi I, II, and IV that were BZ-treated during the acute phase of infection. Groups of Swiss mice were inoculated; 13 received oral BZ, whereas the other 13 comprised the untreated controls. Unlike parasitemia, the infectivity and mortality did not vary among the DTUs. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in all tissues analyzed and the proportion of organs parasitized varied with the parasite DTU. The BZ treatment reduced the most parasitological parameters, tissue parasitism and the inflammatory processes at all infection stages and for all DTUs. However, the number of significant reducti...Download Free PDFView PDFMemórias do Instituto Oswaldo CruzTrypanosoma cruzi strains and autonomic nervous system pathology in experimental chagas disease1996 • Aryon BarbosaDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesTrypanosoma cruzi in the Chicken Model: Chagas-Like Heart Disease in the Absence of Parasitism2011 • Francisco BernalDownload Free PDFView PDFParasitology ResearchBenznidazole therapy during acute phase of Chagas disease reduces parasite load but does not prevent chronic cardiac lesions2008 • Sergio CaldasDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
