These complexes existed in a diversity of ecological habitats that correspond well with the botanical composition and physiognomy of the modern West African and New Guinean mixed moist evergreen and deciduous coastal tropical rain forests (Richards, 1964; Germeraad et al., 1968; Graham 1985, 1995; Frederiksen 1985). The assemblages suggest that much of the Paleogene here was characterized by (1) a coastal, estuary Nypa-palm vegetation complex fringed by a lowland rain forest on the adjacent West African landmass, and (2) a tropical climate. Temporal changes observed within the spore-pollen (sporomorph) assemblages imply climate-driven vegetation successions responding to fluctuations in humidity and precipitation levels that in turn, may have been related 1) to regionally reduced sea-surface temperatures exacerbated by trade winds development and offshore upwelling, and 2) to global tectonoclimatic events. That the microplankton populations appear to reflect episodic, pronounced intervals of nutrient enrichment suggests a marine trend related to environmentally-controlled conditions forced by upwelling-enhanced surface-water fertility. The distribution of the dispersed organic material in the samples is therefore intimately linked to, and controlled by, the oceanographic and atmospheric processes acting on the immediate area of the Cote d&#39;Ivoire-Ghana (CIG) marginal ridge depositional site.

Organic Matter Assessment and Paleoenvironmental Changes of the Middle Jurassic Main Source Rocks (Khatatba Formation) in the North Western Desert, Egypt: Palynofacies and Palynomorph PerspectivesMineralsThe Middle Jurassic in the north Western Desert, Egypt, was a time of complex tectonics and incre... more The Middle Jurassic in the north Western Desert, Egypt, was a time of complex tectonics and increased environmental perturbations attributed to the predominant sedimentation of organic carbon-rich fine siliciclastic and carbonate deposits of the Khatatba Formation. Although some studies have addressed the hydrocarbon potential and source rock characteristics of the Khatatba Formation, a regional-scale investigation of the prevalent paleoenvironmental conditions and organic matter characteristics is still necessary. In this study, the Khatatba Formation is investigated for detailed palynofacies analysis and palynomorph composition to assess organic matter kerogen types and reconstruct the depositional paleoenvironmental patterns on a regional scale. For this purpose, 116 drill cuttings were collected from five wells in the Matruh, Shushan, and Dahab-Mireir Basins. Moderately diverse assemblages of spores, pollen, and dinoflagellate cysts are reported.

The process of discovery of new information generates large volumes of data that can be overwhelming if not properly stored and/or utilized. For example, the treatise on invertebrate macrofossils edited by Raymond in 1959 blazed the trail for similar works that came later. Many paleontological volumes provide information of fossil specimens that have been formally named. In palynology, problems can arise with palynomorph classifications and interpretations because of subjective nature due to human judgments and different levels of training. As a result, the same palynomorph can be interpreted or classified differently, resulting in junior synonyms and emended descriptions that can potentially confuse students and new researchers. It is important to provide a framework to compose a standardized description of each taxon utilizing diverse observations from var...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Stable Zn isotopes are an exceptional indicator of volatility-related processes, where partial vaporization of Zn leaves the residuum enriched in its heavy isotopes. Here, we present Zn isotope data for sedimentary rock layers of the K-Pg boundary, which display heavier Zn isotope compositions and lower Zn concentrations relative to surrounding sedimentary rocks, the carbonate platform at the impact site, and most carbonaceous chondrites. Neither volcanic events nor secondary alteration during weathering and diagenesis can explain the Zn concentration and isotope signatures present. The systematically higher Zn isotope values within the boundary layer sediments provide an isotopic fingerprint of partially evaporated material within the K-Pg boundary layer, thus earmarking Z...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Palynomorphs in southern Western Australian lake sediments: evidence of climate change and hypersalinity during the CenozoicPalynology,  2020ABSTRACT This study focuses on five cores in and around three of the hundreds of shallow ephemera... more ABSTRACT This study focuses on five cores in and around three of the hundreds of shallow ephemeral hypersaline lakes distributed in chains along traces of ancient drainages that dominate the southern Western Australian landscape. Cores within and on the shore of Lake Aerodrome (LA1-09, LA2-09), Prado Lake (PL1-09, PL2-09), and Gastropod Lake (GLE1-09) in the Cowan Paleodrainage were drilled as part of a multidisciplinary study to understand the evolution of the lakes. Lithological and palynomorph data provide insights into the region&#39;s the depositional history, and floristic and climate evolution of the region. The nearly 60 m deep LA2-09 core provides the most comprehensive data. The basal ∼15 m interval of this core comprises two distinct lignite units with a clay interbed that preserve a rich palynomorph assemblage of the Werillup Formation. This assemblage is characterized by the first appearance datum (FAD) and last appearance datum (LAD) of key late Eocene taxa that correlate with the Middle Nothofagidies asperus Zone, and is indicative of freshwater swamp surrounded by subtropical to temperate rainforest. Above the upper lignite (except the topmost sample), evaporitic-siliciclastic units preserve a depauperate palynomorph assemblage comprising mostly long-ranging sclerophyllicxerophilous-halophilic taxa. The pollen Myrtaceidites lipsis constrains the age of the upper ∼23 m interval as Pliocene to Recent. This younger assemblage also preserves reworked palynomorphs from the Werillup Formation and older units, and is identified in the other four cores. The presence of the halophilic green alga Dunaliella in the younger assemblage is used as a proxy for aridity and hypersaline conditions during post-Eocene deposition in southern Western Australia. Its absence in the neutral-alkaline lake water and uppermost core samples of GLE1-09 is either due to predation by the acidophobic gastropod Coxiella residing in the lake, or the fact that the type of Dunaliella preserved in the core samples is acidophilic.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cores from Pine Forest and Bray Area lakes, two manmade lakes in the Rolla area of south—central Missouri, USA, provided an opportunity to relate the algal palynomorphs in the top 9 cm of sediments to the processes that lead to preservation. By comparing algal palynomorphs in the sediments to the algal crop in the water, this study seeks to assess the effects of taphonomy on the assemblage in a palynological sample. The lakes were ecologically monitored four times in one year (late fall, spring, summer, winter) to determine the algal crop, and surficial sediment was sampled in Pine Forest Lake once in early winter. The annual average abundance of algae in the lake water was compared with sediment data, and statistical techniques (Kruskal—Wallis test, Mann—Whitney U-test and Pielou&#39;s Equitability index) were used to determine ecological stability in the sediments. While Sphaerocystis and Ceratium hirundinella did not apparently preserve well, moderate to high preservation potential was determined for Staurastrum and Botryococcus. In addition, Pediastrum simplex var. pseudoglabrum, P. integrum and P. boryanum var. pseudoglabrum were well preserved in the sediments. This preliminary study shows that a highly abundant algal species in the water may not be well preserved in the sediment. Therefore, higher resolution studies are needed to further explore the preservation potential of algae in lake sediments.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Several criteria were studied on 50 m long cores from two boreholes. Ten lithofacies were recognized from grain size, textures, sedimentary structures and trace fossils. Visual and statistical analyses defined two environmentally-controlled palynofacies associations. Mudstones and muddy heteroliths constitute Palynofacies Association A/C, which is rich in light-textured components and in lath-shaped wood fragments. Palynofacies Association B/D is rich in black debris and mainly angular, equidimensional wood fragments and is restricted to sandstones and sandy heterolithsSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
