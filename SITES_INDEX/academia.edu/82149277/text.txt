Michael FeenerDownload Free PDFView PDFMapping the Acehnese Past R. Michael Feener, Anthony ReidAceh has become best known in our times for its twin disasters—the worst earthquake and tsunami of modern times in December 2004, and a long-running separatist conflict that rent Indonesia for most of its independent history. Although this book emerged from the process of recovery from those traumas, it turns the spotlight on a more positive and neglected claim Aceh has on our attention, as the Southeast Asian maritime state that most successfully and creatively maintained its independent place in the world until 1874. Like Burma, Siam and Vietnam, all better protected by geography, Aceh has its own story to tell of a unique culture struggling for survival through the European colonial era. Unfortunately the sources for this story are scattered, since Aceh’s own records have not well survived the ravages of climate, civil war and eventual foreign conquest. To recover its cosmopolitan history an unparalleled range of sources and skills had to be brought together. Aceh’s central role in the creation of Malay literature out of Arabic, Persian, Indian and Indonesian elements had to be explored with reference to texts surviving in a dozen world libraries (Teuku Iskandar, Amirul Hadi). The rich archeological record, neglected through the long years of conflict, had again to be brought into play (Daniel Perret), and the extensive relations of the Aceh sultanate with the Ottoman Empire (Ismail Göksoy and Ismail Kadı, Andrew Peacock & Annabel Gallop), Portugal (Jorge Alves), England (Annabel Gallop), and the Netherlands (Sher Banu and Jean Taylor) had to be explored, chiefly in European archives by experts in these respective fields. The result of this combined work in this volume is the most comprehensive picture so far of sources for the history of Aceh.Download Free PDFView PDFreview van: Administrative courts in Indonesia: a socio-legal study2003 • Freek ColombijnDownload Free PDFView PDFBijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast AsiaEthnic ‘Ferociousness’ in Colonial Wars2021 • Gert OostindieThis article explores the myths and evidence surrounding extreme violence and the framing of ‘ethnic soldiers’ as loyal and indispensable Moluccan soldiers in the Dutch army in the Indonesian War of Independence, 1945–1949. In this article, we first interrogate the origins of this framing in the Dutch–Indonesian case and the type of sources underlying this perspective. Next, we present the results of our research, which combines a study of Dutch veterans’ ego documents and oral-history projects. Based on this analysis, we reconsider both the framing and the evidence, after which we conclude with some comparative observations on ‘ethnic soldiers’ and the sources and perspectives underlying the ambivalent, but increasingly critical, framing of these men. Our methodology includes the use of digital-humanities techniques.Download Free PDFView PDFBKIEthnic ‘ferociousness’ in colonial wars: Moluccans in the Dutch army in Indonesia, 1945-19492021 • Gert OostindieThis article explores the myths and evidence surrounding extreme violence and the framing of 'ethnic soldiers' as loyal and indispensable Moluccan soldiers in the Dutch army in the Indonesian War of Independence, 1945-1949.

Come and visit the Kamoro' is the slogan in the February- May 2003 newsletter of the National Museum of Ethnology (Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde) in Leiden, the Netherlands. An appealing but problem- atic slogan to attract visitors to a major exhibition of Kamoro (Southwest Papua/Irian Jaya) material culture. Can we can really come and see the Kamoro in Leiden? The colourful cover of the brochure shows a photograph of Papuans in war-attire but it is not clear who or what they are attacking. One of the warriors directs his anger towards the camera. It is a beautiful image, though out of focus (perhaps deliberately), and its message is unclear. Are these the Kamoro that we can meet in Leiden? Does the exhibition por- tray the Kamoro and in particular their ways of warfare? No, on the contrary, the exhibition gives us very little insight as to what is happening in the land of the Kamoro or to what the Kamoro aspire. It appears that Papua is much less alive in Leiden than suggested.Download Free PDFView PDFEUROSEAS, Oxford UniversityThe Inescapable Territorial Trap in IR Theories: US Role in the Thai-Lao Border from 1954 to 19752017 • Thanachate  WisaijornThis presentation argues that International Relations as a discipline has a strong interrelationship with geopolitics. The geopolitical characteristics are the self-claim for objectivity, Western supremacy, separation of space and peoples assumption, and the expectation for nationalistic advice. The four characteristics, this research argues, lead to the territorial trap of the political geographer John Agnew (1994). The traps are the dichotomous understanding of inside/outside space of the state, the myth of self-contained state and the border reification monopolized by the elites. This research uses the Thai-Lao border as an example of how scholars in International Relations, especially in Anglo-Saxon world, have been caught in the traps from the year of Laos’ independence in 1954 to 1975 that Laos became a communist state. Despite International Relations’ literature often not being aware of the solutions to escape from the territorial trap as proposed by Agnew and Corbridge (1995), the historical awareness of the states involved, broader social and economic structure of a hegemon, and changes in geopolitical order – were taken into theoretical consideration by a number of scholars. However, the three territorial traps mentioned have remained. This was because the geopolitical characteristics have never disappeared. In conclusion, this research demonstrates how spatial conceptualisation in international politics was portrayed among academia and state practitioners at the peak of the Cold War. It shows that very often, academia and state practitioners are caught in the territorial trap as it benefit the US policy concerning the Thai-Lao border.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
