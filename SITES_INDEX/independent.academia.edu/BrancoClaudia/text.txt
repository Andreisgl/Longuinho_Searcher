We tested a biobank of paired samples of serum and urine from the same patient (202 patients) presenting at the hospital in an area endemic for leptospirosis using qRT-PCR followed by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional nested PCR and with the serologic gold standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Differences were resolved by sequencing. qRT-PCR-HRM was positive for 46 of the 202 patients (22.7%, accuracy 100%) which is consistent with known prevalence of leptospirosis in the Azores. MAT results were positive for 3 of the 46 patients (6.5%). Analysis of paired samples allowed us to identify the illness point at which patients presented at the hospital: onset, dissemination or excretion. The melting curve analysis of Leptospira species revealed that 60.9% (28/46) of patients were infecte...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Considering the unknown role of consanguinity in causing CHD, we hypothesised that consanguineous unions and/or familial aggregation may be frequent in the Azorean Island of São Miguel (Portugal). To that end, we performed a retrospective observational study based on genealogical and molecular analyses. The study enrolled 112 CHD patients from São Miguel Island, which allowed the assessment of type of family (simplex or multiplex), parental consanguinity, and grandparental endogamy. Based on 15 STR markers, we estimated inbreeding coefficient (FIS) in the CHD cohort and healthy control group (N=114). Multiplex families were 37.6% (N=41/109), a rate considerably higher than previously described in the literature (&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;15%). Moreover, 9.2% (N=10/109) of the CHD families were consanguineous, mostly derived from third cousin unions, and 20.2% (N=22/109) presented full grandparental endogamy. Higher FIS values were found in patients with parental consanguinity (0.0371) and patent ductus arteriosus (0.0277). This study analysed several genealogical and genetic features related with CHD, revealing the presence of parental consanguinity and extensive familial aggregation in the CHD patients from São Miguel Island.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Aim: This study investigates clinically relevant pharmacogenes underlying statin response in 170 healthy Azoreans. Methods: Eight SNPs in candidate genes-HMGCR (rs3846662, rs17238540, rs17244841), CETP (rs708272), APOE (rs7412, rs429358) and SLCO1B1 (rs2306283, rs4149056)-were genotyped. Results: The allele frequencies were similar to those reported for European derived populations, excepting SLCO1B1 c.388A&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;G (rs2306283), which has a significant difference when compared with the HapMap CEU population (p = 1 × 10(-8)). The results of statin efficacy showed that 9.1% of Azoreans are APOE4 carriers. This allele has been associated with lower LDLc reduction from statin therapy and also higher LDLc levels at baseline. Regarding SLCO1B1, associated with statin toxicity, 1.8% of individuals have two reduced-function alleles (c.521CC). Conclusion: The results contribute to overcome the lack of knowledge regarding the frequency of pharmacogenetic SNPs and their corresponding haplotypes in targeted populations, such as Azores islands. Moreover, the present work constitutes an initial step to implementing pharmacogenomics in clinical practice where physicians could use a patient&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s genetic make-up to optimize statin therapy, regarding efficiency and myopathy risk.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 Genetic AnalysisMolecular Diagnosis & Therapy,  2009ABSTRACT Background: Glucuronidation reactions, catalyzed by uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltran... more ABSTRACT Background: Glucuronidation reactions, catalyzed by uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, constitute a detoxification process that adds glucuronic acid to endogenous and exogenous compounds, aiding their excretion. UGT1A proteins have been implicated as risk factors for both the development of cancer and adverse drug effects. Methods: Here, we assess the genome of 469 individuals from São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal) in order to determine the frequencies of polymorphisms and haplotypes in UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and UGT1A7, the co-occurrence of reduced enzyme activity UGT1A variants related to irinotecan toxicity, and to calculate the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genomic region encompassing these genes. Results: Allelic analysis disclosed the presence of rare alleles — UGT1A1*36 and UGT1A1*37 — only found in individuals of African descent, and UGT1A 7*4. These alleles confirm our previous results on the São Miguel Island genetic background. We identified five different genotypes in UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 and nine in UGT1A7. Haplotype analysis showed that three haplotypes constituted approximately 80% of the allelic variants. Interestingly, haplotype 3 (UGT1A1*28- UGT1A6*2- UGT1A7*3), with a frequency of 0.235, gathers the three alleles encoding the low-function UGT isoforms. Additionally, LD indicates a strong interaction between functional polymorphisms related to the alteration of the UGT enzyme activity. Conclusions: In summary, the results demonstrate a high variability of alleles and haplotypes, which have important roles in modifying expression and activity of UGTs. The data presented here could improve the understanding of the predisposition to cancers and susceptibility to the adverse effects of irinotecan in the São Miguel Island population.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To obtain a better understanding of the population structure of São Miguel Island (Azorean Archipelago, Portugal), we carried out a surname survey using the surnames listed in the most recent telephone book (2001). We identified 1315 different surnames in a total of 27,621 subscribers. The frequency of the different surnames was used to calculate the following parameters: isonymy (I), random component of inbreeding (FST), genetic diversity according to Fisher (alpha), migration rate according to Karlin-McGregor (v) and Nei&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s genetic distance. Eleven localities were selected, according to population size and geographic distribution, for analysis using the above parameters. Our results show that 51% of Salga&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s population and 52% of Sete Cidades&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s population are represented by six and eight surnames, respectively. These figures demonstrate the effective isolation of these two small places, which are located at opposite ends of São Miguel Island. Salga, Achada, and Sete Cidades present the lowest values of Fisher&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s alpha, indicating less genetic diversity. In contrast, the capital, Ponta Delgada, presents the highest value of alpha (78.13), indicating more genetic diversity. Our data indicate that the clustering of the localities corresponds to the geographic features of the island, where localities close together tend to share similar surnames. In conclusion, the population of São Miguel is relatively homogeneous and may constitute an ideal model for genetic mapping studies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this line of research, the present work aimed to assess the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Azoreans. Genotyping of 19 SNPs - 9 on 9p21, 5 on LDLR and 5 on USF1 - was performed by TaqMan assays on 170 healthy Azorean individuals. Results demonstrate that the most frequent haplotype in 9p21, with a frequency of 41.4%, is TGGGCGCGC, which harbors all risk alleles. Considering haplotype homozygosity data show that females present higher value of homozygosity for both LDLR (13.5%) and USF1 (15.3%), whereas males present higher value for the 9p21 region (8.2%). Interestingly, genetic profile analysis revealed differences in terms of geographic and gender distribution. The Azorean Central group presented a higher risk for atherosclerosis, 2.7 times higher when compared to the Eastern group, while the Eastern group shows 1.5 times higher risk for dyslipidemias. Moreover, Azorean females demonstrated a 4 times higher risk for dyslipidemias when compared to males, whereas males have an increased risk for atherosclerosis. Although allele frequencies in Azoreans were similar to those reported for the HapMap CEU population, the differences in terms of haplotype and genetic profile distribution must be taken in consideration when assessing genetic risk. Taken together, the data here presented evidence for the need to perform biomedical research and epidemiologic analysis in Azoreans with the aim of developing strategies to CVD prevention, health promotion and population education.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The results of statin efficacy showed that 9.1% of Azoreans are APOE4 carriers. This allele has been associated with lower LDLc reduction from statin therapy and also higher LDLc levels at baseline. Regarding SLCO1B1, associated with statin toxicity, 1.8% of individuals have two reduced-function alleles (c.521CC). Conclusion: The results contribute to overcome the lack of knowledge regarding the frequency of pharmacogenetic SNPs and their corresponding haplotypes in targeted populations, such as Azores islands. Moreover, the present work constitutes an initial step to implementing pharmacogenomics in clinical practice where physicians could use a patient&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s genetic make-up to optimize statin therapy, regarding efficiency and myopathy risk.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 Genetic AnalysisMolecular Diagnosis & Therapy,  2009ABSTRACT Background: Glucuronidation reactions, catalyzed by uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltran... more ABSTRACT Background: Glucuronidation reactions, catalyzed by uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, constitute a detoxification process that adds glucuronic acid to endogenous and exogenous compounds, aiding their excretion. UGT1A proteins have been implicated as risk factors for both the development of cancer and adverse drug effects. Methods: Here, we assess the genome of 469 individuals from São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal) in order to determine the frequencies of polymorphisms and haplotypes in UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and UGT1A7, the co-occurrence of reduced enzyme activity UGT1A variants related to irinotecan toxicity, and to calculate the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genomic region encompassing these genes. Results: Allelic analysis disclosed the presence of rare alleles — UGT1A1*36 and UGT1A1*37 — only found in individuals of African descent, and UGT1A 7*4. These alleles confirm our previous results on the São Miguel Island genetic background. We identified five different genotypes in UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 and nine in UGT1A7. Haplotype analysis showed that three haplotypes constituted approximately 80% of the allelic variants. Interestingly, haplotype 3 (UGT1A1*28- UGT1A6*2- UGT1A7*3), with a frequency of 0.235, gathers the three alleles encoding the low-function UGT isoforms. Additionally, LD indicates a strong interaction between functional polymorphisms related to the alteration of the UGT enzyme activity. Conclusions: In summary, the results demonstrate a high variability of alleles and haplotypes, which have important roles in modifying expression and activity of UGTs. The data presented here could improve the understanding of the predisposition to cancers and susceptibility to the adverse effects of irinotecan in the São Miguel Island population.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To obtain a better understanding of the population structure of São Miguel Island (Azorean Archipelago, Portugal), we carried out a surname survey using the surnames listed in the most recent telephone book (2001). We identified 1315 different surnames in a total of 27,621 subscribers. The frequency of the different surnames was used to calculate the following parameters: isonymy (I), random component of inbreeding (FST), genetic diversity according to Fisher (alpha), migration rate according to Karlin-McGregor (v) and Nei&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s genetic distance. Eleven localities were selected, according to population size and geographic distribution, for analysis using the above parameters. Our results show that 51% of Salga&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s population and 52% of Sete Cidades&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s population are represented by six and eight surnames, respectively. These figures demonstrate the effective isolation of these two small places, which are located at opposite ends of São Miguel Island. Salga, Achada, and Sete Cidades present the lowest values of Fisher&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s alpha, indicating less genetic diversity. In contrast, the capital, Ponta Delgada, presents the highest value of alpha (78.13), indicating more genetic diversity. Our data indicate that the clustering of the localities corresponds to the geographic features of the island, where localities close together tend to share similar surnames. In conclusion, the population of São Miguel is relatively homogeneous and may constitute an ideal model for genetic mapping studies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this line of research, the present work aimed to assess the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Azoreans. Genotyping of 19 SNPs - 9 on 9p21, 5 on LDLR and 5 on USF1 - was performed by TaqMan assays on 170 healthy Azorean individuals. Results demonstrate that the most frequent haplotype in 9p21, with a frequency of 41.4%, is TGGGCGCGC, which harbors all risk alleles. Considering haplotype homozygosity data show that females present higher value of homozygosity for both LDLR (13.5%) and USF1 (15.3%), whereas males present higher value for the 9p21 region (8.2%). Interestingly, genetic profile analysis revealed differences in terms of geographic and gender distribution. The Azorean Central group presented a higher risk for atherosclerosis, 2.7 times higher when compared to the Eastern group, while the Eastern group shows 1.5 times higher risk for dyslipidemias. Moreover, Azorean females demonstrated a 4 times higher risk for dyslipidemias when compared to males, whereas males have an increased risk for atherosclerosis. Although allele frequencies in Azoreans were similar to those reported for the HapMap CEU population, the differences in terms of haplotype and genetic profile distribution must be taken in consideration when assessing genetic risk. Taken together, the data here presented evidence for the need to perform biomedical research and epidemiologic analysis in Azoreans with the aim of developing strategies to CVD prevention, health promotion and population education.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
