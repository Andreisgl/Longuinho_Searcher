In your inbox, Thursdays.ArrowRightIt was 2 a.m., nearly 20 hours after starting his travels on March 8, and Drecksler — in town to officiate a friend’s wedding this past Friday — thought everything was in order. The bed was made up with two folded towels on top. The 38-year-old, who lives in Ecuador and North Carolina, was surprised to find a messier-than-expected space, but he looked at photos on the app and figured the owner had just let things get cluttered.He climbed into bed and conked out. In the morning, he woke up to the sound of knocking on the bedroom door. It was the homeowner — he was not expecting a guest.“This is my house,” Drecksler recalled the man saying.Advertisement“This is an Airbnb I rented,” he replied.It was not.Airbnb is taking a closer look at fees after a social media backlashOnly then did Drecksler realize that something had gone wrong between fetching the GPS coordinates from Airbnb, entering them into Google Maps and then using that information to call an Uber. Despite traveling professionally — he is founder of the site TravelisLife.org — and using Airbnbs extensively for a decade, he inadvertently ended up next door to the guesthouse he had rented.“It’s just the perfect storm at 2 a.m. of following the instructions incorrectly that happened to work,” he said in an interview with The Washington Post.Sleepy and mortified, Drecksler apologized profusely to the homeowner, whose name he still does not know.“He was super cool about it,” he said, and even referred to the mix-up as an “honest mistake” and pointed him toward the right home. Next door, Drecksler followed the same steps — gate, dog, backyard guesthouse — and found an exact match for the photos in the listing.AdvertisementHe messaged the host to let her know what had happened and apologize: “Well, true story, I spent the night at your neighbor’s house.”A local's guide to MiamiIn an Instagram video that he posted later that day, Drecksler said the story was “kind of funny and crazy” in hindsight, but also dangerous and “pretty terrifying” in the moment.Share this articleShare“He could have come in shooting or could have called the police or a combination of both,” he said. “Obviously a number of bad things could have happened. The way he reacted was so accommodating to the mistake. It was definitely the best possible outcome that could have occurred.”        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Paul Drecksler (@travelislifeorg)
At a pre-wedding dinner with the bride and groom and close family on March 9, Drecksler shared the story, which became the talk of the wedding. He told the group that he felt awful and wanted to send the homeowner a thank-you gift. Someone suggested a lock.AdvertisementThe bride, Stephanie Linder — another frequent Airbnb user — said she’s experienced “little mix-ups” like going to the wrong door or pressing the wrong button during a stay. Since many people in Miami have in-law suites and fenced yards, “I could totally see how it happens,” she said.Knowing that her friend was safe, she found the mishap hilarious. But it was also sobering.“Everybody kept saying if it was a different state, he could have been shot,” she said.Airbnb spokeswoman Ruthie Wabula said in an email that the company had not heard of a similar situation.“We’re just glad everyone is safe and that the confusion was cleared up,” she said.Drecksler said he doesn’t want to disturb the homeowner who accidentally hosted him. But he does want to express his gratitude. And if the man happens to read about the experience, Drecksler has a message: “If you’re ever in North Carolina or Ecuador, you’ve got a place to stay with me anytime you want,” he said.More travel newsSafety: Bird strikes | No-fly list proposal | Could you land a plane? | Whale vs. sailboat | Turbulence risks | Future of TSA |  Mask advice |  Traveling while transAirlines: Medical emergencies | Bunk beds | Flight padding | Clean-up duty | Carbon offsets | Lap babies | Flying is terrible | Private jet pets | Ribs on a plane | Modern airplane food | Family seating |  Middle seat fans | Phone calls on flights | Airport glow-up |  First class seats | Confronting unruly passengers |  It’s physically impossible to open a plane door | Wheelchair damageDestinations: Bad tourists in Bali | Paris’ best baguette | Starbucks in Rome | New York dogs | Hawaii GPS mishap | Greece’s accessible beaches | Could Disney move? | Florida travel warning | Amsterdam says ‘stay away’ | Orlando hater’s guide |  Real-life White Lotus | Misbehavior at national parks |  Scariest places |   Disney pricesAirbnb: Is there an ‘Airbnbust?' | CEO is hosting | Fees and chores | ‘Slave cabin’ apology | No more parties |  Accidental break-in | Pet-friendly additionsOn the road: Weed tourism | Weird resort fees | Wienermobile life | A day at a truck stop | Tracing the Great Migration |  Hotel room lights | Greyhound road trip | Green hotels | How environmentalists travel | Road trips with pets | Road trips with babiesShare CommentsLoading...View moreTOP STORIESTravelLocal guides, travel tips and the latest industry newsPerspective|Pickle pizza and cookie buckets: Minnesota State Fair food, rankedAt agriculture Disneyland, butter princesses reign supreme What New York City’s new Airbnb rules mean for travelersRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesCompanyAbout The Post Newsroom Policies & Standards Diversity and Inclusion Careers Media & Community Relations WP Creative Group Accessibility Statement Get The PostGift Subscriptions Mobile & Apps Newsletters & Alerts Washington Post Live Reprints & Permissions Post Store Books & E-Books Newspaper in Education Print Archives (Subscribers Only) Today’s Paper Public Notices Coupons Contact UsContact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Contact the Opinions team Advertise Licensing & Syndication Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Terms of UseDigital Products Terms of Sale Print Products Terms of Sale Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices washingtonpost.com  © 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2023 The Washington PostAbout The Post Contact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Download the Washington Post App Policies & Standards Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Print Products Terms of Sale Digital Products Terms of Sale Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices Coupons
