The present paper tests this assumption on 100 aspectual phrasal verbs with ten different particles. Minimal pairs of sentences with and without particles have been created and tested by two of Dowty’s (1979) aspectual tests. For these tests acceptability judgments have been elicited from native speakers. The paper points out methodological problems which should be taken into consideration in any study that relies on eliciting acceptability judgments. Most importantly, the results of the present study suggest, contra what is standardly assumed, that aspectual particles are not primarily markers of telicity. Instead, particles contribute other aspectual and non-aspectual meanings.Save to LibraryDownloadby Milada Walkova•  6  Phrasal Verbs, Tense and Aspect Systems, Verb-Particle Constructions, verbal AspectPräfix- und Partikelverben im deutsch-finnischen KontrastThis dissertation is a contrastive study of verb morphology, semantics, valency, and phrasal patterns in modern German and Finnish, focusing on prefix and par-ticle verbs.

The aims of this thesis are to define the phenomena prefix and parti-cle verb, to discuss the status of the verbs, and to explore and compare the prop-erties of the verbs in German and in Finnish. The method used is contrastive analysis. The study is based on various types of data: both dictionary excerpts as well as evidence from text corpora.The comparison of German prefix verbs with their Finnish counterparts re-veals interesting details of Finnish complex verbs and their morphological prop-erties. Furthermore, it makes it possible to detect valency alternation patterns in Finnish that have not yet been discussed in the research literature. According to the traditional view of the German particle verbs, they are best dealt with in a morphological approach that integrates them into the study of proper word formation products. In the light of the present study, however, this becomes questionable. This work suggests that particle verbs are complex, often lexi¬calized expressions with a syntactic combination structure. This accounts for their behaviour in German sentences. The German particle verbs and their study offer a useful framework for the investigation of the Finnish ones that so far have attained only modest attention in the research on the Finnish language. This study explores several Finnish particle verbs and their properties. Further¬more, it discusses and compares the valency behaviour of several German and Finnish particle verb groups.In addition, some further aspects such as evolutionary developments leading to the growth of prefix and particle verbs and complex verbs in Estonian and Hungarian, two related languages to Finnish, are also discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Leena Kolehmainen•  7  Argument Structure, Valency, Word formation, Verb-Particle ConstructionsVerbi sintagmatici e ordine delle paroleSave to LibraryDownloadby Francesca Masini•  5  Phrasal Verbs, Word order, Italian, Verb-Particle ConstructionsParticle patterns in English: A comprehensive coverageSave to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle•  7  Pragmatics, Semantics, English, SyntaxStefan Thim, Phrasal verbs: The English verb–particle construction and its history (Topics in English Linguistics 78).

I argue that both particles and prefixes come in two types, non-scalar and scalar, depending on how they describe the change denoted in the verb root. Non-scalar particles and prefixes do not alter argument structure, e.g. The children walked (on) in silence. They appear in predicates without an underlying scale, which are consequently atelic. In contrast, scalar particles and prefixes appear in predicates with an underlying scale, which are potentially telic. Scalar prefixes and particles can alter argument structure because scales require an obligatory realization of the measured participant, e.g. Ally slept *(off) a headache. The study reviews manifestations of argument-structure alternations as well as factors that determine the effect of particles and prefixes on telicity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Milada Walkova•  23  Slavic Languages, Phrasal Verbs, Tense and Aspect Systems, Slavic Linguistics‘BULGARIZE AWAY!’ – COGNITIVE ANALYSIS OF PHRASAL VERBS WITH AWAY AND HOW IT CAN HELP EFL LEARNERS TO INTERPRET THEM EASILY (A CORPUS STUDY)This research intends to find a more cognitive-oriented approach to the instruction of English phrasal verbs in comparison with traditional approaches.

This paper does not only aim to organize the meanings of verbs + away constructions in a semantic network but also plans to show how EFL learners can interpret the meaning of constructed ‘online’ phrasal verbs (cf. Evans, Bergen, Zinken 2007: 28) such as ‘Bulgarize away’, used by Ashton Kutcher’s character in the American movie Valentine’s day. The overall objective of the study is to oppose the false assumption that phrasal verbs (PVs) are random and without logical principles. We would like to show that PVs’ idiomaticity is comprehensible and should not make EFL students confused and inclined to avoid using them.Save to LibraryDownloadby Svetlana Nedelcheva•  6  Corpus Linguistics, Cognitive Linguistics, Phrasal Verbs, Semantic NetworksIt-clefts, Pseudo-clefts e Inverted Pseudo-clefts: estudo comparativo das orações clivadas em inglês e portuguêsThis dissertation relates to the usage of cleft constructions in the English and Portuguese languages from a comparative perspective.

For English, I have chosen toinvestigate two British books: The Picture of Dorian Gray and Harry Potter and thePhilosopher’s Stone. In order to compare English and Portuguese, I used thePortuguese versions of Oscar Wilde’s and J.K. Rowling’s works: O Retrato deDorian Gray and Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal, respectively. Peculiaritiesregarding the translation of the books were observed under the views of Venuti(2005), Barbosa (1999) and Jakobson (1974). The study of the constructions wasbased on the analysis of previous works from Braga (2009), Lambrecht (2001),Prince (1978), Pinedo (2000), Delin e Oberlander (2005), amongst others. Theanalysis of the phenomenon was based on the classification of the focalizedconstituents in the constructions according to the following aspects: word class,syntactic function, information status and presence of additional expression ofsalience. The investigation of the phenomenon has shown that differences existbetween the two languages as far as syntax is concerned, revealing that translatorsuse different linguistic strategies in order to preserve the communicative functionspresented in the original texts. However, there were cases in which the pragmaticdiscursivefunctions from the original text were lost in the translations. Additionally,the number of cleft instances in the two books is different, which can be an evidencefor an existing correlation between the use of clefts and the texts.Keywords: Clefts, Translation, Information Status.Save to LibraryDownloadby Manuela Oliveira•  4  Phrasal Verbs, Constructions, A novel fast version of particle swarm optimization method applied to the problem of optimal capacitor placement in radial distribution systems, Verb-Particle ConstructionsPostverbal Particles and Postpositional Elements in LakiPaper presented at the 4th International Conference on Kurdish Linguistics (ICKL-4). 2-3 September 2019.

Such structures are syntactically and semantically complex due to the fact that they do not fit into logical and homogeneous rules. This research aims at examining the semantics of particles in VPCs within the framework of Cognitive Grammar and Cognitive Linguistics. The discussion of the semantic contribution of the particles 'away‘, 'out‘ and 'over‘ is grounded in image schemas which allow establishing relations among the different meanings of particles found in the VPCs selected for the analysis. By using Corpus Linguistics tools, namely a concordancer called AntConc 3.2.1w, the five most frequent VPCs with each particle in the American National Corpus were selected for the analysis. The results showed that the particles contribute to the overall meaning of VPCs in different degrees, with more and less metaphorical senses.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marcos Gazzana•  6  Cognitive Semantics, Corpus Linguistics, Cognitive Linguistics, Cognitive GrammarWhen "wee wretched words" wield weight: the impact of verbal particles on transitivitySave to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle•  5  Semantics, Syntax, Phrasal Verbs, Argument StructureTypological differences shining through: The case of phrasal verbs in translated EnglishAre phrasal verbs less numerous in English translations if the source language is a Romance language than if the source language is a Germanic one?

This chapter sets out to answer that question. In a subcorpus of English fictional texts translated from Romance languages, up, out and down, which represent phrasal verb use rather well, are indeed underused when compared with non-translated English fiction from the British NationalCorpus, while no significant difference is to be found for this set of items between non-translated English and English translated from Germanic languages. This finding is strong evidence for source-language interference, as Romance languages on the whole do not have close equivalents to phrasal verbs, while Germanic languages do. This effect appears stronger than any source-language-independent translation universal that could in principle have played a role, such as normalization (exaggerated use of phrasal verbs, which are typical of the English language) or levelling-out (avoidance of phrasal verbs, which are generally felt to be rather colloquial).A comparison of French prefixed verbs with morphologically simplex ones in Le Petit Prince further shows that the former are more likely to be translated by phrasal verbs than the latter, again supporting source-language influence, as phrasal verbs resemble prefixed verbs in being composed of a verb and an added element. Our study thus stresses the relevance of taking into account typological differences (and similarities) between source and target language in translation studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle and +1Rudy Loock•  11  Translation Studies, English, Syntax, Corpus LinguisticsContextual cues for particle placement: Multiplicity, motivation, modelingSave to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle•  7  Pragmatics, Semantics, English, SyntaxParticle placement and the case for "allostructions"Save to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle•  6  Semantics, English, Syntax, Cognitive LinguisticsReflexiva partikelverb och liknande konstruktioner i sverigesvenska och finlandssvenska.Save to LibraryDownloadby Camilla Wide•  12  Languages and Linguistics, Dialectology, Syntax, Scandinavian languagesAd Foolen and Frederike van der Leek (eds.): Constructions in Cognitive Linguistics.

The meanings of prepositions, particularly, range from spatial to figurative uses, with the figurative uses being documented later than the spatial meanings. Today, the range of meanings for even a single particle, over, in combination with a verb, is overwhelming not only for students of Eng-lish as second language but also to the lexicographers documenting these uses. It is not the aim of this paper to list and explain existing meanings, but rather to take a closer look at the particle over in an earlier stage of its development, dur-ing the Late Middle English (LME) period, specifically the time from 1350 to 1491. This “snapshot” is undertaken with the help of the Middle English text samples contained in the diachronic part of the Helsinki Corpus (sections ME3 and ME4).Save to LibraryDownloadby Stefan  Diemer•  3  Historical Linguistics, Linguistics, Verb-Particle ConstructionsVerb-particle constructions and prefixed verbs in Italian: typology, diachrony and semanticsSave to LibraryDownloadby Francesca Masini and +1Claudio Iacobini•  7  Typology, Phrasal Verbs, Italian, PrefixesInterprétations aspectuelles des verbes à particule en anglais: téliques, comparatifs, résultatifsOn a très souvent affirmé que les particules verbales en anglais ont pour effet de rendre systématiquement télique l&#x27;événement dénoté par le verbe: on pense souvent que lorsqu&#x27;elles sont adjointes à des verbes, les particules... moreOn a très souvent affirmé que les particules verbales en anglais ont pour effet de rendre systématiquement télique l&#x27;événement dénoté par le verbe: on pense souvent que lorsqu&#x27;elles sont adjointes à des verbes, les particules servent à transformer en événements pourvus d&#x27;une fin intrinsèque des activités qui en dehors de ces configurations en seraient dépourvues.

We introduce a quantitative approach for comparative sociolinguistics that integrates linguistic distance metrics and predictive modelling, and use these methods to examine the development of regional patterns in grammatical constraints on particle placement in World Englishes. We find a high degree of uniformity among the conditioning factors influencing particle placement in native varieties, (e.g., British, Canadian, and New Zealand English), while English as a second language varieties, (e.g., Indian and Singaporean English), exhibit a high degree of dissimilarity with the native varieties and with each other. We attribute the greater heterogeneity among second language varieties to the interaction between general L2 acquisition processes and the varying sociolinguistic contexts of the individual regions. We argue that the similarities in constraint effects represent compelling evidence for the existence of a shared variable grammar, and variation among grammatical systems is more appropriately analyzed and interpreted as a continuum rather than multiple distinct grammars.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jason  Grafmiller•  3  World Englishes, Verb-Particle Constructions, Syntactic VariationEnglish aspectual particles are of two typesThe paper presents a corpus-based study of English aspectual particle verbs.

The standard view (Brinton 1985) is that particles mark telicity; a more recent account argues that particles are comparative and/or resultative (Cappelle & Chauvin 2010). However, neither account applies to all particles. Therefore I propose that there are two types of aspectual particles, which differ in aspect-marking. As corpus data show, the two types of particles also differ in other aspectually relevant properties, namely the type of verb root with which particles combine, transitivity and type of direct objects the respective particle verbs license. In particular, particles with a continuative meaning (about, along, around, on) combine with manner verbs rather than result verbs. They form intransitive particle verbs, or else transitive particle verbs with an unaffected direct object. Particles which mark telicity (down, off, out, over, through, up) typically combine with result verb roots. They form particle verbs which are either intransitive or transitive, with either an affected or unaffected direct object.Save to LibraryDownloadby Milada Walkova•  7  Phrasal Verbs, Tense and Aspect Systems, Argument Structure, Verbal Aspect TheoryDoubler-upper nouns: a challenge for usage-based models of language?Save to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle•  6  Syntax, Morphology, Cognitive Linguistics, Phrasal VerbsHeating up or cooling up the brain: MEG evidence that phrasal verbs are lexical unitsSave to LibraryDownloadby Bert Cappelle and +1Yury Shtyrov•  12  Neuroscience, Semantics, Magnetoencephalography, EnglishQualitative Korpusanalyse für die Grammatiktheorie: Introspektion vs. Korpus [Qualitative Corpus Analysis for Grammar Theory: Introspection vs. Corpus]I discuss three syntactic phenomena, which are highly relevant for theoretical linguistics: Ex­tra­po­si­tion from NPs and Sub­ja­cen­cy, pos­si­ble po­si­tions of par­ti­cles of par­ti­cle verbs, and frontings as a con­stituent test.

A class of English particle verbs (PVs) which show an argument structure alternation between ground promotion and figure retention, also shows a pragmatic asymmetry (Levin and Sells, 2007). This paper argues that this pragmatic asymmetry is the result of a null pronoun which has previously not been described. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that a previous attempt to account for ground promotion (Svenonius, 2003) predicts the presence of this null pronoun. Finally, this null pronoun, though it bears some similarity to null elements in other languages, does not fit neatly within a typology.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan Milway•Verb-Particle ConstructionsParticle patterns in English : a comprehensive coverageSave to Libraryby Bert Cappelle•  8  Computer Science, Pragmatics, Semantics, EnglishI verbi sintagmatici dell’italiano fra innovazione e persistenza: il ruolo dei dialettiI VERBI SINTAGMATICI DELL&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27;ITALIANO FRA INNOVAZIONE E PERSISTENZA: IL RUOLO DEI DIALETTI* Claudio Iacobini e Francesca Masini Università di SalernoUniversità Roma Tre 1.

Our goal is to show how a constructionist view of language can account for non-contiguous structures in the lexicon. In particular, the paper deals with four (well-known and lesser-known) case-studies: (i) particle verbs and discontinuous idioms; (ii) bracketing paradoxes where the suffix splits the phrase in two; (iii) parasynthetic verbs, where discontinuity is represented by the simultaneous addition of prefixation and conversion to a noun or adjective to create a verb; and, finally, (iv) discontinuous reduplication with numerals, a (so far undescribed) construction where a numeral is reduplicated “around” the head noun. In order to account for these different types of discontinuities, we use a variety of theoretical tools and notions developed within Construction Morphology and Construction Grammar.Save to Libraryby Francesca Masini and +1Claudio Iacobini•  9  Phrasal Verbs, Reduplication, Bracketing Paradoxes, Verb-Particle ConstructionsEstudio traductológico de los verbos sintagmáticos del italiano al castellano.

Ante la parca productividad de dichos constructos en español, destacamos los recursos lingüísticos que se suelen emplear con más frecuencia en este idioma al traducir los VS italianos. Para ello, analizamos un corpus paralelo, basado en la obra Lessico famigliare de Natalia Ginzburg (1963) y su traducción al español. Tras detallar los VS que figuran en el texto origen, adoptamos un enfoque de tipo cognitivo para dilucidar las posibles causas de aparición de los patrones lingüísticos destacados en la traducción. Por último, tras señalar algunos errores de traducción que se hallan en el texto meta y los motivos por los que se producen, planteamos que los VS han de considerarse como problemas de traducción.ABSTRACT“A corpus-based translation study on Italian verb-particle constructions translated into Spanish. The case of Lessico famigliare”Verb-particle constructions (VPCs) are considered to be a very productive linguistic phenomenon within the Italian language, especially in spontaneous and informal dialogues. On the contrary, in the Spanish language the productivity of such constructions appears to be low. In order to figure out which linguistic patterns seem to be more frequent while translating Italian verb-particle constructions into Spanish, a parallel corpus will be analysed. The corpus consists of the Italian novel Lessico famigliare (by Natalia Ginzburg, 1963) and its translation into Spanish. First, a list of the VPCs contained in the source text will be provided. Secondly, we will show which linguistic patterns are used in the translation, elucidating the reasons why they tend to appear, by means of a cognitive approach. Finally, some translation errors will be highlighted. The possible causes that resulted in such errors will lead us to allege that VPCs should be considered as translation problems.Key words: Orality. Translation. Verb-Particle Constructions.
