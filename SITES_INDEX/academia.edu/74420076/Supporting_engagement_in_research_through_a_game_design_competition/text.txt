However, there is an opportunity for engaging people more deeply by involving them in creating games. This article reports on a game design competition, based on participatory design principles and game jam practices, which challenged university students to design games within the context of a research project. Based on their interpretations of research on human error in health care, teams created four games to be disseminated online to a wider public audience. We outline the competition format and reflect on the extent to which it was successful.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Science CommunicationMotivations, learning and creativity in online citizen science2016 • Margaret GoldOnline citizen science projects have demonstrated their usefulness for research, however little is known about the potential benefits for volunteers. We conducted 39 interviews (28 volunteers, 11 researchers) to gain a greater understanding of volunteers’ motivations, learning and creativity (MLC). In our MLC model we explain that participating and progressing in a project community provides volunteers with many indirect opportunities for learning and creativity. The more aspects that volunteers are involved in, the more likely they are to sustain their participation in the project. These results have implications for the design and management of online citizen science projects. It is important to provide users with tools to communicate in order to supporting social learning, community building and sharing.Download Free PDFView PDF Moving Beyond Fun: Evaluating Serious Experience in Digital Games2015 • Jo  IacovidesGames are normally considered to be "fun", though recently there is growing interest in how gameplay can promote empathy and encourage reflection through "serious experience". However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear how to actually evaluate serious experience. We present an evaluation of four games that were submitted to a student game design competition; the competition challenged teams to design a game that inspired curiosity around human error and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The entries were judged by a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing by twelve participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these methods, with particular emphasis on how they enabled a consideration of the immediate and longer term impact of serious experience on players.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Human-Computer StudiesCo-created Evaluation: identifying how games support police learningAnne AdamsDownload Free PDFView PDFACM Transactions on Social ComputingIs Virtual Citizen Science A Game?Ramine TinatiThe use of game elements within virtual citizen science is increasingly common, promising to bring increased user activity, motivation, and engagement to large-scale scientific projects. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether or not gamifying systems such as these is actually an effective means by which to increase motivation and engagement in the long term. While gamification itself is receiving a large amount of attention, there has been little beyond individual studies to assess its suitability or success for citizen science; similarly, while frameworks exist for assessing citizen science performance, they tend to lack any appreciation of the effects that game elements might have had. We therefore review the literature to determine what the trends are regarding the performance of particular game elements or characteristics in citizen science, and survey existing projects to assess how popular different game features are. Investigating this phenomenon further, we then p...Download Free PDFView PDFDo games attract or sustain engagement in citizen science?: a study of volunteer motivationsJo  IacovidesIncreasingly, games are being incorporated in online citizen science (CS) projects as a way of crowdsourcing data; yet the influence of gamification on volunteer motivations and engagement in CS projects is still unknown. In an interview study with 8 CS volunteers (4 from Foldit, 4 from Eyewire), we found that game elements and communication tools are not necessary for attracting new volunteers to a project; however they may help to sustain engagement over time, by allowing volunteers to participate in a range of social interactions and through enabling meaningful recognition of achievements.Download Free PDFView PDFLearning by volunteer computing, thinking and gaming: What and how are volunteers learning by participating in Virtual Citizen Science?Laure KLOETZERDownload Free PDFView PDFBorda, A., Molnar, A. and Kostkova, P.

Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to consider the usage of both participatory research and serious games to improve public health. It discusses the existing research, opportunities and future directions.Download Free PDFView PDFComputers in Human BehaviorAn investigation of player motivations in Eyewire, a gamified citizen science projectRamine TinatiDownload Free PDFView PDFRemoving the HUD: The Impact of Non-Diegetic Game Elements and Expertise on Player InvolvementJo  IacovidesPrevious research has shown that player involvement can be influenced by a range of factors, from the controllers used to the perceived level of challenge provided by the game. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of the game interface. Game interfaces consist of both diegetic (that can be viewed by the player-character, e.g. the game world) and non-diegetic components (that are only viewed by the player, e.g. the heads-up display). In this paper we examine two versions of a first-person shooter game to investigate how immersion is influenced through interacting with a diegetic and non-diegetic interface. Our findings suggest that the removal of non-diegetic elements, such as the heads-up display, is able to influence immersion in expert players through increasing their cognitive involvement and sense of control. We argue that these results illustrate the importance of considering the role of expertise in relation to how particular design choices will influence the player experience.Download Free PDFView PDFDesigning Ourselves: Identity, Bias, Empathy, and Game Design A report from the Center for Technology and Society2019 • Kat SchrierDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
