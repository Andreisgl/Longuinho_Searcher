Several NQs are highly active against protozoans, amongst them the causative pathogens of neglected tropical diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Prominent NQ-producing plants can be found among Juglans spp. (Juglandaceae) with juglone derivatives as known constituents. In this study, 36 highly variable extracts were prepared from different plant parts of J. regia, J. cinerea and J. nigra. For all extracts, antiprotozoal activity was determined against the protozoans Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei rhodesiense and Leishmania donovani. In addition, an LC-MS fingerprint was recorded for each extract.

Flavonoid glycosides from Olax mannii: Structure elucidation and effect on the nuclear factor kappa B pathwayJournal of Ethnopharmacology,  2015Olax mannii Oliv.

(Olacaceae) is among the many medicinal plants used in Nigeria for the ethnomedicinal management of both cancer and inflammation. Such plants represent potential sources of innovative therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and other malignant disorders. While the majority of medicinal plants exert their anticancer effects by direct cytotoxicity on tumour cells, it is important that other mechanisms through which these plants can exhibit anticancer effects are investigated. Preliminary studies indicated that Olax mannii leaves are rich sources of novel flavonoid glycosides. The detailed chemistry as well the mechanisms through which these flavonoid constituents may exert their cancer chemo-preventive and therapeutic effects are, however, not yet investigated. The aim of this study is to carry out a detailed chemical investigation of Olax mannii leaves and the effects of the isolated constituents on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. A methanol leaf extract was subjected to various chromatographic separations to achieve isolation of flavonoid glycosides and the structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by a combination of 1D and 2D NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry. Biological activities were assessed by measurement of cellular viability and proliferation using quantitative IncuCyte videomicroscopy, trypan blue staining and by quantification of the number of metabolically active K562 cells based on quantitation of ATP. The effect of the compounds on the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway as well as toxicity towards peripheral blood mononuclear cells to evaluate differential toxicity was also assayed. Chemical investigation of the methanol leaf extract of the plant material led to the isolation of three new flavonoid triglycosides, kaempferol 3-O-[α-d-apiofuranosyl-(1→2)-α-l-arabinofuranoside]-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-O-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-l-arabinofuranoside]-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (2), kaempferol 3-O-[β-d-arabinopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-l-rhamnopyranoside]-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (3), in addition to fourteen known flavonoid glycosides (4-17). Of all the tested compounds, only compound 9 (kaempferol 3-O-αl- rhamnopyranoside) exhibited promising and specific antiproliferative activity on human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and dose-dependently inhibited NF-κB transactivation. The presence of this flavonoid glycoside and derivatives may account for the reported efficacy of Olax mannii leaf extract in the ethnomedicinal management of cancer and inflammation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
In Vivo Consumption of Cranberry Exerts ex Vivo Antiadhesive Activity against FimH -Dominated Uropathogenic Escherichia coli : A Combined in Vivo, ex Vivo, and in Vitro Study of an Extract from Vaccinium macrocarponJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,  2015For investigation of the molecular interaction of cranberry extract with adhesins of uropathogeni... more For investigation of the molecular interaction of cranberry extract with adhesins of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), urine from four volunteers consuming standardized cranberry extract (proanthocyanidin content = 1.24%) was analyzed within ex vivo experiments, indicating time-dependent significant inhibition of 40-50% of bacterial adhesion of UPEC strain NU14 to human T24 bladder cells. Under in vitro conditions a dose-dependent increase in bacterial adhesion was observed with proanthocyanidin-enriched cranberry Vaccinium macrocarpon extract (proanthocyanidin content = 21%). Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy proved that V.m. extract led to the formation of bacterial clusters on the outer plasma membrane of the host cells without subsequent internalization. This agglomerating activity was not observed when a PAC-depleted extract (V.m. extract(≠PAC)) was used, which showed significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion in cases where type 1 fimbriae dominated and mannose-sensitive UPEC strain NU14 was used. V.m. extract(≠PAC) had no inhibitory activity against P- and F1C-fimbriae dominated strain 2980. Quantitative gene expression analysis indicated that PAC-containing as well as PAC-depleted cranberry extracts increased the fimH expression in NU14 as part of a feedback mechanism after blocking FimH. For strain 2980 the PAC-containing extract led to up-regulation of P- and F1C-fimbriae, whereas the PAC-depleted extract had no influence on gene expression. V.m. and V.m. extract(≠PAC) did not influence biofilm and curli formation in UPEC strains NU14 and 2980. These data lead to the conclusion that also proanthocyanidin-free cranberry extracts exert antiadhesive activity by interaction with mannose-sensitive type 1 fimbriae of UPEC.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Covalent modification of human serum albumin by the natural sesquiterpene lactone parthenolideMolecules (Basel, Switzerland),  2015The reactivity of parthenolide (PRT), a natural sesquiterpene lactone from Tanacetum parthenium (... more The reactivity of parthenolide (PRT), a natural sesquiterpene lactone from Tanacetum parthenium (Asteraceae), with human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by UHPLC/+ESI-QqTOF MS analysis after tryptic digestion of albumin samples after incubation with this compound. It was found that the single free cysteine residue, C34, of HSA (0.6 mM) reacted readily with PRT when incubated at approximately 13-fold excess of PRT (8 mM). Time-course studies with PRT and its 11β,13-dihydro derivative at equimolar ratios of the reactants revealed that PRT under the chosen conditions reacts preferably with C34 and does so exclusively via its α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety, while the epoxide structure is not involved in the reaction.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Hieronymus (Verbenaceae), known as incayuyo, are used by the peasant population of Argentina for treatment of diseases related to a gastrointestinal system, mainly for inflammation of the stomach and have also been included into the Argentina Food Code. This study aimed to investigate the phytochemical profile of hydrophilic extracts from the herbal material by LC-MS and to evaluate potential pharmacological mechanisms rationalizing the traditional use of incayuyo aqueous extracts potential anti-inflammatory treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Phytochemical profiling: LC-MS of an aqueous decoction. Antiadhesive effects against Helicobacter pylori: in vitro FACS assay using FITC-labeled bacteria and AGS human stomach cells. Influence of extracts on stomach cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages: MTT viability assay and BrdU proliferation ELISA. Influence of extracts on IL-6 and IL-8 secretion from stomach cells was quantitated by ELISA after infection of the cells with Helicobacter pylori. Influence of test extracts on macrophages: phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Zymosan particles and NO production. Antioxidative capacity: DPPH assay and O2-induced caroten oxidation. LC-MS profiling indicated the presence of compounds 1-20 with flavonoid hexosides, phenylethanoides (acteoside, isoacteoside) and sesquiterpenes [(epi)lippidulcine, peroxylippidulcine] in the decoction extract and subfraction PhF. The extract exhibits strong in vitro antioxidative capacity and inhibited adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to stomach cells up to 40%, while an EtOH-soluble fraction showed inhibition rates of up to 60%. Decoction increased the cellular viability of AGS cells significantly at &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;10 μg/mL, while proliferation rate was not influenced. Helicobacter pylori induced IL-8 secretion was significantly reduced by coincubation of AGS cells with the extracts. Aqueous extracts stimulated phagocytosis rate of macrophages and inhibited the LPS-induced NO-secretion. The traditional use of aqueous extracts from Lippia integrifolia for gastric inflammation seems to be rationalized: besides anti-inflammatory effects on stomach cells antiadhesive properties of the extracts against the main bacterial inductor of gastritis Helicobacter pylori were identified. Additional effects for stimulation of innate immunity and potential radical scavenging effects may additionally contribute to the activity of the extracts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Extracts from Rhododendron ferrugineum Do Not Exhibit Grayanotoxin I: An Analytical Survey on Grayanotoxin I within the Genus RhododendronPlanta Medica,  2014For quantitative determination of grayanotoxin I (1) in plant material, a GC/MS method was develo... more For quantitative determination of grayanotoxin I (1) in plant material, a GC/MS method was developed after trimethylsilyl derivatisation of the analytes. Forskolin (5) was used as an internal standard for quantification. ICH-compliant method validation indicated sufficient specificity, precision, quantitation (15 µg/mL) and detection (5 µg/mL) limits. Regression analysis showed that a non-linear (polynomial) model was preferable to a linear one. For isolation of grayanotoxin I reference material from Rhododendron ponticum leaves, an efficient two-step fast centrifugal partition chromatography isolation protocol is described. A survey of 17 different plant species from the genus Rhododendron revealed high grayanotoxin I content for R. catawbiense, R. ponticum, R. degronianum subsp. yakushimanum, R. × sochadzeae, R. moupinense, R. galactinum, and R. mucronatum var. ripense. The content of this compound in leaf material from R. ponticum decreased rapidly during drying process. Grayanotoxin I was not detected in different batches of fresh leaves and fruits from R. ferrugineum. In contrast to the claims of German health authorities, this traditionally used herb therefore cannot be evaluated as toxic due to the presence of grayanotoxin I.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
