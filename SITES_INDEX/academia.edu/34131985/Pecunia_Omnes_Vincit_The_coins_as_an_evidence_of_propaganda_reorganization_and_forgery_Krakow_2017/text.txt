The coins as an evidence of propaganda, reorganization and forgeryVarga, Máté - Nagy, Zsolt Dezső - Coin Counterfeiting Workshops in Hungary in the Middle and Early Modern Ages2017 • Máté VargaWe have obtained many written sources and archaeological artefacts related to the counterfeiting of coins of the Hungarian Kingdom during the Middle and Early Modern Ages. Many forgeries can be found in numismatic collections, but tracing them to a specific workshop is sometimes a difficult matter. There are a number of sites, i.e. Visegrád, Buda, Esztergom, Kassa, Tevel, Bonyhádvarasd, and Szuhogy-Csorbakő, where not only counterfeit coins but other artefacts or objects (sheet metal, raw material, casting jars, and furnaces) which are obviously related to this illegal activity have been excavated. Frigyes Kahler is the researcher who most recently (several decades ago) published articles about the counterfeiting of coins during the Middle and Early Modern Ages. Since then, many new artefacts have been found, but information about them has been published only in part, and many have not been studied by numismatists or subjected to archaeometrical investigation. Moreover, many sites and/or forgeries discussed in previous publications should be studied again using new methods and adopting new considerations. Herein we present several case studies concerning the counterfeiting of gold and silver coins from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.Download Free PDFView PDFΝeokoroi: Propaganda of the Imperial Cult on the Coins of Pergamum  During the Reigns of Augustus, Trajan, and Caracalla.

The aim of this study was their chemical and microstructural characterisation aimed at obtaining information about the period of the coinage. Grazing light was used to obtain information about iconography. Alloy components and corrosion products were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructural research was conducted with cross-section samples of coins without iconographies. The iconographies revealed that many of the coins found at the archaeological site were minted between the first and second century ad . Metallographic analysis revealed that the coins were made from copper alloys, many of which are characterised by high lead content and various soil interactions. The result of sample cross sections showed that the archaeological finds of Alberone di Ro are different from those of the neighbouring field surveys and may be related to different periods. These findings were made within the framework of a research project that aims to expand our knowledge of the Roman presence in the territories of the Po delta and the spread of the monetary economy in a rural area between the urban centres of Hatria and Ravenna.Download Free PDFView PDFPecunia Omnes Vincit. The coins as an evidence of propaganda, reorganization and forgeryRoman coins from a rural settlement in central Italy2017 • alessandro lucianoThe excavations at San Vincenzo al Volturno (trench SS4, on the other bank of the river) brought to light a Republican vicus. It was replaced by a rural villa of Imperial Age, which was abandoned in the second half of the 4th century AD. The 70 coins which were found during the researches allowed the dating of the settlement’s phases. The aim of my paper is to submit a catalogue of a group of these coins. It shows what kind of currency circulated in a rural area of Roman Age and how the Imperial propaganda used it.Download Free PDFView PDFA Coin of Jewish Rebels from the Paphian AgoraMaciej WacławikWhen we look at the surfaces of ancient coins, it is generally obvious that they represent legal authority. However, this is not always true, as in the example of coins of the First Jewish War against Rome, minted by local authorities rebelling against their Roman occupiers. These emissions presented slogans of political freedom as well as of religious redemption, written in paleo-Hebrew script and referring to the Unified Kingdom of David. They were minted in silver to emphasise the independence of the rebels, and in bronze to obtain the widest possible circulation. Interestingly, these issues can be found not only in Judea, but also in other locations, such as Nea Paphos, where one prutah of the second year was found during the excavations of the Paphos Agora Project.Download Free PDFView PDFPecunia Omnes Vincit: The coins as an evidence of propaganda, reorganization and forgeryA Coined Victory of Pyrrhus: the propagandistic iconography on the gold staters of Pyrrhus in his sicilian coinage, an interpretative proposal2017 • Carlo LualdiThe reverse iconography of a Sicilian Pyrrhus’ gold issue can be linked with the exploitation of the propaganda concerning the Pyrrich victory at Heraclea as the symbols represented on this specific numismatic issue seem to indicate. This hypothesis has been verified by widening the scope of the investigation involving some other testimonies coming from the literary sources, the epigraphic field and comparisons with some representations coming from the italiote contemporary coinage. The choice of a theme that evokes Pyrrhus’ first military success in his western campaign can be explained with the great resonance of this event in the contemporary memory, that give the chance to the Epirote to reaffirm his strategic and tactical qualitiesDownload Free PDFView PDFPecunia Omnes Vincit.

The Coins as an Evidence Of Propaganda, Reorganization and Forgery, Kraków 2017.Szymon JellonekThe coins struck in Philippi differed from the coins struck in colonial mints. Common symbols that appeared on coins were the plough and legionary standards, however in Philippi there were only few such emissions. The main motive shown on the coins from Philippi, that of Augustus being crowned by Julius Caesar, emerged during the reign of Augustus and endured till the reign of Commodus. This juxtaposition is extraordinary and there are no strict analogies. Of great significance is the place where these types occurred. Philippi is known as the place where Julius Caesar was avenged.Download Free PDFView PDFAlberone di Ro's numismatic finds: iconography, metallurgy and microstructure interpretetions in Pecunia Omnes Vincit The coins as an evidence of propaganda, reorganizaTion and forgery CONfErENCE PrOCEEdINgS Of THE 2 Nd INTErNATIONAl NUMISMATIC CONfErENCEMario CesaranoDownload Free PDFView PDFForm of the Past.
