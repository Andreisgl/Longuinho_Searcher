Based on a comprehensive dataset of collocated surface and satellite observations at more than 700 sites, it is shown that GCM atmospheres typically absorb too little solar radiation, in the range of 10-20 Wmm2.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
