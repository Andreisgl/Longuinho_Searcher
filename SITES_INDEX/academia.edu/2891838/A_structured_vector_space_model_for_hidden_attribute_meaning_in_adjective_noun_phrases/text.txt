For the representation of adjective meanings, we reformulate the pattern-based approach for attribute learning of Almuhareb (2006) in a structured vector space model (VSM). This model is complemented by a structured vector space representing attribute dimensions of noun meanings.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersProceedings of the 2010 Conference on  …Nouns are vectors, adjectives are matrices: Representing adjective-noun constructions in semantic space2010 • Roberto ZamparelliDownload Free PDFView PDFExploring supervised lda models for assigning attributes to adjective-noun phrases2011 • Anette FrankAbstract This paper introduces an attribute selection task as a way to characterize the inherent meaning of property-denoting adjectives in adjective-noun phrases, such as eg hot in hot summer denoting the attribute temperature, rather than taste. We formulate this task in a vector space model that represents adjectives and nouns as vectors in a semantic space defined over possible attributes. The vectors incorporate latent semantic information obtained from two variants of LDA topic models.Download Free PDFView PDFAssessing interpretable, attribute-related meaning representations for adjective-noun phrases in a similarity prediction task2011 • Anette FrankAbstract We present a distributional vector space model that incorporates Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to capture the semantic relation holding between adjectives and nouns along interpretable dimensions of meaning: The meaning of adjective-noun phrases is characterized in terms of ontological attributes that are prominent in their compositional semantics. The model is evaluated in a similarity prediction task based on paired adjective-noun phrases from the Mitchell and Lapata (2010) benchmark data.Download Free PDFView PDFTHE MODULE-ATTRIBUTE REPRESENTATION OF VERBAL SEMANTICS2000 • Chu-Ren HuangIn this paper, we set forth a theory of lexical knowledge. we propose two types of modules: event structure modules and role modules, as well as two attributes: event-internal attributes and role-internal attributes which are linked to the event structure module and role module respectively. These module-attribute semantic representations have associated grammatical consequences.

The paper introduces the notion of typological closeness, which is a novel rigorous formalization of semantic similarity based on comparison of multilingual data. Starting from the Moscow Database of Qualitative Features for adjective typology, we create four datasets of typological closeness, on which we test a range of distributional semantic models. We show that, on the one hand, vector representations of phrases based on data from one language can be used to predict how words within the phrase translate into different languages, and, on the other hand, that typological data can serve as a semantic benchmark for distributional models. We find that compositional distributional models, especially parametric ones, perform way above non-compositional alternatives on the task.Download Free PDFView PDFFormalizing the Dynamics of InformationDimensional adjectives and measure phrases in vector space semantics2000 • Martina FallerDownload Free PDFView PDFlrec-conf.orgLearning Properties of Noun Phrases: From Data to FunctionsQuochi ValeriaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
