The indices are constructed on the basis of nominal housing transaction prices compiled from the real property registers of the cities. Existing Norwegian house prices indices generally cover a few decades and usually start in the mid-1980s. Hence, we present new information about Norwegian house prices for more than 160 years. The house price indices seem to fit well in with historical events and available indicators of the Norwegian economy. The overall trend in nominal house prices is upward sloping over the two centuries. However, in real terms the picture looks different, in particular in the first half of the twentieth century.Download Free PDFView PDFAn industrious revolution in Norway?

Inflation models are however contested. Rival models are shown to have different forecasting properties over a period that covers a change in regime in the Norwegian economy—from high to low infla- tion.
