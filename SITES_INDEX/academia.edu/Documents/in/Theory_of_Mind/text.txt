It then demonstrates how this reflexive monist map can be used to evaluate the utility and resolve some of the oppositions of the many other “isms” that currently populate consciousness studies. While no conventional, one-dimensional “ism” such as physicalism can do justice to this web of relationships, physicalism, functionalism, dualism, neutral monism, and dual-aspect monism can all be seen to provide useful ways of understanding different aspects of the relationships among consciousness, mind, brain and the external world when these are viewed in either a first- or a third-person way from within this web of relationships by sentient creatures such as ourselves. For example, physicalism and functionalism provide a useful understanding of consciousness, mind, brain and external world when viewed from a third-person perspective, while neutral monism provides a useful way of understanding first- versus third-person views of external phenomena. On the other hand, dual-aspect monism provides a useful way of understanding first- versus third-person views of mind, including Eastern versus Western views of mind.  Dual-aspect monism also provides a useful understanding of the “unconscious ground of being” that gives rise to, supports and embeds all these observable phenomena. For an integrated understanding one needs to understand how these phenomena and relationships combine into an integrated whole.Save to LibraryDownloadby Max  Velmans•  43  Comparative Religion, Cognitive Science, Metaphysics, Philosophy of MindMegtestesült interszubjektivitásRecent proposals of embodied intersubjectivity argue that social cognition is grounded in and shaped by – before and below any disembodied mentalizing – the perception, expression and understanding of embodied actions, emotions and... moreRecent proposals of embodied intersubjectivity argue that social cognition is grounded in and shaped by – before and below any disembodied mentalizing – the perception, expression and understanding of embodied actions, emotions and intentions. The central aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the phenomenology of intersubjectivity can complement and inform – both at the descriptive and at the theoretical-conceptual level – the ongoing work in the field of embodied social cognition in a more productive way than theories of theory of mind in analytical philosophy of mind. The paper first outlines a phenomenological critique of theories of theory of mind, and then tries to demonstrate the relevance of the phenomenological analysis of intersubjectivity for interpreting current empirical findings about the embodied nature of social cognition (mirror neurons in cognitive neuroscience, infant imitation and inter-affectivity in developmental psychology).Save to LibraryDownloadby Attila Szigeti•  5  Mirror Neurons, Theory of Mind, Embodied Social Cognition, Embodied IntersubjectivityVelmans, M.

Part II reconstructs an understanding of consciousness from first principles, starting with its phenomenology, and leading to a closer examination of how conscious experience relates to the world described by physics and information processing in the brain. Finally, Part III deals with fundamental issues such as what consciousness is and does, and how it fits into the evolving universe. As the structure of the book moves from a basic overview of the field to a successively deeper analysis, it can be used both for those new to the subject and for more established researchers. Understanding Consciousness tells a story with a beginning, middle and end in a way that integrates the philosophy of consciousness with the science. Overall, the book provides a unique perspective on how to address the problems of consciousness and as such will be of great interest to psychologists, philosophers, neuroscientists and other professionals concerned with mind/body relationships, and all who are interested in this subject.Save to LibraryDownloadby Max  Velmans•  40  Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology, Human EvolutionO’Reilly, K., Peterson, C.

Results showed ToM development to be a life span phenomenon for deaf and hearing people alike. Native and late signers were outperformed by hearing peers on advanced ToM in childhood (M = 9 years), but in adulthood (M = 40 years), native signers had caught up, whereas late signers had not. Findings highlight the extended importance of conversational interaction for ToM growth.

It is explicated that these beings comprise a group of utterly ruthless, merciless beings that are totally void of any feelings, compassion, and love without any heart-based intuitive intelligence. Furthermore, they are energetically parasitic-vampiric and highly dependent on the natural energetics of organic solar consciousness beings such as humans to energize their doomsday machinery and survive. In this respect, they resort to violence and wars in search of conquest of organic solar consciousness beings to capture and imprison and subject them to reverse consciousness enslavement using their specially devised artificial intelligence technology. And, in order to be able to perpetually siphon the precious divine energies of the organic solar consciousness beings, they strictly adhere to certain agendas and strategies to maintain in bondage their taken spoils of wars that include (their perceived) conquered planetary resources as well as the solar consciousness inhabitants such as humans they have captured. Being totally arrogant tyrants and utterly narcissistic perceiving themselves as superiors and even 'gods' of their captured victims, their nefarious agendas include blank slating (conscious wiping) of the oppressed subjects of their genetic cellular memories and replacing them through mind sliding AI programming with false-phantom memories, as well asSave to LibraryDownloadby Mohsen Paul Sarfarazi•  18  Philosophy of Mind, Human Genetics, Altered States of Consciousness, Theory of MindEinfühlung und EmpathieSave to LibraryDownloadby Monika Dullstein•  4  Social Interaction, Theory of Mind, Empathy (Philosophy), Carl RogersFeeling and Thinking of Others: Affective and Cognitive Empathy and Emotion Comprehension in Prosocial/Hostile PreschoolersSave to LibraryDownloadby Carmen Belacchi•  16  Psychology, Theory of Mind, Emotions, EmpathyRecursive Mentalizing and Common Knowledge in the Bystander EffectThe more potential helpers there are, the less likely any individual is to help.

A traditional explanation for this bystander effect is that responsibility diffuses across the multiple bystanders, diluting the responsibility of each. We investigate an alternative, which combines the volunteer&#39;s dilemma (each bystander is best off if another responds) with recursive theory of mind (each infers what the others know about what he knows) to predict that actors will strategically shirk when they think others feel compelled to help. In 3 experiments, participants responded to a (fictional) person who needed help from at least 1 volunteer. Participants were in groups of 2 or 5 and had varying information about whether other group members knew that help was needed.

Mental illness in a parent or child often exacerbates the challenges of managing psychological distress that is germane to the parenting roll. Mentalization-based approaches to psychotherapy for parents have the potential to address challenges of emotional regulation in parents by supporting their capacity to recognize and modulate negative affect during stressful parenting situations. In this study, we piloted Mothering from the Inside Out (MIO) with 17 mothers receiving services at a community-based mental health clinic. MIO is a 12-week, mentalization-based parenting intervention that demonstrated efficacy in two previous randomized controlled trials with substance using mothers.

Method: The research method is semi-experimental with post-test pre-test with control group. The statistical population of the present study was children with autism disorder aged 6 to 12 years in Urmia (274 people) in the academic year of 2019-20 were from the exceptional school for children with autism, out of the target population, Out of the total target population 40 high-performance autism were selected using Gilliam Autism Rating Scale(Gilliam,1995) and randomly assigned to two experimental (20) and control (20) groups, and the Hutchins Mind Theory Questionnaire(Hutchins et al., 2012) was completed by parents of both groups. After performing the pre-test, the experimental group was trained in the executive functions program. The program was designed by researchers and consisted of 24 sessions in which 4 skills (working memory, inhibition, flexibility and attention training) were taught, At this stage, the children in the control group did not receive any training. The post-test was performed again and the data obtained from the pre-test and post-test were analyzed using analysis of covariance.Results: The data showed a significant difference(p < 01) between the control and test groups in the post-test of variable theory of Mind scores after adjusting the effect of pre-test of theory of Mind .Conclusion: Based on this study, it can be suggested that improving the executive functions can increase the levels of theory of Mind.Save to LibraryDownloadby journal of Clinical Psychology Studies•  3  Autism, Theory of Mind, Executive FunctionsTranscranial magnetic stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex impairs theory of mind learningSave to LibraryDownloadby Abraham Zangen•  15  Cognition, Social Cognition, Theory of Mind, Transcranial Magnetic StimulationMirror Neurons: Tests and testability.Commentators tended to focus on the conceptual framework of our article, the contrast between genetic and associative accounts of mirror neurons, and to challenge it with additional possibilities rather than empirical data.

There is not even any indication of how that coherence occurs except through quantum entanglement, which is unacceptable as an explanation. Instead of looking at quantum explanations, it is time to look at and seriously consider a classical explanation for the coherence. In this respect each microtubule can be considered an LRC or basic radio tuning circuit based upon its configuration as a bio-induction coil. In other words, an axon can act as a system of multi-LRC circuits with the outer Axon wall as a capacitor and the microtubules as inductors. The LRC circuit is the primary tuning circuit in all electromagnetic transmitters and receivers. A large number of neurons could then develop and maintain coherence at  specific resonant frequencies within a group for a specific amount of time.Save to LibraryDownloadby James (Jim) E Beichler•  6  Metaphysics of Consciousness, Theory of Mind, Consciousness, Metaphysics of MindUwspólnianie uwagi a cechy autystyczne i empatiaThe functioning of people without autism spectrum disorders but with an increased level of autistic traits is a little-explored research area nowadays.

Therefore, in the present study, the issue of relations between the ability to share attention (both visual and auditory), underlying mentalization abilities, and the level of autistic traits as well as empathy was undertaken. The main objective of this study was to check whether people without developmental disorders but with an increased level of autistic traits or decreased empathy have difficulties in sharing attention. The second objective was to examine the potential difference between visual and auditory stimuli as cues inducing joint attention. We examined 75 participants aged 18 to 60. For the purpose of the study, we used the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, the Empathy Quotient, and a computerized test assessing the ability to share attention. The results showed that joint attention induced by auditory cues speeds up searching the field of view to a greater degree than joint attention induced by visual cues. Contrary to expectations, people with an increased level of autistic traits did not have difficulties with sharing attention. However, such difficulties were observed in people with decreased empathy. The results suggest that there is a relationship between the ability to share attention and empathy, even in people without developmental disorders.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adam  Putko and +1Agata Złotogórska-Suwińska•  4  Empathy (Psychology), Theory of Mind, Joint attention, Autistic TraitsFetal Testosterone and EmpathySave to LibraryDownloadby Simon  Baron-Cohen•  20  Theory of Mind, Intention, Empathy, Biological SciencesDevelopment of Affective Theory of Mind Across Adolescence: Disentangling the Role of Executive FunctionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Matthias Kliegel and +2Louise PhillipsMareike Altgassen•  15  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Theory of Mind, Adolescent DevelopmentDrones, robots and perceived autonomy: implications for living human beingsSave to LibraryDownloadby Rasmus Gahrn-Andersen•  20  Robotics, Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence, PhilosophyEpistemic Ordering and the Development of Space-Time: Intentionality as a Universal EntailmentThe paper shows the nomological basis for the emergence of intentionality and meaning, the "epistemic dimension of the world" from first (universal physical) principles.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rod Swenson•  8  Theory of Mind, Ecological Psychology, Evolution, Philosopy of MindChildren’s Social Representations in Dolls’ House Play and Theory of Mind Tasks, and their Relation to Family Adversity and Child DisturbanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Alison Hipwell•  4  Psychology, Theory of Mind, Social Development, Social RepresentationSimple Mindreading Abilities Predict Complex Theory of Mind: Developmental Delay in Autism Spectrum DisordersTheory of mind (ToM) is impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

The aims of this study were to: (i) examine the developmental trajectories of ToM abilities in two different mentalizing tasks in children with ASD compared to TD children; and (ii) to assess if a ToM simple test known as eyes-test could predict performance on the more advanced ToM task, i.e. comic strip test. Based on a sample of 37 children with ASD and 55 TD children, our results revealed slower development at varying rates in all ToM measures in children with ASD, with delayed onset compared to TD children. These results could stimulate new treatments for social abilities, which would lessen the social deficit in ASD.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dagmara Dimitriou•  16  Psychology, Education, Theory of Mind, MedicineStudies of adults can inform accounts of theory of mind developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Ian Apperly•  20  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Developmental Psychology, Cognitive developmentGuilty Artificial Minds: Folk Attributions of Mens Rea and Culpability to Artificially Intelligent AgentsWhile philosophers hold that it is patently absurd to blame robots or hold them morally responsible, a series of recent empirical studies suggest that people do ascribe blame to AI systems and robots in certain contexts. This is... moreWhile philosophers hold that it is patently absurd to blame robots or hold them morally responsible, a series of recent empirical studies suggest that people do ascribe blame to AI systems and robots in certain contexts. This is disconcerting: Blame might be shifted from the owners, users or designers of AI systems to the systems themselves, leading to the diminished accountability of the responsible human agents. In this paper, we explore one of the potential underlying reasons for robot blame, namely the folk's willingness to ascribe inculpating mental states or "mens rea" to robots. In a vignette-based experiment (N=513), we presented participants with a situation in which an agent knowingly runs the risk of bringing about substantial harm. We manipulated agent type (human v. group agent v. AI-driven robot) and outcome (neutral v. bad), and measured both moral judgment (wrongness of the action and blameworthiness of the agent) and mental states attributed to the agent (recklessness and the desire to inflict harm). We found that (i) judgments of wrongness and blame were relatively similar across agent types, possibly because (ii) attributions of mental states were, as suspected, similar across agent types. This raised the question-also explored in the experiment-whether people attribute knowledge and desire to robots in a merely metaphorical way (e.g., the robot "knew" rather than really knew). However, (iii), according to our data people were unwilling to downgrade to mens rea in a merely metaphorical sense when given the chance. Finally, (iv), we report a surprising and novel finding, which we call the inverse outcome effect on robot blame: People were less willing to blame artificial agents for bad outcomes than for neutral outcomes. This suggests that they are implicitly aware of the dangers of overattributing blame to robots when harm comes to pass, such as inappropriately letting the responsible human agent off the moral hook.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael T Stuart•  7  Artificial Intelligence, Theory of Mind, Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, Moral BlameO que Elisabeth da Bohemia perguntou a Descartes?

Ele dedica a Princesa o seu trabalho de maturidade metafísica (Princípios de Filosofia Primeira, 1644) e redige Paixões da Alma (1649) como um dos resultados do diálogo com a filósofa. O silenciamento dos últimos cem anos de historiografia sobre o legado de Elisabeth da Bohemia nesta troca epistolar causou distorções e, em alguns casos, lastreou o viés como regra e como a história. Uma das consequências dessa distorção está na leitura de que a questão da filósofa consistiria em uma crítica ao dualismo substancial. Neste estudo busco oferecer uma interpretação da natureza da primeira questão, com o intuito de esclarecer o pensamento da filósofa e o seu papel no diálogo, de uma maneira compreensiva, sem subscrever o paradigma literário do solilóquio cartesiano, e seu viés na literatura filosófica.Save to LibraryDownloadby Katarina Peixoto•  7  Theory of Mind, René Descartes, Conscience, Action TheoryTheory of mind and irony comprehension in children with cerebral palsySave to LibraryDownloadby Stéphanie CAILLIES•  19  Psychology, Pragmatics, Theory of Mind, PsycholinguisticsLanguage and the mind: on concepts and valuesSave to LibraryDownloadby Bert Peeters•  4  Theory of Mind, Linguistics, Language, Mind and Brain, Cognitive SciencesMetaphor, Transformation, and Knowledge: From Mind to Social Use: Gossip, Reputation, and Knowledge in Zinacantan.

This new revolution will be as much about mind and consciousness as it is about matter and physics. It will bring a new theory of physical reality that includes the consciousness that senses, interprets and interacts with physical reality. The new theory of consciousness will lead to explanatory models of the paranormal as well as explain how consciousness survives death. This prediction is not an optimistic 'pipe dream', but our present and future. A theory of this type has already been developed. It is based on a five-dimensional Einstein-Kaluza model of the space-time continuum. ‘Single field theory' or SOFT can easily account for paranormal phenomena and the survival of consciousness. Whatever theory finally succeeds in bridging the gap between mind and matter, indications are that it will have many of the characteristics of SOFT if it is not SOFT.

A wealth of theory and growing empirical evidence strongly indicate that reading a narrative activates a simulation with critical cognitive and emotional components. Importantly, these components have been linked to prosocial outcomes, such as empathy and transportation. While there is growing experimental support that reading narratives entails a simulated experience that involves transportation, the conditions under which reading leads to improvements in empathy remains understudied. This thesis applies a cognitive and narrative based approach in order to ask: What matters more? “Literary” features of a text, or the genre expectation a reader brings into a text? To answer this question, this thesis examines whether genre expectations and text genre—in combination or independently—influence participants’ empathy, transportation and comprehension. Overall, the results of two experiments bring to light the role of genre expectation in processing fiction and nonfiction texts and suggest genre expectation is an important factor that future studies should take into account when investigating the reading experience. By considering the study results in the framework of narratology, this thesis also addresses the theoretical foundations of the division between fiction and nonfiction. Specifically, this project reflects on the implications of how and why the reader’s use of disbelief has changed since the novel’s arrival due to the increasingly blurred boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, and their respective claims to truth.Save to Libraryby Jessica Van Gilder•  14  The Novel, Cognitive Narratology, Theory of Mind, FictionalityMaternal history of depression is associated with enhanced theory of mind in depressed and nondepressed adult womenSave to LibraryDownloadby Kate Harkness and +1Mark Sabbagh•  21  Genetics, Psychiatry, Depression, Social CognitionMindfulness in German Schools (MISCHO): A Specifi cally Tailored Training Program : Concept, Implementation and Empirical ResultsSave to LibraryDownloadby Vera Kaltwasser and +1Niko  Kohls•  9  Teacher Education, Theory of Mind, Mindfulness in Leadership, Mindfulness and well beingAnimal Metaphors and Metaphorizing Animals: An Integrated Literary, Cognitive, and Evolutionary Analysis of Making and Partaking of StoriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Kathleen Hart•  6  Cognitive Science, Evolutionary Psychology, Theory of Mind, Course designConsciousness and the natural method‘Consciousness’ is a superordinate term for a heterogeneous array of mental state types.

The types share the property of ‘being experienced’ or ‘being experiences’—‘of there being something that it is like for the subject to be in one of these states.’ I propose that we can only build a theory of consciousness by deploying ‘the natural method’ of coordinating all relevant informational resources at once, especially phenomenology, cognitive science, neuroscience and evolutionary biology. I'll provide two examples of the natural method in action in mental domains where an adaptationist evolutionary account seems plausible: (i) visual awareness and (ii) conscious event memory. Then I will discuss a case, (iii), dreaming, where I think no adaptationist evolutionary account exists. Beyond whatever interest the particular cases have, the examination will show why I think that a theory of mind, and the role conscious mentation plays in it, will need to be built domain-by-domain with no a priori expectation that there will be a unified account of the causal role or evolutionary history of different domains and competences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Owen Flanagan•  17  Evolutionary Biology, Psychology, Cognitive Science, PsychophysiologyNextLast »Related TopicsSocial CognitionFollowFollowingPhilosophy of MindFollowFollowingEmbodied CognitionFollowFollowingCognitive ScienceFollowFollowingEmbodied Mind and CognitionFollowFollowingPhilosophy of Cognitive ScienceFollowFollowingSocial NeuroscienceFollowFollowingCognitive NeuroscienceFollowFollowingFolk PsychologyFollowFollowingConsciousnessFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
