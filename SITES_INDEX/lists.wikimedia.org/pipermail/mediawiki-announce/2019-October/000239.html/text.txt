I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of MediaWiki 1.34.0-rc.0,
the first release candidate for 1.34.x. Download links at the end of the
e-mail. The tag has been signed and pushed to Git.
Please note that MediaWiki 1.34 no longer supports HHVM, and also the PHP
version requirement has been raised from 7.0.13 in MediaWiki 1.33, to 7.2.9.
This is not a final release and should not be used for production websites.
Known issues are tracked in Phabricator on the release workboard [1].
As always please do try out the release candidate in a test environment and
report any issues that you discover. Please use the #MW-1.34-Release [2] tag
in Phabricator when reporting issues specific to this release.
It is expected that MediaWiki 1.34 will become final in the second half of
November 2019.
