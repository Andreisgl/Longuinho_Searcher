Hartford Foundation Institute for Geriatric Nursing (Hartford Institute), in collaboration with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, conducted a survey of baccalaureate schools of nursing in the United States to compare gerontological content to baseline data collected by the Hartford Institute in 1997. Since last surveyed in 1997, baccalaureate nursing programs have been the recipients of substantial new resources and initiatives focused on gerontological curriculum enhancement. While these initiatives are ongoing, and some are in an early stage of development, resurveying baccalaureate programs was seen as a means of taking a midcourse &quot;pulse&quot; as to the effectiveness of these efforts. Data suggest that there has been a fundamental shift in baccalaureate curriculum toward incorporation of a greater amount of gerontological content, integration of gerontological content in a greater number of nursing courses, and more diversity of clinical ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Deirdre Thornlow•  27  Program Evaluation, Nursing, Geriatrics, GerontologySearch for gravitational waves associated with 39 gamma-ray bursts using data from the second, third, and fourth LIGO runsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alessandra San Jose•  18  Engineering, Quantum Physics, Organic Chemistry, Astrophysical PlasmaSpectroscopic characterization of lanthanide octaethylporphyrin sandwich complexes.

Maternal depression and current partner violence were hypothesized to be mediators of the association between CSA and parenting. This study is based on secondary data analysis of archived data. The participants were 263 primiparous mothers (107 with a history of CSA and 156 comparison mothers recruited from a prenatal clinic prior to the birth of their first child. Mothers were interviewed twice: once when they were between 28 and 32 weeks gestation and again when their child was between 2 and 4 years of age. During the first interview, women were asked about childhood experiences of sexual abuse. During their second interview, they were asked about current symptoms of pathology and experiences with partner violence and parenting beliefs and practices.

This step considersfinding groups of members in the dataset that are verydifferent from each other, and whose members are verysimilar to each other, therefore one DM task is appliedwhich is clustering task. The main objective of theproposed research is to enhance the performance of oneof the most well-known popular clustering algorithms(K-mean) to produce near-optimal decisions for telcoschurn prediction and retention problems. Due to itsperformance in clustering massive data sets. The finalclustering result of the k-mean clustering algorithmgreatly depends upon the correctness of the initialcentroids, which are selected randomly. This researchwill be followed by a serious of researches targeting themain objective which is an efficient DSS which will beapplied on customer banking data. In this research anew method is proposed for finding the better initialcentroids to provide an efficient way of assigning thedata points to suitable clusters with reduced timecomplexity. The proposed algorithm is successfullydeveloped an applied on customer banking data, andthe evaluation results are presented.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ahmed Bahgat B El Seddawy and +1Dr. Ayman khedr•  2  Data Mining, Data AnalysisHigh-resolution truncated plurigaussian simulations for thecharacterization of heterogeneous formationsIntegrating geological concepts, such as relative positions and proportions of the different lithofacies, is of highest importance in order to render realistic geological patterns.

The truncated plurigaussian simulation method provides a way of using both local and conceptual geological information to infer the distributions of the facies and then those of hydraulic parameters. The method (Le Loc&#39;h and Galli 1994) is based on the idea of truncating at least two underlying multi-Gaussian simulations in order to create maps of categorical variable. In this manuscript we show how this technique can be used to assess contaminant migration in highly heterogeneous media. We illustrate its application on the biggest contaminated site of Switzerland. It consists of a contaminant plume located in the lower fresh water Molasse on the western Swiss Plateau. The highly heterogeneous character of this formation calls for efficient stochastic methods in order to characterize transport processes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Olivier  Jaquet•  8  Data Analysis, Fluid Dynamics, Ground Water, Simulation MethodsImplementación de un sistema para la toma de decisiones y mejora continua, basado en la gestión cuantitativa de la informaciónEsta tesis desarrolla el modelo de un sistema para la toma de decisiones y mejora continua que toda organización o industria debería de poseer; tomando como punto crítico la gestión cuantitativa de información.

One of the key questions how to harness this technology in an educational manner in universities and schools. This paper is about a Bluetooth quizzing system which will be used to administer quizzes to students of a university. The Bluetooth quizzing application consists of a server and client mobile Android application. It will utilize a queuing system to allow many clients to connect simultaneously to the server. When clients connect, they can register or choose the option to complete a quiz that the lecturer selected. Results are automatically sent when quiz is done from the client application. Data analysis can then be done to review the progress of students.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN) - ERA, WJCI Indexed•  19  Computer Science, Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, Wireless Communications, Mobile TechnologyA relative escape?

A distancia de casi 45 años de las elecciones democráticas de 1977, el abstencionismo electoral continúa siendo un fenómeno que concierne decenas de millones de ciudadanos españoles. En este trabajo se quiere investigar sobre las características de este fenómeno, sobre su relación con aspectos políticos y socio-económicos y sobre sus efectos en los resultados electorales. Para realizar este objetivo se han utilizado dos enfoques diferentes. El primero consiste en el análisis agregado, es decir el examen de los datos electorales desde 1977 hasta 2019. En esta fase se ha analizado el nivel de participación electoral diferenciandolo por unidad territorial y tipo de elecciones, y se ha observado como han cambiado los resultados de los diferentes partidos según el nivel de abstención. El segundo enfoque consiste en el análisis individual, que se fundamenta en un examen de encuestas de opinión donde se relaciona el comportamiento electoral con características socio-económicas y opiniones políticas. Herramientas de visualización de datos y test estadísticas han sido utilizadas para permitir la individuación de patrones y relaciones significativas. En el análisis agregado se ha observado que las unidades territoriales más abstencionistas son las insulares y costeras y que el abstencionismo en las elecciones generales beneficía el Partido Popular. En el análisis individual se ha verificado como el tener un nivel de estudios primarios, una edad superior a los 60 años, el tener una opinión negativa hacia la situación política y económica y auto-ubicarse hacia el centro político tienen un efecto positvo en el abstencionismo electoral.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nicola Tanno•  5  Data Analysis, Voter Turnout (Electoral Behavior), Tesi di laurea, Abstencionismo electoralFaculty Perceptions of Intercollegiate Athletics: A National Study of Faculty at NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision InstitutionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Molly Ott•  5  Data Analysis, Governance, Sampling, Context EffectPrivate Security and Military Companies as a Challenge for TransparencySave to LibraryDownloadby Iveta Hlouchova•  3  Data Analysis, Security, PrivatizationData Analytics: Data Analytics in Higher EducationData analytics (DA) is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions about the information they contain, increasingly with the aid of specialized systems and software.

Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries toenable organizations to make more-informed business decisions and by scientists and researchersto verify or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses. (Rouse and Stedman, 2016).This project will seek to discover the applicability of DA within higher education andspecifically, the usability of DA to the University of the West Indies (UWI). By using DA, theUWI can achieve many business outcomes and be more responsive to their target market.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kumar Hinds•  3  Data Analysis, Data Analytics, Big DataWhat is an Ethnographic Archive an Archive of?

Moleong (2007, p. 247) stated that the process of analysis begins by reviewing research information throughout the research information available from various sources, from interviews, observations written in the notes field, and study documents. The research information after being read, studied, and analyzed the data reduction is then performed by abstracting. Abstraction is a researcher trying to make a summary of the core, the process, and the statements that need to be maintained so that it remains within it. The next step is to construct the abstraction results in the units. The units are then categorized. At the time of the categorization of the units do the coding process. The final stage of the analysis is to conduct examination of the validity of the research information. After examination of the validity of research information, while the researcher to interpret the data into a substantive theory with a particular method.Save to LibraryDownloadby Psychology Lover•  6  Social Research Methods and Methodology, Qualitative methodology, Data Analysis, Qualitative ResearchTUGAS 1 - TUTON Pengantar Statistik Sosial (ISIP4215)Save to LibraryDownloadby Triyosi  Girinda Puri•  5  Statistics, Qualitative methodology, Applied Statistics, Data AnalysisBuji ile Ateşlemeli Bir Motorun Yük Karakteristiklerinin HesaplanmasıSave to LibraryDownloadby Orhan TÜRK•  2  Data Analysis, Internal Combustion EnginesPYTHON İLE VERİ MADENCİLİĞİT.C KARADENİZ TEKNİK ÜNİVERSİTESİ FEN FAKÜLTESİ İSTATİSTİK VE BİLGİSAYAR BİLİMLERİ LİSANS BİTİRME ÇALIŞMASI Kaynak olarak kullanılan metnin, sayfanın veya kısmın ilgili çalışmada kaynak olarak belirtilmesi rica olunur.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kadir TURAN•  3  Data Mining, Data Analysis, Python ProgrammingHigh-order pattern discovery from discrete-valued dataSave to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Wong•  11  Machine Learning, Graph Theory, Motor Learning, Data AnalysisSchool crowding, year-round schooling, and mobile classroom use: Evidence from North CarolinaSave to LibraryDownloadby Steven  McMullen•  9  Economics, Data Analysis, Education Policy, Applied EconomicsBayesian adaptive Lasso quantile regressionRecently, variable selection by penalized likelihood has attracted much research interest.

In this paper, we propose adaptive Lasso quantile regression (BALQR) from a Bayesian perspective. The method extends the Bayesian Lasso quantile regression by allowing different penalization parameters for different regression coefficients. Inverse gamma prior distributions are placed on the penalty parameters. We treat the hyperparameters of the inverse gamma prior as unknowns and estimate them along with the other parameters. A Gibbs sampler is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior distributions. Through simulation studies and analysis of a prostate cancer dataset, we compare the performance of the BALQR method proposed with six existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods. The simulation studies and the prostate cancer data analysis indicate that the BALQR method performs well in comparison to the other approaches.Save to LibraryDownloadby Keming Yu•  9  Mathematics, Econometrics, Statistics, Data Analysis“Successful” Principals: A Contested Notion for Superintendents and PrincipalsThe notion of “success” is narrowly defined and appropriated within an educational context.

Typically limited to objective measures of organizational productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency, “successful” principal practices, we argue, engender action and attention to a broader array of issues and interrelationships. In this study, we conducted an exploratory case study drawing from interviews with five superintendents and three principals to probe broader definitions of successful school leadership. Data analysis revealed three themes to guide further research on successful leadership practice: capillarity of leadership actions, principals’ positionality in relation to members of the school community, and principals’ actions as moral ends.Save to LibraryDownloadby Khaula Murtadha•  7  Data Analysis, Case Studies, Best Practices, Organizational EffectivenessIssues in spatial microsimulation estimation: a case study of child povertySave to LibraryDownloadby Riyana Miranti•  7  Data Analysis, Child Welfare, Income Distribution, Spatial MicrosimulationStudy protocol for the translating research in elder care(TREC): building context through case studies in long-term care project(project two)Save to LibraryDownloadby Alison Hutchinson•  20  Long Term Care, Data Analysis, Case Study Research, Implementation ScienceInterval Semi-supervised LDA: Classifying Needles in a HaystackSave to LibraryDownloadby Sergey Nikolenko•  19  Sociology, Ethnic Studies, Mathematics, Computer SciencePerformance Assessment of Faculties of Management Discipline From Student Perspective Using Statistical and Mining MethodologiesThis paper deals with Faculty Performance Assessment from student perspective using Statistical Analysis and Mining techniques.Performance of a faculty depends on a number of parameters (77 parameters as identified) and the performance... moreThis paper deals with Faculty Performance Assessment from student perspective using Statistical Analysis and Mining techniques.Performance of a faculty depends on a number of parameters (77 parameters as identified) and the performance assessment of a faculty/faculties are broadly carried out by the Management Body,the Student Community,Self and Peer faculties of the organization.The parameters act as performance indicators for an individual and group and subsequently can impact on the decision making of the stakeholders. The idea proposed in this research is to perform an analysis of faculty performance considering student feedback which can directly or indirectly impact management’s decision, teaching standards and norms set by the educational institute, understand certain patterns of faculty motivation, satisfaction, growth and decline in future.

Eighty-seven Grade 6 girls were interviewed and completed questionnaires, including both self-report and projective measures, relating to pubertal status, attitudes to and knowledge about menstruation. Results showed knowledge to be limited, with evidence of incorrect and negative myths about menstruation. Attitudes to menstruation were characterized by embarrassment, discomfort, and ambivalence about growing up. Themes in story completion tasks further reflected these attitudes, along with shame and anxiety, linked periods with incapacity or illness, and expressed the norm of periods as events which require the use of deception and denial as coping strategies. Mature problem-solving approaches to the hypothetical situations in the stories were rare. Factor analysis of the attitudinal and knowledge data revealed four factors — Comfort through Knowledge; Negative Feelings: Discomfort through Knowledge; and Independence — which were discussed in terms of the ambivalent social construction placed on menstruation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Susan Moore•  24  Psychology, Research Methodology, Coping Strategies, Qualitative methodologyVacuum-based preservation of surgical specimens: An environmentally-safe step towards a formalin-free hospitalSave to LibraryDownloadby Gianni Bussolati•  15  Pathology, Surgery, Data Analysis, MedicinePaDDMAS: Parallel and Distributed Data Mining Application SuiteSave to LibraryDownloadby Omer Rana•  21  Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, Visualization, Decision MakingNextLast »Related TopicsData MiningFollowFollowingData ManagementFollowFollowingMachine LearningFollowFollowingBig DataFollowFollowingClustering and Classification MethodsFollowFollowingApplied StatisticsFollowFollowingQualitative ResearchFollowFollowingQualitative methodologyFollowFollowingStatisticsFollowFollowingNonparametric MethodsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
