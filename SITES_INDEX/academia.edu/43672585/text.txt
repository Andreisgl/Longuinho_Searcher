Here we analyze the ability of mutants of different transcription elongation factors to transcribe lacZ. We found that spt4Δ, like THO mutants, impaired transcription of lacZ and of long and GC-rich DNA sequences fused to the GAL1 promoter. Using a newly developed in vitro transcription elongation assay, we show that Spt4 is required in elongation. There is a functional interaction between Spt4 and THO, detected by the lethality or strong gene expression defect and hyper-recombination phenotypes of double mutants in the W303 genetic background. Our results indicate that Spt4–Spt5 has a positive role in transcription elongation and suggest that Spt4–Spt5 and THO act at different steps during mRNA biogenesis.Download Free PDFView PDFNucleic Acids ResearchTemperature-sensitive mutants of the exosome subunit Rrp43p show a deficiency in mRNA degradation and no longer interact with the exosome2002 • Fernando GonzalesDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biological ChemistryPeroxiredoxin Chaperone Activity Is Critical for Protein Homeostasis in Zinc-deficient Yeast2013 • Kittikhun KerdsomboonDownload Free PDFView PDFA Dual Role for Zinc Fingers in Both DNA Binding and Zinc Sensing by the Zap1 Transcriptional ActivatorMarguerite Evans-GaleaDownload Free PDFView PDFEmbo JournalThe Ssn6Tup1 repressor complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is involved in the osmotic induction of HOG-dependent and -independent genes1998 • Jose MarquezDownload Free PDFView PDFEmbo JournalRecombination between DNA repeats in yeast hpr1Δ cells is linked to transcription elongation1997 • ANDRES AGUILERADownload Free PDFView PDFProc Natl Acad Sci U S AThe unfolded protein response supports cellular robustness as a broad-spectrum compensatory pathway2011 • Guillaume ThibaultStress pathways monitor intracellular systems and deploy a range of regulatory mechanisms in response to stress. One of the best-characterized pathways, the unfolded protein response (UPR), is responsible for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. The highly conserved Ire1 branch regulates hundreds of gene targets by activating a UPR-specific transcription factor. To understand how the UPR manages ER stress, a unique genetic approach was applied to reveal how the system corrects disequilibria. The data show that the UPR can address a wide range of dysfunctions that are otherwise lethal if not for its intervention. Transcriptional profiling of stress-alleviated cells shows that the program can be modulated, not just in signal amplitude, but also through differential target gene expression depending on the stress. The breadth of the functions mitigated by the UPR further supports its role as a major mechanism maintaining systems robustness.Download Free PDFView PDFNucleic Acids ResearchIn vivo gene repair of point and frameshift mutations directed by chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides and modified single-stranded oligonucleotides2001 • Eric KmiecDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
