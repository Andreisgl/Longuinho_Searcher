This characteristic increases transport rates of the reactants and products to and from the catalyst layers and reduces the amount of liquid water entrapped in the porous electrodes thereby minimizing electrode flooding. To investigate the effects of the gas and liquid water hydrodynamics on the performance of an air cathode of a PEM fuel cell employing an interdigitated gas distributor, a 2-D, two-phase, multicomponent transport model was developed. Darcy's law was used to describe the transport of the gas phase. The transport of liquid water through the porous electrode is driven by the shear force of gas flow and capillary force. An equation accounting for both forces was derived for the liquid phase transport in the porous gas electrode. Higher differential pressures between inlet and outlet channels yield higher electrode performance, because the oxygen transport rates are higher and liquid water removal is more effective. The electrode thickness needs to be optimized to get optimal performance because thinner electrode may reduce gas-flow rate and thicker electrode may increase the diffusion layer thickness. For a fixed-size electrode, more channels and shorter shoulder widths are preferred.Save to LibraryDownloadby trung nguyen•  3  Chemical Engineering, Two Phase Flow, PEM fuel cellLarge bubbles attached to spargers in downwards two-phase flowSave to LibraryDownloadby Rex Thorpe•  3  Engineering, Multiphase Flow, Two Phase FlowDiffusion of aerosols from a stream flowing through a cylindrical tubeSave to LibraryDownloadby Derek Ingham•  7  Chemical Engineering, Two Phase Flow, Atmospheric sciences, DiffusionFLOW PATTERNS OF THE ESTER OIL-REFRIGERANT R134A MIXTURE FLASHING FLOW THROUGH A SMALL DIAMETER TUBESave to LibraryDownloadby José Luiz Gasche•  5  Two Phase Flow, Pressure Drop, Flow Pattern, Flow RateElectrowetting: A versatile tool for drop manipulation, generation, and characterizationSave to LibraryDownloadby Michel  Duits•  16  Engineering, Microfluidics, Two Phase Flow, FluidA neural network to correct mass flow errors caused by two-phase flow in a digital coriolis mass flowmeterSave to LibraryDownloadby Manus Henry and +1Mihaela Duta•  6  Civil Engineering, Two Phase Flow, Neural Network, Measurement ErrorMathematical study of a petroleum-engineering schemeSave to LibraryDownloadby Robert Eymard•  9  Applied Mathematics, Two Phase Flow, Mathematical Modelling, Mathematical AnalysisOn the accuracy of the void fraction measurements using optical probes in bubbly flowsSave to LibraryDownloadby Robert Mudde•  11  Engineering, Image Processing, Two Phase Flow, Scientific InstrumentsState of the art of high heat flux cooling technologiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Art Jung•  10  Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Two Phase Flow, Heat TransferForce-fed evaporation and condensation utilizing advanced micro-structured surfaces and micro-channelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Ohadi and +1Edvin Cetegen•  13  Microelectronics, High Pressure, Two Phase Flow, Heat TransferIgnition of turbulent non-premixed flamesSave to LibraryDownloadby Epaminondas  Mastorakos•  18  Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Convection, TurbulenceSimulation of fluid percolation in a rough-walled rock fractureSave to LibraryDownloadby Z.

Except for horizontal flow between vertical plates, the effects of gap width and flow channel orientation on flow pattern, void fraction and friction pressure drop were found to be small in narrow channels. The void fraction and two-phase friction multiplier data could also be reasonably correlated in terms of the Martinelli parameter. For horizontal flow between vertical plates, both the void fraction and friction multiplier data showed strong mass velocity effects. Several friction pressure drop correlations were tested for applicability to the narrow channels including a separated flow model proposed in this work.L'é coulement à cocourant adiabatique d'eau et d'air à travers un passage étroit entre deux plateaux plats de 240 mm de long et 80 mm de largeur avec des écartements de 0,778 et 1,465 mm, a été étudié pour six orientations différentes: courants ascendant et descendant verticalement, courants ascendant et descendant avec une inclinaison de 45° et avec des écoulements horizontaux entre les plateaux horizontaux et entre les plateaux verticaux. Excepté pour l'écoulement horizontal entre les plateaux verticaux, on a constaté que les effets de l'éartement et de l'orientation du canal d'écoulement sur le profil d'écoulement, la fraction de vide et la perte de charge par friction étaient faibles dans les canaux etroits. La fraction de vide et les données de multiplicateurs de friction biphasique pourraient aussi ětre raisonnablement correélées en termes de paramètre de Martinelli. Pour l'écoulement horizontal entre les plateaux verticaux, la fraction de vide et les données de multiplicateurs de friction indiquent d'importants effets de vitesse massique. On a vérifié le potentiel d'application de plusieurs corrélations de perte de charge par friction pour des canaux étroits et notamment un modéle d'écoulement séparé proposé dans ce travail.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Ali•  6  Chemical Engineering, Medical Sciences, Two Phase Flow, Pressure DropGas-liquid pressure drop in vertical internally wavy 90 bendSave to LibraryDownloadby mohammad al-shannag•  9  Engineering, Two Phase Flow, Stainless Steel, Energy BalanceCombination of CFD and DOE to analyse solid particle erosion in elbowsSave to LibraryDownloadby Marco Geron•  10  Engineering, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Two Phase Flow, Numerical MethodStudy on flow and mixing characteristics of molten steel in RH and RH-KTB refining processes...

Dispersion analysis for a practical range of wave-number is used to examine the stability characteristics of both differential and numerical implementations of the two models. In this study it was found that numerical damping overshadows the effect of differential terms when they were added specifically to achieve a well-posed differential model such as is done for some flow regimes in the CATHARE code. Furthermore the added terms can result in non-physical dynamic behavior of the model.Save to LibraryDownloadby Himanshu Pokharna•  6  Engineering, Computational Physics, Two Phase Flow, Mathematical SciencesTerminal velocity of a Taylor drop in a vertical pipeA scaling analysis based on the field equations for two phases and the jump conditions at the interface is carried out to deduce a balance of forces acting on a Taylor drop rising through stagnant liquid in a vertical pipe.

These equations can be solved by characteristics and finite difference methods. The Saint-Venant equations are changed into four complete differential equations in characteristics method and these equations are solved by drawing two characteristics lines. The Saint-Venant equations are changed into set nonlinear equations and are solved using Preissman scheme in finite difference method. This set of equation is changed into linear equation using Newton-Rafson method and can be solved using Sparce method. In this research, the results of the two method were compared and this was shown that: 1) these two methods can draw the surface profiles and flow hydrograph as well; 2) the finite difference method is more accurate than that one; 3) the mesh size in finite difference method can be larger than that one; 4) the difference between two methods are increased by increasing the time and distance..

To achieve that, this study intends to assist the understanding the influence of some variables on the project’s total cost due to the creation of a hypothetical relief with different inclinations, aiming always to obtain the route that represents the minimum cost for every case studied through the solution of a minimum path problem using the Dijkstra’s algorithm. Has a support tool, helping to determine with the best precision the flow’s pressure loss influence on the total cost, the software Ansys CFD was used. Analyzing the results of the volumetric fraction and pipe diameter variations it could be noted that different optimum routes tendencies were observed on the different analyzed cases, the main influencer factor was the cost due the pumping of the fluids. The costs of the routes varied from 0,00374 to 0,08032 US$/m³ of fluid transported between the studied cases, raising proportionally to the volume of oil in the mixture and in an inverse relationship, decreasing with the increase of the pipe’s diameter.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yuri Aguiar•  7  Two Phase Flow, Brazil, Pipeline, Oil and gasFlow pattern based two-phase frictional pressure drop model for horizontal tubes.
