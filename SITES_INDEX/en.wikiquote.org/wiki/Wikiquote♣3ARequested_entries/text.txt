Normal is just a cycle on a washing machine[edit]
This quote is popularly attributed to Whoopi Goldberg. All I have found so far are image macros. There is also a 2016 autobiography with this quote as the title.  Does anyone know what movie, TV show, or interview this might be from? -- Heyzeuss (talk) 12:54, 2 August 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I found an interview from 2009. I just can't believe that she is the first person  to ever say that though. ~~ Heyzeuss (talk) 10:44, 3 August 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]
the bible lets have a healthy conversation[edit]
I stumbled on to a part of genesis which talks about Nephilim which pricked my ears it's in (gen 6.4-8) I would love to know what your opinion is and description seems the most interesting I'm not an expert but I'm a fellow Christian shalom.
Hi... religion is about ethics and morality. It seems you are more interested in science fiction, or speculative history?

RE: Desperately Seeking the authentic citations for quotes[edit]
I am presently on the last page of my book called My Own Ocean Tides: Triumph Over Tribulation Bk 1. It has been an ongoing nightmare trying to learn how to cite correctly my quotes featured, but also find the actual original authors with citations details. This one particularly: “The pen is mightier than the sword.” Edward Bulwer-Lytton 1829. Wikipedia and Wikiquotes seem to not recognize Edward Bulwer Lytton connected to this quote. Although it brings up other works of his. How can I resolve this issue and find what I am looking for -with the quickness! Thank you very much. Candina Ann Author, Publisher, Poet, and Lyricist

English[edit]
What does the word "compile"mean?[is a researched data analysis generally based thurally investigated, checked for crosspondance on the retrieved data analysis then edited as its printed under documentation of documents]
Ortega y Gasset quote?[edit]
When there is a shortage of bread the mob burns down the bakeries.  Does anyone know where this is from
What is the earliest verifiable quote?[edit]
It seems like a simple question, but I haven't had much luck trying to find the answer. Maybe my google-fu is weak, or maybe the ubiquity of communications technology and mass data storage has caused my Gen Z brain to become fascinated by the very idea of words, frozen in time and directly attributable to a single person, in a way earlier generations may have recognized to be futile.
At any rate, for the purpose of clarifying the scope of the question, let’s define a “quote” as “a word or series of words, which was cited as the synthesis of, or attributed to, another speaker or writer.” Considering a quote as only a single word may seem odd, but in the case of wholly new words, new loanwords, and translations all the same, the first time something is quoted represents the moment the word(s) enters the historical record as not just a word(s) but a unit of cultural information in a way less easily lost to time than, say, the moment the word(s) is first uttered or the moment the meaning is comprehended by a whole segment of contemporary society.
Accordingly, the definition of “verifiable” must be able to be applied to both the quote and the original; although there are few scenarios I could imagine that would result in it being applicable to one, but not the other. For this purpose, I’ll define it narrowly, as “that which can be confirmed to have been written or spoken, by proof or evidence of a surviving copy of the text or record, or by proof or evidence of reference to the text or record by a source regarded by the majority of modern historians to be accurate.”
So, now that I’ve properly explained what it is that I’m looking for, I humbly ask any smart person reading this with even a slight interest in the subject matter to share their knowledge or any vague directions that may be helpful along my journey. If you made it this far, thank you, and I hope we can discover history together.

Circa 1990s:  Origin of Quotation that begins "Some people mirror our darkness..."[edit]
I am looking for the origin of the following quotation:
"Some people mirror our darkness. Others adequately reflect our light. Occasionally, we find one who does both. This is the one we either flee from or grapple to our hearts with hoops of steel."
I was given it on a piece of copy paper in 1993 by a hospital chaplain in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1994 I saw it on a Day-To-A-Page flip calendar (those specialty desktop calendars that were popular in the 1990s in the USA - unfortunately I don't know the calendar brand).  So far Google searches and list searches have resulted in no hits whatsoever even though I conduct a search for it every few years. 
Note: The closest 'hits' relate to the text from Shakespeare’s play Hamlet Act 1 Scene 3: "Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,. Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,. But do not dull thy palm with entertainment."
The quotation I am looking for was not this one.
Anyone recognise it?

"What do I win if I gain the thing I seek - A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy?  Who buys a minutes mirth to wail a week or sells eternity for a toy?"

There is no substitute for a running program -- Herbert Simon[edit]
I know I read this quote (it might be a paraphrase), but I would appreciate a citation. I have read Herbert Simon's Models of my life, but I can't seem to locate it.
BrainyQuote has  a blocked paraphrase "...the moment of truth is a running program; all else is prophecy". I actually don't recall that version.

The shock severe[edit]
User:Edent has blogged about a poem, often used as an epitaph, including the lines:
The call was short the shock severe
To part with one we loved so dear
with variants using "A bitter grief a shock severe" and "the sting severe"; and the earlier "The cup was bitter the loss severe"
Can we trace its origins? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:41, 22 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Pigsonthewing, Edent:: I observe "The Shock severe" stated as used by James Thomson (b 1700) in Elergy on the death of his Mother (1725) (Courthope,A History of English Poetry,vol5,1919). (Then I spotted you've already found that!) -- DeirgeDel tac 22:44, 23 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
trying to ask a Q; clicked Ask a Question on  //en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Reference_desk[edit]
Puzzled as to whether this is how to ask...
Just perused the Keith Laumer materials. Marvelous work Wikiquote has done there.
Found the above while trying to hunt down source of 
"Is Not Is Not Not Is"
I seem to recall coming across it when I was reading a lot of Sci Fi & after reading the excerpts on the Laumer page, I'm almost ready to believe it is from him.
If one of your volunteers is a Laumer fan maybe they can confirm him as the originator. Had I kept all of my back issues I'd be re-reading them now to find it.
Do you suppose archive.org would accept scanned copies of Sci Fi greats?
You are all incredible people... Live long and prosper ----&----  have large families!
