Mauricio L BarretoUFBA - Federal University of Bahia,  Instituto De Saude Coletiva,  Faculty MemberPublic Health+17I am a Senior Investigator(FIOCRUZ) and a Professor(Federal University of Bahia). My research in Epidemiology and Collective Health cover an extensive range of different topics, but always exploring background questions around social and environmental determinants of health, health inequalities, the impact of social and health interventions on health, and integration of social and biological knowledge for causal explanations in health. In 2016, I co-founded and direct the Center for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health-CIDACS, based in Salvador-Bahia. My current major project is the 100 million Brazilian Cohort, investigating the role of social protection policies on health. I am an elected fellow of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences(ABC) and the World Academy of Sciences(TWAS).less234 Followers115 Following44 Co-authorsTotal Views ;6 Public MentionsFollowFollowingPapersNew Insights on the Zika Virus Arrival in the Americas and Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of the Epidemic Dynamics in BrazilViruses,  2020Zika virus (ZIKV) became a worldwide public health emergency after its introduction in the Americ... more Zika virus (ZIKV) became a worldwide public health emergency after its introduction in the Americas. Brazil was implicated as central in the ZIKV dispersion, however, a better understanding of the pathways the virus took to arrive in Brazil and the dispersion within the country is needed. An updated genome dataset was assembled with publicly available data. Bayesian phylogeography methods were applied to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of ZIKV in the Americas and with more detail inside Brazil. Our analyses reconstructed the Brazilian state of Pernambuco as the likely point of introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, possibly during the 2013 Confederations Cup. Pernambuco played an important role in spreading the virus to other Brazilian states. Our results also underscore the long cryptic circulation of ZIKV in all analyzed locations in Brazil. Conclusions: This study brings new insights about the early moments of ZIKV in the Americas, especially regarding the Brazil-Haiti cluster at...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Como etapa inicial de um estudo epidemiológico que buscou a relação entre exposição ao lixo e diarréia em crianças, desenvolveu-se este estudo com o objetivo de conhecer como mulheres, residentes na periferia de um grande centro urbano, definem lixo, bem como as mesmas percebem a relação entre lixo e doença e entre lixo e outros aspectos ambientais. Em 1999, realizaram-se entrevistas com treze mulheres, em um bairro da periferia de Salvador, utilizando-se um roteiro semi-estruturado. Para a análise das entrevistas utilizou-se o aplicativo &quot;diaricamp&quot; do programa FileMaker. As entrevistadas definem o lixo como tudo que não serve para ser utilizado e o consideram como um problema quando este se encontra acumula...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Little is known about the human health consequences of solid waste disposal in open-air dumps. In addition, there are few studies on people&#39;s health practices in relation to solid waste. As the initial step in epidemiological research on the relationship between solid waste and diarrhea, this study describes women&#39;s perception of the definition of garbage and the popular understanding of the relationships between garbage and disease, and between garbage and the environment. The study used a qualitative approach in a slum neighborhood in Salvador, Bahia. A total of 13 women were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire in 1999. The FileMaker &quot;diaricamp&quot; application was used for data analysis. Interviewees defined garbage as anything useless and considered it a problem whenever it accumulated in the surroundings producing a bad smell or visual pollution, attract...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Esta pesquisa tem por objetivo estudar a estrutura fatorial das escalas da CTSPC em uma amostra populacional urbana do Nordeste brasileiro, sendo conduzido um estudo transversal com 1.370 crianças de uma coorte em Salvador, Bahia. Realizou-se análise fatorial com rotação oblíqua promax e calculou-se o coeficiente Kuder-Richardson. A análise fatorial revelou uma distribuição dos itens nos fatores de forma diferente da proposta do instrumento original. Verificou-se um perfil gradativo de violência em cada fator. Os valores obtidos para o Kuder-Richardson foram 0,63 para o Fator 1, 0,59 para o Fator 2 e 0,42 para o Fator 3.

The human host is often infected with multiple helminth parasites and most studies to date have investigated the effects of helminths in the context of infections with single parasite or types of parasites (e.g. geohelminths). In this study, we investigated how co-infections with three nematodes affect markers of allergic inflammation and asthma in children. We selected Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, two parasites that inhabit the human intestine and Toxocara spp (Toxocara canis and/or T. cati), intestinal roundworms of dogs and cats that cause systemic larval infection in humans. These parasites were selected as the most prevalent helminth parasites in our study population. 36.4% of children were infected with one parasite; 12.7% with 2 and 5.2% with 3. Eosinophilia&gt;4% and &gt;10% was present in 74....Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The goal of this study was to formulate environmental sanitation indicators and classify sanitation conditions in specific sewer basins and their respective neighborhoods. The database used contains information on the following sanitation components in these areas: water supply, sewer systems, urban drainage, road pavement, building typology and public cleaning. Data was analyzed using cluster analysis. The key variable of each component was identified, and eight sewer basins and twenty-three neighborhoods were classified into the following categories: good, regular, and poor. The use of environmental sanitation indicators allows decision makers to identify critical areas and define priorities for improving environmental sanitation conditions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
