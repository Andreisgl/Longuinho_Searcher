The main idea to this end is to use the combination of superposition and rate splitting for the encoding scheme and construct a decoding scheme based on simultaneous decoding.https://www.isecure-journal.com/article_161936.htmlSave to LibraryDownloadby ISECURE Journal•  4  Mutual Information, Secrecy Capacity, Multiple Access Channel, Quantum ChannelDesigning the Interventions to Mitigate the Barriers of Coordination in Handling Food Security: Insight from Central Java ProvinceThis study aims to identify the underlying barriers that may prevent public policy coordination among stakeholders in dealing with food security in Central Java Province and suggest recommendations to enhance the coordination.

This study used primary data from a questionnaire that the six government agencies’ experts filled out. These experts were asked to identify the relevance and the importance of each barrier and formulate a suitable policy recommendation. There were three data processing techniques used in this study: Content Validity Analysis, Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM) Method, and Delphi Method. The result of the Content Validity Analysis indicated 22 valid barriers. The result of the ISM method indicated eight barriers occupied the topmost level (complicated problems, insufficient sharing of information, ambiguities and lack of clarity, gap of coordination implementations between the rules and policies with the actual practice, fewer budget allocations, differ...Save to LibraryDownloadby aries susanty•  6  Clarity, Food Quality, Implementation, StakeholderHyper-Finite Factors, P-Adic Length Scale Hyoithesis, and Dark Matter HierarchySave to LibraryDownloadby Matti Pitkänen•  3  Physics, Planck length, PlanckNew Particle Physics Predicted by TGD: Part IIIn this article the focus is on the hadron physics.

The applications are to various anomalies discovered during years. 1. Application of the many-sheeted space-time concept in hadron physics The many-sheeted space-time concept involving also the notion of field body can be applied to hadron physics to explain findings which are difficult to understand in the framework of standard model. 1. The spin puzzle of proton is a two decades old mystery with no satisfactory explanation in QCD framework. The notion of hadronic space-time sheet which could be imagined as string like rotating object suggests a possible approach to the spin puzzle. The entanglement between valence quark spins and the angular momentum states of the rotating hadronic space-time sheet could allow natural explanation for why the average valence quark spin vanishes. 2. The notion of Pomeron was invented during the Bootstrap era preceding QCD to solve difficulties of Regge approach.

The data are collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 9.1 fb(-1). We measure the leptonic forward-backward asymmetry, A(FB)(ℓ), to be 0.072 ± 0.060 and the leptonic pair forward-backward asymmetry, A(FB)(ℓℓ), to be 0.076 ± 0.082. The measured values can be compared with the standard model predictions of A(FB)(ℓ) = 0.038 ± 0.003 and A(FB)(ℓℓ) = 0.048 ± 0.004, respectively. Additionally, we combine the A(FB)(ℓ) result with a previous determination from a final state with a single lepton and hadronic jets and obtain A(FB)(ℓ) = 0.090(-0.026)(+0.028).Save to LibraryDownloadby giulia manca•  10  Physics, Nuclear Physics, Particle Physics, MedicineFirst Measurement of Near-Threshold J/ψ Exclusive Photoproduction off the ProtonSave to LibraryDownloadby M.

Here we introduce the Big Pop Cosmogenesis and show our calculations associated with the Equation of State of the Universe.

In this note we show that the isodual theory predicts that antimatter emits a new light, called isodual light, which can be distinguished from the ordinary light emitted by matter via gravitational interactions (only). In particular, the isodual theory predicts that all stable antiparticles such as the isodual photon, the positron and the antiproton experience antigravity in the field of matter (defined as the reversal of the sign of the curvature tensor). The antihydrogen atom is therefore predicted to: experience antigravity in the field of Earth; emit the isodual photon; and have the same spectroscopy of the hydrogen atom, although subjected to an anti-isomorphic isodual map. In this note we also show that the isodual theory predicts tha...Save to LibraryDownloadby New Light•New Concept of MassIn contemporary physics mass is a basic property of any physical object, but there is no consistent definition of what mass is.

This principle can be considered as an effective way of universal filter and equalizers synthesis, which easily realizes any gene-ral transfer function. An attention is devoted to the derivation of optimum design conditions. As shown, these conditions strongly depend on the amplifier type used. The results obtained are illustrated by some design examples.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daša Tichá•T–x–y Diagram of the MgO–SiO2–Al2O3 System: Computer Model AssemblySave to LibraryDownloadby Vasily Lutsyk•  3  Materials Science, Inorganic Chemistry, DiagramExamination of the observability of a chiral magnetically driven charge-separation difference in collisions of the Ru4496+Ru4496 and Zr4096+Zr4096 isobars at energies available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion ColliderSave to LibraryDownloadby niseem magdy•  2  Physics, IsobarForward-Backward Asymmetry in Top-Quark Production inpp¯Collisions ats=1.96  TeVSave to LibraryDownloadby Giovanni Busetto•  12  Physics, Nuclear Physics, Particle Physics, Production economicsSuppression Pattern of Neutral Pions at High Transverse Momentum inAu+AuCollisions atsNN=200  GeVand Constraints on Medium Transport CoefficientsSave to LibraryDownloadby K.
