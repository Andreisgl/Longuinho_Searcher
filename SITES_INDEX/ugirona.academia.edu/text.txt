The study is based on a quantitative approach. The sample is made up of 207 students during 2018 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 161 students in 2020 (during COVID-19). The questionnaire included questions about professional perceptions and questions about the professional goals that students have in the short and long term. Finally, perceptions exclusively related to COVID-19 were measured.  The results showed that the vast majority of the students are highly motivated and committed to pursue a career in the tourism industry. A high percentage of the participants expressed their desire to do a Tourism master degree and undertake their own tourism businesses, despite the uncertainty now generated by COVID-19. The findings also reaffirmed the importance of guiding improvements on tourism higher ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Explanatory variables are characteristics of PhD student&#39;s research group understood as an egocentered social network, background and attitudinal characteristics of the PhD students and some characteristics of the supervisors. Academic performance was measured by the weighted number of publications. Two web questionnaires were designed, one for PhD students and one for their supervisors and other research group members. Most of the variables were easily comparable across universities due to the careful translation procedure and pre-tests. When direct comparison was not possible we created comparable indicators. We used a regression model in which the country was introduced as a dummy coded variable including all possible interaction effects. The optimal transformations of the main and interaction variables are discussed. Some...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

People with special access go to specific shrines for curative purposes. They may be differently motivated and display different behaviors at the destination. As they must confront obstacles when travelling, they may be more constrained, leading to different behaviors in terms of satisfaction and loyalty. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the motivations of those with special access needs and those without when traveling to curative shrines, such as Lourdes, France. First, motivations of these two groups will be compared. Second, the effects of motivations on their travel behavior at the destination will be contrasted. The wide scope of visitors&#39; motivations means that destinations must address all market segments, being crucial to ensure accessibility standards, as this affects not only people with disabilities but also seniors and families wi...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Even so, curative shrines can be defined as places where these two types of tourism are especially co-habitual. Behaviour of both religious tourists (Battour, Battor, & Bhatti, 2013; Nolan & Nolan, 1992; Rinschede, 1992) and of people with special access needs (Burnett & Baker, 2001; Figueiredo, Eusebio, & Kastenholz, 2012) has been analysed before. However, the behaviour of visitors with special access needs in religious sites has not been analysed yet. This study aims at exploring whether there are differences in motivations and perceived value of tourists with special access needs and those without at these destinations. Findings suggest: (1) there is significant difference in the perception of religious sites and hospitality services between the two groups of the sample; (2) the dimensions of the perceived value are structured differently; (3) there are significant differences in motivations, mostly relate...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The confirmatory factor analysis model for multitrait-multimethod data (Werts & Linn, 1970; Andrews, 1984) is used for our analyses. In this study we reanalyse a part of data of another study (Kogovšek et al., 2002) done on a representative sample of the inhabitants of Ljubljana. The traits used in our article are the name interpreters. We consider egocentered network data as hierarchical; therefore a multilevel analysis is required. We use Muthen&#39;s partial maximum likelihood approach, called pseudobalanced solution (Muthen, 1989, 1990, 1994) which produces estimations close to maximum likelihood for large ego sample sizes (Hox & Mass, 2001). Several analyses will be done in order to compare this multilevel analysis to classic methods of analysis such as the ones made in Kogovšek et al. (2002), who...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
