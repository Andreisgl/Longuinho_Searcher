The current chemical method used to treat the ecosystem polluted with diesel is incompetent and expensive for a large-scale treatment. Thus, bioremediation technique seems urgent and requires more attention to solve the existing environmental problems. Biological agents, including microorganisms, carry out the biodegradation process where organic pollutants are mineralized into water, carbon dioxide, and less toxic compounds. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are ubiquitous in the nature and often exploited for their specialty to bioremediate the oil-polluted area. The capability of these bacteria to utilize hydrocarbon compounds as a carbon source is the main reason behind their species exploitation. Recently, microbial remediation by halophilic bacteria has received many positive feedbacks as an efficient pollutant degrader. These halophilic ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersApplied SciencesComparison of Petroleum Hydrocarbons Degradation by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa2018 • Hyunook KimDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Marine Science and EngineeringFrom Surface Water to the Deep Sea: A Review on Factors Affecting the Biodegradation of Spilled Oil in Marine EnvironmentKaye SimilatanOver the past century, the demand for petroleum products has increased rapidly, leading to higher oil extraction, processing and transportation, which result in numerous oil spills in coastal-marine environments. As the spilled oil can negatively affect the coastal-marine ecosystems, its transport and fates captured a significant interest of the scientific community and regulatory agencies. Typically, the environment has natural mechanisms (e.g., photooxidation, biodegradation, evaporation) to weather/degrade and remove the spilled oil from the environment. Among various oil weathering mechanisms, biodegradation by naturally occurring bacterial populations removes a majority of spilled oil, thus the focus on bioremediation has increased significantly. Helping in the marginal recognition of this promising technique for oil-spill degradation, this paper reviews recently published articles that will help broaden the understanding of the factors affecting biodegradation of spilled oil i...Download Free PDFView PDFMDPIA Review on Biotechnological Approaches Applied for Marine Hydrocarbon Spills Remediation2022 • Farzad  RahmatiThis article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BYDownload Free PDFView PDFGenesMetagenomic Insights into the Bacterial Functions of a Diesel-Degrading Consortium for the Rhizoremediation of Diesel-Polluted SoilRocío MillánDiesel is a complex pollutant composed of a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Because of this complexity, diesel bioremediation requires multiple microorganisms, which harbor the catabolic pathways to degrade the mixture. By enrichment cultivation of rhizospheric soil from a diesel-polluted site, we have isolated a bacterial consortium that can grow aerobically with diesel and different alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as the sole carbon and energy source. Microbiome diversity analyses based on 16S rRNA gene showed that the diesel-degrading consortium consists of 76 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and it is dominated by Pseudomonas, Aquabacterium, Chryseobacterium, and Sphingomonadaceae. Changes in microbiome composition were observed when growing on specific hydrocarbons, reflecting that different populations degrade different hydrocarbons. Shotgun metagenome sequence analysis of the consortium growing on diesel has identified redundant genes enco...Download Free PDFView PDFMicroorganismsAssessment of the Degradation Potential and Genomic Insights towards Phenanthrene by Dietzia psychralcaliphila JI1D2021 • Donatella de PascaleExtreme marine environments are potential sources of novel microbial isolations with dynamic metabolic activity. Dietzia psychralcaliphila J1ID was isolated from sediments originated from Deception Island, Antarctica, grown over phenanthrene. This strain was also assessed for its emulsifying activity. In liquid media, Dietzia psychralcaliphila J1ID showed 84.66% degradation of phenanthrene examined with HPLC-PDA. The identification of metabolites by GC-MS combined with its whole genome analysis provided the pathway involved in the degradation process. Whole genome sequencing indicated a genome size of 4,216,480 bp with 3961 annotated genes. The presence of a wide range of monooxygenase and dioxygenase, as well as dehydrogenase catabolic genes provided the genomic basis for the biodegradation. The strain possesses the genetic compartments for a wide range of toxic aromatic compounds, which includes the benABCD and catABC clusters.

This has created a serious environmental issue; therefore, there is a need to find solutions, including application of efficient remediation technologies or improvement of current techniques. Rhizoremediation is a green technology that has received global attention as a cost-effective and possibly efficient remediation technique for PHC-polluted soil. Rhizoremediation refers to the use of plants and their associated microbiota to clean up contaminated soils, where plant roots stimulate soil microbes to mineralize organic contaminants to H2O and CO2. However, this multipartite interaction is complicated because many biotic and abiotic factors can influence microbial processes in the soil, making the efficiency of rhizoremediation unpredictable. This review reports the current knowledge of rhizoremediation approaches that can accelerate ...Download Free PDFView PDFMicroorganismsOil Bioremediation in the Marine Environment of Antarctica: A Review and Bibliometric Keyword Cluster Analysis2021 • Suriana SabriBioremediation of hydrocarbons has received much attention in recent decades, particularly relating to fuel and other oils. While of great relevance globally, there has recently been increasing interest in hydrocarbon bioremediation in the marine environments of Antarctica. To provide an objective assessment of the research interest in this field we used VOSviewer software to analyze publication data obtained from the ScienceDirect database covering the period 1970 to the present, but with a primary focus on the years 2000–2020. A bibliometric analysis of the database allowed identification of the co-occurrence of keywords. There was an increasing trend over time for publications relating to oil bioremediation in maritime Antarctica, including both studies on marine bioremediation and of the metabolic pathways of hydrocarbon degradation. Studies of marine anaerobic degradation remain under-represented compared to those of aerobic degradation. Emerging keywords in recent years includ...Download Free PDFView PDFMoleculesMicrobial Degradation of Hydrocarbons—Basic Principles for Bioremediation: A Review2020 • Andreas LoibnerCrude oil-derived hydrocarbons constitute the largest group of environmental pollutants worldwide. The number of reports concerning their toxicity and emphasizing the ultimate need to remove them from marine and soil environments confirms the unceasing interest of scientists in this field. Among the various techniques used for clean-up actions, bioremediation seems to be the most acceptable and economically justified. Analysis of recent reports regarding unsuccessful bioremediation attempts indicates that there is a need to highlight the fundamental aspects of hydrocarbon microbiology in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, in this review, we would like to elucidate some crucial, but often overlooked, factors. First, the formation of crude oil and abundance of naturally occurring hydrocarbons is presented and compared with bacterial ability to not only survive but also to utilize such compounds as an attractive energy source. Then, the significance of nutrient limitation on biomas...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public HealthA Review and Bibliometric Analysis on Applications of Microbial Degradation of Hydrocarbon Contaminants in Arctic Marine Environment at Metagenomic and Enzymatic LevelsChiew Yen WongThe globe is presently reliant on natural resources, fossil fuels, and crude oil to support the world’s energy requirements. Human exploration for oil resources is always associated with irreversible effects. Primary sources of hydrocarbon pollution are instigated through oil exploration, extraction, and transportation in the Arctic region. To address the state of pollution, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms and processes of the bioremediation of hydrocarbons. The application of various microbial communities originated from the Arctic can provide a better interpretation on the mechanisms of specific microbes in the biodegradation process. The composition of oil and consequences of hydrocarbon pollutants to the various marine environments are also discussed in this paper. An overview of emerging trends on literature or research publications published in the last decade was compiled via bibliometric analysis in relation to the topic of interest, which is the microbial commu...Download Free PDFView PDFAquatic BiosystemsMarine crude-oil biodegradation: a central role for interspecies interactions2012 • G.
