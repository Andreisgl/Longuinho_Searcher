To ensure the quality of the results, we developed a methodology under a social innovation paradigm that enabled the co-creation of the game. The methodology was driven by a series of three workshops, during which we adopted several different gamification strategies to support a Participatory Design (PD) process with the stakeholders, a group of local pre-teen and teen girls at social risk (N = 22). Captured requirements materialized into intermediate prototype evaluations that motivated a progressive refinement of the game.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersDigital Scholarship in the HumanitiesA project review under the focus of ‘complexities’ on the example of exploreAT!eveline wandl-vogtThis article provides insights into dealing with complexities in the Digital Humanities project exploreAT!. By exploring a non-standard language collection for cultural insights, a three-fold approach is presented looking into concrete realizations and solutions of tackling challenges in terms of Open Innovation infrastructure, technology and the topic of choice, food. Methods and processes applied and developed in the project are aimed to serve as examples for future projects with similar data sets.Download Free PDFView PDFInformationEvaluating a Taxonomy of Textual Uncertainty for Collaborative Visualisation in the Digital HumanitiesMichelle DoranThe capture, modelling and visualisation of uncertainty has become a hot topic in many areas of science, such as the digital humanities (DH). Fuelled by critical voices among the DH community, DH scholars are becoming more aware of the intrinsic advantages that incorporating the notion of uncertainty into their workflows may bring. Additionally, the increasing availability of ubiquitous, web-based technologies has given rise to many collaborative tools that aim to support DH scholars in performing remote work alongside distant peers from other parts of the world. In this context, this paper describes two user studies seeking to evaluate a taxonomy of textual uncertainty aimed at enabling remote collaborations on digital humanities (DH) research objects in a digital medium. Our study focuses on the task of free annotation of uncertainty in texts in two different scenarios, seeking to establish the requirements of the underlying data and uncertainty models that would be needed to impl...Download Free PDFView PDFIdentification of Indigenous Knowledge Concepts through Semantic Networks, Spelling Tools and Word Embeddings2020 • eveline wandl-vogtIn order to access indigenous, regional knowledge contained in language corpora, semantic tools and network methods are most typically employed. In this paper we present an approach for the identification of dialectal variations of words, or words that do not pertain to High German, on the example of non-standard language legacy collection questionnaires of the Bavarian Dialects in Austria (DBÖ). Based on selected cultural categories relevant to the wider project context, common words from each of these cultural categories and their lemmas using GermaLemma were identified. Through word embedding models the semantic vicinity of each word was explored, followed by the use of German Wordnet (Germanet) and the Hunspell tool. Whilst none of these tools have a comprehensive coverage of standard German words, they serve as an indication of dialects in specific semantic hierarchies. Methods and tools applied in this study may serve as an example for other similar projects dealing with non-s...Download Free PDFView PDFGI_ForumCreating Meaningful Narratives in Collections of Historical Lexical Dataeveline wandl-vogtDownload Free PDFView PDFACMSingle Mobile Apps to tune online Radio in Spain: iRadioPlay ProjectLuis Miguel Pedrero Esteban, Alberto Pedrero-EstebanTechnological progress and digital evolution leaded by Internet have promoted enormous changes in our societies evolving towards a global, connected and networked society. This state of affairs has influenced media not only in the convergence they have suffered but in the way people consume them. The impact of Internet on reception habits and on audiovisual consumption has imposed new patterns of production, marketing and distribution of contents adjusted to the new devices. Although radio is the medium that mostly converges with Internet, the Spanish industry has still not endorsed applications that give a unified access to its complete offer. This article presents an innovative project that strives to develop a new web app: iRadioPlay. The iRadioPlay project, developed by the University Club of Innovation of the Pontifical University of Salamanca (UPSA), proposes a model susceptible to standardization. The project is focused on two main scopes: the first one contributing to increase the radio audience with mobile devices and, the second one to improve the user's experience with the help of complementary information. This application will provide an informative guide with the contents and programmes that can be listened at every moment. The result is a very useful app that covers a lack in the Spanish Radio consumption which is been consider by the radio industry for its digital consolidation.Download Free PDFView PDFChallenge based Innovation for Humanitarian Purposes : Designing a Web-App to fight Obesity . Results of ThePort _ 20182019 • eveline wandl-vogtexploration space1 @ ACDH-AAS against unite innovators, impact future, act today invited for the first time people with knowledge in the Humanities to join CERN THEPort-Humanitarian Hackathon. It aimed at prototype a modular structure enhancing the analysis and understanding of knowledge systems, connecting food and its different cultures with the SDGs2. During THEPort2018, an interdisciplinary team addressed the Humanitarian challenge of obesity to fill a knowledge gap. Better knowledge about eating behaviour is core to acting properly, supporting behavioural changes. In addition, cultural knowledge and experience may allow to support better decision making processes. The paper showcases the hackathon result: a design study of the OrbEat application, aiming to increase the knowledge about individuals’ eating behaviour and support behavioural change in a sustainable way, against the background of nutritionists’ knowledge, facilitated by neuroscientific insights (EEG). It demonstrate...Download Free PDFView PDFOpening up cultural content in non-standard language data through cross-disciplinary collaboration: insights on methods, process and learnings on the example of exploreAT!2019 • eveline wandl-vogtUnderstanding collaboration between researchers of different disciplines requires an ability to embrace multiple views and perspectives, and communicative efforts. This paper thus provides insights on methods, processes and results of a cooperation in Humanities research supported by semantic technologies with the aim of accessing and opening up cultural knowledge contained in a non-standard language resource. The collaborative undertaking is carried out within a Digital Humanities project and an Open Innovation framework. Metadisciplinary learnings offer insights on factors fostering mutual understanding, knowledge translation and mutual benefits.Download Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality - TEEM '16A spatio-temporal visual analysis tool for historical dictionaries2016 • Eveline Wandl-VogtDownload Free PDFView PDFInformaticsTowards A Taxonomy of Uncertainties: Analysing Sources of Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty on the Example of Non-Standard German Corporaeveline wandl-vogtDifferent types of uncertainties occur in almost all datasets and are an inherent property of data across different academic disciplines, including digital humanities (DH). In this paper, we address, demonstrate and analyse spatio-temporal uncertainties in a non-standard German legacy dataset in a DH context. Although the data collection is primarily a linguistic resource, it contains a wealth of additional, comprehensive information, such as location and temporal detail. The addressed uncertainties have manifested because of a variety of reasons, and partly also because of decades of data transformation processes. We here propose our own taxonomy for capturing and classifying the various uncertainties, and show with numerous examples how the remedying but also re-introduction of uncertainties affects DH practices.Download Free PDFView PDFMagical Realism and Augmented Reality: Designing Apps with Children in a Cultural Institution • Human-centered computing~ HCI theory, concepts and models • Human-centered computing~ User centered designTom  SchofieldDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
