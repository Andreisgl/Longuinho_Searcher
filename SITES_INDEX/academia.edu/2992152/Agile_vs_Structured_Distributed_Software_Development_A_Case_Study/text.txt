The study compares agile (Scrum, XP, etc.) vs. structured (RUP, waterfall) processes to determine if the choice of process impacts: the overall success and economic savings of distributed projects; the importance customers attribute to projects; the motivation of the development teams; and the amount of real-time or asynchronous communication required during project development.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSoftware Process: Improvement and PracticeUsing scrum in a globally distributed project: a case study2008 • Maria PaasivaaraDownload Free PDFView PDFUsing Scrum in Distributed Agile Development: A Multiple Case StudysdnsjqdnNJCN DCDJNDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Systems and SoftwareInvestigating the applicability of Agility assessment surveys: A case study2014 • Lefteris AngelisDownload Free PDFView PDFDistributed Software Development Process, Initiatives and Key Factors: A Systematic Literature ReviewZILLE  SUBHANGeographically Distributed Software Development (GSD) process differs from Collocated Software Development (CSD) process in various technical aspects. It is empirically proven that renowned process improvement initiatives applicable to CSD are not very effective for GSD. The objective of this research is to review the existing literature (both academia and industrial) to identify initiatives and key factors which play key role in the improvement and maturity of a GSD process, to achieve this goal we planned a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following a standard protocol. Three highly respected sources are selected to search for the relevant literature which resulted in a large number of TOIs (Title of Interest). An inter-author custom protocol is outlined and followed to shortlist most relevant articles for review. The data is extracted from this set of finally selected articles. We have performed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracted data to obtain the results. The concluded results identify several initiatives and key factors involved in GSD and answer each research question posed by the SLR.Download Free PDFView PDF2008 IEEE International …Distributed agile development: Using Scrum in a large project2008 • Maria PaasivaaraDownload Free PDFView PDFAgility Across Time and SpaceRoles and Responsibilities in Feature Teams2010 • Jutta Eckstein, Steve Tendon, Jörn KochDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Information Engineering and Electronic BusinessScheme of Global Scrum Management Software2015 • Prof. Dr. Rizwan  QureshiDownload Free PDFView PDFWho are we doing Global Software Development research for?2000 • Ita RichardsonDownload Free PDFView PDFApplying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to Global Software Development with Scrum Project PlanningPlacido PinheiroDistributed Software Development (DSD) projects have become a common reality for many organizations. Scrum is a consolidated Agile methodology and has been increasingly used in a distributed fashion. As distance makes difficult to interact and to cooperate effectively, it is paramount to use methodologies like Scrum that emphasizes communication, reduces coordination and control overhead. Successfully planning and managing the combined use of DSD and Scrum is a complex task and requires carefully planning. Despite the importance and complexity of this type of problem, there seems to be a lack of reports, in the literature, of models that could support managers dealing with such decision context. This paper applies a multi-criteria decision model on the choice of DSD Scrum project plans that have a better chance of success. The model, presented in [1], was developed using cognitive mapping and MACBETH[2]. The application of the model is demonstrated, followed by conclusion and future...Download Free PDFView PDF TOWARDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES ON DISTRIBUTED AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: A THEORY OF PRACTICE PERSPECTIVE Maureen TannerDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
