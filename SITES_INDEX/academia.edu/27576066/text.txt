Recent studies in cellular automata (CA) and the fractal nature of the frequency-area relationship they produce has led some authors to ask whether the power-law frequency-area statistics seen in the CA might also be present in empirical wildfire data. Here, we outline the history of the debate regarding the statistical wildfire frequency-area models suggested by the CA and their confrontation with empirical data. In particular, the extent to which the utility of these approaches is dependent on being placed in the context of self-organized criticality (SOC) is examined. We also consider some of the other heavy-tailed statistical distributions used to describe these data. Taking a broadly ecological perspective we suggest that this debate needs to take more interest in the mechanisms underlying the observed power-law (or other) statistics. From this perspective, future studies utilizing the techniques associated with CA and statistical physics will be better able to contribute to the understanding of ecological processes and systems.Download Free PDFView PDFLandscape EcologySpatial scale invariance of southern Australian forest fires mirrors the scaling behaviour of fire-driving weather events2008 • Pauline GriersonDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological ModellingTime-scaling properties in forest-fire sequences observed in Gargano area (southern Italy2005 • Giuseppe  LasaponaraDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological ModellingScaling properties in forest fire sequences: The human role in the order of nature2007 • Carmen RojoDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological StudiesNative Fire Regimes and Landscape Resilience2010 • Max  Moritz, Paul HessburgDownload Free PDFView PDFApplied Mathematical ModellingDouble power laws, fractals and self-similarity2014 • Carla PintoDownload Free PDFView PDFEarth and Space SciencePower law size distributions in Geoscience revisited2019 • Álvaro GonzálezThe size or energy of diverse structures or phenomena in geoscience appears to follow power law distributions. A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail, and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power law fit and the corresponding exponent and whether a power law tail is improved by a truncated lognormal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated lognormals, although wildfires also may show power law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.Download Free PDFView PDFDiversityEcological Systems as Complex Systems: Challenges for an Emerging Science2010 • Andrew GonzalezDownload Free PDFView PDFWildfire Frequency-Area Statistics and their Ecological and Anthropogenic Drivers2003 • James MillingtonFrequency-area statistics of wildfire regimes in USA and British Columbia, Canada, are examined and suggested to exhibit power-law behaviour across many orders of magnitude. Two parameters are used to compare regimes for anthropogenic and ecological drivers of this behaviour. The frequencies of fires (log alpha) and ratios of large to small fires (beta) are greater for: USA National Parks (NPs) compared to their surrounding areas; Washington state NPs compared to British Columbia NPs; and human-caused fires compared to lightning-caused fires. Recent work on the self-organization and thermodynamics of open systems is presented and related to wildfire occurrence in ecosystems of the USA.Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal fire size distribution: from power law to log-normalEmilio ChuviecoWildland fires are one of the main alleged examples of Self-Organised Criticality (SOC), with simple SOC models resulting in the expectation of a power-law fire size frequency distribution. Here, we test whether fire size distributions systematically follow a power law and analyse their spatial variation for eight distinct areas over the globe. For each of the areas, we examine the fire size frequency distribution using two types of plots, maximum likelihood estimation and chi-square tests. Log-normal emerges as a suitable option to fit the fire size distribution in this variety of environments. In only two of eight areas was the power law (which is a particular case of the log-normal) not rejected. Notably, the two parameters of log-normal are related to each other, displaying a general linear relation, which extends to the sites that can be described with a power law. These results do not necessarily refute the SOC hypothesis, but reveal the presence of other processes that are, at least, modulating the outcome of SOC in some areas.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
