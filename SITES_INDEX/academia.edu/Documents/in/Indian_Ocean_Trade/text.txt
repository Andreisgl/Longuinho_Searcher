Our archaeological investigations in Mayotte allowed us to understand the raison d’être of an early Islamic site in the western Indian Ocean. Dembeni was occupied between the ninth to the twelfth century, a period of intensive trad, first with the Abbasid caliphate in Iraq/Iran, then with the Fatimid caliphate in Egypt. Dembeni appears to be a major distribution centre for rock crystal in the Indian Ocean. The fragments of rock crystal discovered in Mayotte were imported from Madagascar. The rock crystal was exported from Madagascar to the Comoros together with other products, notably steatite (soapstone).An important outcome of our research was to put the Comoros and Madagascar in the “big picture” of East African trade, as rock crystal was a much-valued product. This “Eastern” or Malagasy road could serve as an explanation for the urbanization of Kilwa, the biggest and most well-known city-state of the East African coast. The city state of Kilwa has always been interpreted in relation to the gold trade with Sofala and the gold mines in Zimbabwe. But Kilwa is also located at a major crossroads between the East African coast and the Comoros. I would argue that the development and urbanization of Kilwa was due to this key position at the crossroads, between gold and rock crystal mines, the two most valued products of the Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephane Pradines•  11  Islamic Archaeology, African History, Indian Ocean History, Islamic ArtPortugal in the Sea of Oman: Religion and Politics.

The presence of the powerful Ming navy not only introduced an unprecedented militaristic aspect to the Indian Ocean region, but also led to the emergence of state-directed commercial activity in the maritime world that extended from Ming China to the Swahili coast of Africa. Additionally, these expeditions stimulated the movement of people and animals across the oceanic space and might eventually have facilitated the rapid entry of European commercial enterprises into the Indian Ocean region during the second half of the fifteenth century.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tansen Sen•  7  Chinese Studies, Asian History, Indian Ocean History, Ming DynastyDocuments on Western Burmese Economic History, edited by Michael W.

Island economies, in particular, have protracted recoveries from disasters due to their location, size, and economic dependence on trading partners. As imports and exports are especially explicit and discernible in ports, islands facilitate investigations on the long-term effects of disaster relief, reconstruction, and redevelopment on trade. In this paper, we examine the transformational impact of the 2004 Indian ocean earthquake and tsunami. We examine changes to physical imports and exports in the archipelago to reflect on the social, economic, and ecological impacts of the 2004 disaster and subsequent recovery. We analyse disaggregated physical import and export data for 2003–2017 from revenue ports in the Nicobar Islands in India along with data from field surveys and interviews conducted on the islands.

While scholars have long recognized the importance of pearling to the social, cultural, and economic practices of both coastal and inland areas, the overwhelming majority have confined themselves to highly localized or at best regional studies of the pearl trade. By contrast, this book stresses how pearling and the exchange in pearl shell were interconnected processes that brought the ports, islands, and coasts into close relation with one another, creating dense networks of connectivity that were not necessarily circumscribed by local, regional, or indeed national frames.Essays from a variety of disciplines address the role of slaves and indentured workers in maritime labor arrangements, systems of bondage and transoceanic migration, the impact of European imperialism on regional and local communities, commodity flows and networks of exchange, and patterns of marine resource exploitation between the Industrial Revolution and Great Depression. By encompassing the geographical, cultural, and thematic diversity of Indian Ocean pearling, Pearls, People, and Power deepens our appreciation of the underlying historical dynamics of the many worlds of the Indian Ocean.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pedro  Machado•  10  Indian Ocean History, History of the Western Indian Ocean XV-XIX Century, Indian Ocean (British Empire), Indian Ocean WorldBreaking through the Boundaries: An Investigation into the Chronological and Geographical Distribution of two South Asian CeramicsSave to Libraryby Jo Shoebridge•  7  Pottery (Archaeology), South Asian Archaeology, Southeast Asian Archaeology, Ceramics (Archaeology)Banbhore, a Major Trade Centre on the Indus' Delta.

Written in a variety of Jewish languages, these sources hail from places across the Afro-Eurasian geographical continuum and speak to the two well-known circuits of medieval trans-Asian trade: the Silk Road and its maritime Indian Ocean equivalent. While there has been a tendency to look at medieval Jewish sources scattered across Asia as vestiges of a unified trading diaspora, a consideration of these sources’ volume, chronology, and the circumstances of their production and use reveals several disjunctures and suggests a more fractured history of Jewish participation in Asia trade. Even so a survey of these sources illuminates a variety of topics that relate to Jewish mercantile activity along well-trodden avenues of exchange, transactions and relationships across confessional lines, and the structures and institutions of transregional commerce.Save to Libraryby Roxani Eleni Margariti•  5  Jewish History, Indian Ocean Trade, Cairo Genizah, Medieval Economic and Social HistoryZheng He's voyages to Hormuz: the archaeological evidenceThe imperially sponsored maritime expeditions led by Zheng He in the early fifteenth century AD projected Ming Chinese power as far as Java, Sri Lanka and the East African coast.

The Indian Ocean voyages are well documented in Chinese and Islamic historical accounts and by the nautical charts of Zheng He's journeys. Less clear has been the exact location of ancient Hormuz, the destination of Zheng He's voyages in the Persian Gulf. Recent re-analysis of ceramics from coastal southern Iran provides a solution. Archaeological evidence for Ming ceramics on present-day Hormuz Island and jewellery and gemstones of Iranian origin in southern China suggest that ancient Hormuz and Hormuz Island are one and the same.Save to LibraryDownloadby LIN Meicun•  5  Maritime Archaeology, Ming Dynasty, Indian Ocean Trade, Persian Gulf archeologyAbraham's Luggage.

Previewed on Google Books too. From a single merchant's list of baggage begins a history that explores the dynamic world of medieval Indian Ocean exchanges. This fresh and innovative perspective on Jewish merchant activity shows how this list was a component of broader trade connections that developed between the Islamic Mediterranean and South Asia in the Middle Ages. Drawing on a close reading of this unique twelfth-century document, found in the Cairo Genizah and written in India by North African merchant Abraham Ben Yiju, Lambourn focuses on the domestic material culture and foods that structured the daily life of such India traders, on land and at sea. This is an exploration of the motivations and difficulties of maintaining homes away from home, and the compromises that inevitably ensued. Abraham's Luggage demonstrates the potential for writing challenging new histories in the accidental survival of apparently ordinary ephemera.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth  Lambourn•  13  Jewish Studies, Medieval History, Foodways (Anthropology), Medieval Studies" Godavaya: The Oldest Shipwreck in the Indian Ocean"This power-point presentation is based on the two following article in the Academia.edu: O.

However, it is only the sixteenth largest exporter, in terms of value with its exports accounting for around USD 336.6 billion. In contrast, India is the 12th largest importer demanding USD 477.3 billion as of 2013. Although it is claimed that the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1991 has greatly transformed the economy by removing many trade barriers and de-licensing of the industrial sector, its value or trade flow has remained very ordinary for a country with a population of 1.26 billion (Census, 2011).India witnesses much lesser trade flow by value not only when compared with the bigger economies such as the United States of America and China, but also far lesser than smaller economies such as a Singapore and the Netherlands (Table-1).In order to understand India’s current limitations and identify untapped opportunities this article tries to answer questions such as:What are India’s main trade partners and current trade balance?How is India in terms of current trade patterns compared with the rest of the world?How are trade policies formulated in India? How consistent are these policies with international trading requirements and practices?What are the import procedures? What are the different costs borne by importers due to these policies and procedures? Are there specific imports for which these costs are unreasonable high? What are these costs in quantitative terms? How trade distortive are these costs?This study attempts to suggest that import tariffs have to be lessened on the one hand and more importantly import procedures have to be reduced on the other so as to create an atmosphere of competition in policy action.Save to LibraryDownloadby Centre for Public Policy Research•  21  Economics, International Relations, International Trade, Indian studiesCinnamon, Cassia, and Ancient TradeThere is a widespread assumption that ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as the spices now known by those names.

It is argued here that this is not the case, but that the “cinnamon” and “cassia” of ancient writers very probably came from plants native to northeast Africa, as several early writers actually state. Their principal source is identified as Cassia abbreviata. It is also argued that alleged identifications of cinnamon or cassia at archaeological sites in the Mediterranean region are questionable. Cinnamon and cassia did not figure in Southeast Asian and Chinese trade at an early period. There is no good reason to believe that these products were traded to the western Indian Ocean and beyond at any very early date.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephen G.

The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) is currently the major organisation that seeks to promote cooperation within the region, including economic, political and security dimensions. This article examines regional cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region within the framework of the IORA, exploring the association’s historical development and cooperation model (structure and institutions) to deduce whether cooperation is driven by geography (location), or by ideology (non-location). The article further explores whether the IORA’s cooperative framework offers lessons that can be replicated in other regional cooperation contexts.

The artefact is a very rare and highly significant find in East Africa, with only one other example being found previously (also at the same site), and likely represents early contact between coastal East Africa and the Indian Ocean world. Chemical analysis of the residue adhering to this artefact was undertaken to confirm its use to burn incense, and to determine whether the resin used was local or exotic to East Africa and thus likely acquired through long-distance trade. The residue extract was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and identified as Zanzibar copal (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.), a local species that rose to major importance in colonial period trade. The results obtained from this study provide the first direct archaeological evidence for the ancient use of this East African species as an aromatic, suggesting that it might have had a much earlier role in long-distance incense trade than previously demonstrated. This finding also provides insights into local East African engagement with the material culture of the Indian Ocean world.Save to LibraryDownloadby Margaret-Ashley Veall and +2Ania  Kotarba-MorleyThomas R Fenn•  26  Islamic Archaeology, Bioarchaeology, East Africa, Coastal and Island ArchaeologyA.C.

Operating throughout the Indian Ocean and in articulation with the inland African trade routes by way of the coastal settlements from Bazaruto up to the north of Mozambique, this network bustled luxury goods and basic goods benefiting either from a network of inter-personal relationships and kinship that supported the whole business, or from an ancestral knowledge on the techniques and particular procedures indispensable to navigating in the Indian Ocean. This trade made the prosperity of small southern ports, like Sofala or Mozambique long before the Portuguese arrival. However, this trade was so much dependent on the network's capacity of organisation and the supply demand relation of the goods involved, as well as on other factors such as the political stability of the African kingdoms, the environmental changes that shaped flows and trade routes or the actual knowledge of the region and of the different forms of organization of local communities. By focusing in the ports of Sofala and Mozambique and the information provided by the Portuguese documents we intend to analyse its evolution during the 16th century in order to understand its role in the Indian Ocean commercial network under Portuguese rule.Save to LibraryDownloadby ana roque•  3  History of the Portuguese Empire, Indian Ocean Trade, Ports‘Ali Akbar’s red horse – collecting Arab horses in the early modern culture of Empire.The Islamicate world has barely featured thus far in the new academic study of collecting, collectors and collections, certainly nowhere in proportion to its vast geographical and temporal extent.

The second part of this chapter addresses the place of the horse in collections as an animate ‘collectable.' The study of a particular 'red' horse supplied by ‘Ali Akbar to Shah Jahan queries and disrupts some of Asian art’s more established taxonomies and argues for a less object-centric, more holistic view of what was collected, by whom, how and why, in early modern Eurasia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth  Lambourn•  8  Animal Studies, Mughal History, Collecting and Collections, Indian Ocean WorldAUSTRALIA'S ROADMAP FOR BLUE ECONOMY SCIENCE FOR THE NEXT DECADEIn August 2015, Australia adopted a comprehensive roadmap for the development of its blue economy for the decade up until 2025.

This study examines that role in the period between 1200 and 1500 CE,  ending almost a century before the first appearance in India of New World silver.The Indian demand for monetary commodities was shaped by the internal logic and dynamics of each of the sub-continent’s multiple monetary systems, all oriented towards domestic concerns, with considerable  variation. Silver was by far the dominant precious metal in the north of India and the Deccan. Gold was mined in southern India, although the level of demand could not be met locally and gold was frequently imported. Copper was in great demand, being the basis of low-value coinage in the Delhi, Gujarat and Bahmanid Sultanates. In contrast, in Bengal there was no demand at all for copper for monetary purposes prior to 1538 because cowries served that function.The dual demand for silver and copper especially, set the pattern for the succeeding “early modern” period, when Indian coinage systems developed a voracious appetite for both metals.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Deyell•  7  Indian Ocean History, Indian Ocean World, Indian Ocean Trade, Indian HistoryColonial Archaeology in South Asia; The Legacy of Sir Mortimer WheelerThis book discusses the practice and institutionalization of the discipline of archaeology under British rule and its current manifestations.

Using Sir Mortimer Wheeler’s tenure as the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India (1944–48), it assesses the extent to which colonial intervention shaped the nascent discipline in South Asia. The study investigates two important areas generally neglected in most histories of archaeology of the subcontinent—conservation practices and the display of archaeological artefacts in museums. It also examines topical questions like the government control of academic disciplines like archaeology and the role of the discipline in the postcolonial period. Ray also provides an overview of the major events and debates that emerged in the archaeology of the subcontinent leading up to the 1940s. She discusses the contemporary academic scenario, Wheeler’s Indian contemporaries, his contributions to the study of the subject, and his agenda for the Archaeological Survey of India. In doing so, she highlights how his work and methodology continue to dominate the study of archaeology in the postcolonial period as well. The author draws on a wide range of source material, some being used for the first time—the archives of Archaeological Survey of India and Mortimer Wheeler’s private papers— to present the changing paradigms within which the past has been studied.

Escale essentielle pour les navires, où se croisaient marchands et produits les plus recherchés, relais majeur de la propagation de l’islam dans l’aire indoocéanique, Aden fut la pièce maîtresse d’une politique de vaste ampleur, menée avec obstination par les sultans rasulides du Yémen. Fondée en 1229, la dynastie rasulide imposa en effet jusqu’en 1454 son autorité et son hégémonie sur l’ensemble du Sud de la péninsule Arabique. Dominant la mer Rouge, craint et respecté par les tribus de l’Arabie et les puissances riveraines de l’océan Indien, l’État rasūlide eut une longévité remarquable en construisant pour partie sa réussite sur l’ouverture de l’Arabie au grand commerce : des rivages d’Aden aux citadelles du Yémen, des portes de La Mekke aux marchés d’Alexandrie, des routes de l’Abyssinie aux vaisseaux de l’Inde. L’histoire du grand commerce oriental et celle du Yémen médiéval ont été longtemps écrites l’une sans l’autre, l’étude d’Éric Vallet permet enfin de les confronter. Abondamment nourrie par des sources originales – archives administratives et fiscales rasulides récemment découvertes – , et des corpus peu connus – l’historiographie du Yémen et de La Mekke – , cette somme érudite met en lumière les ambitions et les conflits qui animèrent l’un des coeurs de l’économie mondiale à la fin du Moyen Âge.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eric Vallet•  6  Islamic History, Indian Ocean World, Mamluks (Islamic History), Ayyubids (Islamic History)Why did slave trading intensify in nineteenth century east Africa, and with what consequences for the region's societies?Save to LibraryDownloadby Cosmo Rana-Iozzi•  77  History, Modern History, African Studies, Colonialism (History)VOC-ship Avondster, The Anglo-Dutch East-Indiaman that was wrecked twice in Ceylon.Sri Lanka is strategically located between Arabia and East Asia, at a natural crossroads of navigational routes and has been a centre of trade and cultural exchange since ancient times.

With Sri Lanka’s significant seafaring history, and the archaeological riches of its land sites, there can be no doubt that study of the underwater sites will reveal a fascinating history.Underwater surveys carried out in Galle Harbour since 1992 have revealed 26 archaeological sites dating from the 13th century, through the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, to modern times. This history is also reflected in the material remains found on the harbour and artefacts excavated date from the 13th century to 21st century. Several stone anchors of Indo-Arabian pattern have been discovered, including one from the Arabian Peninsula weighing almost a tonne, and an anchor of Mediterranean pattern (Souter, 1998). A celadon bowl of the Southern Song dynasty (13th century) is one of the few relics of early trade with China; while the later 17th century blue-and-white Chinese trade ware is abundant. While Sri Lankan archaeology is rich in cultural treasures from much earlier periods, it is the combination of several United Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or VOC) wrecks and the VOC’s extensive historical archives that make Galle Harbour so interesting. This combination of archaeological and historical resources provides a unique opportunity to explore Sri Lanka’s role in international trade, and to examine the political and cultural affects of this trade.In 2001 a Maritime Archaeology Unit (MAU) was formed under the Mutual Heritage Centre and managed by the Central Cultural Fund, a Sri Lankan Government agency. The MAU’s first major project was the excavation of the Avondster, one of five Dutch East Indiamen wreckedThe Avondster Project had a number of aims in addition to the survey, excavation and conservation of the site and artefacts. One of the primary goals was to build the capacity of the MAU’s Sri Lankan archaeologists and conservators, and associated infrastructure for the continuation of a permanent maritime archaeology program in Sri Lanka. Another important goal was the development of a maritime museum, to showcase Sri Lanka’s broad maritime history, its sites and the people involved; with the initial displays based on the material recovered and research undertaken during the Avondster Project.Save to LibraryDownloadby Robert Parthesius•  18  Maritime Archaeology, Cultural Heritage, Maritime History, Community Engagement & ParticipationDie verlorengegangenen Schiffe der Niederländischen Ostindienkompanie (VOC) This work overviews complete lists and cartographic as well as statistical analysis of the lost ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) during 17th and 18th century.

Justly famous for offering a contemporary and descriptive account of early Indian Ocean trade, the work has been sub- ject to and a point of departure for numerous studies. Its extensive influence on scholarship is, however, also problematic, as it reflects the limited infor- mation and cultural and personal bias of its unknown author. Arguably this might have led scholars to overemphasise so-called western or Roman par- ticipation in early Indian Ocean trade. Network analysis allows us to map, visualize and measure interconnectedness in the Periplus Maris Erythraei. Many of these connections are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but by connecting not only places with places, but also products with places that export and import them, we get a partly different impression of Indian Ocean trade from that conventionally gathered from the Periplus. It allows us to ask questions about the relationship between coastal cabotage and transoceanic shipping, to identify regional trading circuits, and unexpected centres of long-distance exchange.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eivind Heldaas Seland•  6  Indian Ocean History, Indian Ocean World, Indian Ocean Trade, Historical Network ResearchNextLast »Related TopicsIndian Ocean HistoryFollowFollowingIndian Ocean WorldFollowFollowingIndian Ocean ArchaeologyFollowFollowingIndo-Roman TradeFollowFollowingHistory of the Western Indian Ocean XV-XIX CenturyFollowFollowingSouth Asian ArchaeologyFollowFollowingArabian/Persian Gulf ArchaeologyFollowFollowingRed SeaFollowFollowingIslamic ArchaeologyFollowFollowingIndian OceanFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
