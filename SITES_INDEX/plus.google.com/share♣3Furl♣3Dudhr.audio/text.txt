While this process of deleting consumer content will take a few months and some content may remain visible during this time, you should take action before April to ensure you don’t lose any content you want to save.Many different people use Google+, from everyday consumer users to developers to teams in business settings. Because of this, we want to provide the details you need to navigate this change. Below is more information and recommended actions.For Google+ consumer usersStarting April 2, 2019, we will shut down your Google+ account and any pages you created, and we'll begin deleting content from consumer Google+ accounts. Photos and videos from Google+ in your Album Archive and your Google+ pages will also be deleted. If you have Google+ content that you would like to save, you must do so before April 2nd.To get started, please reference these Google+ account download instructions, which explain how to download and save your content.

You can read more details in this blog post. This means that for those of you who use Google+ as part of G Suite, your accounts will remain active. G Suite users include businesses who pay for its services and educational institutions and other organizations that use G Suite at no cost.If you’re not sure if your organization uses G Suite, you can check here.

We recommend that developers migrate to alternative APIs such as Google Sign-in and Google People API. However, for cases where developers are unable to move over before March 7th, we have created a new implementation of some Google+ APIs critical to sign-in only. The new implementation will only return basic fields necessary for sign-in functionality such as name and email address, if authorized by the user. More details here.We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Google+ users who’ve built their communities with us over the years. We appreciate what you’ve created and your contributions. Look out for more enterprise-specific Google+ details later this year.Posted inProduct AnnouncementsRelated articlesProduct AnnouncementsNow Available: Duet AI for Google WorkspaceBy Aparna Pappu • 5-minute readProduct AnnouncementsWelcome to the new Google ChatBy Vamsee Jasti • 4-minute readProduct AnnouncementsExpanding Google AI in Workspace with new zero trust and digital sovereignty controlsBy Yulie Kwon Kim • 5-minute readEventsGoogle Cloud Next 2023: Workspace Spotlight and 5 sessions not to missBy The Google Workspace Team  • 2-minute readFooter LinksFollow usIncluded applicationsIncluded applicationsGmailMeetChatCalendarDriveDocsSheetsSlidesFormsSitesKeepApps ScriptSecurity and managementSecurity and managementAdminEndpointVaultWork InsightsSolutionsSolutionsNew BusinessSmall BusinessEnterpriseRetailManufacturingProfessional ServicesTechnologyHealthcareGovernmentEducationNonprofitsArtificial IntelligencePricingPricingCompare pricing plansAdd-onsAdd-onsMeet hardwareGoogle VoiceAppSheetResourcesResourcesWorking remotelySecurityCustomer StoriesFAQsPartnersMarketplaceIntegrationsTraining & CertificationRefer Google WorkspaceLearning and supportLearning and supportAdmin HelpSetup and Deployment CenterLearning Center for UsersForums for AdminsGoogle Workspace DashboardWhat's New in Google WorkspaceFind a Google Workspace PartnerJoin the community of IT AdminsPressMore from GoogleMore from GoogleGoogle CloudGoogle DomainsChrome EnterpriseGoogle Business SolutionsGoogle AdsBusiness MessagesJoin User StudiesAbout GoogleGoogle ProductsPrivacyTermsLanguage‪English‬‪Deutsch‬‪Français‬‪한국어‬‪日本語‬
