Various novel drug delivery approaches have been used as a part of life cycle management from which Osmotic drug delivery systems look the most promising one. After discussing the history of osmotic pump development, this article looks at the principles, advantages and disadvantages of osmotic drug delivery systems. Then, the basic components of osmotic pump and factors affecting the design of oral osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed in detail. In the later part of the manuscript, various types of osmotic pumps available in the market and evaluation methods for osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed in detail.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersA Review on Osmotically Controlled Oral Drug Delivery Systems2012 • Nishith  PatelIn the pharmaceutical research and development the novel drug delivery system (NDDS) plays remarkable performance. A milestone in oral NDDS is innovative and highly versatile drug delivery system. ODDS use the principle of osmotic pressure, as an energy source, for the delivery of drugs. Oral osmotic drug delivery systems with their versatile and their highly predictable drug release rates offer various biomedical advantages. Osmosis is one type of aristocrat phenomenon that seizes the attention for its exploitation in zero-order drug delivery systems. The drug delivered from these systems is not reliable of pH and the physiological conditions. Optimizing semipermeable membrane and the osmotic agents can modulate drug release from the system. In this article, a detailed description of various oral osmotically driven systems along with their formulation aspects, therapeutic applications and evaluation techniques are described.Download Free PDFView PDFOsmotically controlled oral drug delivery systems: an update review]2008 • kiran dudhatDownload Free PDFView PDFA Comprehensive Review On Osmotically Controlled Oral Drug Delivery System2020 • Savita DeokarOral route is one of the most extensively used routes for drug administration for several advantages. In conventional oral drug delivery system, the release rate of drug cannot be controlled and effective concentration at the target site achieved is low. Bioavailability of drugs from the oral drug delivery may vary significantly, depending on factors such as physicochemical properties of the drug, presence of excipients, various physiological factors such as the presence or absence of food, pH of GIT, GI motility. OROS is an advanced drug delivery system that uses osmotic pressure as a driving force to deliver drug in a controlled manner for a longer period of time. In this review article, historical aspects related to osmotic pump, various types of osmotically controlled pumps like EOP, PPOS, CPOP, etc. have been studied.

Osmotic devices which are tablets coated with walls of controlled porosity are the most promising strategy based systems for controlled drug delivery. In contrast to common tablets, these pumps provide constant (zero order) drug release rate. When these systems are exposed to water, low levels of water soluble additive is leached from polymeric material i.e. semipermeable membrane and drug releases in a controlled manner over an extended period of time. The main clinical benefits of oral osmotic drug delivery system are their ability to improve treatment tolerability and patient compliance. These advantages are mainly driven by the capacity to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, independent of the drug chemical properties, of the patient’s physiological factors or following food intake. This review brings out the theoretical concept of drug delivery, history, advantages and disadvantages of the delivery systems, types of oral osmotic drug delivery systems, factors affecting the drug delivery system and marketed products.Download Free PDFView PDFOSMOTIC PUMP DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM: A NOVAL APPROACHJillian ChangDownload Free PDFView PDFOsmotic Controlled Drug Delivery Systems: An OverviewAjit JadhavOsmotic controlled drug delivery systems utilize the principles of osmotic pressure for the controlled delivery of active agent. The delivery rate of zero-order is achievable with these systems. The release rate from these systems is highly predictable and can be programmed by modulating the release control parameters. The drug release from these systems is independent of gastric pH and hydrodynamic conditions. A high degree of in vivo-in vitro correlation (IVIVC) is obtained with osmotically controlled drug delivery systems. In this review various types of osmotic systems, basic components, patent literature and commercially marketed osmotic drug delivery systems are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFOsmotically Controlled Drug Delivery System with Associated Drugshồ hồng ngọcConventional drug delivery systems have slight control over their drug release and almost no control over the effective concentration at the target site. This kind of dosing pattern may result in constantly changing, unpredictable plasma concentrations. Drugs can be delivered in a controlled pattern over a long period of time by the controlled or modified release drug delivery systems. They include dosage forms for oral and transdermal administration as well as injectable and implantable systems. For most of drugs, oral route remains as the most acceptable route of administration. Certain molecules may have low oral bioavailability because of solubility or permeability limitations. Development of an extended release dosage form also requires reasonable absorption throughout the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Among the available techniques to improve the bioavailability of these drugs fabrication of osmotic drug delivery system is the most appropriate one. Osmotic drug delivery systems release the drug with the zero order kinetics which does not depend on the initial concentration and the physiological factors of GIT. This review brings out new technologies, fabrication and recent clinical research in osmotic drug delivery. __________________________________________________________________________________________Download Free PDFView PDFA Review on Novel Osmotically Controlled Drug Delivery SystemP. Dinesh KumarConventional drug delivery systems are known to provide an immediate release of drug, in which one can not control the release of the drug and can not maintain effective concentration at the target site forlonger time. Osmotically controlled drug delivery systems (OCDDS) are most promising systems for controlleddrug delivery. Osmotically controlled drug delivery systems utilize osmotic pressure for controlled delivery ofactive agents. Various patents are available for osmotic drug delivery system like Rose and Nelson pump,Higuchi Leeper pump, Higuchi Theeuwes pump, Elementary osmotic pump etc. Various techniques available for preparation of OCDDS include push pull osmotic pump, Osmotic bursting osmotic pump, Liquid OROS,Telescopic capsule for delayed release, OROS-CT (colon targeting), and Sandwiched osmotic tablet system.These systems can be used for systemic as well as targeted delivery of drugs.
