PRESS STATEMENT: Malaysia a secular State
18 Jul 2007 7:19 pm
•
Groups: We are 
secular
• MCA: We are a 
secular nation
The statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister in 
this 50th year of Merdeka that Malaysia has never been a secular state is 
startling as it ignores the undisputed constitutional history of the country as 
well as the social contract by which the multi–racial and multi–religious people 
of this nation came together.
The Federal Constitution was a carefully thought out, 
carefully negotiated document that evolved after much debate and discussion. 
Some historical context is necessary. In 1956, Tunku Abdul Rahman had headed a 
Merdeka Mission to London to negotiate for independence. The negotiations were 
conducted by 4 representatives of the Malay Rulers, 4 representatives of the 
then Alliance Government and representatives of the British Government. The Reid 
Commission was then appointed to draft a constitution for independent Malaya. 
The Reid Commission held 118 meetings in Malaya. It met a wide cross–section of 
people and organisations and received 131 memoranda.One of the striking features of the Reid Commission report 
and the Federal Constitution is the inter–communal compromises. These 
compromises were essentially the result of proposals set out in a memorandum by 
the then Alliance party which had in turn been vigorously debated over many 
months by a core group from UMNO, MCA, and MIC under Tunku’s chairmanship. The 
Alliance Memorandum referred to the issue of religion as follows:
“The religion of Malaya shall be Islam. The observance of 
this principle shall not impose any disability on non–Muslim nationals 
professing and practising their own religion, and shall not imply that the State 
is not a secular State.” (Emphasis added)
Subsequent to the issuance of the Reid Report, further reviews were carried out 
by a Working Party that again consisted of representatives from the Malay 
rulers, the Alliance party and the British Government. The Alliance party set up 
its own sub–committee chaired by its then deputy president, Datuk Abdul Razak. 
Again the Alliance maintained its position that they had no intention of 
creating a Muslim theocracy and that Malaya would be a secular State. A white 
paper subsequently issued by the British Government in June 1957 confirmed this 
by stating “This will in no way affect the present position of the Federation as 
a secular State”.
Since then Tunku himself, respected Academics, and our own Supreme Court in 1988 
have reiterated in one way or another that we are a secular State and not an 
Islamic State. Thus for more than 40 years (until 2001), no–one had suggested 
that Malaysia is an Islamic State.
One has to only look at the Articles in the Federal Constitution, our system of 
government and the administration of justice to know that we are not an Islamic 
State. The Civil Courts set up under the Constitution dispense secular justice 
on a daily basis to all the citizens of this country. Secular law governs 
contracts, commerce, international relations and trade and every aspect of the 
lives of a citizen. Islamic law governs specific matters set out in the Federal 
Constitution in relation to persons professing Islam. 
In the context of our history and the Constitution itself that proclaims its 
supremacy, it is the Bar Council’s view that there is no doubt whatsoever that 
Malaysia is a secular state and not an Islamic state. It is noteworthy that the 
Prime Minister in his speech delivered at the conference yesterday and in his 
propagating Islam Hadhari has never referred to Malaysia as an Islamic State.
It is time that the proposition that Malaysia is not secular, 
(which is a rewriting of the Constitution), be put to rest once and for all and 
that there is due recognition and reaffirmation of the clear legal and 
constitutional position that Malaysia is, and has always been, a secular State.
