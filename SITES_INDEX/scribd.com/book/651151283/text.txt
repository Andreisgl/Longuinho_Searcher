It requires leading, advocating, fighting, and organizing wherever it is required--in the streets, slums, villages, inner cities, halls of political power, and more. But what does social justice work look like for those of us who don't feel comfortable battling in the trenches? Introverts--including those who consider themselves sensitive, empathic, or quiet--have much to contribute to bringing about a more just and equitable world. Such individuals are wise, thoughtful, and conscientious; they feel more deeply and see things that others don't. We need their contributions. Yet, sustaining justice work can be particularly challenging for the sensitive, and it requires a deep level of self-awareness, intentionality, and care. In Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul, writer Dorcas Cheng-Tozun (Enneagram 4, INFJ, nonprofit/social enterprise professional, and multiple-burnout survivor) expands the possibilities of how to have a positive social impact, affirming the particular gifts and talents that sensitive souls offer to a hurting world. Alongside inspiring, real-life examples of highly sensitive world-changers--including creatives and administrators, engineers and academics in the US and around the world--Cheng-Tozun explores pathways where our quieter, but equally passionate, collaborators for social good can serve and thrive.

Turns out, Sarah has been practicing tarot for decades, and rather than seeing the Suit of Swords as being about conflict, she sees it as being about truth and realization. In this episode we have a lively discussion about how the suit of swords works; how people in positions of power (like some police officers and "President" Tr**p) like to see themselves as victims even when they're being abusive and why that is; and how the Suit of Swords calls us to take an honest look at ourselves and our communities.

Cheng-Tozun proposes a quieter, but no less impactful, approach: her gentle guidance urges us to get curious about finding our way to quiet activism, allowing us all to join in the march toward making the world a brighter place. A soulful book. —Karen Walrond, author of The Lightmaker’s Manifesto and Radiant Rebellion I wish this book existed earlier in my career, as it would’ve saved me so much struggle and stress! I’m so grateful for Dorcas Cheng-Tozun’s voice, and her boldness in sharing her struggles and wisdom with us so that we know we’re not alone as sensitive souls. We can make a unique difference in the world! The reflection questions after each chapter are also incredible and powerful journaling prompts that make this book priceless as a guide on our journeys. —Grace Chiang Nicolette, vice president of Programming and External Relations, Center for Effective Philanthropy "If you identify as an introvert, highly sensitive person, or empath you need Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul by Dorcas Cheng-Tozun to learn how to best bring your strengths, talents, and sense of purpose to social justice causes that are near and dear to your heart." —Christine Rose Elle, author of The Happy Empath and Daily Affirmations for Women Upon simply reading the title, my soul sighed with relief. As I read these pages, I felt seen! I felt known! I felt celebrated! Dorcas Cheng-Tozun’s words flow like the Holy Spirit whispering affirmation, encouragement, and appreciation for our intentional design—our quiet, potent strength, informed by prophetic foresight, as we reach for what is possible. She fosters freedom for the sensitive soul to just be and allow Spirit to create in and through us. This book is an important read as we learn to recognize and make room for the diversity of contributions that actually sustain justice work. —Lucretia Carter Berry, PhD, president, Brownicity.com "Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul is the first book I have read that fully embraces what so many of us who are Sensitives feel: a need to serve the greater good of humanity but to do so in ways that avoid burnout, compassion-fatigue, and apathy. Dorcas Cheng-Tozun gifts Sensitives with an incredible framework to understand and practice advocacy and activism on scales that reflect personal authenticity, sustainability, and optimal use of our time and energy while creatively and effectively contributing our often-prodigious empathy, conscientiousness, and heart-centered leadership." —Tracy Cooper, PhD, author of Thrive: The Highly Sensitive Person and Career "Writing with empathy and winsome honesty on this timely topic, Cheng-Tozun offers key insights relevant for all social changemakers. Her lived experience as a sensitive activist—along with the vivid stories of many others—provides a hopeful path forward for those who want to engage sustainably and authentically in the work of justice." —Jody Chang, Chief Operating and Portfolio Officer, Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund "The work of justice is hard. Moving the needle on lasting social change requires a deep dive into who we are, where we are from, our values, and an understanding of the gifts we each bring to the world. Those gifted with sensitivity have incredible insights others do not, naturally set apart from the status quo of ego-centered engagements. Their heart-centered connection to people and places is what this present moment is desperately calling for. In Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul, writer Dorcas Cheng-Tozun takes you on an affirming journey of self-discovery and contemplative reflection on each person’s unique place in pursuing change to create a world in which all can thrive." —Byron Chung, executive director, Ignite Institute at the Pacific School of Religion "This book is a thorough, inspiring, and empowering exploration of the topic of highly sensitive people and social justice activism. The author writes from a basis of well-grounded and informed understanding of what high sensitivity and social justice activism are, honoring the important gift of activism that HSPs in particular bring to the world—especially when they do it their own way." —Barbara Allen, founder, Growing Unlimited As an introverted and highly sensitive activist, I’ve struggled to find ways to be an effective campaigner using my talents without burning out. This is the first social change book I’ve read where I felt understood, valued, and supported. I’m so glad this book exists for us gentle protesters around the world! A thoughtful, poignant, and empowering book shining a spotlight on world-changing quiet ways to protest and improve our fragile world. —Sarah P. Corbett, award-winning activist and author of How to Be a Craftivist: The Art of Gentle Protest "If you’ve ever felt too sensitive or too fragile to join the work of social justice, this book is for you. While we sensitive and empathic folks might often perceive our sensitivity as a liability to our activism, Cheng-Tozun asserts that our sensitivity is, in fact, a gift to reformation movements, writing, ‘The shortest path toward progress is built on nonviolence, empathy, and inclusion.’ These are all gifts embodied naturally by deep feelers! Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul offers a playbook for quiet, effective social transformation, a panacea for nonprofit burnout, and a way to stay sane when the work of changing the world feels like too much for any of us." —Liz Charlotte Grant, author of the Empathy List newsletter and host of the Zealot podcast "Dorcas Cheng-Tozun has created a book for the rest of us: a book for those whose hearts are on the line and who need a different way forward when it comes to confronting injustice, oppression, and hatred. Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul has filled a void I didn’t know existed, but if Gandhi can learn how to leverage his innate sensitivity for good, then maybe I can too." —Cara Meredith, author of The Color of Life "In Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul, Dorcas Cheng-Tozun offers a brilliant thesis and a timely message penned with the authenticity of lived experience. Part love-letter and part manifesto, it’s a must-read for any and all empath changemakers who are called to social change work, but shun the limelight of activism or heropreneurship of social innovation. Savor this book and then pass it on." —Anita Nowak, PhD, author of Purposeful Empathy and lecturer at McGill University "Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul is a beautifully written book that addresses a topic of critical importance and relevance for highly sensitive people: how to truly and authentically make a difference in the world. This will surely inspire and empower sensitive individuals to be the change in their own unique and wonderful ways." —Andre Sólo, founder of Sensitive Refuge and author of Sensitive Cheng-Tozun creates a spacious place for many types of folks in the social justice movement. This book expands and stirs the imagination for the types of people needed to lead and sustain social change. This book provides a particularly poignant case for the gifts that sensitive souls bring to social justice, but the book is applicable to leadership and education settings as well. A thoughtful, stirring, and deeply hopeful book. —Nikki Toyama-Szeto, executive director of Christians for Social Action This is a work of tremendous, hard-won hope that will speak to every social justice activist, not just the empaths. Dorcas Cheng-Tozun is a wise and gentle guide offering real help to those who have found themselves crushed by the outsize expectations of other activists and movements. Justice is not an ideal to which we sacrifice ourselves and our well-being. Dorcas helps us chart a path toward healthy engagement that includes self-awareness, silence, solitude, and rest—leading not to burnout but to deeper resilience and purpose. —Jim Martin, vice president of spiritual formation, International Justice Mission "I am a highly sensitive person called to seek justice in the world, but sometimes I worry I’m not strong enough for this work because I feel things deeply. I worry I’m not smart or educated enough because I overthink, and I’ve worried I don’t care enough when I’m prone to overwhelm that leads to paralysis. I wish I had Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul when I was first beginning in ministry. Through Dorcas’s research, storytelling, and gentle care for her reader, I see that I am exactly the person the world needs me to be—highly sensitive and all. This is a book I will treasure and return to many times for encouragement and insight." —Osheta Moore, pastor and author of Shalom Sistas and Dear White Peacemakers "Dorcas Cheng-Tozun offers us a gift in Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul, providing a pathway for the deep feelers and high empaths among us to fully engage in the work of social justice as we are, without the need to become someone else. Those of us who feel everything deeply need a way of being that allows us to engage in justice-oriented work without the fear of burning out. The wisdom in this book provides just that." —Drew Jackson, poet and author of God Speaks through Wombs and Touch the Earth "If your heart is stirred by the injustices all around you, yet you also struggle to understand how to confront those injustices in a manner that aligns with who God created you to be, Social Justice for the Sensitive Soul is the resource you need. Dorcas Cheng-Tozun has created a gracious, life-giving book full of wisdom, stories, and insights to encourage and empower you in the work of justice. It is possible to care deeply about justice and also take care of your own sensitive soul; Dorcas’s book is a wonderful guide to help you in the journey." —Helen Lee, co-author of The Race-Wise Family and author of The Missional Mom SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR THE SENSITIVE SOUL How to Change the World in Quiet Ways Copyright © 2023 Dorcas Cheng-Tozun.

Mahatma Gandhi In the late nineteenth century, a quiet, unassuming young man named Mohandas boarded a steamship to travel from his native India to England to study law. Being a lawyer hadn’t been the eighteen-year-old’s first choice, but his father had pressured him to pursue the profession. He decided to make the most of it, taking the chance to see another part of the world. But he struggled with culture shock from the moment he left his home country. On the steamship and after arriving in London, he was embarrassed by how differently he behaved and dressed. He just couldn’t seem to find his place. In search of people to connect with, he joined the London Vegetarian Society and was elected a member of the executive committee. The law student faithfully attended every meeting. But, try as he might, he couldn’t bring himself to speak. Everyone else seemed more articulate, more opinionated, and sharper in their thinking. But I was at a loss to know how to express myself. All the rest of the members appeared to me to be better informed than I, he reflected later. Then it often happened that just when I had mustered up courage to speak, a fresh subject would be started. This went on for a long time.¹ It wasn’t that he didn’t have anything to say. Mohandas had plenty of thoughts; he just couldn’t quite put them together and verbalize them on the spot. He tried different ways of participating and sharing his views. He would write his thoughts down before meetings. Sometimes, if reading his own words felt too difficult, he asked someone else to read them for him. When he did speak, he was prone to anxiety and losing his train of thought. On occasion, his body shook and his vision blurred. In the Vegetarian Society and elsewhere, he avoided large crowds, resisted small talk, and never gave impromptu remarks. Far later in life, this constitutional shyness, as he called it, which had been a source of shame and embarrassment in his younger days, became a distinct advantage that would shake the world. Its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words, Mohandas said. I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. . . . It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in my discernment of truth.² Today, many would consider Mohandas’s own descriptions of his shyness and introversion as evidence that he was highly sensitive.³ A highly sensitive person (HSP), according to Dr. Elaine N. Aron, the clinical psychologist who discovered this personality type and coined the term, can be recognized by these four traits: depth of processing, quicker to overstimulation, emotional reactivity, and sensing the subtle.⁴ Mohandas, the glossophobic of the London Vegetarian Society, needed longer than his colleagues to process his thoughts. He had an intense, visceral response to being the center of attention. He was highly attuned to any ridicule or impatience he might see in the eyes of his colleagues. But rather than fighting who he was, over time Mohandas learned to embrace his innate sensitivity. To leverage it. To use it for good. And in so doing, he changed the world. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, more commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, is often considered the founder of the modern nonviolence movement, which has toppled oppressive systems and inspired peace across the globe. His work and writings stirred other prominent social justice leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Cesar Chavez, to advocate for change through some of the methods of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance Gandhi employed. Even as a leader, Gandhi was never a formidable figure. He remained soft-spoken throughout his remarkable life. Much of the revolutionary change he brought about stemmed from a series of simple but powerful acts of resistance: walking out of a courtroom that did not allow him to wear his turban, fasting, marching for twenty-four days, boycotting British-made products. He also spent long periods of time at his ashram in Ahmedabad, India, focused on prayer, fasting, meditation, and welcoming pilgrims.⁵ Gandhi could not have achieved and inspired all that he did without the gifts that typically accompany sensitivity: empathy, perception, study, observation, an innate connection to sadness, and an ability to bond with others at the core of who they are and what they need. His example demonstrates the incredible influence and power that highly sensitive people have to contribute to the social good. He is an inspiration for many people, including those of us who also hate large crowds or public speaking. Or those of us who have admittedly irrational fears, like Gandhi’s long-standing fear of the dark.⁶ While sensitive, empathic people can certainly bring about revolutionary social change, most of us won’t follow the path of Gandhi. And that’s perfectly fine. The world doesn’t need a billion Gandhis. There are many other richly meaningful roles we can fill, and many more role models we can emulate. As a highly sensitive person, I needed years—decades, in all honesty—before I understood that I didn’t have to be anything like Gandhi to still contribute to social justice causes. I had to find my own path, to do it in my own way, based on my own passions, skills, and limitations. Of course, such wisdom could apply to anyone, but it is especially pertinent for highly sensitive and empathic people, who risk deep emotional wounds and permanent burnout if they do not act with self-awareness and intentionality, understanding their strengths and limits. Even Gandhi could only be Gandhi because he accepted the whole picture of who he was and spent long seasons in quiet and solitude discerning his identity and calling. Fortunately, there are plenty of places and spaces for sensitive, empathic, quiet, and introverted change agents. We are collectively holding ourselves back if we fail to embrace the unique and wonderful gifts—talents, perspectives, ideas, approaches—that sensitive people have to offer. With those gifts, sensitive people tend to go all in with social justice efforts—which inevitably puts our hearts on the line. As we do, we encounter historical forces, systemic forces, social forces, dogmatic forces, political forces, and individual forces that resist a more equitable distribution of rights, resources, power, and privilege. We will encounter anger and hatred, frustration and apathy, disgust and fear. There are many who would gladly throw down anchors to slow or stop our efforts. And sometimes the pain originates much closer to home.
