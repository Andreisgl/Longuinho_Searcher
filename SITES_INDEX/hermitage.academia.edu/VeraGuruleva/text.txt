Kunik’s extensive historical interests, his contribution to the development of Byzantine Studies in Russia and his research on ancient Russian coins are highly acclaimed by historians and experts on Russian numismatics. His studies on Byzantine numismatics, however, have been overlooked by researchers. Kunik used his findings on Byzantine coins to solve a number of crucial research problems relating to the minting of earliest Russian coins and pioneered studies on several crucial issues. 1. Owing to Arist Kunik, it is now acknowledged that Byzantine miliarensia were used in Ancient Rus’ along with Arabic dirhams and Western European denarii. 2. Kunik used linguistic analysis to identify the sources and types of the ancient Russian grivna; the researcher also suggested that the weight of the grivna was close to that of the Byzantine pound. 3. The findings of Kunik’s iconographical analysis of the images of St George, including those on Byzantine coins, were applied with great success to identify prototypes for srebreniks of Prince Yaroslav the Wise. 4. Kunik provided the correct assessment of the degree to which ancient Russian coinage was influenced by Byzantine coin types. Although he interpreted thisprocess as the general stylistic impact of Byzantine iconography, he justly doubted that Russian stamp carvers blindly copied any specific coins. 5. Kunik was also the first to study the epigraphic features of coin inscriptions and use his findings to illustrate the gradual transition from the Latin to Greek language.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

ИМИТАЦИЯ ВИЗАНТИЙСКОЙ МОНЕТЫ ИЗ ВЕЛИКОСЕЛЕЦКОГО КЛАДА 1902–1903 ГОДОВAn Imitation Byzantine Coin from the Hoards Found at Velikaya Seletskaya in 1902–1903Сообщения Государственного Эрмитажа,  2015 
We were prompted to take a new look at the hoard of coins and objects found more than a century... more We were prompted to take a new look at the hoard of coins and objects found more than a century ago near the village of Velikaya Seletskaya of Poltava Province, which then entered the Imperial Hermitage almost in its entirety, by a study of so-called subaeratus Byzantine coins (mainly imitations of gold solidi and nomismata), made of copper or more rarely of silver which was then gilded with a mercury amalgam. It seems likely that the subaeratus coin from the Velikaya Seletskaya hoard was hidden away along with original gold coins of Basil II and Constantine VIII, the owner unaware of its copper core. It may well have been not an imitation but an eleventh-century counterfeit, the work of a skilled craftsman familiar with Byzantine coins. The weight, at 3.92 g, is slightly less than the standard 4.4 g, but is within the permissible norm. Even when the hoard was discovered in 1903, the officials of the Poltava administration who sent the objects to the Imperial Archaeological Commission – and the staff of the Commission itself – were in no doubt that all the coins in the hoard were of gold. Indeed, the quality of the die used is very high and the coin is struck and not cast, but the inscriptions include displaced letters and small errors in how they are written, revealing it for what it is. Moreover, the style – and particularly the details of the image on the reverse – differs in a number of ways from original coins of Constantine IX.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This applies both to finds during archaeological excavations, and to the stray finds.  It is difficult to say whether this was due to the unclaimed silver coins in the monetary circulation of the Crimea, or whether they were used as raw materials in the absence of its own resources of this metal. During excavations in Chersonesos, two miliaresia of John I and one copper imitation (not Taman) were discovered.
