It produces a mass of black powder of 2 grams by four times of synthesis process. Then, material characterization was performed on the black powder samples obtained by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to determine the phases formed, Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) to determine the morphology and analyze the composition elemental on the microscale and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) to determine chemical bonds. From the whole black powder sample, XRD analysis showed the phases of Dilantanum Nickel Tetraoxide (La2NiO4), Nickel Oxide (NiO), Lanthanum Oxide (La2O3), and Lanthanum Oxide Ht x-form (La2O3 Ht (x-form)). In addition, it was seen from the visible compositions of the phases that the NiO phase looks more dominant and the variation of the synthesis tem...Save to LibraryDownloadby Nano Sujani•  3  Materials Science, Chemistry, CombustionCombustion Properties of Norwegian Biomass: Wood Chips and Forest ResiduesFlue gas emissions and particle size distribution were investigated during combustion experiments of wood, forest residue and mixtures of these two.

The combustion experiments were carried out in a grate fired multi-fuel reactor with and without air staging at stable operation conditions and constant temperature of 850 °C. The overall excess air ratio was held at 1.6, and the primary excess air ratio was 0.8 during air staged experiments. NOx emissions are reduced by air staging. Fly ash particle concentration of forest residues in the flue gas is lower than wood. Aerosols number increased in the staged experiments for fuel blends.Save to LibraryDownloadby Wilson Musinguzi•  12  Engineering, Biomass, Combustion, Atmospheric AerosolsPyrolysis of coal at high

This test rig can be used to evaluate the effects of geometric variations on the performance of the combustion chamber, as well as determining the flammability, stability and ignition maps, exhaust gas composition and temperature profile, and liner wall temperature. This rig has the potentiality of performing combustion tests with a maximum airflow rate of 800m3/h and preheated air up to 1000K, as well as different types of liquid or gas fuels.Save to LibraryDownloadby Amirhossein AZIMI•  5  Combustion, Gas Turbines, Test Rig, Combustion ChamberCFD modelling of air-fired and oxy-fuel combustion in a large-scale furnace at Loy Yang A brown coal power stationSave to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Naser•  30  Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Visualization, Computational Fluid DynamicsCharacterisation of smoke in expanded polystyrene combustionSave to LibraryDownloadby Maria Luda•  7  Materials Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Combustion, PyrolysisFormation of PCDD and PCDF in the thermal treatment of footwear leather wastesSave to LibraryDownloadby Leonardo Marcílio•  19  Engineering, Production, Modeling, CombustionSmouldering combustion of peat in wildfires: Inverse modelling of the drying and the thermal and oxidative decomposition kineticsSmouldering combustion is the driving phenomenon of wildfire in peatlands, like those causing haze episodes in Southeast Asia and Northeast Europe.

These are the largest fires on Earth and an extensive source of greenhouse gases, but poorly understood, becoming an emerging research topic in climate-change mitigation. In this work, a series of multistep heterogeneous kinetics are investigated to describe the drying and decomposition in smouldering combustion of peat. The decomposition schemes cover a range of complexity, including 2, 3 or 4-step schemes, and up to 4 solid pseudo-species. The schemes aim to describe the simultaneous pyrolysis and oxidation reactions in smouldering fires. The reaction rates are expressed by Arrhenius law, and a lumped model of mass loss is used to simulate the degradation behaviour seen during thermogravimetric (TG) experiments in both nitrogen and air atmospheres. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve the corresponding inverse problem using TG data from the literature, and find the best kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for four types of boreal peat from different geographical locations (North China, Scotland and Siberia). The results show that at the TG level, all proposed schemes seem to perform well, with a high degree of agreement resulting from the forced optimization in the inverse problem approach. The chemical validity of the schemes is then investigated outside the TG realm and incorporated into a 1-D plug-flow model to study the reaction and the species distribution inside a peat smouldering front. Both lateral and in-depth spread modes are considered. The results show that the drying sub-front is essential, and that the best kinetics is the 4-step decomposition (one pyrolysis, and three oxidations) plus 1-step drying with 5 condensed species (water, peat, α-char, β-char, and ash). This is the first time that the smouldering kinetics and the reaction-zone structure of a peat fire are explained and predicted, thus helping to understand this important natural and widespread phenomenon.Save to LibraryDownloadby Xinyan  Huang•  5  Combustion, Fire Behaviour, Chemical Kinetics, WildfiresExergy analysis of gas turbine trigeneration system for combined production of power heat and refrigerationA conceptual trigeneration system is proposed based on the conventional gas turbine cycle for the high temperature heat addition while adopting the heat recovery steam generator for process heat and vapor absorption refrigeration for the... moreA conceptual trigeneration system is proposed based on the conventional gas turbine cycle for the high temperature heat addition while adopting the heat recovery steam generator for process heat and vapor absorption refrigeration for the cold production.

A swirl injection system is used to achieve the flame stability of the turbulent non-premixed combustible gases. An Eddy Breakup (EBU) combustion model with appropriate empirical coefficients is employed for this study. Validation and comparison of both combustion cases with the experimental data, which conducted on a 100 kW facility unit, were made by comparing the temperature distribution levels and species concentration levels. The oxy-fuel combustion case showed that the flame is obviously concentrated in the central region, and it is not spread inside the furnace compared to the air-fired flame. The swirl effect is certainly used to enhance the turbulent mixing and to achieve the internal recirculation of flames.

In order to reduce the variation of process parameters during the exploitation, in relation to their design values, a selection of relevant process parameters was made, and their impact on the constructional characteristics of the furnace and vice versa were analyzed. It is important to note that a large number of plants never reach the project defined operational parameters in exploitation, so in order to determine the interconnections between the constructional and energy characteristics of the steam boiler furnace, the design and simulation (off design) models were generated. The “design” of the simulation model shows the changes of the selected constructional parameters of the steam boiler furnace depending on the energy-process parameters, while the “off-design” of the simulation model show...Save to Libraryby Izudin Delic and +1nedim ganibegovic•  5  Mechanical Engineering, Modeling, Combustion, Steam Boilers(POx) Partial Oxidation and Sour Shift Catalyst Applications(POx) Partial Oxidation and Sour Shift Catalyst ApplicationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Gerard Hawkins•  11  Chemical Engineering, Combustion, Gasification, Clean Coal TechnologiesRapid method for determination of protein content in cereals and oilseeds: validation, measurement uncertainty and comparison with the Kjeldahl methodThe objective of this research was to test suitability of the Dumas combustion method to completely substitute the Kjeldahl method in routine laboratory determination of crude protein content in cereals and oilseeds.

While models with fairly simplified gas-dynamics and a one-step Arrhenius kinetics in many cases makes possible to solve the problem in question in explicit analytical form, many important features of combustion can not be explained without account of the reactions chain nature, describing qualitatively a few major properties of the phenomena in question with some poor accuracy if any, often rendering misinterpretation of a verity of combustion phenomena. However, for modeling real three-dimensional and turbulent flows we have to use reduced chemical kinetic schemes, since the use of detailed reaction mechanisms consisting up to several hundreds species and thousands reactions is difficult or practically impossible to implement. In this lecture we consider the option of a reliable reduced chemical kinetic model for the proper understanding and interpretation of the unsteady combustion processes using hydrogen-oxygen combustion as a quintessential example of chain mechanisms in chemical kinetics. Specific topics covered several of the most fundamental unsteady combustion phenomena including: the regimes of combustion wave initiated by initial temperature non-uniformity; ignition of combustion regimes by the localized transient energy deposition; the spontaneous flame acceleration in tubes with no-slip walls; and the transition from slow combustion to detonation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael A Liberman•  6  Combustion, Theoretical Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics, Deflagration, Deflagration-to-Detonation TransitionNew Approaches in Modeling Multiphase Flows and Dispersion in Turbulence, Fractal Methods and Synthetic TurbulenceThis book contains a collection of the main contributions from the first five workshops held by Ercoftac Special Interest Group on Synthetic Turbulence Models (SIG42.

It is intended as an illustration of the sig’s activities and of the latest developments in the field.This volume investigates the use of Kinematic Simulation (KS) and other synthetic turbulence models for the particular application to environmental flows.This volume offers the best syntheses on the research status in KS, which is widely used in various domains, including Lagrangian aspects in turbulence mixing/stirring, particle dispersion/clustering, and last but not least, aeroacoustics. Flow realizations with complete spatial, and sometime spatio-temporal, dependency, are generated via superposition of random modes (mostly spatial, and sometime spatial and temporal, Fourier modes), with prescribed constraints such as: strict incompressibility (divergence-free velocity field at each point), high Reynolds energy spectrum. Recent improvements consisted in incorporating linear dynamics, for instance in rotating and/or stably-stratified flows, with possible easy generalization to MHD flows, and perhaps to plasmas. KS for channel flows have also been validated. However, the absence of "sweeping effects" in present conventional KS versions is identified as a major drawback in very different applications: inertial particle clustering as well as in aeroacoustics. Nevertheless, this issue was addressed in some reference papers, and merits to be revisited in the light of new studies in progress.Content Level » ResearchKeywords » atmospheric flows - fractal fluids - isotropic turbulence - lagrangian dispersion - multiphase flows - super fluids - synthetic turbulence modelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jose M.

However, there is far less information on the chemical composition of municipal solid waste. The results from a number of chemical surveys from Europe are compared and show a reasonable degree of agreement, but several problems were identified with the data. Chemical and physical compositional data are combined in a case study example to investigate the flow of key potential pollutants in an integrated solid waste management system that uses materials recycling, composting, incineration and landfilling. This case study has shown that an integrated waste management strategy diverts lead and cadmium away from composting and recycling to incineration, which effectively isolates these elements from the environment through efficient capture of the pollutants followed by secure landfilling or recycling of the residues. However, further work is needed to determine the distribution of mercury in incineration residues and its fate when the residues are landfilled.Save to LibraryDownloadby Coco Goh•  17  Environmental Engineering, Recycling, Combustion, Waste ManagementEngine combustion, performance and emission characteristics of gas to liquid (GTL) fuels and its blends with diesel and bio-dieselSave to LibraryDownloadby Sajjad Hossain•  17  Engineering, Combustion, Internal Combustion Engines, Marine Diesel EnginesFire-Protective and Flame-Retardant Coatings - A State-of-the-Art ReviewThis review covers mainly intumescent coatings, with briefer discussions of non-intumescent organic fire-resistive coatings and cementitious inorganic coatings.
