A sustainable energy for greenhouses heating in Italy: wood biomassActa Horticulturae,  2017More than 0.7 million ton of oil equivalent is the total requirement for thermal energy in the It... more More than 0.7 million ton of oil equivalent is the total requirement for thermal energy in the Italian greenhouse vegetable industry, derived mostly from fossil fuels, which corresponds to 2 Mt CO2 emissions. The technology of wood biomass system is a good candidate for heating greenhouses, since this resource is considered as &#39;greenhouse gas&#39; (GHG) neutral when converted to heat, excluding the GHG generation during harvesting, transportation, and pre-processing of raw materials. Besides, the CO2 enrichment in greenhouses from the exhaust gas of a biomass heating system can bring benefits for greenhouse production, along with optimal management strategies to reduce fuel consumption. Unfortunately, CO2 enrichment from the exhaust gas of biomass boilers is still challenging and expensive, considering that wood biomass boilers generate a higher volume of particulate matters (PM) and ash emissions than other fossil fuels. However, wet scrubbers and other recent flue gas conditioning devices could help to reduce costs and make this process more feasible. In the Italian peninsula, the power energy load for greenhouses heating was estimated to be between 30 and 175 W m-2, while the thermal energy consumption varies between 21 to 546 kWh m-2 year-1 according with internal air temperature and climatic zones. In general, the total cost of a heating system with boiler, loading system, accumulator, control system and safety, installation, and heat delivering can vary from a maximum of 1400 € kW-1 for systems with power up to 100 kW, 600-800 € kW-1 for power over 100 kW, to a minimum of 400 € kW-1 for systems with power over 1000 kW. Thus, a techno-economic assessment is highly recommended to ascertain the economic feasibility of wood biomass boilers for the greenhouse industry, as related to the economic incentives by the National Decree of 28 December 2012, so-called “White Certifies”.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Scheduling Irrigation in Heterogeneous Container Nursery CropsActa Horticulturae,  2014One of the major production areas in Europe for Hardy Ornamental Nursery Stocks (HONS) is located... more One of the major production areas in Europe for Hardy Ornamental Nursery Stocks (HONS) is located around Pistoia (Tuscany, Italy). In this area, pot ornamental crops show low water use efficiency (WUE). Main reasons of poor irrigation efficiency are both the inaccurate irrigation scheduling, which is normally based on grower’s personal experience, and the choice to group different plant species together in the same irrigation plot in order to simplify irrigation and to reduce growing costs. An efficiency-oriented approach for the management of HONS requires the use of soil/substrate moisture sensors (SMS) and/or crop evapotranspiration (ET) model to regulate irrigation frequency. In order to compare different methods for irrigation scheduling in container beds hosting four different HONS species, two experiments were carried out in the spring-summer season of 2009 and 2010 at ‘Centro Speri-mentale per il Vivaismo’ (CESPEVI), Pistoia. In particular, we tested two irrigation control methods based on SMS or ET model as compared to conventional timer scheduling. The WET sensor was used for SMS control while the ET model consisted of a composite regression model of crop ET (as function of plant height and potential evapotranspiration) along with a specific algorithm implemented in the software of an irrigation controller prototype. Scheduling irrigation by means of the WET sensor (irrigation was activated when the matric potential of substrate was less than -5.0 kPa) or applying ET model reduced seasonal water use respectively by 40% and 45%, and water runoff by 74% and 81% in comparison with timer control strategy, without significant effects on plant ET, growth, and commercial value at the end of growing season. Both new irrigation scheduling are useful for growers, but for a large use of RZS method, a low cost RZS sensor is required. The use ET-model is less expensive, but it requires the knowledge of the Kc for the hundred of different species grown in the nurseries.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this scenario, participatory approaches become pivotal to engaging the population and stakeholders in the decision-making process. In this paper, we reflect on the first year’s results and the strengths and weaknesses—of the participatory activities realized in Lucca to co-design and co-deploy a smart city based on human–animal relationships in the framework of the European project Horizon 2020 (IN-HABIT). Human–animal bonds, as nature-based solutions, are scientifically and practically underestimated. Data were collected on the activities organized to implement a public–private–people partnership in co-designing infrastructural solutions (so-called Animal Lines) and soft nature-based solutions to be implemented in the city.

For this reason, the understanding about the contribution of urban greening infrastructures on buildings to sustainable energy use for air conditioning is urgent. This paper focuses on the analysis of a vertical surface provided with a Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.) Planch., a winter deciduous species, as green cover of a building, assessing the reduction of the solar radiation energy absorbed by the façade and, consequently, the heat flux (HF) transmitted into the internal ambient. This research shows that, in July, surface temperatures (STs) on the vegetated façade were up to 13 °C lower than on the unvegetated (bare) façade.

A lack of dystrophin in DMD leads to inflammatory response, autophagic dysregulation, and oxidative stress in skeletal muscle fibers that play a key role in the progression of the pathology. β-glucans can modulate immune function by modifying the phagocytic activity of immunocompetent cells, notably macrophages. Mitochondrial function is also involved in an important mechanism of the innate and adaptive immune responses, owing to high need for energy of immune cells. In the present study, the effects of 1,3-1,6 β-glucans on five-day-old non-dystrophic and dystrophic (sapje) zebrafish larvae were investigated. The effects of the sonication of β-glucans and the dechorionation of embryos were also evaluated. The results showed that the incidence of dystrophic phenotypes was reduced when dystrophic embryos were exposed to 2 and 4 mg L−1 of 1,3...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, due to the reduction of wild fish stocks used for FM production, its manufacturing it is now unsustainable. Insect meal represents a valid alternative to FM, due to the low carbon footprint of its production and its high nutritional value. The aim of this study was to investigate the potentials of replacing FM with black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) meal (HIM) in aquafeeds, using zebrafish as the animal model. Four diets were formulated with increasing HIM/FM replacement rate (the control diet contained 20% FM). Mortality rates, growth performances, and feed consumptions were measured, and fish intestine samples were collected for histological and enzymatic analysis. After 49 days, all groups almost tripled their initial body weight (cumulative body weight gain ranged between 143.9 and 155.2 mg), and no statistically significant differences among treatments were observed in relation to growth performa...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These are complex systems and many site- and plant-specific parameters influence their energy behavior. The leaf area index (LAI) is a relevant plant characteristic to consider. Solar shading and latent heat loss of plant evapotranspiration are the two main cooling mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the cooling effect provided by an evergreen south oriented green facade in summer in a Mediterranean area and to investigate what happens when LAI changes. Experimental data were used to calculate the cooling effect provided by the facade. Simulations with different LAI values were performed to determine the related cooling effect. The canopy solar transmissivity decreased by 54% for every LAI unit increase. LAI significantly influenced the green facade cooling performance. As LAI increased, solar shading and latent heat increased; this was ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
