1 Oblique forms are used following most prepositions.2 All personal pronouns compound with the preposition con, but the meaning varies with grammatical person (see below).3 The longer alternative forms may be used when there is a possibility of confusion with the contraction nos (“in the”).4 The pronoun si is the reflexive third-person form in both the singular and plural.5 The forms prefixed with l- or n- are used only in certain cases for consonantal agreement (see below).
Usage[edit]
Nominative forms[edit]
Nominative forms of Galician pronouns function as the subject of a sentence.  However, because Galician verb conjugation implies the subject pronoun, these forms are often omitted except in cases where the subject pronoun is given emphasis.
Subject implied by verb:
Son de España. — “I am from Spain.”
Subject given for emphasis:
El é de Portugal, pero eu son de España. — “He is from Portugal, but I am from Spain.”
Accusative inflection[edit]
The third-person pronouns o, os, a, and as, have variant forms prefixed with l- or n-.  These alternative forms appear depending on the ending of the preceding word.  The l- forms are used when the preceding word ends in -r or -s. The n- forms are used when the preceding word ends in a -u or a diphthong.  These alternative forms are then suffixed to the preceding word.
In all other situations, the standard forms of the pronouns are used (o, os, a, as) and are not suffixed to the preceding word.
Compounds with con[edit]
All personal pronouns may compound with the preposition con (“with”), but the meaning varies with grammatical person.  Such first and second person compounds may function as an objective or reflexive form, e.g. comigo (“with me; with myself”), but third person compounds may function only as a reflexive form, e.g. consigo (“with himself/herself”).
Dative-accusative contractions[edit]
The third-person oblique pronouns el, ela, eles, and elas form contractions when they follow the prepositions  de (“of, from”) or  en (“in”).  For example, de el contracts to  del and en elas contracts to  nelas.
The third-person accusative pronouns o, a, os, as, lo, la, los, and las form contractions when they follow a dative pronoun.

These contracted forms may be added as a suffix to the preceding verb.
Possessive pronouns[edit]
Possessive pronouns are a special class of personal pronouns which indicate a relationship of ownership or possession.  However, they may serve as either as a pronoun or as an adjective.

Usage[edit]
The choice of gender and number matches the noun possessed, not the gender and number of the possessor.
The possessives may be suffixed to the preceding word.
Demonstratives[edit]
The demonstratives are another class of pronoun that have both pronomial and adjectival functions.

1  Galician does not have neuter nouns; neuter forms function only as pronouns, never as adjectives.
Contractions[edit]
The demonstrative pronouns form contractions when used following the prepositions de (“of, from”) and en (“in”).  For example, de este contracts to deste and en aquela contracts to naquela.
The demonstrative pronouns also form contractions when they precede the determiner outro (“other, another”).  For example, este outro contracts to estoutro and aquelas outras contracts to aqueloutras.
