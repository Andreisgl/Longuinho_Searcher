Common cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.) is an east Mediterranean plant element and one of four native conifers in Iran. During spring and summer of 2012, a field survey was carried out in different areas of Kerman province (south-eastern Iran) to study cypress decline diseases. Samples were collected from crowns, trunks and branches of cypress trees showing yellowing, dieback, canker, wilting of leaves and internal wood discoloration. Isolations were made from symptomatic wood tissues. Based on morphological and molecular characteristics, four species of Phaeoacremonium, namely Phaeoacremonium parasiticum, Pm. aleophilum, Pm. iranianum and Pm. rubrigenum, and two species of the Botryosphaeriaceae, Botryosphaeria dothidea and Neofusicoccum parvum, were isolated and identified. Pathogenicity tests were undertaken to determine the role of these species on 2-year-old potted cypress plants and green shoots of grapevine. Neofusicoccum parvum was more virulent than the other sp...Download Free PDFView PDF85.

PapageorgiouIndividuals were selected for resistance against the imperfect fungus Seiridium cardinale Wag in six common cypress populations (Cupressus sempervirens L.) in Greece. A total of 109 resistant clones and 140 trees from their base populations were surveyed at several allozyme loci. The comparison yielded information on changes in genetic variation due to artificial selection. The genetic structure of the breeding populations was similar to their base populations. Nevertheless, the number of rare alleles among the resistant clones had decreased, showing a similar trend at most loci and for most comparisons. Possible implications for breeding strategies are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFCanadian Journal of BotanyIn vitro expression of resistance responses to Seiridium species in micropropagated shoots of Cupressus sempervirens and Chamaecyparis lawsoniana1997 • K.
