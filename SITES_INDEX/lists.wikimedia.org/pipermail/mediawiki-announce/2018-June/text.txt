Hello everyone,
I am happy to announce the availability of the general release of MediaWiki
1.31!
MediaWiki 1.31 includes all changes released in the smaller 1.31.0-wmf.*
software deployments to Wikimedia sites over six months, totaling over 2100
commits by roughly 130 unique authors. This is a very large release that
contains many new features and bug fixes. It is also an LTS release.
This is a summary of the major changes of interest to users and
administrators:

You can always consult the RELEASE-NOTES-1.31 file for the full list of
changes in this version.

**********************************************************************
On a personal note, this will be the last release that I shall be handling.
As many probably know I left Wikimedia this month for a new career and as
such I won't have the time to dedicate to releasing MediaWiki anymore.
Whomever picks up the torch will do fantastic. See you all around the
Internet :)
-Chad
