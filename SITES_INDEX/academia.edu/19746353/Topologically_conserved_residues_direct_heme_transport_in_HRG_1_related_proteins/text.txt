Results: Conserved residues within the transmembrane domain and the C terminus dictate the function of HRG-1-related proteins. Conclusion: Heme transport is mediated by topologically conserved residues implying an evolutionary ancient transport mechanism. Significance: Understanding the mechanism of HRG-1-related protein function will provide novel therapeutic insights into human hematological disorders and parasites, which rely on host heme for survival.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCell MetabolismHRG1 Is Essential for Heme Transport from the Phagolysosome of Macrophages during Erythrophagocytosis2013 • Monica CalicchioDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of biological chemistryExploratory and confirmatory gene expression profiling of mac1Delta2004 • Henri WintzDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biological ChemistryExploratory and Confirmatory Gene Expression Profiling of mac1 2003 • Chris VulpeExploratory outlier identification methods and confirmatory gene expression studies showed induction of the iron regulon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Mac1p, a copper-responsive transcription factor. The Aft1p/Aft2p binding motif was the most discriminating motif between up- and down-regulated genes, and we identified new genes potentially regulated by Aft1p/Aft2p. In addition, multiple genes encoding proteins containing Fe-S clusters were down-regulated suggesting metabolic reorganization to conserve iron in mac1Delta. Null mutants of each of the differentially expressed genes were characterized for copper- or iron-related phenotypes. New or additional support for a role in copper and iron homeostasis is provided in this study for the gene products of AKR1, MRS4, PCA1, SSU1, TIS11, YBR047W, YHL035C, YHR045W, YLR047C, YLR126C, and YTP1.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Bioscience and BioengineeringDNA microarray analysis suggests that zinc pyrithione causes iron starvation to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae2010 • Hitoshi IwahashiDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biological ChemistryDisruption of the ATP-binding Cassette B7 (ABTM-1/ABCB7) Induces Oxidative Stress and Premature Cell Death in Caenorhabditis elegans2011 • Sergio Alberto Beltrán MorenoDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesThe Heme Biosynthetic Pathway of the Obligate Wolbachia Endosymbiont of Brugia malayi as a Potential Anti-filarial Drug Target2009 • Barton SlatkoDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS GeneticsGenome-Wide Analysis Reveals Novel Genes Essential for Heme Homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans2010 • Makedonka MitrevaHeme is a cofactor in proteins that function in almost all sub-cellular compartments and in many diverse biological processes. Heme is produced by a conserved biosynthetic pathway that is highly regulated to prevent the accumulation of heme—a cytotoxic, hydrophobic tetrapyrrole. Caenorhabditis elegans and related parasitic nematodes do not synthesize heme, but instead require environmental heme to grow and develop.
