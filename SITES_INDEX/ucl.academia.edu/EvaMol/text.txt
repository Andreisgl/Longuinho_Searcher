I argue that current digital technologies can be a very constructive tool to create non-human experience and awareness. I pursue this argument by presenting ideas from a work-in-progress project experimenting with the post-human and the virtual, and by exploring significant otherness in Roman religion and the dark spots in human perception, through the analysis of an absent temple in Rome. Applying post-human philosophies and an expanded concept of virtuality beyond the digital makes it possible to change our approach to object/human/divine relations in Roman cults and how we present Roman heritage towards a post-humanist framework. Through this, digital archaeology can become one of the ways of reexamining and reinventing our ideas of the human, the past and the digital.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rather than discussing the rituals, architecture, and objects that are usually associated with these cults in cultural terms (namely, as either Oriental or Roman), the cults will be approached from a cognitive religious viewpoint. It will use the concept of apartness/alterity in religion as a guiding cognitive feature to show how all cults use objects and decoration that can be interpreted as Oriental, exotic, or deviant, in order to create an otherworldly environment which enables a religious experience. In this way, the paper wishes to pull the alleged Oriental cults out of their sometimes narrowing framework. The cults of Isis will be used as a case study but the paper draws comparisons from a wide range of cultic behaviour, both geographically and chronologically.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Romanisation from the ground up? Towards an understanding of Egyptian objects in Roman contextsThe project Cultural innovation in a globalising society, Egypt in the Roman world which started ... more The project Cultural innovation in a globalising society, Egypt in the Roman world which started in April 2010, deals with the formation of identity in the Roman world by looking at how Rome used, perceived, and incorporated the concept of Egypt. Theories on globalization and Romanisation form an important tool to understand this process. However, the researches of the individual members deal with objects, things from Egypt or things that supposed to represent Egypt. The gap between the analysis of the artefacts and the framework which should provide a narrative is one reflecting the issues proposed the session’s outline and raises some fundamental questions concerning object-research. Does the ‘concept of Egypt’ equal Egyptian objects? Is it possible to label objects as Egyptian or Egyptianising? Is it an appropriate designation or category to use when studying Roman contexts? And if we should deconstruct the label ‘Egyptian’, how can it still contribute to the larger discussion on Romanisation? On a large (top-down) scale, current theories on Romanisation have already argued for a more complex and dynamic picture of the Roman world. However, when turning these ideas to the interpretation of objects they often seem to create more problems rather than that they solve them. This paper will reflect on these issues using the category of ‘Egyptian’ objects in Roman domestic contexts. It will subsequently give an example of how to deal with the issues arguing from a bottom-up perspective which starts the discussion from the things themselves and the power they act out upon groups and people. Consequently, the paper argues that it might be better to start with methods that help portraying the internal dynamics of Roman society than using overarching interpretative structures in order to explain social and cultural complexity. The approach, which consists of contextual archaeology with a focus on material agency and within a (post)phenomenological framework, might allow for this because it focuses on objects within the sphere of social practice and coping with everyday life instead of reflecting upon the different components of it. Arguing from the bottom up, ‘Egyptian’ objects (and their deconstruction) are a good example to show how by using particular things in a certain context, a deeper connectedness is created between people and their world and how a constant dealing with foreign objects and their diverging connections incorporated Egypt in Roman society.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Perception of Egypt in Networks of Being and Becoming: A Thing Theory Approach to Egyptianising Objects in Roman Domestic ContextsPublished in TRAC 2012, vol. 22, 117-132The paper will discuss the role of Egyptian and Egyptianised artefacts in Roman society. A great ... more The paper will discuss the role of Egyptian and Egyptianised artefacts in Roman society. A great number of both imported and locally produced Egyptian objects found their way into Roman houses. My research examines how these objects, in all their diversity, were used by the Romans and how Egypt as a cultural concept was appreciated and communicated through material culture. The types of artefacts and their location within the house allow us to address questions concerning their function, meaning and value. Was there for example a difference experienced between Egyptian imports and Egyptianised products? In what ways was Egyptian material culture used in communicating power and status? Furthermore, the transformation and modification of the objects in a Roman context can say something significant about social and ideological values within Roman society.However, next to the question of what role artefacts played in a Roman context, it is of equal importance to look at the effect Aegyptiaca had on a Roman context. We have to consider both how these artefacts were able to mediate social relationships between people and how the everyday engagement with Egyptianised artefacts could have affected society and the construction of Roman identity. These ideas correspond to recent developments within archaeological theory which stress the importance of objects as having agency and the power to change their environment. This framework, referred to as Thing Theory in this paper, focuses on the co-dependencies and entanglements between humans and objects and assumes a symmetrical relationship between humans and material culture (Hodder 2011, Olsen 2010, Witmore and Webmoor 2007). Do objects need their own ontological existence within archaeological research and how would that benefit archaeology? Through the study of Egyptian artefacts I want to explore in what way Thing Theory could be useful for Roman archaeology and how we should deal with the ‘turn to things’ when we did not even come round postmodernism’s spatial turn yet.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
