The huge amount of data derived from gene expression and sequencing experiments has propelled physicians, basic scientists and bioinformaticians towards a common goal to transform &#39;big data&#39; into predictive constructs that are readily available and will offer clinical utility. Although most of the studies available in the literature have been performed on healthy subjects and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which are a heterogenous and extremely variable pool of cells, scientists are now trying to address mechanistic questions in purified cell subsets in pathological conditions. In the field of HIV, few attempts have been made to comprehensively evaluate gene-expression profiles of infected patients with different disease status.

Downfall of the current antibody correlates of influenza vaccine response in yearly vaccinated subjects: Toward qualitative rather than quantitative assaysPediatric Allergy and Immunology,  2015Response to seasonal influenza vaccination is currently evaluated by antibody correlates that est... more Response to seasonal influenza vaccination is currently evaluated by antibody correlates that estimate vaccine seroconversion as well as immune protection. These correlates rely on the general dogmas surrounding seasonal influenza vaccination; that is, that vaccine-induced antibodies would exclusively generate immunity to influenza vaccine strains and that protective immunity would wane before the next season. Here, we summarize recently reported data on immunity to seasonal influenza in healthy individuals and rediscuss results on yearly vaccinated pediatric immunocompromised patients that together highlight the need for revision of the current correlates of vaccine response to shift from quantitative to qualitative measurements.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Antibody but not memory B-cell responses are tuned-down in vertically HIV-1 infected children and young individuals being vaccinated yearly against influenzaVaccine,  Jan 3, 2014Yearly immunization against seasonal influenza is highly recommended for HIV-1 infected individua... more Yearly immunization against seasonal influenza is highly recommended for HIV-1 infected individuals but evaluating the success of vaccination by serological markers may not be fully informative in this population. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the generation of long-lasting immune responses may depend on whether similar antigens challenge the immune system frequently and intermittently. In the present study, in order to search for additional correlates of vaccine-induced protective immunity and to further dissect this theory, both humoral and memory B-cell responses to the trivalent 2012-2013 seasonal influenza vaccination has been evaluated by strain-specific (separately for H1N1, H3N2 and B strain) standard hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and B-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) in a cohort of vertically HIV-1 infected children and young individuals as compared to age-matched healthy controls.

We report the case of a 1-year-old child who developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because of a progressive respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional treatment extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was rapidly started. HPIV-3 infection was diagnosed on the rhinopharyngeal fluid and immunological examinations revealed a hypogammaglobulinemia. A combination therapy with ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroid under ECMO support was started with considerable improvement. Subsequent analysis and more specific immunological assessment resulted normal confirming the diagnosis of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI). This case highlights the importance of prompt therapy with early ECM...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is raising the hypothesis that chronic immune activation may cause the premature aging of the immune system. Here we dissect this theory by comparing changes occurring to B-cells during healthy aging to the ones occurring during chronic immune activation in younger individuals. Moreover, we discuss how these changes may affect or predict response to vaccination in immune compromised individuals.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Early Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy Enhances B-cell Longevityby Nicola Cotugno and Stefania BernardiThe Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal,  2014We have previously reported that an early initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAA... more We have previously reported that an early initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-1 vertically infected children enhanced the function of memory B-cells gained during childhood routine vaccinations. On the other hand, a significant waning of immunity was observed for patients with a late treatment. In this follow-up study, we report data from a sample of patients in our cohort including late-treated patients being revaccinated with routine childhood vaccines. The levels of serum antibodies and cellular immunity were measured by antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and B-cell ELISpot. Moreover, flow cytometry on the frequencies of mature-activated (CD10-CD21-) and double-negative (CD27-IgD-) B-cells as hallmarks of immune activation and immune senescence, respectively, was performed for all patients. Reduced protective humoral immunity and cellular immunity to routine childhood vaccines was observed in late-treated patients. Moreover, we found that timing of HAART related with the frequencies of mature activated and double negative. Altogether the data presented in this follow-up study reenforce the importance for an early start of HAART in HIV-1 vertically infected individuals and suggest that timing of HAART is a fundamental factor to take into account for vaccination design in this population.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Raising Awareness of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in HIV-infected Adolescentsby Nicola Cotugno, Stefania Bernardi, and Paola AriganelloJournal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology,  2013Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) chronically infected patients are at increased risk of develop... more Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) chronically infected patients are at increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma compared with the general population. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has had a dramatic effect on the natural history of HIV infection, reducing the incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma and improving overall survival. However, problems related to adherence to treatment, frequently experienced during adolescence, may increase the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cancers. Optimizing highly active antiretroviral therapy and monitoring noncompliant patients with persisting HIV replication should be considered by physicians who take care of these patients. We herein report 2 cases of relapsed/progressive Burkitt lymphoma in HIV vertically infected adolescents.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Premature aging of the immune system relates with increased anti-lymphocyte antibodies (ALA) after an immunization in HIV-1 infected and kidney transplanted patientsClinical & Experimental Immunology,  2013Low-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig)G with potential autoreactivity to lymphocytes and hypergammaglob... more Low-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig)G with potential autoreactivity to lymphocytes and hypergammaglobulinaemia have been described previously in HIV-1-infected patients. Whether such antibodies increase after challenging the immune system, for example with an immunization, is not known. In the present study, the modulation of antibodies with low affinity and potential autoreactivity was evaluated after 2012-13 seasonal flu vaccination with a simple empirical laboratory test measuring the titres of anti-lymphocyte antibodies (ALA) in two different models of secondary immunodeficiency: HIV-1 vertically infected patients (HIV) and patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies after kidney transplantation (KT) compared to healthy individuals (HC). In parallel, the activation status of B cells and their degree of immune senescence was evaluated by measuring the B cell interleukin (IL)-21R expression/plasma IL-21 levels and the frequencies of mature-activated (MA) and double-negative (DN) B cells. A significant increase of ALA titres was observed after vaccination in HIV and KT but not in HC, and this correlated directly with the frequencies of both MA and DN and inversely with the B cell IL-21R expression. This suggests that the quality of an immune response triggered by flu vaccination in HIV and KT may depend upon the activation status of B cells and on their degree of immune senescence. Further investigations are needed to verify whether high frequencies of MA and DN may also relate to increase autoimmunity after immunization in high-risk populations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
