Frequency, regression and regression tree analysis were made by using SPSS 15 Package program. Findings: 59.0% of the nurses are in the age group of 30- 39 years, 86.0% are women, 75.0% are married, 42.0% hold associate degree graduates, and 32.0% have been working as nurse for a period more than 20 years. 32.0% of participants have been working in nursing room for a period of 5-9 years.39.0% suffer from emotional exhaustion, 76.0% from low levels of depersonalization and 97.0% have scored high levels of personal accomplishment. 63.0% suffer from poor sleep quality. Significant correlation is found between subjective sleep quality, sleep duration and global score components and personal accomplishment scale (p<0.05). Conclusion: Subjective sleep quality of participants was found poor. Low levels of sleep duration were associated with low levels of personal accomplishment. Contrary to literature, nurses which rated higher global score index have higher levels of personal accomplishment.
