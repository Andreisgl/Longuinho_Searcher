Canepa explores the ways in which the Seleukids contributed basic and enduring elements of Iranian religious and royal culture that lasted throughout late antiquity. Beyond stressing simple continuities or breaks with the Babylonian, Achaemenid or Macedonian traditions, this article argues that the Seleukids selectively integrated a variety of cultural, architectural and religious traditions to forge what became the architectural vocabularies and religious expressions of the Middle Iranian era.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHellenism and Persianism in Iran (2020)Rolf StrootmanR. Strootman, ‘Hellenism and Persianism in Iran: Culture and empire after Alexander the Great’, Dabir 7 (2020) 201–227. The article studies cultural developments in Hellenistic-period Iran by looking at “Hellenistic” and “Persianistic” trends. It is shown that it is impossible to draw a line between “Greek” and “Iranian” culture. The prevalent notion of an antagonism between Greco-Macedonian and Iranian elites in the Hellenistic world, viz., the Seleukid Empire, is criticized. The evidence for Hellenistic or Persianistic style in (Greater) Iran is invariably connected with imperial ideas and dynastic identities, not with ethnic groups per se. Though the top layer of philoi at the Seleukid imperial court may originally have been recruited mainly among Aegean civic elites, local rulers and military leaders in the Upper Satrapies were for a large part local Iranians, who interacted with their peers through a system of interconnected dynastic courts. In religion, eastern deities could be given the iconography of Greek gods and Greek names—but this does not imply that a syncretism of cults also took place. Cultures are always in flux and changes occur most strongly when geopolitical circumstances change, especially when empires break down or are created. Despite the overall trans-Eurasian connectivity that came into being during the Persian and Hellenistic periods—forerunner of what Jack Goody called the remarkable “relative cultural unity” of later Silk Road societies—it is most of all the astounding variety and richness of local cultures in the globalizing so-called “Hellenistic World” that remains a wonderful and intriguing phenomenon.Download Free PDFView PDFBibliography of 150+ years of historical research on the Seleucid Empire.

By surveying the available evidence, this study aims in particular to understand the role played by non-Greek populations in the Seleukid Empire, trying to go beyond the thesis of an apartheid-like regime in which those ethnic groups would be socially as well as politically isolated from the Greco-Macedonian settlers.Download Free PDFView PDFRolf Strootman, ‘The Seleukid Empire between Orientalism and Hellenocentrism: Writing the history of Iran in the Third and Second Centuries BCE’, Nāme-ye Irān-e Bāstān: The International Journal of Ancient Iranian Studies 11.1-2 (2011/2012) 17–35.The Seleucid Empire Between Orientalism and Hellenocentrism: Writing the History of Iran in the Third and Second Centuries BCE (2012)2011 • Rolf StrootmanMy earliest attempt to understand the Hellenistic ‘interlude’ in the history of Iran as Iranian history.
