S. Halliwell and C.

McCarthy has adopted de Certau's appellation for the dispossessed for a new cant in criticism that fails to adopt any real position. The 'new marginalism' he argues is the mantle of a new band of critics who suffer a kind of infantile disorder that fails their own test of critique and the reflexivity required to undertake it.Download Free PDFView PDFCommentaries & ConversationsBrian  McNairA selection of articles for The Conversation, written between 2011-2017.

Bayle’s book, supposedly an attack on superstitious beliefs about comets, was—in her opinion—full of “sly insinuations” and “vile suggestions” targeted against the Christian religion. Astell’s marginalia provides evidence of the indignation that Bayle provoked, but it also provides a unique and sustained line of attack against his scepticism. The literary form of the marginal note provides Astell with an ideal weapon. Bayle’s style of argument, which relied on his reader to follow through on his anti-Catholic insinuations and the atheistic implications of his texts, demands active engagement and immediate disarmament. In her commentary, Astell turns Bayle’s reason against him: she “undoes” his scepticism by using the very reason he himself deploys. As Bayle became more widely known in England, there were fears about what might happen if his books fell into the hands of the unlearned. The strategic purpose of Astell’s marginalia is to disarm Bayle’s arguments for the benefit of any future reader of the book, but also for one reader in particular—her friend Lady Wortley Montagu.Download Free PDFView PDF“No comments?” Can commentary be a means of expression for the social scientist?2015 • -Emmanuelle SavignacCommenting is often what social scientists are asked to do when they intervene in the media. In this article, we propose to analyze such commentary in the context of the relationship between the media and researchers. We will try to understand what the researcher is doing and where he stands when he makes his comments. We will also try to determine which position is given to him by the commentary: that of a commentator, an expert or a scientist? If the principal characteristic of the comment is to highlight what it comments upon, what is the difference between such comment and a sociological description? ------ ‘Comentario’ e muitas vezes o que e pedido aos cientistas sociais quando falam nos meios de comunicacao. Neste artigo, propomo-nos a analisar tal comentario no contexto da relacao entre os media e investigadores.
