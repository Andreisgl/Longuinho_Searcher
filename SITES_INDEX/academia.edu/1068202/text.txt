The CH predicts a higher and longer lasting 'breeding baseline' androgen level in males of polygynous species with no or only short-term paternal investment than in males of monogamous species with a high degree of paternal investment. Since the applicability of the CH to nonavian vertebrates has been unclear, we experimentally tested its predictions in several cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher, Lamprologus callipterus, Tropheus moorii, Pseudosimochromis curvifrons and Oreochromis mossambicus) using a simulated territorial intruder protocol. Androgens (11-ketotestosterone: 11-KT; testosterone: T) were measured from fish-holding water. In all species sampled, the 11-KT patterns confirmed the predictions of the CH originating from the...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBehaviourSocial context may affect urinary excretion of 11-ketotestosterone in African cichlids2008 • Katharina HirschenhauserDownload Free PDFView PDFAnimal BehaviourSocial modulation of androgens in male vertebrates: meta-analyses of the challenge hypothesis2006 • Rui OliveiraDownload Free PDFView PDFShort communication Androgen level and male social status in the African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni2000 • Russell FernaldIn vertebrates, circulating androgen levels are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis through which the brain controls the gonads via the pituitary. Androgen levels ultimately depend on factors including season, temperature, social circumstance, age, and other variables related to reproductive capacity and opportunity.

Here, we review and synthesize findings on sexual modulation of T in primates (including humans), birds, fish, and rodents, with attention to the specific elements of sexual situations that drive T responses. We use a comparative perspective to show how research with females and males from a wide distribution of taxa provides novel insights for understanding effects of sexuality on T in humans. Among other patterns, our cross-species synthesis highlights a) the importance of the context surrounding a sexual interaction, over and above specific sensory modalities, to sexual modulation of T; b) that changes in T and changes in sexual behavior or arousal do not always occur in concert; c) that sexual contexts may be especially likely to increase T when coupled with aggression or competition, but sexuality contributes to T profiles independently as well; and d) that variation in T responses may be adaptive in balancing behavioral and physiological costs and benefits of T.We discuss how broadening the ways sexuality is defined, and especially decoupling sexuality from reproduction, would further clarify predictors and potential functions of sexually-modulated T. Overall, effects of sexuality on T across species highlight the malleability of androgens, particularly in response to the social environment. Not only does sexual behavior affect T, but the social environment in turn modulates the extent of sexuality’s effect on T.Download Free PDFView PDFHormones and behaviorIntra-sexual variation in male reproduction in teleost fish: a comparative approach2005 • Albert RosDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysiology & behaviorHormonal control of brood care and social status in a cichlid fish with brood care helpers2008 • Michael TaborskyWe studied the role of steroid hormones for parental and alloparental brood care and social status in a cooperatively breeding fish. We measured excretion levels of testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone in males, estradiol-17beta in females and cortisol in both sexes at different stages of the breeding cycle, and compared these values to data measured in non-reproductive fish. Brood care behaviour does not seem to relate to steroid hormone excretion levels in this species. Steroid hormones varied with social status, however. Non-territorial male aggregation members, for example, showed high testosterone and low 11-ketotestosterone excretion levels, suggesting that they might pursue a &quot;stand-by strategy&quot; for breeding to react quickly if an occasion for breeding arises. Cortisol excretion levels are high in juvenile helpers compared to same-size aggregation members, suggesting higher stress levels in subordinate members of reproductive groups.
