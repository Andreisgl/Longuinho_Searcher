Because population explosion is the first step in biological invasions, considerable insight into the processes that contribute to the success of invasive species can be gained from population level studies. The goal of this research was to understand the factors and processes that are contributing to the demographic success of an invasive tropical shrub (Ardisia elliptica) within local patches and across the landscape in Everglades National Park. I used matrix models to evaluate which life-history stages may be contributing the most to population growth and spread in southern Florida and to evaluate how different types of dispersal agents may contribute to its spread. A. elliptica is an understory shrub that can form dense thickets and exclude native plants.
