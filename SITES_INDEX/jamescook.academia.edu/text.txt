Gender issues were of apparent importance due to increasing feminisation of the teaching workforce in Australia. Aim: This study sought to explore possible differences in teachers regarding perceptions of school administration trustworthiness, which may well pertain to gender. Sample: Participants were 90 currently serving teachers in Queensland Independent Schools. Method: Survey instruments included measures for perceptions of administration trustworthiness (ability, benevolence and integrity), morale, participative decision making, trust, burnout and job stress. Results: There were significant effects for gender and school, with female primary teachers experiencing more burnout job stress than male primary teachers, and secondary teachers (male and female).

What is less well understood is how these relationships vary for different groups of respondents. Using a two-wave longitudinal design with a 12-month time lag and samples of employees (total N = 2183) from Australia, New Zealand, China and Hong Kong, the present research investigated whether the mediating relationships between social support, work–family conflict and well-being outcomes were moderated by gender, geographical region and the presence of dependants in the household. Supervisor support and family support were associated with lower work–family conflict, and hence reduced psychological strain and increased job and family satisfaction, for women and for employees in China and Hong Kong, but not for employees in Australia and New Zealand. However, the presence of dependants was not a significant moderator. Our findings illust...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is important for the retention of qualified academic staff in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and for the supply of well-educated workers in this developing country.,The authors surveyed 94 national (indigenous) academic staff at a prominent PNG university for their perceptions of organisational justice and management support, with an aim determining if these variables were related to workers’ affective commitment (AC) and intentions to turnover. The surveyed staff members are all employed on an inequitable basis in that their salaries and living conditions are inferior to those of equally qualified expatriate academic staff.,The research found that staff members’ emotional connection (affective commitment (AC)) to their work was predicted by organisational support, whereas lack of organisational support predicted academic staff turnover.,Universities must provide supportive environments to enable staff to remain focussed and committed in order to maintain high morale and reduce turnover in academic staff.,Previous research on this topic has emphasised the economic inequity faced by national academic staff members in PNG’s high education institutions. The current research applies motivation theory to people experiencing this obvious inequity. It finds that an environment where workers experience management support and a sense of intrinsic reward can effectively influence their intention to remain at their place of work as well as their emotional connection to their institution and their students.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We investigated mindful self-care, comparing the experiences of chaplains and other workers. Measures used included mindful selfcare, social support, and professional quality of life. We found self-care practices did not predict the professional quality of life. Lack of supportive structures and mindful awareness predicted burnout. Compassion satisfaction might arise from other sources.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However the take up of such policies by employees depends on embedded workplace cultural norms. These norms can be supportive or they can hinder use of flexible options by employees. The current research investigated employees&#39; use of FWAs and its particular relationship to work engagement within the context of their organisational culture. Turnover intentions and psychological strain were also used as criterion variables for comparison purposes. A heterogeneous sample of Australian employees (n = 823) responded to two waves of data collection with a twelve month interval. Relationships between supportive and hindering aspects of organisational culture and the outcome variables of work engagement, turnover intentions and psychological strain supported the research hypotheses...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Measures used in theresearch included the Areas of Worklife Survey(AWLS), which identifies matches or mismatchesbetween the worker and organisation on six areas ofworklife, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), andthe Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES). Twohundred and ninety seven teachers from independentschools in Queensland, Australia were surveyed. Onesample t-tests revealed respondents reportedsignificantly higher matches in the control, community,fairness and values areas of worklife than previouslysurveyed populations, whereas they reported nodifference in reward, and significantly more mismatchwith workload. Respondents reported significantlyhigher levels than previously established norms on theOLBI dimension of exhaustion, but similar levels ofdisengagement. Responses to the UWES revealedsignificantly higher dedication and absorption and lowervigour than previously established norms. In addition,respondents reported working long hours in order tofulfill all obligations. Respondent comments augmentedquantitative data findings and demonstrated that teachersworking in independent schools in Queensland havereached a level of workload that is unsustainable andwhich constitutes a serious risk to their mental andphysical health.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
