Step 1: Create an API proxy

          Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
        
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid.
If you have finished setting up and configuring Apigee, you're ready to
  create a simple API proxy.
Note: Apigee is introducing a  
  new version of its UI,
  which is integrated with the Google Cloud console.
  The new UI is called Apigee in Cloud console. The
  instructions in the first two tabs below explain how to use either the
  Apigee in Cloud console or classic Apigee.
Apigee in Cloud console
Open the Apigee UI in Cloud console in a browser.
  Note: If you see the message below at the top of the UI, you need to
    provision
    your Apigee organization before proceeding further.
    
After you have provisioned Apigee, close the UI and reopen the
    Apigee UI in Cloud console.
In the left navigation pane, click Proxy development > API Proxies.
  
In the API Proxies pane, click + Create.
In the Create a proxy pane, under Proxy template,
      select Reverse proxy (Most common).
Under Proxy details, enter the following:
    
Proxy name: Enter myproxy. The remaining steps in this
        section assume that this is your proxy's name.
Base Path: Automatically set to the value you enter for
         Proxy name. The Base
         Path is part of the URL used to make requests to your API. Apigee uses the URL to
         match and route incoming requests to the proper API proxy.
Description (Optional): Enter a description for your new API proxy, such
        as "Testing Apigee with a simple proxy."
Target (Existing API): Enter https://mocktarget.apigee.net.
        This defines the
        target URL that Apigee invokes on a request to the API proxy. The mocktarget service is
        hosted at Apigee and returns simple data. It requires no API key or access token.
Click Next.
Under Policies, after Security: Authorization, select Pass through
     (no authorization).
Click Next.
Under Deploy (optional) leave the
    Deployment environments field unchanged. In this
    example, you just create the proxy without deploying it at this
    stage.
Click Create.
Apigee creates the new proxy and displays a summary of the proxy details in the
  Proxy summary pane.
The Deployments section is empty because
  the proxy has not yet been deployed.
Below that, the Endploints section displays:
Proxy endpoints: The basepath you set for the proxy, which in this example
          is /myproxy.
 Target endpoints: The basepath you set for the target, which in this
          example is https://mocktarget.apigee.net.
Classic Apigee
To create a simple API proxy in the classic Apigee UI:
Open the Apigee UI in a browser.
  Note: If you see the message below at the top of the UI, you need to
    provision
    your Apigee organization before proceeding further.
    
After you have provisioned Apigee, close the UI and reopen the Apigee UI.
Click Develop > API Proxies in the main view of the UI.
    
From the Select Environment drop-down list, select the environment in which you want
    to create a new API proxy.
The Apigee UI displays a list of API proxies for that environment. If you haven't created any
    proxies yet, the list is empty.
Click Create New.
The Create Proxy wizard starts:
Select Reverse proxy (most common).
    The Proxy details view is displayed.
Configure your proxy with the following settings:
    
Proxy Name: Enter myproxy. The remaining steps in this section assume
        that this is your proxy's ID.
Proxy Base Path: Automatically set to /myproxy. The Proxy Base
        Path is part of the URL used to make requests to your API. Apigee uses the URL to
        match and route incoming requests to the proper API proxy.
 Description (Optional): Enter a description for your new API proxy, such
        as Testing Apigee with a simple proxy.
Target (Existing API): Enter https://mocktarget.apigee.net.
        This defines the
        target URL that Apigee invokes on a request to the API proxy. The mocktarget service is
        hosted at Apigee and returns simple data. It requires no API key or access token.
Your API proxy's details should look like the following:
Click Next.
On the Common policies screen, select Pass through (no authorization) as the
    security option.
Click Next.
On the Summary screen, click Create. (Leave the
    Optional Deployment unselected.)
    Apigee generates the proxy (sometimes referred to as the proxy bundle):
Click Go to proxy list.
    Apigee displays the Proxies view, which displays a list of API proxies. The
    new proxy has a gray status indicator, meaning that it has not yet been deployed.
You've created a simple API
    proxy. Next you'll deploy it to your environment.
