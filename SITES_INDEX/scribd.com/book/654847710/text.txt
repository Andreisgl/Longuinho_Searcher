The Universe desires this for everyone and has made your world a playground for you to experiment, play, and create in. The Universe wants you to create beautiful things so it can experience them. It's through you and your human body that the Universe can experience itself. The planet you're living in is indeed your world. It's the kingdom you inherited as soon as you were born, and since you're a divine child of the Universe, you must realize how loved you are. The Universe has an endless stream of unconditional love for you and looks at you with this love through all the things you consider shameful and evil. There is nothing you can do that would stop the Universe from loving you. Before we go any further, we must address a question you may have: how could the Universe make life so cruel for many of its children whom it loves? As a parent, you want your child to feel free so they don't need you to do everything. In the same way, the Universe would like to intervene as little as possible so that you may figure it out on your own. The more you can do this, the greater your ability to use the power of creative thought to make things that have never existed before. You must realize that the Universe loves every single bit of you and all you've done. In the eyes of the Universe, you're perfect exactly as you are now and always will be, no matter what you do in the future. You're a deeply loved Soul, and the Universe wants nothing more than to see your light shine. Within everyone is pure light. This light is the Universe's infinite, unconditional love. The Universe wants you to use this light to create beautiful things in your world, which is how you'll bring heaven to earth. Have you ever been so touched by a work of art that it moved you to tears? Has a piece of music ever given you a tingling sensation throughout your body? These feelings are what happens when someone else's light touches you. Light is powerful. The beautiful thing about this light is that every single human has it. The light of the Universe lives in you. Having this light means you're always connected to the Universe's unconditional love and have nothing to fear. A problem only arises when you hide your light. Contrary to what many people believe, no dark or evil forces can stop you from shining your light. You're the only one who decides whether or not you share your light with the world. By observing others, you may have learned that your light is dangerous, will cause you to be unloved, or isn't worth sharing. Not expressing your light is painful because your whole purpose in being born on earth is to shine it fully. When you hide your light, you experience the fear of feeling Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksBody, Mind, & SpiritFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
