Now That It’s Come to This

ONCE, BEFORE I knew him well, I asked Barry Lopez the earliest thing he could remember. Without missing a beat, the most widely traveled and sophisticated spiritual seeker in North American letters in a century—a writer of mystical sensitivity and grace, who’d been up to his armpits in snow, tracking wolves in Alaska, and who charted the migration of snow geese across Canada, who listened to Indigenous peoples across the globe, learning from their knowledge systems, especially in the Arctic—spoke at length about water.
His life began, Lopez said, with water.
He talked about being transfixed by the luminescence of a thin column of water as it poured from a spigot from the house in Reseda, California, where he grew up. This would have been the late 1940s, and Lopez, just three or four years old at the time, already sensed beauty’s power to hold… to protect even. He turned toward it, he recalled, mesmerized, the way we all respond to something vital in nature.
Such a long time this memory traveled in Lopez’s life, from that back porch in Reseda, along his trips through the Arctic, the Sahara, and through more than eighty other countries, nourishing in him uncommon reservoirs. You knew it upon meeting him, that his spirit had been written in water. Although he voyaged widely, he lived most of his life in a small cabin on the McKenzie River in Oregon, sticking his hands into its currents daily. He grew strong from what they told him. He shared the depths the river gave with virtually anyone who asked. Were I to name them, these wells he’d scoop his cup into, I’d call them patience, curiosity, humility, and generosity. If I were telling stories about him, I might also mention his rich springs of determination, stubbornness, and loyalty. Maybe if the stories were going late into the night, I’d want to add that deep beneath all of them was a profound aquifer of faith. He didn’t just believe, but did so deeply that the questions of faith became a daily practice of sacrifice. A stringency with himself I never once saw him impose on others.
He was hard on
