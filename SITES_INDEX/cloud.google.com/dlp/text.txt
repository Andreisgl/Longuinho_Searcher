Enable Sensitive Data Protection across your entire
                          BigQuery footprint to automatically discover, inspect,
                          and classify your data. Continuously, pick up new data
                          tables as they are added.
                        Reduce risk to unlock more data for your business
Protection of sensitive data, like personally
                          identifiable information (PII), is critical to your
                          business. Deploy de-identification in migrations, data
                          workloads, and real-time data collection and
                          processing.

With over
                          150 built-in infoTypes,
                          Cloud DLP gives you the power to scan, discover,
                          classify, and report on data from virtually anywhere.
                          Cloud DLP has built-in support for scanning and
                          classifying sensitive data in Cloud Storage, BigQuery,
                          and Datastore, and a streaming content API to enable
                          support for additional data sources, custom workloads,
                          and applications.
                        Automatically mask your data to safely unlock more of
                        the cloud
Sensitive Data Protection provides tools to classify,
                          mask, tokenize, and transform sensitive elements to
                          help you better manage the data that you collect,
                          store, or use for business or analytics. With support
                          for
                          structured
                          and
                          unstructured
                          data, Sensitive Data Protection can help you preserve
                          the utility of your data for joining, analytics, and
                          AI while protecting the raw sensitive identifiers.
                        Measure re-identification risk in structured data
Enhance your understanding of data privacy risk.
                          Quasi-identifiers are partially identifying elements
                          or combinations of data that may link to a single
                          person or a very small group. Cloud DLP allows you to
                          measure statistical properties such as k-anonymity and
                          l-diversity, expanding your ability to understand and
                          protect data privacy.

 Architecture 
                        Using a Cloud DLP proxy to query a database
This concept architecture
                          uses a proxy that parses, inspects, and then either
                          logs the findings or de-identifies the results by
                          using Cloud DLP.

 Use cases 
 Use case 
Automatically
                    discover sensitive data
Understand and manage your data risk across your
                    organization automatically with Cloud DLP (available now for
                    BigQuery). Continuous visibility into your data can help you
                    make more informed decisions, manage and reduce your data
                    risk, and help stay in compliance. Data profiling can be
                    configured easily in the Cloud Console with no jobs or
                    overhead to manage, letting you focus on the outcomes and
                    your business.
 Use case 
Classify
                    data across your enterprise
Cloud DLP can help classify your data on or off cloud
                    giving you the insights you need to ensure proper
                    governance, control, and compliance. Save detailed findings
                    to BigQuery for analysis or publish summary findings to
                    other services like Data Catalog, Security Command Center,
                    Cloud Monitoring, and Pub/Sub. Audit and monitor your data
                    in Cloud Console or build custom reports and dashboards
                    using Looker Studio or your tool of choice.

 Use case 
Protect
                    sensitive data as you migrate to the cloud
Unblock more workloads as you migrate to the cloud. Cloud
                    DLP enables you to inspect and classify your sensitive data
                    in structured and unstructured workloads. De-identification
                    techniques like tokenization (pseudonymization) let you
                    preserve the utility of your data for joining or analytics
                    while reducing the risk of handling the data by obfuscating
                    the raw sensitive identifiers.

                            Automatic discovery, inspection, and classification
                          
Automatic DLP can be
                            configured directly in the Cloud Console and runs
                            continuously for you.
                            Flexible classification 
150+ pre-defined detectors
                            with a focus on quality, speed, and scale. Detectors
                            are improving and expanding all the time.
                            Simple and powerful redaction 
De-identify your data:
                            redact, mask, tokenize, and transform text and
                            images to help ensure data privacy.
                            Serverless 
Cloud DLP is ready to
                            go, no need to manage hardware, VMs, or scale. Just
                            send a little or a lot of data and Cloud DLP scales
                            for you.
                            Detailed findings with on-demand inspection 
Classification results
                            can be sent directly into BigQuery for detailed
                            analysis or export into other systems. Custom
                            reports can easily be generated in Looker
                            Studio.
                            Secure data handling 
Cloud DLP handles your
                            data securely
                            and undergoes several independent third-party audits
                            to test for data safety, privacy, and
                            security.
                            Pay-as-you-go pricing 
Cloud DLP is charged
                            based on the amount of data processed, not based on
                            a subscription service or device. This
                            customer-friendly pricing allows you to pay as you
                            go and not in advance of demand.
                            Easy workload integration 
Efficiently deploy
                            Cloud DLP with reusable templates, monitor your data
                            with periodic scans, and integrate into serverless
                            architecture with Pub/Sub notifications.
                            Custom rules 
Add your own custom
                            types, adjust detection thresholds, and create
                            detection rules to fit your needs and reduce
                            noise.
