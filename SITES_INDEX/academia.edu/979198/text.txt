Instances of cultural implications of such contacts have been indicated at: https://www.academia.edu/12144939/Indian_sprachbund_of_Sarasvati-Sindhu_Hindu_civilization_and_the_imperative_of_further_Proto-IE_language_studies Indian sprachbund of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization and the imperative of further Proto-IE language studies https://www.academia.edu/10344521/An_Indo-European_god_in_a_Gudea_Inscription An Indo-European God in a Gudea inscription (Indara) There are two relatively ancient sources for the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European: 1. Preservation in Samskritam and contibution made by Samskritam to PIE (as elaborated by Nicholas Kazanas) and 2. Meluhha (cognate mleccha) as elaborated by the identification of about 2000 glosses describing metalwork of Bronze Age and hieroglyphs used in rebus-metonymy layers identified in Indus Script corpora, for trade during the Bronze Age -- in particular, of tin-bronzes and cire perdue (lost-wax) metalcastings using alloys. These sources may provide the base data to promote studies in identifying the PIE urheimat, historical formation and evolution of PIE and IE languages, languages in Indian sprachbund. The indications of Meluhha studies based on Indus Script decipherment point to an east-to-west transmission of metalwork glosses, drawn from Meluhha sources. Two examples of IE (perhaps PIE) glosses may be cited: aya, ayas 'metal' (Rigveda) signified by the hieroglyph ayo, aya, hako 'fish' (Munda). saṁghāṭa m. ʻfitting and joining of timberʼ (Samskritam, Ramayana)Hieroglyphs: sãghāṛɔ m. ʻ lathe ʼ (Gujarati); sãgaḍ f. ʻ a body formed of two or more fruits or animals or men &c. linked together, part of a turner's apparatus ʼ, sã̄gāḍā m. ʻ frame of a building ʼ, °ḍī f. ʻ lathe ʼ(Marathi) Rebus: saṁghāta 'collection' (of metalwork) sanghāta 'holding or binding together' (Pali) Rebus: S سنګر sangar, s.m. (2nd) A breastwork of stones, etc., erected to close a pass or road; lines, entrenchments. Pl. سنګرونه sangarūnah. See باره (Pushto) Since meluhha (mleccha) was the parole, speech or vernacular as distinct from chandas (prosody), the studies may also promote a sharper understanding of the cultures of the Vedic period with particular reference to archaeometallurgy technologies along the Tin Road traversed from Hanoi, Vietnam to Haifa, Israel. That Eastern Mediterranean had regular contacts with Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization in the third and second millennia BCE is a significant pointer to the sources of early glosses of Proto-Indo-European related to Bronze-age metalwork and other cultural phenomena of the times. This explanation for the isoglosses of PIE should be reckoned in reconstructing the urheimat. This reconstruction starting with the glosses identified by the Indus Script decipherment as Meluhha (Proto-Prakritam or parole of Samskritam in Indian sprachbund) has also to take into account the arguments of Nicholas Kazanas in the following and related papers posted at http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/en/indology_en.aspDownload Free PDFView PDFin O.

Unlike former studies investigating third and second millennia exchange networks as separate entities, we examine comparatively and systematically a large corpus of published archaeological data by adopting a quantitative and spatial approach. Through this analysis, we propose that a significant degree of similarity in the shape, infrastructure and motivations behind the development and maintenance of these long-distance exchanges existed between the third and early second millennia BC.Download Free PDFView PDFश्येन syenaciti vedi discovered in Purola, Uttarakhand and links with pola 'magnetite', polad, faulad 'steel', on Vedic River Sarasvati BasinSrini Kalyanaraman"Purola A 12 km drive from Lakhamandal leads to Nowgaon from where a bifurcation through an iron bridge leaves the Yamuna river behind. The landscapes changes and pine adorned grassy valley appears. Purola, fed by the Kamal river, is undoubtedly the biggest terraced rice field valley in the entire state of Uttarakhand. The rice fields, primarily producing the rare red rice, stretch in an area more than 10 km dissected by the Kamal river. Purola is a fast developing market from where a passage leads to the ancient ASI site dating back to 2ndcentury B.C. The Yagya Vedica (burnt brick alter) is unique in its kind resembling a floating Garuda. During excavation a good number of Sunga-Kushana period (2nd century B.C.- 2nd century A.D.) red wares and coins belonging to the Kuninda rulers were discovered. Purola valley is the biggest divide between the Yamuna and the Tons Valley." This map shows the trek route from Naugaon to Har-ki-dun the glacier point closes to Rupin, Supin gaciers which yielded the ancient Vedic River Sarasvati. The route is from Naugaon-Purol-Jermola-Mori-Netwar-Saur-Taluka-Sema-Osla-Harkidun (Valley of the Divinities) http://www.mussooriehandbook.com/index.php/purolaCentrally protected sites(excavated by A.S.I Finds at Purola include Painted Gray Ware dated to ca. 1000 BCE. 24x18 m. vedika discovered in Purola, ca. 2nd cent. BC to 1st cent. CE. Laid out in the east-west direction. "Researchers also uncovered a square central chamber measuring 60 x 60 cm. in the middle of the altar. Excavation of this pit yielded five red-ware miniature bowls containing ash, charcoal, sandy clay and copper coins of the Kuninda period. But the most important discovery was an impressed gold-leaf showing a human figure in flowing apparel. Along with this was found a circular gold pendant and a small piece of a -chain. A lot of charcoal and charred bones were also recovered from the chamber." https://www.facebook.com/ouruki/posts/720924017918479 श्येन [p= 1095,2]m. a hawk , falcon , eagle , any bird of prey (esp. the eagle that brings down सोम to man) RV. &c; firewood laid in the shape of an eagle S3ulbas.

PUROLA, District Uttarkashi The ancient site at Purola is located on the left bank of river Kamal in District Uttarkashi. The excavation carried out by Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna University, Srinagar Garhwal. The site yielded the remains of Painted Grey Ware (PGW) from the earliest level along with other associated materials include terracotta figurines, beads, potter-stamp and the dental and femur portions of domesticated horse (Equas Cabalus Linn). The most important finding from the site is a brick alter identified as Syena chitti by the excavator. The structure is in the shape of a flying eagle Garuda, head facing east with outstretched wings having a square chamber in the middle yielded the remains of pottery assignable to circa first century B.C. to second century AD along with copper coin of Kuninda , bone pieces and a thin gold leaf impressed with a human figure identified as Agni have also been recovered from the central chamber. http://www.asidehraduncircle.in/excavation.html s'yena 'eagle' (Samskritam) has a synonym: Hieroglyph: పోలడు (p. 0825) [ pōlaḍu ] , పోలిగాడు or దూడలపోలడు pōlaḍu.

Magnetite is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring igneous and metamorphic rocks with black or brownish-black with a metallic luster. These magnetite ore stones could have been identified as pola iron by Meluhha speakers.

Perhaps, the human figure is comparable to the image of the 'archer' shown on Kalibangan terracotta cake. If so, the image may also be inferred as kamAThiyo 'archer' rebus: kammaTa 'coiner, mint'. Perhaps, the processing done in the fire-altar related to some metallic alloys to create Kuninda type coins.

A Maritime tin route from Hanoi to Haifa has been posited to transport tin which was a critical component to alloy with copper to sustain the Bronze Age revolution. On this route which predated Silk Road by two millennia, the Persian Gulf (Straits of Hormuz), together with the Straits of Malacca, was the critical maritime link. Archaeological reports on sites along the Persian Gulf have cumulatively evidenced the trade and cultural contacts Meluhha (Sarasvati civilization) merchants and artisans (some with settlements in Ancient Near East) had with Ancient Near East and Ancient Far East as active participants in the revolution. The Gundestrup cauldron and Pillar of Boatmen are evidence of the Meluhhan contact areas in the Ancient NEar East. So are the hieroglyphs of frog, peacock, elephant, antelopes, heron on Dong Son bronze drums evidenc of the Meluhhan contact areas in the Tin Belt of the Globe in Ancient Far East. Glyptic art of the Seals from Persian Gulf are a combination of Mesopotamian syles of cylinder seals combined with Indus Script hieroglyphs. Meluhhans had a flourishing tradw with Sumer ca. 2350 BCE. The inscriptions of Persian Gulf cylinder seald and also Dilmun-type stamp seals provide conclusive evidence for the presence of Meluhha merchants/artisans in the Persian Gulf and interacting with Ur and Susa. The trade transactions with Susa are attested by a Susa pot with the cargo of metal implements, tools, weapons. The decipherment of Indus Script hieroglyphs on the Susa pot as metalwork catalogues are presented in: Annex A Susa pot with Indus Script hieroglyphs is a 'rosetta stone' for Indus Script Corpora of metalwork proclamations The presence of Munda in Austro-asiatic speaker areas of Ancient Far East is well-attested by Austro-asiatic etyma also present in glosses of Indian sprachbund (pace FBJ Kuiper on Munda words in Samskrtam).

Kalyanaraman, Sarasvati Research Centre The thesis of this monograph is that 1. Indian Ocean Rim and Himalayan riverine waterways constituted the maritime trade route linking Hanoi (Vietnam) and Haifa (Israel) in 3rd millennium BCE, an ancient Maritime Tin Route which pre-dated Silk Road by two millennia; and 2. evidences for guilds of metalwork artisans and seafaring merchants of Ancient India, establish the contributions of the guilds to creating Wealth of Nations. In this mnograph, literary, hydrological, archaeo-metallurgical and archaeological evidences are organized in three sections. The re-discovery of Vedic River Sarasvati in North-West Bharat is an epochal mission which redefines the identity of present-day Bharatiya-s. The decipherment of over 8000 inscriptions of the Sarasvati Civilization has firmly anchored the writing system to a documentation of wealth-accounting ledgers and metalwork catalogues of the Tin-Bronze Revolution from 3rd millennium BCE. The artisans and seafaring merchants mediated the maritime trade transaction for nearly two millennia linking Ancient Far East and Ancient Near East.
