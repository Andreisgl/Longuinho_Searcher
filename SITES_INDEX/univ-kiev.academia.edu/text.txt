Localization of aerosol sources in East-European region by back-trajectory statisticsInternational Journal of Remote Sensing,  2014ABSTRACT A concentration-weighted trajectory method for aerosol source localization based on join... more ABSTRACT A concentration-weighted trajectory method for aerosol source localization based on joint statistical analysis of aerosol column volume concentrations and back-trajectory data was used to estimate the spatial distribution of aerosol sources in the East-European region. The aerosol column volume concentration data measured at five AERONET network sites, Belsk, Minsk, Kyiv, Moldova/Kishinev, and Sevastopol, were used. The geographical areas responsible for increased aerosol content at the monitoring sites were mapped separately for coarse-mode and fine-mode aerosol fractions. The investigated area is located between 42° and 62° N in latitude and between 12° and 50° E in longitude. It was shown that the northeastern territories (in relation to the monitoring stations) give a small contribution to the coarse-mode aerosol content. The events of increased coarse-mode aerosol concentration have been caused by sources in the southeastern regions. On average, the air masses with a large content of coarse-mode aerosol particles were delivered to all stations from regions around Donetsk, Rostov-on-Don, and Kharkiv cities. The fine-mode aerosol fraction originated from areas of Tambov, Voronezh, and Kharkiv cities. The calculated aerosol source regions partly correspond to European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme data for eastern Europe. The cause of difference between calculated regions responsible for increased aerosol content at the monitoring sites and the sources of particle emission according to European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme data are discussed. http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/j99ACAgV2rNeP7uJ8CAR/fullSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper presents an investigation of aerosol seasonal variations in several urban sites in the East European region. Our analysis of seasonal variations of optical and physical aerosol parameters is based on the sun-photometer 2008–2012 data from three urban ground-based AERONET sites in Ukraine (Kyiv, Kyiv-AO, and Lugansk) and one site in Belarus (Minsk), as well as on satellite POLDER instrument data for urban areas in Ukraine. Aerosol amount and optical thickness values exhibit peaks in the spring (April–May) and late summer (August), whereas minimum values are seen in late autumn over the Kyiv and Minsk sites. The results show that aerosol fine mode particles are most frequently detected during the spring and late summer seasons. The seasonal variation similarity in the two regions points to the resemblance in basic aerosol sources which are closely related to properties of aerosol particles. However the aerosol amount and properties change noticeably from year to year and from region to region. The analysis of seasonal aerosol optical thickness variations over the urban sites in the eastern and western parts of Ukraine according to both ground-based and POLDER data exhibits the same traits. In particular, over Kyiv, the values of the Angstrom exponent are lower in April of 2011 than in 2009 and 2010, while aerosol optical thickness values are almost the same, which can be explained by an increase in the amount of coarse mode particles in the atmosphere, such as Saharan dust. Moreover, the coarse mode particles prevailed over suburbs and the center of Kyiv during a third of all available days of observation in 2012. In general, the fine and coarse mode particles&amp;#39; modal radii averaged over 2008–2012 range from 0.1 to 0.2 μm and 2 to 5 μm, respectively, during the period from April to September. The single scattering albedo and refractive index values of these particles correspond to a mix of urban-industrial, biomass burning, and dust aerosols. In addition, strongly absorbing particles were observed in the period from October to March, and the modal radius of fine and coarse mode particles changed from month to month widely.

The transfer of fine- and coarse mode particles is considered in warm and cold times of year. The territories, where the air masses bringing to the monitoring stations the aerosol with the total volume column content exceeded mean values in 1.5 times, were revealed. For the same stations the cases of enhanced fine and coarse aerosol faction concentrations and correspondent source regions have been revealed by the method of trajectory statistics. The enhanced aerosol concentration areas were identified with potential sources. In the average for all stations the air masses with the large concentration values of coarse mode aerosol particles were brought from the Donetsk, Rostov, and Kharkiv regions. The fine mode aerosol fraction comes mostly from Tambov, Voronezh and Kharkov areas. The localized aerosol source regions are partially correspond to the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) data for East Europe. The cause of difference between calculated regions of enhanced aerosol content releases and sources of particle emission by EMEP data are discussed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our analysis of seasonal variations of optical and physical aerosol parameters is based on the sun-photometer 2008–2013 data from two urban ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sites in Ukraine (Kyiv, Lugansk) as well as on satellite POLDER instrument data for urban–industrial areas in Ukraine. We also analyzed the data from one AERONET site in Belarus (Minsk) in order to compare with the Ukrainian sites. Aerosol amount and optical depth (AOD) values in the atmosphere columns over the large urbanized areas like Kyiv and Minsk have maximum values in the spring (April–May) and late summer (August), whereas minimum values are observed in late autumn. The results show that fine-mode particles are most frequently detected during the spring and late summer seasons. The analysis of the seasonal AOD variations over the urban–industrial areas in the eastern and central parts of Ukraine according to both ground-based and POLDER data exhibits the similar traits. The seasonal variation similarity in the regions denotes the resemblance in basic aerosol sources that are closely related to properties of aerosol particles. The behavior of basic aerosol parameters in the western part of Ukraine is different from eastern and central regions and shows an earlier appearance of the spring and summer AOD maxima. Spectral single-scattering albedo, complex refractive index and size distribution of aerosol particles in the atmosphere column over Kyiv have different behavior for warm (April–October) and cold seasons. The seasonal features of fine and coarse aerosol particle behavior over the Kyiv site were analyzed. A prevailing influence of the fine-mode particles on the optical properties of the aerosol layer over the region has been established. The back-trajectory and cluster analysis techniques were applied to study the seasonal back trajectories and prevailing directions of the arrived air mass for the Kyiv and Minsk sites.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Fire impact on aerosol distribution over Ukraine from satellite and ground-based measurements (in ukrainian)Fire impact on aerosol distribution over Ukraine from satellite and ground-based measurements (in ukrainian),  Dec 1, 2013We analyze the sources of aerosol transport from forest, steppe, peat and agricultural fires over... more We analyze the sources of aerosol transport from forest, steppe, peat and agricultural fires over Ukraine from 2002 to 2012. Some data from the satellite instruments POLDER/PARASOL and MODIS were used to characterize the distribution of aerosol particles in the atmosphere and to visualize fire locations on Earth’s surface, respectively. The cluster analysis was used to classify air mass back trajectories using the HYSPLIT model. Moreover, the data obtained by ground-based network AERONET were used for analysis of volume size distributions over Kyiv site during 2008-2012. The maximum values of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 870 nm wavelength ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 were observed from 14 to 16 August 2010 over Eastern and Central Ukraine, which were caused by strong forest and peat wildfires in the central area of European part of Russia. The sources of aerosol combustion were located at greater distance from Kyiv during this period in comparison to August 2008, when fires occurred in the Central and Southern Ukraine. The monthly average AOT ranging from 0.05 to 0.08 was observed over Northern and Central Ukraine as a result of steppe wildfires in Belarus from April to May 2006. It was determined that transboundary transport of atmosphere plays an important role in the aerosol distribution and affects on air quality over all the Eastern European countries. The radii of fine fraction aerosols corresponding to maxima of the size distribution are equal to 0.2-0.25 μm over Kyiv site during wildfires which may be evidence for the presence of biomass burning and industrial aerosols simultaneously. Furthermore, some features are observed in the size distribution of coarse fraction in the form of double peak from April to June which can be explained by the seasonal nature of particle origin. The volume size distribution is characterized by the most significant fraction of fine particles in May-July 2012 as compared to the same period in other years.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The spatial variability of PM2.5 over Europe using satellite POLDER-3/PARASOL dataThe spatial variability of PM2.5 over Europe using satellite POLDER-3/PARASOL data,  Dec 20, 2013The paper presents the results of the monthly mean PM2.5 analysis in the period from 2005 to 2013... more The paper presents the results of the monthly mean PM2.5 analysis in the period from 2005 to 2013 over the Europe based on the connection between daily fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) by surface in-situ measurements in AIRBASE network and column aerosol optical thickness (AOT) derived from POLDER-3/PARASOL satellite sensor. The regression function between PM2.5 and AOT was derived from measurements done over Europe in the period from April to October 2007. Considering 749 match-up data points over 20 fine particle monitoring sites, we found that the POLDER-3/PARASOL derived AOT at 865 nm is correlated with collocated PM2.5 measurements with a correlation coecient 0.62 (RMS = 3.26). According to the obtained linear regression PM2.5 = 73.4 × AOT865 + 9.6, a signicant offset caused an introduction of the threshold of 0.01 in monthly mean AOT for assessment of PM2.5 based on satellite data. Therefore, only PM2.5 values larger than 10.3 µg/m^3 can be obtained using this method. According to results the monthly mean PM2.5 in the period from 2005 to 2013 over the Europe is usually characterised by values less than 12 µg/m^3 (classified as good by Air Quality Categories, AQC), but values ranging from 12 to 18 µg/m^3 (classified as moderate) are found in the densely populated and industrial areas, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, the Ruhr and Danube area, Northern Italy, Poland, Romania and Eastern Ukraine. Additionally, the maximum values of PM2.5 over Eastern Europe are observed during forest, peat and agricultural wildfires in May 2006 (15-21 µg/m^3), April 2009 (14-18 µg/m^3) and August 2010 (35-55 µg/m^3 , classified as unhealthy for sensitive groups). An extended set of aerosol parameters including particle size distribution, complex refractive index, as well as parameters characterising aerosol particle shape and vertical distribution will be analysed in the future work.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Recent developments of atmospheric research in UkraineIn recent years the Joint Laboratory of Atmospheric Optics and Aerosols of Ukraine has been carry... more In recent years the Joint Laboratory of Atmospheric Optics and Aerosols of Ukraine has been carrying out atmospheric research in cooperation with international program of climate change studies. Our current research is aimed at studying aerosol and ozone in the Earth's atmosphere, because these constituents have a substantial influence on climate. In Ukraine, atmospheric aerosol remote sensing in the PHOTONS/AERONET network has been carried out since 2006 in Sevastopol and 2008 in Kyiv. For this research, sunphotometers CIMEL CE318 have been used. A mobile AERONET station has been developed, which consists of CE318N and portable Microtops II sunphotometers, as well as two self-designed experimental portable sunphotometer models and an ozonometer for aerosol and ozone study. The team's findings on aerosol spectral optical thickness, as well as optical and physical properties of aerosol particles (single-scattering albedo, distribution of particles by sizes, Ångström exponent), are discussed in the paper. In 2010, upon the establishment of the new regional atmospheric research station Nr. 498 Kyiv-Goloseyev, the team commenced with measurements of the total column density and vertical distribution of ozone, using the Dobson D040 spectrophotometer, in the framework of the Global Atmosphere Watch Program of WMO. The station has also been equipped with a Vaisala automatic weather station, a surface ozone 49i analyzer, and an experimental complex for monitoring secondary space rays. The aerosol and ozone measurements have been continuously submitted to data centres of AERONET (http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and WMO (www.woudc.org/data/). For aerosol and ozone research, the data from satellite sources (POLDER, MODIS, OMI, and SCIAMACHY) have also been analysed. The work on a proposal to design, build, and launch the space radiometer/polarimeter for global monitoring of atmospheric aerosols has commenced recently. This instrument should have the capability of investigating microphysical properties of aerosol particles. An overview of the devices, methods of data retrieval analysis of aerosol parameters and ozone dynamics, is presented in this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The analysis was based on the POLDER/PARASOL and POLDER-2/ADEOS satellites and AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) ground-based sun photometer observations. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of the studied area is characterized by values (referenced to 870 nm wavelength) ranging from 0.05 to 0.2, except for in the period of July–August 2010 with strong forest and peat wildfires when the AOT typical values range from 0.3 to 0.5 according to both retrievals. The analysis of seasonal dynamics of aerosol loading has revealed two AOT high value peaks. The spring peak observed in April–May is the result of solitary transportation of Saharan dust in the atmosphere over Eastern Europe, infrequent agricultural fires, transportation of sea salt aerosols by southern winds to Ukraine and Moldova from the Black and Azov seas. The autumn peak in August–September is associated with forest and peat wildfires, considerable transportation of Saharan dust and the presence of soil dust aerosols due to harvesting activity. The maximum values of AOT are observed in May 2006 (0.1–0.15), April 2009 (0.07–0.15) and August 2010 (0.2–0.5). Furthermore, the study has identified a distinct pattern of anthropogenic aerosols over the industrial areas, especially in central Ukraine and eastern Belarus as well as Moscow region in Russia.  The comparison of the AOT derived by standard algorithm POLDER/PARASOL with those recomputed from AERONET inversions for fine mode particles with radius < 0.3 μm was performed over several AERONET sites. The correlation coefficients for the POLDER/AERONET AOT retrieval comparisons are equal: 0.78 for Moscow site, 0.76 – Minsk, 0.86 – Belsk, 0.81 – Moldova (period 2005–2009), 0.93 – Kyiv and 0.63 for Sevastopol sites (2008–2009). The deviations are explained by the spatial inhomogeneity of the surface polarization that has a stronger effect on aerosol retrieval for clear atmospheric conditions with low aerosol loading when surface impact on satellite observations is more pronounced. In addition, the preliminary analysis of the detailed aerosol properties derived by a new generation PARASOL algorithm was evaluated. The comparison of AOT and single scattering albedo retrieved from the POLDER/PARASOL observations over Kyiv with the closest AERONET retrievals within 30 min of satellite overpass time and with a cloudless day shows acceptable agreement of the aerosol dynamics. The correspondence of those data is observed even for extreme AOT440 value 1.14, which was caused by the forest and peat fires in August 2010.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Aerosol seasonal variations over urban–industrial regions in Ukraine according to AERONET and POLDER measurementsby Gennadi Milinevsky and Andrii BovchaliukThe paper presents an investigation of aerosol seasonal variations in several urban–industrial re... more The paper presents an investigation of aerosol seasonal variations in several urban–industrial regions in Ukraine. Our analysis of seasonal variations of optical and physical aerosol parameters is based on the sun-photometer 2008–2013 data from two urban ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sites in Ukraine (Kyiv, Lugansk) as well as on satellite POLDER instrument data for urban–industrial areas in Ukraine. We also analyzed the data from one AERONET site in Belarus (Minsk) in order to compare with the Ukrainian sites. Aerosol amount and optical depth (AOD) values in the atmosphere columns over the large urbanized areas like Kyiv and Minsk have maximum values in the spring (April–May) and late summer (August), whereas minimum values are observed in late autumn. The results show that fine-mode particles are most frequently detected during the spring and late summer seasons. The analysis of the seasonal AOD variations over the urban–industrial areas in the eastern and central parts of Ukraine according to both ground-based and POLDER data exhibits the similar traits. The seasonal variation similarity in the regions denotes the resemblance in basic aerosol sources that are closely related to properties of aerosol particles. The behavior of basic aerosol parameters in the western part of Ukraine is different from eastern and central regions and shows an earlier appearance of the spring and summer AOD maxima. Spectral single-scattering albedo, complex refractive index and size distribution of aerosol particles in the atmosphere column over Kyiv have different behavior for warm (April–October) and cold seasons. The seasonal features of fine and coarse aerosol particle behavior over the Kyiv site were analyzed. A prevailing influence of the fine-mode particles on the optical properties of the aerosol layer over the region has been established. The back-trajectory and cluster analysis techniques were applied to study the seasonal back trajectories and prevailing directions of the arrived air mass for the Kyiv and Minsk sites.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Fire impact on aerosol distribution over Ukraine from satellite and ground-based measurements (in ukrainian)Fire impact on aerosol distribution over Ukraine from satellite and ground-based measurements (in ukrainian),  Dec 1, 2013We analyze the sources of aerosol transport from forest, steppe, peat and agricultural fires over... more We analyze the sources of aerosol transport from forest, steppe, peat and agricultural fires over Ukraine from 2002 to 2012. Some data from the satellite instruments POLDER/PARASOL and MODIS were used to characterize the distribution of aerosol particles in the atmosphere and to visualize fire locations on Earth’s surface, respectively. The cluster analysis was used to classify air mass back trajectories using the HYSPLIT model. Moreover, the data obtained by ground-based network AERONET were used for analysis of volume size distributions over Kyiv site during 2008-2012. The maximum values of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 870 nm wavelength ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 were observed from 14 to 16 August 2010 over Eastern and Central Ukraine, which were caused by strong forest and peat wildfires in the central area of European part of Russia. The sources of aerosol combustion were located at greater distance from Kyiv during this period in comparison to August 2008, when fires occurred in the Central and Southern Ukraine. The monthly average AOT ranging from 0.05 to 0.08 was observed over Northern and Central Ukraine as a result of steppe wildfires in Belarus from April to May 2006. It was determined that transboundary transport of atmosphere plays an important role in the aerosol distribution and affects on air quality over all the Eastern European countries. The radii of fine fraction aerosols corresponding to maxima of the size distribution are equal to 0.2-0.25 μm over Kyiv site during wildfires which may be evidence for the presence of biomass burning and industrial aerosols simultaneously. Furthermore, some features are observed in the size distribution of coarse fraction in the form of double peak from April to June which can be explained by the seasonal nature of particle origin. The volume size distribution is characterized by the most significant fraction of fine particles in May-July 2012 as compared to the same period in other years.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The spatial variability of PM2.5 over Europe using satellite POLDER-3/PARASOL dataThe spatial variability of PM2.5 over Europe using satellite POLDER-3/PARASOL data,  Dec 20, 2013The paper presents the results of the monthly mean PM2.5 analysis in the period from 2005 to 2013... more The paper presents the results of the monthly mean PM2.5 analysis in the period from 2005 to 2013 over the Europe based on the connection between daily fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) by surface in-situ measurements in AIRBASE network and column aerosol optical thickness (AOT) derived from POLDER-3/PARASOL satellite sensor. The regression function between PM2.5 and AOT was derived from measurements done over Europe in the period from April to October 2007. Considering 749 match-up data points over 20 fine particle monitoring sites, we found that the POLDER-3/PARASOL derived AOT at 865 nm is correlated with collocated PM2.5 measurements with a correlation coecient 0.62 (RMS = 3.26). According to the obtained linear regression PM2.5 = 73.4 × AOT865 + 9.6, a signicant offset caused an introduction of the threshold of 0.01 in monthly mean AOT for assessment of PM2.5 based on satellite data. Therefore, only PM2.5 values larger than 10.3 µg/m^3 can be obtained using this method. According to results the monthly mean PM2.5 in the period from 2005 to 2013 over the Europe is usually characterised by values less than 12 µg/m^3 (classified as good by Air Quality Categories, AQC), but values ranging from 12 to 18 µg/m^3 (classified as moderate) are found in the densely populated and industrial areas, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, the Ruhr and Danube area, Northern Italy, Poland, Romania and Eastern Ukraine. Additionally, the maximum values of PM2.5 over Eastern Europe are observed during forest, peat and agricultural wildfires in May 2006 (15-21 µg/m^3), April 2009 (14-18 µg/m^3) and August 2010 (35-55 µg/m^3 , classified as unhealthy for sensitive groups). An extended set of aerosol parameters including particle size distribution, complex refractive index, as well as parameters characterising aerosol particle shape and vertical distribution will be analysed in the future work.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Recent developments of atmospheric research in UkraineIn recent years the Joint Laboratory of Atmospheric Optics and Aerosols of Ukraine has been carry... more In recent years the Joint Laboratory of Atmospheric Optics and Aerosols of Ukraine has been carrying out atmospheric research in cooperation with international program of climate change studies. Our current research is aimed at studying aerosol and ozone in the Earth's atmosphere, because these constituents have a substantial influence on climate. In Ukraine, atmospheric aerosol remote sensing in the PHOTONS/AERONET network has been carried out since 2006 in Sevastopol and 2008 in Kyiv. For this research, sunphotometers CIMEL CE318 have been used. A mobile AERONET station has been developed, which consists of CE318N and portable Microtops II sunphotometers, as well as two self-designed experimental portable sunphotometer models and an ozonometer for aerosol and ozone study. The team's findings on aerosol spectral optical thickness, as well as optical and physical properties of aerosol particles (single-scattering albedo, distribution of particles by sizes, Ångström exponent), are discussed in the paper. In 2010, upon the establishment of the new regional atmospheric research station Nr. 498 Kyiv-Goloseyev, the team commenced with measurements of the total column density and vertical distribution of ozone, using the Dobson D040 spectrophotometer, in the framework of the Global Atmosphere Watch Program of WMO. The station has also been equipped with a Vaisala automatic weather station, a surface ozone 49i analyzer, and an experimental complex for monitoring secondary space rays. The aerosol and ozone measurements have been continuously submitted to data centres of AERONET (http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and WMO (www.woudc.org/data/). For aerosol and ozone research, the data from satellite sources (POLDER, MODIS, OMI, and SCIAMACHY) have also been analysed. The work on a proposal to design, build, and launch the space radiometer/polarimeter for global monitoring of atmospheric aerosols has commenced recently. This instrument should have the capability of investigating microphysical properties of aerosol particles. An overview of the devices, methods of data retrieval analysis of aerosol parameters and ozone dynamics, is presented in this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Variability of aerosol properties over Eastern Europe observed from ground and satellites in the period from 2003 to 2011The paper presents some results of the study on aerosol variability in the period from 2003 to 20... more The paper presents some results of the study on aerosol variability in the period from 2003 to 2011 over the Eastern Europe region, with latitude ranging from 40° N to 60° N and longitude from 20° E to 50° E. The analysis was based on the POLDER/PARASOL and POLDER-2/ADEOS satellites and AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) ground-based sun photometer observations. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of the studied area is characterized by values (referenced to 870 nm wavelength) ranging from 0.05 to 0.2, except for in the period of July–August 2010 with strong forest and peat wildfires when the AOT typical values range from 0.3 to 0.5 according to both retrievals. The analysis of seasonal dynamics of aerosol loading has revealed two AOT high value peaks. The spring peak observed in April–May is the result of solitary transportation of Saharan dust in the atmosphere over Eastern Europe, infrequent agricultural fires, transportation of sea salt aerosols by southern winds to Ukraine and Moldova from the Black and Azov seas. The autumn peak in August–September is associated with forest and peat wildfires, considerable transportation of Saharan dust and the presence of soil dust aerosols due to harvesting activity. The maximum values of AOT are observed in May 2006 (0.1–0.15), April 2009 (0.07–0.15) and August 2010 (0.2–0.5). Furthermore, the study has identified a distinct pattern of anthropogenic aerosols over the industrial areas, especially in central Ukraine and eastern Belarus as well as Moscow region in Russia.  The comparison of the AOT derived by standard algorithm POLDER/PARASOL with those recomputed from AERONET inversions for fine mode particles with radius < 0.3 μm was performed over several AERONET sites. The correlation coefficients for the POLDER/AERONET AOT retrieval comparisons are equal: 0.78 for Moscow site, 0.76 – Minsk, 0.86 – Belsk, 0.81 – Moldova (period 2005–2009), 0.93 – Kyiv and 0.63 for Sevastopol sites (2008–2009). The deviations are explained by the spatial inhomogeneity of the surface polarization that has a stronger effect on aerosol retrieval for clear atmospheric conditions with low aerosol loading when surface impact on satellite observations is more pronounced. In addition, the preliminary analysis of the detailed aerosol properties derived by a new generation PARASOL algorithm was evaluated. The comparison of AOT and single scattering albedo retrieved from the POLDER/PARASOL observations over Kyiv with the closest AERONET retrievals within 30 min of satellite overpass time and with a cloudless day shows acceptable agreement of the aerosol dynamics. The correspondence of those data is observed even for extreme AOT440 value 1.14, which was caused by the forest and peat fires in August 2010.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
