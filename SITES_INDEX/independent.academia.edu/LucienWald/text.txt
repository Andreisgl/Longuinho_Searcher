Solar Atlas for the Mediterraneanby Philippe BLANC, Etienne Wey, and Lucien WaldABSTRACT The solar resource is the &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; of solar energy applications and its ... more ABSTRACT The solar resource is the &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; of solar energy applications and its availability is a key economic parameter in system design. Even though the southern and eastern Mediterranean region is served by several commercial data providers, in a public domain, so far only coarse resolution (100 km) data or data with limited temporal coverage is available. For more rapid development of policies and to attract the industrial interest in this region a more enhanced and easy to access free information is needed. The project will bring high resolution (1 km), long term coverage of at least 15 years data on the available solar resources for the region covering the countries Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Palestine National Authority, Mauretania and Turkey. The resource data will be derived from Earth Observation satellite data, based on published and transparent methodologies and the data will be validated with existing ground measurements in the region. The database will be provided by SOLEMI and Helioclim (SoDa) sources - Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI). The data will be made available via a distributed information system which will ensure the ease access to the data. The free access to the data will include historical annual and monthly averages, and more detailed data products and services will remain the domain of commercial data providers. This paper will show the first prototype of the user interface for an easy web access to the solar radiation as well as ancillary geographical data. With the presentation of this paper we aim to encourage potential users to give us feedback on the further development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A new method for assessing surface solar irradiance: Heliosat-4by Philippe BLANC and Lucien WaldABSTRACT Downwelling shortwave irradiance at surface (SSI) is more and more often assessed by mea... more ABSTRACT Downwelling shortwave irradiance at surface (SSI) is more and more often assessed by means of satellite-derived estimates of optical properties of the atmosphere. Performances are judged satisfactory for the time being but there is an increasing need for the assessment of the direct and diffuse components of the SSI. MINES ParisTech and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are currently developing the Heliosat-4 method to assess the SSI and its components in a more accurate way than current practices. This method is composed by two parts: a clear sky module based on the radiative transfer model libRadtran, and a cloud-ground module using two-stream and delta-Eddington approximations for clouds and a database of ground albedo. Advanced products derived from geostationary satellites and recent Earth Observation missions are the inputs of the Heliosat-4 method. Such products are: cloud optical depth, cloud phase, cloud type and cloud coverage from APOLLO of DLR, aerosol optical depth, aerosol type, water vapor in clear-sky, ozone from MACC products (FP7), and ground albedo from MODIS of NASA. In this communication, we briefly present Heliosat-4 and focus on its performances. The results of Heliosat-4 for the period 2004-2010 will be compared to the measurements made in five stations within the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. Extensive statistic analysis as well as case studies are performed in order to better understand Heliosat-4 and have an in-depth view of the performance of Heliosat-4, to understand its advantages comparing to existing methods and to identify its defaults for future improvements.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It covers Europe, Africa and Atlantic Ocean. In average, comparison with hourly measurements made in meteorological stations yields a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9, a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) around 20% of the mean measured irradiance and a relative mean bias error (rMBE) below 2%. HelioClim-3 can be accessed via the SoDa Service (www.soda- is.org). The availability and quality of HelioClim-3 data should help in performing steps towards a better knowledge of the surface solar irradiance and its variations over recent years.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These data are considered as a reference against which satellite-derived estimates are compared. Long-term radiation and meteorological measurements are available from a large number of measuring stations. However, close examination of the data often reveals a lack of quality, often for extended periods of time. This lack of quality has been the reason, in many cases, of the rejection of large amount of available data. The quality data must be checked before their use in order to guarantee the inputs for the methods used in modelling, monitoring, forecast, etc. To control their quality, data should be submitted to several conditions or tests. After this checking, data that are not flagged by any of the test is released as a plausible data. In this work, it has been performed a bibliographical research of quality control tests for the common meteorological variables (ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind speed) and for the usual solar radiometrical variables (horizontal global and diffuse components of the solar radiation and the beam normal component). The different tests have been grouped according to the variable and the average time period (sub-hourly, hourly, daily and monthly averages). The quality test may be classified as follows: • Range checks: test that verify values are within a specific range. There are two types of range checks, those based on extrema and those based on rare observations. • Step check: test aimed at detecting unrealistic jumps or stagnation in the time series. • Consistency checks: test that verify the relationship between two or more time series. The gathered quality tests are applicable for all latitudes as they have not been optimized regionally nor seasonably with the aim of being generic. They have been applied to ground measurements in several geographic locations, what result in the detection of some control tests that are no longer adequate, due to different reasons. After the modification of some test, based in our experience, a set of quality control tests is now presented, updated according to technology advances and classified. The presented set of quality tests allows radiation and meteorological data to be tested in order to know their plausibility to be used as inputs in theoretical or empirical methods for scientific research. The research leading to those results has partly receive funding from the European Union&amp;#39;s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement no. 262892 (ENDORSE project).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We compare the results of three fast algorithms to the SPA and establish their performances. We propose a new algorithm SG2 that is faster than the three others and offers the same level of accuracy than the most accurate, i.e., maximum error in solar vector of order of 10″, for a multi-decadal time period, with an example of a 50-year period: 1980-2030. This performance is achieved by devising approximations of the original equations of the SPA to decrease the number of operations. This yields a decrease in accuracy that is controlled and bounded. The mathematical tools permitting to determine these approximations with a selected uncertainty level are described.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

How close to detailed spectral calculations is the k-distribution method and correlated-k approximation of Kato et al.(1999) in each spectral interval?by Philippe BLANC and Lucien WaldABSTRACT The k-distribution method and the correlated-k approximation of Kato et al. (1999) is a ... more ABSTRACT The k-distribution method and the correlated-k approximation of Kato et al. (1999) is a smart approach originally designed for broadband calculations of the solar radiation at ground level by dividing the solar spectrum in 32 spectral bands. The approach is a priori not suited for calculation of spectral irradiance. Nevertheless, this paper evaluates its performance when compared to more detailed spectral calculations serving as references for the spectral intervals no. 3 [283, 307] nm to 26 [1613, 1965] nm for clear and cloudy situations. The evaluation is based on numerical simulations. The clearer the sky, the greater the root mean square error (RMSE) in all bands. In the spectral intervals no. 3 and 4 [307, 328] nm, the irradiance is underestimated by large – approximately −90 % and −17 % in relative value -because the wavelength interval is large with respect to the absorption by ozone and a single value of ozone cross section is not enough for each interval. For each spectral interval from no. 5 [328, 363] nm to no. 18 [743, 791] nm, and for both global and direct radiation, the bias and the RMSE are less than 1.5 % of the irradiance in the corresponding interval under clear skies and may amount to 3 % in cloudy conditions. For greater wavelength intervals no. 19 to no. 26, the relative bias and RMSE show a tendency to increase with wavelength and may reach 8 % and 7 % for global and direct under clear skies respectively, and 11 % and 15 % under cloudy skies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
