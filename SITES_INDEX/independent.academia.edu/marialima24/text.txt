Prevalence of insomnia and associated socio-demographic factors in a Brazilian community: the Bambuı́ studySleep Medicine,  2002Population-based studies of insomnia among adults residing in communities in developing countries... more Population-based studies of insomnia among adults residing in communities in developing countries are rare. The objectives of this population-based study were to determine the prevalence and factors associated with insomnia among adults (18 years and over) living in a Brazilian town with 15,000 inhabitants (Bambuí MG) and to determine how the use of different definitions of insomnia affect its prevalence. A total of 87.3% of 1221 randomly selected individuals aged 18+ participated. Prevalences were estimated based on different definitions. To determine the associated characteristics, insomnia was defined as a complaint in the last month, occurring at least three times a week, causing distress. (1) Prevalence ranged from 12.0 to 76.3%; (2) prevalence of insomnia, as defined above, was 35.4%; (3) prevalence among women increased with age and was higher than that of men; (4) insomnia was independently associated with less education in both sexes, and among females it was associated with older age (60+ years). The prevalence of insomnia in Bambuí was high, similar to that of urban centers of developed countries; this investigation substantiated the importance of operational criteria in studies of insomnia.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity against Trypanosoma cruzi is only mediated by protective antibodiesParasite Immunology,  1985Summary The antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) to Trypanosoma cruzi blood forms (Btry) u... more Summary The antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) to Trypanosoma cruzi blood forms (Btry) using non-adherent spleen cells is only mediated by sera from chronic chagasic patients or mice. Both display ‘lytic antibodies’ (LA), which are immunoglobulins directed against epitopes only present in living BTry, and ‘conventional serology antibodies’ (CSA). which are responsible for the positive diagnostic tests in Chagas disease. Sera from mice immunized with different T. cruzi antigens or from treated patients (displaying only CSA but not LA) are unable to mediate ADCC. These data confirm the central role played by LA in the host resistance against T. cruzi. Moreover, they probably explain why most immunizing agents used as vaccines in Chagas' disease and which ellicit CSA but not LA, do not display significant protection against T. cruzi. We also demonstrate that trypsinization of BTry increases significantly the rate of parasite destruction by ADCC, suggesting that enzyme sensitive membrane components may help BTry to evade from this immune effector mechanism.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The solution found by this method satisfies the Strong Complementarity Slackness Condition (SCSC) and maximizes the product of the positive components among all SCSC solutions. The first property is critical in the use of DEA and the second one contributes significantly to the reliability of the solution.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

LIQUID-TO-PARTICLE HEAT TRANSFER DURING CONTINUOUS TUBE FLOW: INFLUENCE of FLOW RATE and PARTICLE to TUBE DIAMETER RATIOJournal of Food Process Engineering,  1990Liquid-to-particle convective heat transfer coefficients were measured during continuous flow thr... more Liquid-to-particle convective heat transfer coefficients were measured during continuous flow through tubes, using an experimental technique in which a thermocouple was moved at the same speed as the particle. Water was used as the carrier fluid and transducer particles were made hollow to approximate densities of real food particles. Results from over 250 experimental runs over a fluid Reynolds number range from 7300 to 43600, showed that the convective coefficient was increased significantly with increasing fluid flow rate and particle to tube diameter ratio. Convective coefficient values ranged from 688 to 3005 w/m20C depending on the experimental conditions. Dimensionless correlations obtained between the Nusselt number, particle Reynolds number, particle to tube diameter ratio, and the particle Froude number yielded R2 values ranging from 0.82 to 0.92 depending on the complexity of the relation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
