What's new
CAB Direct content is moving
In 2023 CAB Abstracts, Global Health and CABI’s Database Subsets are scheduled to begin their migrating journey to our new platform ‘CABI Digital Library’. With almost 15 million records to move to their new home, we expect this to take a few months to complete. For more information visit: https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/about/about-cabi-digital-library
Why not join our research panel and help shape the future of CABI Digital Library? https://www.cabi.org/join-our-research-panel/
Take a look at our filter for Evidence Synthesis!
We have updated the search filter for evidence-based literature in our databases.  Find the detailed search strategy and background information here.
CAB Direct now works with LibKey! If your library has implemented LibKey you will see in-line links on Search Results and the Abstract page to connect you seamlessly with your library’s subscription access to the article.
For Librarians: Integration of your institutional LibKey profile with CAB Direct is very quick and easy! Please email CABI support@cabi.org with your LibKey API Key and LibKey Static ID which may be requested from Third Iron support@thirdiron.com.
