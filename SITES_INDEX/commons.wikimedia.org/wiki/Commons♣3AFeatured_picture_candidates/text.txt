Nominating[edit]
Guidelines for nominators[edit]
Please read the complete guidelines before nominating.
This is a summary of what to look for when submitting and reviewing FP candidates:
Scope – In addition to falling within the Commons scope, candidates must be static two-dimensional images. All other types of files should be nominated at Commons:Featured media candidates.
Licensing – Images licensed with solely "GFDL" or "GFDL and an NC-only license" are not acceptable due the restrictions placed on re-use by these licenses.
Resolution – Raster images of lower resolution than 2 million pixels (pixels, not bytes) are typically rejected unless there are strong mitigating reasons. This does not apply to vector graphics (SVGs).
Graphics on Commons are not only viewed on conventional computer screens. They may be used in high-resolution print versions, and the images may be cropped to focus on portions of the image. See Commons:Why we need high resolution media for more information.
Scans – While not official policy, Help:Scanning provides advice on the preparation of various types of images that may be useful.
General quality – pictures being nominated should be of high technical quality.
Digital manipulations must not deceive the viewer.  Digital manipulation for the purpose of correcting flaws in an image is generally acceptable, provided it is limited, well-done, and not intended to deceive.
For photographs, typical acceptable manipulations include cropping, perspective correction, sharpening/blurring, and color/exposure correction. More extensive manipulations, such as removal of distracting background elements, should be clearly described in the image text, by means of the {{Retouched picture}} template. Undescribed or mis-described manipulations which cause the main subject to be misrepresented are never acceptable. For images made from more than one photo, you can use the {{Panorama}} or {{Focus stacked image}} templates.
For historic images, acceptable manipulations might include digitally fixing rips, removal of stains, cleanup of dirt, and, for mass-produced artworks such as engravings, removal of flaws inherent to the particular reproduction, such as over-inking. Careful color adjustments may be used to bring out the original work from the signs of ageing, though care should be taken to restore a natural appearance. The original artistic intent should be considered when deciding whether it is appropriate to make a change.  Edits to historic material should be documented in detail within the file description, and an unedited version should be uploaded and cross linked for comparison.
Value – our main goal is to feature most valuable pictures from all others. Pictures should be in some way special, so please be aware that:
almost all sunsets are aesthetically pleasing, and most such pictures are not in essence different from others,
night-shots are pretty but normally more details can be shown on pictures taken at daytime,
beautiful does not always mean valuable.
 Artworks, illustrations, and historical documents[edit]
There are many different types of non-photographic media, including engravings, watercolors, paintings, etchings, and various others. Hence, it is difficult to set hard-and-fast guidelines. However, generally speaking, works can be divided into three types: Those that can be scanned, those that must be photographed, and those specifically created to illustrate a subject.
Works that must be photographed include most paintings, sculptures, works too delicate or too unique to allow them to be put on a scanner, and so on. For these, the requirements for photography, below, may be mostly followed; however, it should be noted that photographs which cut off part of the original painting are generally not considered featurable.
Works that may be scanned include most works created by processes that allow for mass distribution − for instance, illustrations published with novels. For these, it is generally accepted that a certain amount of extra manipulation is permissible to remove flaws inherent to one copy of the work, since the particular copy – of which hundreds, or even thousands of copies also exist – is not so important as the work itself.
Works created to serve a purpose include diagrams, scientific illustrations, and demonstrations of contemporary artistic styles. For these, the main requirement is that they serve their purpose well.
Provided the reproduction is of high quality, an artwork generally only needs one of the following four things to be featurable:
Notable in its own right: Works by major artists, or works that are otherwise notable, such as the subjects of a controversy.
Of high artistic merit: Works which, while not particularly well known, are nonetheless wonderful examples of their particular type or school of art.
Of high historic merit: The historical method values very early illustrations of scenes and events over later ones. Hence, a work of poor quality depicting a contemporaneous historical event can be nonetheless important, even if the artistic merit is relatively low. Likewise, scans or photographs of important documents – which may not be at all artistic – nonetheless may be highly valuable if the documents are historically significant. The reason for the image's historical importance should be briefly stated in the nomination, for those reviewers unfamiliar with the subject.
Of high illustrative merit: Works that illustrate or help explain notable subjects, for instance, illustrations of books, scientific subjects, or technical processes. The amount of artistic merit required for these will vary by subject, but, for instance, an illustration that makes the working of a complicated piece of machinery very clear need not be notable as a piece of artwork as well, whereas an illustration for a book might well be expected to reach much higher artistic standards.
Digital restorations must also be well documented. An unedited version of the image should be uploaded locally, when possible, and cross-linked from the file description page. Edit notes should be specified in detail, such as "Rotated and cropped. Dirt, scratches, and stains removed. Histogram adjusted and colors balanced."
 Photographs[edit]
On the technical side, we have focus, exposure, composition, movement control and depth of field.
Focus – every important object in the picture should normally be sharp.
Exposure refers to the shutter diaphragm combination that renders an image with a tonal curve that ideally is able to represent in acceptable detail shadows and highlights within the image. This is called latitude. Images can be on the low side of the tonal curve (low range), the middle (middle range) or high side (upper range). Lack of shadow detail is not necessarily a negative characteristic. In fact, it can be part of the desired effect. Burned highlights in large areas are a distracting element.
Composition refers to the arrangement of the elements within the image.  The "Rule of thirds" is one useful guideline.  Horizons should almost never be placed in the middle, where they "cut" the image in half.  Often, a horizon creating a top or bottom third of the space works better.  The main idea is to use space to create a dynamic image.
Foreground and background – foreground and background objects may be distracting. You should check that something in front of the subject doesn't hide important elements and that something in background doesn't spoil the composition (for example that the streetlight doesn't "stand" on someone's head).
Movement control refers to the manner in which motion is represented in the image. Motion can be frozen or blurred. Neither one is better than the other. It is the intention of representation. Movement is relative within the objects of the image. For example, photographing a race car that appears frozen in relation to the background does not give us a sense of speed or motion, so technique dictates to represent the car in a frozen manner but with a blurred background, thus creating the sense of motion, this is called "panning". On the other hand, representing a basketball player in a high jump frozen in relation to everything else, due to the "unnatural" nature of the pose would be a good photograph.
Depth of field (DOF) refers to the area in focus in front of and beyond main subject. Depth of field is chosen according to the specific needs of every picture. Large or small DOF can either way add or subtract to the quality of the image. Low depth of field can be used to bring attention to the main subject, separating it from the general environment. High depth of field can be used to emphasize space. Short focal length lenses (wide angles) yield large DOF, and vice versa, long focal lenses (telephotos) have shallow DOF. Small apertures yield large DOF and conversely, large apertures yield shallow DOF.
On the graphic elements we have shape, volume, color, texture, perspective, balance, proportion, noise, etc.
Shape refers to the contour of the main subjects.
Volume refers to the three dimensional quality of the object. This is accomplished using side light. Contrary to general belief, front lighting is not the best light. It tends to flatten subject. Best light of day is early morning or late afternoon.
Color is important. Oversaturated colors are not good.
Texture refers to the quality of the surface of the subject. It is enhanced by side lighting… it is the "feel" to the touch.
Perspective refers to the "angle" accompanied by lines that disappear into a vanishing point that may or may not be inside the image.
Balance refers to the arrangement of subjects within the image that can either give equal weight or appear to be heavier on one side.
Proportion refers to the relation of size of objects in picture. Generally, we tend to represent small objects small in relation to others, but a good technique is to represent small objects large contrary to natural size relationship. For example, a small flower is given preponderance over a large mountain…. This is called inversion of scales.
Not all elements must be present. Some photographs can be judged on individual characteristics, that is, an image can be about color or texture, or color AND texture, etc.
Noise refers to unwanted corruption of color brightness and quality and can be caused by underexposure. It is not a desirable quality and can be grounds for opposition.
Symbolic meaning or relevance … Opinion wars can begin here … A bad picture of a very difficult subject is better than a good picture of an ordinary subject. A good picture of a difficult subject is an extraordinary photograph.
Images can be culturally biased by the photographer and/or the observer. The meaning of the image should be judged according to the cultural context of the image, not by the cultural context of the observer. An image "speaks" to people, and it has the capacity to evoke emotion such as tenderness, rage, rejection, happiness, sadness, etc. Good photographs are not limited to evoking pleasant sensations …
You will maximise the chances of your nominations succeeding if you read the complete guidelines before nominating.
Video and audio[edit]
Please nominate videos, sounds, music, etc. at Commons:Featured media candidates.
 Set nominations[edit]
If a group of images are thematically connected in a direct and obvious way, they can be nominated together as a set. A set should fall under one of the following types:
Faithful digital reproductions of works notable in their own right, which the original author clearly intended to be viewed as a set. Examples: pages in a pamphlet, crops (puzzle pieces) of a prohibitively large scan, a pair of pendant paintings. Not acceptable: Arbitrary selection of sample works by an artist.
A sequence of images showing the passage of time. They could depict frames of a moving/changing object or a static object during different times of day or different seasons. Examples: diagrams illustrating a process, steps of a dance, metamorphosis of an insect, maps/drawings/photos of the same subject over the years (frame of view should be more or less the same).
A group of images depicting the same subject from different viewpoints, preferably taken under the same lighting conditions when possible. Examples: Exterior and interior of a building, different facades of a building, different interior views, obverse and inverse of a banknote/coin. Not acceptable: A selection of different rooms in a skyscraper, the facade of a church plus an organ, any images of fundamentally different scopes.
A group of images which show all possible variations of a particular class of object. Examples: Male and female versions of an animal (preferably in the same setting), all known species of a genus. Not acceptable: A few breeds of cats (unless they share a defining characteristic and represent all possible examples of that).

Adding a new nomination[edit]
If you believe that you have found or created an image that could be considered valuable, with appropriate image description and licensing, then do the following.
Step 1: copy the image name into this box, after the text already present in the box, for example, Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:Your image filename.jpg. Then click on the "create new nomination" button.
All single files:
For renominations, simply add /2 after the filename. For example, Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:Foo.jpg/2
All set nomination pages should begin "Commons:Featured picture candidates/Set/", e.g. "Commons:Featured picture candidates/Set/My Nomination".
Step 2: follow the instructions on the page that you are taken to, and save that page.
Step 3: manually insert a link to the created page at the top of Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list:
Click here, and add the following line to the TOP of the nominations list:
{{Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:Your image filename.jpg}}
Strongly recommended: Please add a gallery page and section heading from the list at Commons FP galleries. Write the code as Page name#Section heading. For example: Commons:Featured pictures/Sports#Individual sports
Optional: if you are not the creator of the image, please notify them using {{subst:FPC-notice|Your image filename.jpg}} -- ~~~~.
Note: Do not add an 'Alternative' image when you create a nomination. Selecting the best image is part of the nomination process. Alternatives are for a different crop or post-processing of the original image, or a closely related image from the same photo session (limited to 1 per nomination), if they are suggested by voters.
Voting[edit]
Editors whose accounts have at least 10 days and 50 edits can vote. Everybody can vote for their own nominations. Anonymous (IP) votes are not allowed.
You may use the following templates:
{{Support}} ( Support),
{{Oppose}} ( Oppose),
{{Neutral}} ( Neutral),
{{Comment}} ( Comment),
{{Info}} ( Info),
{{Question}} ( Question),
{{Request}} ( Request).
You may indicate that the image has no chance of success with the template {{FPX|reason - ~~~~}}, where reason explains why the image is clearly unacceptable as a FP. The template can only be used when there are no support votes other than the one from the nominator.
A well-written review helps participants (photographers, nominators and reviewers) improve their skills by providing insight into the strengths and weaknesses of a picture. Explain your reasoning, especially when opposing a candidate (which has been carefully selected by the author/nominator). English is the most widely understood language on Commons, but any language may be used in your review.  A helpful review will often reference one or more of the criteria listed above.
Unhelpful reasons for opposing include:
No reason
"I don't like it" and other empty assessments
"You can do better" and other criticisms of the author/nominator rather than the image
Remember also to put your signature (~~~~).
Featured picture delisting candidates[edit]
Over time, featured picture standards change. It may be decided that for some pictures which were formerly "good enough", this is no longer the case. 
This is for listing an image which you believe no longer deserves to be a featured picture. For these, vote: 
Text to use
Displays as
Meaning
{{Keep}}
 Keep
It deserves to remain a featured picture
{{Delist}}
 Delist 
It does not deserve to be a featured picture anymore.
This can also be used for cases in which a previous version of an image was promoted to FP, but a newer version of the image has been made and is believed to be superior to the old version, e.g. a newly edited version of a photo or a new scan of a historical image. In particular, it is not intended for replacing older photos of a particular subject with newer photos of the same subject, or in any other case where the current FP and the proposed replacement are essentially different images. For these nominations, vote:
Text to use
Displays as
Meaning
{{Keep}}
 Keep
Do not replace the old image with the new image as a FP.
{{Delistandreplace}}
 Delist and replace 
Replace the current FP with the proposed replacement.
If you believe that some picture no longer meets the criteria for FP, you can nominate it for delisting, copying the image name into this box, after the text already present in the box:
In the new delisting nomination page just created you should include:
Information on the origin of the image (creator, uploader);
A link to the original FP nomination (it will appear under "Links" on the image description page);
Your reasons for nominating the image and your username.
After that, you have to manually insert a link to the created page at the top of Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list.
As a courtesy, leave an informative note on the talk page(s) of the original creator, uploader(s), and nominator with a link to the delisting candidate. {{subst:FPC-notice-removal}} can be used for this purpose.
Featured picture candidate policy[edit]
General rules[edit]
The voting period is 9 complete days counted from the nomination. After the end of this period the result will be determined. Votes added on day 10 and after are not counted.
Nominations by anonymous contributors are welcome
Contributions to discussion by anonymous contributors are welcome
Only registered contributors whose Commons accounts have at least 10 days and 50 edits  can vote. Exception: registered users can always vote in their own nominations no matter the account age and number of edits.
Nominations do not count as votes. Support must be explicitly stated.
Nominators and authors can withdraw their nominated pictures at any time. This is done by adding the following template: {{Withdraw}} ~~~~. Also, remember that if more than one version is nominated, you should explicitly state which version you are withdrawing.
Remember, the goal of the Wikimedia Commons project is to provide a central repository for free images to be used by all Wikimedia projects, including possible future projects. This is not simply a repository for Wikipedia images, so images should not be judged here on their suitability for that project.
Rules of the 5th day based on vote counts on day number 5 (day of nomination + 5)
Pictures are speedy declined if they have no support (apart from the nominator).
Pictures are speedy promoted if they have 10 support votes or more and no oppose votes. (Note that if it takes more than five days to reach this threshold, the picture can be promoted as soon as it is reached.)
Once either speedy criterion is reached, the voting period is considered closed, and no more votes may be added.
Pictures tagged {{FPX}} may be removed from the list 24 hours after the tag was applied, provided there are no support votes other than that of the nominator.
Pictures tagged {{FPD}} (FP-Denied) may be removed from the list 24 hours after the tag was applied.
Only two active nominations by the same user (that is, nominations under review and not yet closed) are allowed. The main purpose of this measure is to contribute to a better average quality of nominations, by driving nominators/creators to choose carefully the pictures presented to the forum.
Featuring and delisting rules[edit]
A candidate will become a featured picture in compliance with following conditions:
Appropriate license (of course)
At least seven  Support votes (or 7  Delist  votes for a delist) at the end of nine days
Ratio of supporting/opposing votes at least 2/1 (a two-thirds majority); same for delist/keep votes
Two different versions of the same picture cannot both be featured, but only the one with higher level of support, as determined by the closer. Whenever the closer is not sure which version has consensus to be featured, they should attempt to contact the voters to clarify their opinions if not clear from the nomination page.
The delisting rules are the same as those for FPs, with voting taking place over the same time period. The rule of the 5th day is applied to delisting candidates that have received no votes to delist, other than that of the proposer, by day 5. There is also a limit of two active delisting nominations per user, which is in addition to the limit of two active regular nominations.
The FPCBot handles the vote counting and closing in most cases, current exceptions are candidates containing multiple versions of the image as well as FPXed and withdrawn nominations. Any experienced user may close the requests not handled by the bot.  For instructions on how to close nominations, see Commons:Featured picture candidates/What to do after voting is finished. Also note that there is a manual review stage between when the bot has counted the votes and before the nomination is finally closed by the bot; this manual review can be done by any user familiar with the voting rules.
Above all, be polite[edit]
Please don't forget that the image you are judging is somebody's work. Avoid using phrases like "it looks terrible" and "I hate it". If you must oppose, please do so with consideration.  Also remember that your command of English might not be the same as someone else's. Choose your words with care.
Happy judging… and remember... all rules can be broken.

 Support Great photo, already in good condition and very well restored, as usual. It's interesting: it looks almost like a painted portrait, and I'm guessing the oval-shaped dark area behind him is not a shadow that was there but something added to brilliant effect in post-processing.

 Oppose For a picture of a domestic cat to be featured, it would have to be really outstanding. This is a nice composition, but the cat is not particularly sharp, so it's not a really outstanding picture that would make it one of the greatest on the site. The sour-looking facial expression of the senior cat also makes it less than wowing to me, though others could well disagree. -- Ikan Kekek (talk) 16:40, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

 Info A majestic blackside hawkfish (Paracirrhites forsteri) watching for a prey on top of a coral (Pocillopora verrucosa), Ras Muhammad National Park, Red Sea, Egypt. It is from the Indo-Pacific and occasionally found in the aquarium trade and is also of minor importance to local commercial fisheries. It grows to a total length of 22 cm (9 in). One of the main characteristics of this speices are the speckles of the head. The black-sided hawkfish is an ambush predator; it usually lies in wait on a head of coral, propped up by its stiff pectoral fins, ready to dart out at passing crustaceans or small fish.[ It is mainly a solitary fish, but may be seen in pairs or may form small harems with one dominant male and several females. Like other members of the family, it is a sequential hermaphrodite; adults start life as females but the largest female in a group changes sex to a male if that position is vacated. c/u/n by Poco a poco (talk) 13:27, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

It is not to be confused with the Rüppell's griffon vulture (Gyps rueppellii) and Himalayan griffon vulture (Gyps himalayensis).

I've added a note - the white feathers on the bird's 'collar' are overexposed and 'blown'. Sometimes details can be recovered from the RAW file. Charlesjsharp (talk) 15:43, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

 Info Red Sea clownfish (Amphiprion bicinctus) in a magnificent sea anemone (Heteractis magnifica), Red Sea, Egypt. This clownfish species is found in the Western Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, Socotra and the Chagos archipelago. The fish's body is yellow-orange to dark brown. Males grow to a length of 10 centimetres (3.9 in), and females grow to a length of 14 centimetres (5.5 in). Clownfish and sea anemone form together one of the most known symbiotic mutualism. The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators, and parasites and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. c/u/n Poco a poco (talk) 03:23, 29 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

It's around 5,000 years old – of course it's not going to be striking as a piece of rock art today or even 1,000 years ago. --SHB2000 (talk) 22:17, 29 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
 Oppose I agree with Ermell, and you misread what he said, which is that the art is wowing but the photograph is not. I think the inclusion of other parts of the rock face that are the same color as the artwork or that have what I consider in context an overly active texture distracts from it, and a much closer crop around the art would give it a much better presentation. -- Ikan Kekek (talk) 17:11, 30 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Personally, I've always found Indigenous rock art more interesting (and more appealing) when it has a bit of its surrounds, primarily because you can actually tell it is rock art, whereas you can't if it's cropped (this is something I learned from my personal photos, though the rock art in my area tends to be more red hands and less on animals, which can be a differing factor). --SHB2000 (talk) 10:51, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I've opened the most recent version of this file in Photoshop and applied the clipping warnings in Camera Raw. It's highlighting large swatches of three clouds, as well as a few smaller areas. Having said that, I've shot in near-equatorial conditions before and know how difficult it can be to capture the entire range, and this is an excellent representation of the area, so...

 Comment - Western-style wedding dresses were worn by wealthier Chinese Indonesians as early as the 1910s (see Peter Post (2019), The Kwee Family of Ciledug: Family, Status, and Modernity in Colonial Java, p. 40; an example from the 1930s is on p. 225), and they have remained popular in the century since then. This offers an excellent example of a mid-century studio portrait.

 Oppose This is not a subtle restoration in my view, but rather a heavy modification of a historical photograph. The new background is too dark and hiding important details. With this modification, the "historical" aspect of the picture disappears, and the goal of the candidature questionable. Although the original work is damaged, the natural appearance of the background is still important. Sorry but it seems to be like a photomontage now, combining modern and ancient elements. Incidentally, some scratches remain -- Basile Morin (talk) 01:20, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Thank you for the considered remarks. I will look at the scratches; I see that, when I went back to the PSD file after five years, there were some scratches that had been removed originally but not on that copy. As for the background, I respectfully disagree. It appears that Tati used their parquet floor and plain wall for this shot (also seen in File:Chitra Dewi, c. 1960, by Tati Studio - Before restoration.jpg), with more of a low-key approach (not as dark as File:Suzzanna, c 1963, Tati Photo Studio - Before restoration.jpg, but still enough to obscure the baseboards). I did adjust the midtones on the background as a means of reducing the glare from the texture of the print, but the more low-key approach was in the original.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 01:54, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I have hunted down those wayward scratches. (And as an aside, I just realized that this file shows the set-up that they would likely have used for this image... it appears to be the same part of the studio).  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 02:02, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
One big scratch is still there but whatever. You darkened the background by covering it with an artificial black shade, and it totally changes the original contrasts. This is not a historical picture anymore, sorry, now it is part 1964 and part 2023's style. The original is grey, not black. And there is a visible texture all over, which should be preserved. One can also see reliefs and realistic transitions in the scattering of light -- Basile Morin (talk) 03:02, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
On the face of it, Basile's remarks seem reasonable to me. This doesn't seem like a humble restoration that eliminates only damage. -- Ikan Kekek (talk) 05:55, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I can take a better look after work. It was getting late, so I must have missed it. As for the tone, the midtones did affect the brightness. I can see about going back to the original upload's avoidance of touching the midtones. The only thing is, of course, that the crackleature will be more prominent.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 09:07, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
It is a studio photograph, so the quality should be excellent. Here the face and the hand are very blotchy, like after a Photoshop filter. The hair is full of blue spots. Even at low resolution. Please compare with normal pictures taken at the same period, for example 1964 (same year, interior shot). With good equipment, the quality can easily reach this level: taken in 1918 (your own current nomination). A professional studio is supposed to reach high standards of quality. Some old photographs are still very well conserved, and thus represent great testimonies of their period. The best results come from professional scans of original films. Unfortunately there's a huge difference with what we see here. This candidature is a photo or a scan of a very damaged print. I think previous nominations of pictures by the same studio were much better, like this one (1960). -- Basile Morin (talk) 09:50, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Thank you, Basile. This print, as well as the aforementioned Suzanna one, appeared to be on different media than some of the others (I no longer have access, which is detrimental). The white "specks" were much more prominent in this one, unfortunately. I suspect that they changed media at some point in the 1960s, as the economic crisis was ongoing. Anyways, I will take a look when I get home, just for the sake of ensuring we have as high a quality as feasible from this print. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 15:24, 28 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

"not comparable to the great plant pictures we've been featuring" is not the kind of comment which is appropriate for an online community as it discourages further involvement in the project. -- Ephramac (talk) 08:28, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Ephramac:  I disagree. Ikan has valid criteria for expressing his/her opinion on what should or should not be featured on Commons. And remember: constructive criticism helps to evolve (taking this from my own experience). ★ 11:22, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I am fine with people voicing contructive critisism (e.g. the photo being too unsharp), but saying that someone elses work is "not comparable" to other work can be perceived as very arrogant. Also keep in mind that in my case the feedback is unsolicited, as I did not ask for my photo being 'reviewed' here. I wish more people were aware of the fact that their behavior can make a difference in another persons day. Have a nice weekend! --Ephramac (talk) 12:34, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I know that landing at FPC can be a rather turbulent experience, and unfortunately you don't know all the rules and practices. The reason given for the 'oppose' was not a review. The guidelines say that you can 'support' a photo without giving any reason for it, but if you vote 'oppose' you must give a reason for it. The idea behind this practice is that you shouldn't be able to 'oppose' photos just because you don't like them, a valid reason must be given. It is also common that a photographer wants to know why the photo was opposed so that they might improve something for their next photo and nomination. Also, after reviewing thousands of photos over the years, the tone of many reviewers gets curt and harsh in short posts. It's a very hard school (lots of tears and drama!) but we also learn from each other that way. All the best, --Cart (talk) 13:18, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Ephramac, when you nominate a photo for a possible feature as one of the very best photos on Commons, you are asking for people to judge your work. You can't expect people to avoid comment, even if it weren't for the fact that opposing votes have to be justified by comments per Featured Picture Candidates rules. And it's a little odd to accuse me of arrogance when I'm comparing photos to one another and don't have a personal stake in any of this. If you want to know more about the basis for my remarks, you should look at the current and recent nominations of plant photos that have gotten unanimous support, to see just how sharp they've been and what kind of contrast there is between the plant and the background. But stating that a photo is not (in my opinion) comparable to the very cream of the crop is not meant to be disrespectful; instead, it's a way to uphold very high standards that make the "Featured" designation meaningful. I am sorry, though, that my remarks were so painful for you. I had no intention of being mean, just clear. -- Ikan Kekek (talk) 14:58, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I was not the one nominating this photo, but whatever. You do you... --Ephramac (talk) 15:18, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Excuse me. I nominate this picture, not him. The reason I nominate it here is the artistic of the picture. I'm also new to Wiki Commons. I've been on Vietnamese Wiki for a year, but I've just hoped in Commons recently. Maybe I should change the category. - ABAL1412🇻🇳🇸🇺🇷🇺 (talk ☭) 16:06, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@ABAL1412 Thank you for nominating the picture I took. I appreciate it. Also, I did not mean to start a big discussion here. I just thought the tone was a little bit off and it would not hurt to mention it. --Ephramac (talk) 16:35, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I'm studying classical music, not art or photography. I know nothing about photography, but there's no rule that says I can't nominate. I put this pic here basically just because its artistic. Photography, for me, is also art. From my perspective, everyone who work in art should have their own thinking, their own style, not trying to be like everyone else. Otherwise, art is just a boring stuff. And you've just done that. Thank you for uploading your picture to Wikimedia. I truly love this one.
About the rules, there's a line that says "all rules can be broken". The featured picture has no category for artistic photo, so I have to put it in the Plants category. That breaks the rules, but this is a nice work of art, and I think it's a shame if it can't be an FP just because it's not like every other pictures.
Btw, having a big discussion on the nomination pages is super normal. It's OK.

Don't worry, for now artistic photos are kept in the same galleriers as the regular photos (perhaps they can inspire other photographers by being seen there), but if/when we get plenty of them, new galleries will be created.

 Comment This is a perfectly lovely and artistic photo displaying soft focus pastels. It's a shame that Commons FPC is so notorious for dismissing artistic photo styles that are valued in the rest of the world. Sure, the Wikipedias have plenty of articles about photo styles, but heavens forbid we should have FPs of them <sarcasm>. Unfortunately, if you nominate something outside the normal "National-Geographic-style" that is so dominant here, you have to prepare for battle. (Been there, done that, got the scars, gave up.)
That said, you were a bit unlucky with the light and shadow. You got the center of the plant in shadow, with two lit parts on either side. It would have been better if it was the other way around, --Cart (talk) 12:05, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

 Support Honestly, this is one of those examples where artistic intent outweighs documentarian merit to me. This would not look out of place on a waiting room wall, or any of those other locations where one could reasonably expect a beautiful and non-controversial image to be hung for decoration. A big part of that is the brown background, which allows the buds in the rear to blend into it, creating a wistful impression. I like it; I've even tried to achieve it albeit less effectively.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 13:22, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

 Oppose The most interesting parts (sunny sides) are out of focus. Thus I don't think it would make a "non-controversial image to be hung for decoration". We often meet candidates with nice bokeh at FPC, like 1, 2, or 3. Unfortunately the tones here are not contrasted enough.
The shady side of the plant is too close to the background color. The subject awkwardly pops up. I would say this is more random than "artistic", even if that sounds harsh. The right part is a blurry mass. Narrow depth of field sometimes creates nice effects, but here the shade combination doesn't work.

Closing a featured picture promotion request[edit]
The bot[edit]
Note that the description below is for manual closure, this is mostly not needed anymore as there exists a bot (FPCBot) that counts the votes and handles the process below. However after the bot has counted the votes a manual review step is used to make sure the count is correct before the bot again picks up the work.
Manual procedure[edit]
Any experienced user may close requests.  
In Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list click on the title/link of the candidate image, then [edit].Add the result of the voting at the bottom (on a new line with a space first) {{FPC-results-reviewed|support=x|oppose=x|neutral=x|featured=("yes" or "no")|gallery=xxx (leave blank if "featured=no")|sig=~~~~}} (for example see Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:The Bridge (August 2013).jpg). See also {{FPC-results-reviewed}}.
Also edit the title of the candidate image template and add after the image tagfeatured or not featuredFor example: === [[:File:XXXXX.jpg]] ===becomes === [[:File:XXXXX.jpg]], featured ===
Save your edit.
If it is featured:
Add the picture to the list of the four most recently featured pictures of an appropriate gallery of Commons:Featured pictures, list as the first one and delete the last one, so that the number is four again.
Also add the picture to an appropriate gallery and section of Commons:Featured pictures, list. Click on the most appropriate link beneath where you just added it as one of the four images.
Add the template {{Assessments|featured=1}} to the image description page.
If it was an alternative image, use  the subpage/com-nom parameter: For example, if File:Foo.jpg was promoted at Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:Bar.jpg, use {{Assessments|featured=1|com-nom=Bar.jpg}}
If the image is already featured on another wikipedia, just add featured=1 to the Assessments template. For instance {{Assessments|enwiki=1}}  becomes {{Assessments|enwiki=1|featured=1}}
Add the picture to the chronological list of featured pictures. Put it in the gallery using this format: File:xxxxx.jpg|# - '''Headline'''<br>created by [[User:xxxxx|xxxxx]], uploaded by [[User:xxxxx|xxxxx]], nominated by [[User:xxxxx|xxxxx]]
The # should be replaced by 1 for the first image nominated that month, and counts up after that. Have a look at the other noms on that page for examples.
You may simplify this if multiple things were done by the same user. E.g.:  File:xxxxx.jpg|# - '''Headline'''<br>created,  uploaded, and nominated by [[User:xxxxx|xxxxx]]
Add == FP promotion ==  {{FPpromotion|File:XXXXX.jpg}} to the Talk Page of the nominator.
As the last step (whether the image is featured or not; including {{FPX}}ed, {{FPD}}ed and withdrawn nominations), open Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list, click on [edit], and find the transclusion of the nomination you've just finished closing. It will be of the form: {{Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:XXXXX.jpg}}Copy it to the bottom of Commons:Featured picture candidates/Log/September 2023), save that page, and remove it from the candidate list.
Closing a delisting request[edit]
In Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list click on the title/link of the candidate image, then [edit].Add the result of the voting at the bottom (on a new line with a space first)'''Result:''' x delist, x keep, x neutral => /not/ delisted. ~~~~(for example see Commons:Featured picture candidates/removal/Image:Astrolabe-Persian-18C.jpg)
Also edit the title of the delisting candidate image template and add after the image tagdelisted or not delistedFor example:=== [[:File:XXXXX.jpg]] === becomes === [[:File:XXXXX.jpg]], delisted ===
Move the actual template from Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list to the bottom of the actual month page on Commons:Featured picture candidates/Log/September 2023.
If the outcome was not delisted, stop here. If it is delisted:
Remove the picture from Commons:Featured pictures, list and any subpages.
Edit the picture's description as follows:
Replace the template {{Featured picture}} on the image description page by {{Delisted picture}}. If using the {{Assessments}} template, change featured=1 to featured=2 (do not change anything related to its status in other featured picture processes).
Remove the image from all categories beginning with "Featured [pictures]" (example: Featured night shots, Featured pictures from Wiki Loves Monuments 2016, Featured pictures of Paris).
Remove the "Commons quality assessment" claim (d:Property:P6731) "Wikimedia Commons featured picture" from the picture's Structured data.
Add a delisting-comment to the original entry in chronological list of featured pictures in bold-face, e. g. delisted 2007-07-19 (1-6) with (1-6) meaning 1 keep and 6 delist votes (change as appropriate). The picture in the gallery is not removed.
If this is a Delist and Replace, the delisting and promotion must both be done manually. To do the promotion, follow the steps in the above section. Note that the assessment tag on the file page and the promotion tag on the nominator's talk page won't pick up the /replace subpage that these nominations use.
Manual archiving of a withdrawn nomination[edit]
In Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list click on the title/link of the candidate image, then [edit].In the occasion that the FPCbot will not mark withdrawn nominations with a "to be reviewed" template and put them in Category:Featured picture candidates awaiting closure review just like if they were on the usual list, put the following "no" template:{{FPC-results-reviewed|support=X|oppose=X|neutral=X|featured=no|gallery=|sig=--~~~~}}
Also edit the title of the candidate image template and add after the image tagnot featuredFor example: === [[:File:XXXXX.jpg]] ===becomes === [[:File:XXXXX.jpg]], not featured ===
Save your edit.
Open Commons:Featured picture candidates/candidate list, click on [edit], and find the transclusion of the nomination. It will be of the form: {{Commons:Featured picture candidates/File:XXXXX.jpg}}Copy it to the bottom of Commons:Featured picture candidates/Log/September 2023), save that page, and remove it from the candidate list.
