Sean A. AdamsUniversity of Glasgow,  Theology and Religious Studies,  Faculty MemberReligion+40Sean A. Adams is Professor of New Testament and Ancient Culture. Sean began his academic career as a British Academy Postdoctoral fellow and, as of 2015, has been a member of the British Academy’s Policy Development Panel.In his research he seeks to understand the New Testament and contemporary Jewish literature in its wider literary and historical contexts. He is currently working on a monograph on Philo's philosophy of education and a commentary on De congressu. This work will lay the foundation for his next project, which will investigate the way Jewish communities engaged with Greek literary education. Sean has also worked with ancient manuscripts and has published a few papers on the way that ancient scribes used paragraphs to divide the text.Sean lectures on a range of New Testament topics, including the Historical Jesus, Biblical theology, individual books studies (e.g., Acts, Galatians), and introductions to the Bible. Sean has also supervised undergraduate, masters, and doctoral dissertations and would be happy to talk to students interested in studying all aspects of the New Testament, biblical theology, the use of the Old Testament in the New Testament, ancient manuscripts, Hellenistic literature, and Greek education.Address: Theology and Religious Studies,No 4 the Square,University of Glasgow,Glasgow, UKG12 8QQless1,983 Followers541 Following9 Co-authorsTotal Views ;1 Public MentionFollowFollowingCVall8 Books40 PapersBooks‘Where’s Rome?

Second Temple Jewish Paideia in Context (ed. Jason M. Zurawski and Gabriele Boccaccini; BZNW 228; Berlin: de Gruyter, 2017)by Jason Zurawski, Gabriele Boccaccini, Elisa Uusimäki, Luca Arcari, Sean A.

The essays collected here were first offered for discussion at the Fifth Enoch Seminar Nangeroni Meeting, held in Naples, Italy, from June 30 – July 4, 2015, the purpose of which was to gain greater insight into the diversity of views of Jewish education during the period, both in Judea and Diaspora communities, by viewing them in light of their contemporary Greco-Roman backgrounds and Ancient Near Eastern influences. Together, they represent the broad array of approaches and specialties required to comprehend this complex and multi-faceted subject, and they demonstrate the fundamental importance of the topic for a fuller understanding of the period. The volume will be of particular interest to students and scholars of the history and culture of the Jewish people during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, ancient education, and Greek and Roman history.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rat... more This work is the first major commentary of LXX Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah in English. Rather than seeing LXX mainly as a text-critical resource or as a window on a now-lost Hebrew text, this commentary, as part of the Septuagint Commentary Series, interprets Baruch and EpJer as Greek texts and from the perspective of Greek readers unfamiliar with Hebrew. Included are a transcription and an English translation of Codex Vaticanus, the oldest extant manuscript of the books, and a detailed commentary. Another major contribution is the utilisation of the sense-delimitation (paragraphs) of Codex Vaticanus and other codices to explore how early readers interpreted the text.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Alth... more Throughout the last century, there has been continuous study of Paul as a writer of letters. Although this fact was acknowledged by previous generations of scholars, it was during the twentieth century that the study of ancient letter-writing practices came to the fore and began to be applied to the study of the letters of the New Testament. This volume seeks to advance the discussion of Paul's relationship to Greek epistolary traditions by evaluating the nature of ancient letters as well as the individual letter components. These features are evaluated alongside Paul's letters to better understand Paul's use and adaptations of these traditions in order to meet his communicative needs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study, I evaluate the collections and treatise orders of Philo's Greek codices through the lens of the list. We begin with a discussion of two early catalogues of Philo’s corpus by Eusebius and Jerome before moving to an evaluation of the extant manuscripts. I am specifically interested in how the treatises are ordered, what collocations are evident, and how these differ from modern critical editions. I consider the impact of manuscript collections, including the pinakes, on the interpretation of treatises and modern understanding of Philo’s corpus and argue that curated critical editions limit useful data by obscuring textual associations available to and influencing readers in the pre-modern eras.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The majority of the paper investigates the ways that memory language was used by ancient authors (Jewish, Greek, and Latin) as a literary technique to signal overt intertextual and intratextual allusions. I argue that this is a recognized, intentional, and cross-cultural phenomenon with varied practices and that scholars need to consider this in future studies of intertextuality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This contribution begins with a discussion of terms associated with ancient parables and fables (λόγος, μῦθος, and παραβολή) with a specific investigation as to how these terms are used by Philo. I will follow this with an evaluation of Philo’s use of fables and fable language within his corpus, arguing that these literary devices provide insight into Philo’s interpretive approach and his educational background. In particular, Philo’s engagement with Greek fabula in Conf. 4–14 provides strong example of how Philo explicitly engaged with fabula and how Philo differentiated biblical stories from their Greek counterparts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By investigating other Philo manuscripts our understanding of their perpetuation will only deepen. The fluid lives of manuscripts (see, for instance, by the Κ/Ζ confusion) and the inherently subjective copying process renders even ‘copies’ valuable instances of reception and preservation. MS 143 is representative of ‘copies’ of two earlier codices, but also remains a distinct entity unto itself as a composite of two prior codices, one of which appears to have been intentionally formed as a supplement to the other, before they were combined into this single manuscript.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Almost all commentaries or translations of Baruch begin the penitential prayer with a strong break.

The chapter focuses on return of Jerusalem&#39;s children from exile.
