Foster was conceived long ago in our graduate school days when we had the good fortune to study under his brilliant tutelage. Captivated by his elegant, witty, and sometimes irreverent lectures, we were inspired daily to solve the mysteries of cuneiform and to explore the linguistic, literary, and historical implications of the many and diverse texts we worked through together.

The signs on these inscriptions are graphemically very similar to that which is known from Early Alphabetic inscriptions (e.g., Serabit el-Khadem and Wadi el-Hol), but the archaeological context is substantially older earlier than that of the Serabit and el-Hol inscriptions. This article surveys the salient aspects of these finds and concludes that they are indeed Early Alphabetic.Download Free PDFView PDFIconography of Protoliterate SealsOya  TopcuogluDownload Free PDFView PDFVisible Language, OIMP 32Christopher WoodsDownload Free PDFView PDFOpening the Tablet BoxPaolo MatthiaeDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Cambridge Handbook of the Learning SciencesLearning to Be Literate2014 • Peter SmagorinskyDownload Free PDFView PDFEbla and its Landscape: Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East, edited by Paolo Matthiae and Nicolò Marchetti (Left Coast Press, Walnut Creek CA, 2013).EBLA AND ITS LANDSCAPE_Abbreviations and ReferencesGianni MarchesiDownload Free PDFView PDFin Christopher Woods, ed., Visible Language: Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond, Oriental Institute Museum Publications 32 (Chicago: Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago), pp. 237-240Glossary of Linguistic Terms2010 • Monica Louise PhillipsDownload Free PDFView PDFAnalysis of CORONA Imagery of the Ebla RegionSimone MantelliniDownload Free PDFView PDFAesthetic and Cognitive Report on Ancient Near East Clay Figurines Based on Some Early Bronze and Middle Bronze Records Discovered at Ebla – Tell Mardikh (Syria)Marco RamazzottiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
