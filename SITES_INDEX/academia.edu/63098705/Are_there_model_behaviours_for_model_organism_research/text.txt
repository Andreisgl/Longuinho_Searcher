What sets Coast researchers apart, from her perspective, is that they openly express skepticism about the very investigative strategies they are using to advance an understanding of the genetic and/or neural bases of mental illness. Before providing a complementary philosophy of science perspective on what I regard as extraordinary and exemplary about Coast's researchers' knowledge production activities, I want to consider how Nelson understands these activities from the standpoint of her own discipline, social science and technology studies.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNature protocolsThe use of the elevated plus maze as an assay of anxiety-related behavior in rodents2007 • Cheryl FryeThe elevated plus maze is a widely used behavioral assay for rodents and it has been validated to assess the anti-anxiety effects of pharmacological agents and steroid hormones, and to define brain regions and mechanisms underlying anxiety-related behavior. Briefly, rats or mice are placed at the junction of the four arms of the maze, facing an open arm, and entries/duration in each arm are recorded by a video-tracking system and observer simultaneously for 5 min. Other ethological parameters (i.e., rears, head dips and stretched-attend postures) can also be observed. An increase in open arm activity (duration and/or entries) reflects anti-anxiety behavior. In our laboratory, rats or mice are exposed to the plus maze on one occasion; thus, results can be obtained in 5 min per rodent.Download Free PDFView PDFBehavioural Brain ResearchFactors controlling measures of anxiety and responses to novelty in the mouse2001 • Sandra FileDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysiology & BehaviorComparative analysis of anxiety-like behavior in partition and plus-maze tests after agonistic interactions in mice1997 • Natalia KudryavtsevaDownload Free PDFView PDFPhilosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciencesOf mice and mental health: facilitating dialogue and seeing further2018 • Amy MiltonThe science of mental life is critical for understanding both how we function, and impairments in our functioning. However, understanding the causal mechanisms underlying mental health disorders and developing new treatments are challenges too great to be solved by any individual approach. There is a growing awareness that translational research-from laboratory to patient and back again to animal models-will be critical for the improved understanding and treatment of mental health disorders. The motivation and intention to pursue translational approaches is therefore strong in mental health research, but critically, opportunities for interaction between basic scientists and clinicians are relatively limited, and vary depending on the institution in which researchers are working. This has promoted the development of a &#39;culture gap&#39; between basic and clinical scientists that limits interaction and sharing of knowledge. Here, we provide 14 examples of contemporary translational...Download Free PDFView PDFTransporting rats to the test situation on a cart can modify rat exploratory behavior in the elevated plus-maze1996 • Marcus  BrandaoDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysiology & BehaviorAssessing the exploratory and anxiety-related behaviors of mice.

Animal experimental models that accurately recapitulate clinical pathology are indispensable for understanding molecular mechanisms and advancing preclinical studies. Behavioral tests on animal models have been developed over time in two directions: to enable the acquisition of as many valid behavior data as possible, and constructing experimental models and procedures that represent a parallel with certain conditions in humans. In this review we discuss more information for the new tools in behavioral investigations in animal experimental models. Here we described evoked beam-walking (EBW) test as a new test for estimation of anxiety levels. The reliability of that test was confirmed in our...Download Free PDFView PDFContemporary Clinical NeuroscienceAnimal Models of Anxiety2006 • Robert Blanchard, Robert GerlaiAnxiety is a complex neurobehavioral disorder that often includes co-morbid features, e.g., obsessive-compulsive behavior. Animal models can be generated by several techniques, one of which includes transgenic and knockout technologies. Although anxiety can be assessed in various environments, we examine our animals in a naturalistic or ethological setting in what we call the mouse defense test battery (MDTB), in whichDownload Free PDFView PDFProtocol ExchangeAnimal models for depression-like and anxiety-like behavior2007 • Catharine DumanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
