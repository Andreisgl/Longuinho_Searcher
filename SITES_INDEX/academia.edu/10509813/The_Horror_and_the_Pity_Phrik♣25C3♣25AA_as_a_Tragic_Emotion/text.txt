This makes it especially at home in a number of specialized (ritual and other) scenarios, and helps explain its recurrent role in the ancient Greek aesthetics and literary theory, a role that illustrates the importance of the visual and the physical in ancient theories of audiences’ emotional responses to the portrayal of suffering in both dramatic performance and non-dramatic narrative.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHorror, Pity, and the Visual in Ancient Greek Aesthetics, Cairns and Nelis (eds.), Emotions in the Classical World, 53–77Douglas  CairnsDownload Free PDFView PDFExemplarity and Narrative in the Greek Tradition (abridged)Douglas  CairnsThis discussion starts from the encounter between Achilles and Priam in Iliad 24, and especially Achilles’ remarks on the jars of Zeus (525-35), the seminal expression of a characteristic Greek attitude towards the mutability of fortune and the instability of happiness. Such ideas can be readily paralleled in other cultures, literatures and narrative forms, both ancient and more recent, Greek and non-Greek. Their expression in language, symbol, and art (both verbal and visual) illustrates the way that the condensation of such complexes of thought and feeling in typical and traditional forms makes a particular ethical or emotional perspective tangible, tractable and transferable. These recurrent forms capture important aspects of a culture’s emotional and normative repertoire in a way that allows them to be reconstituted and applied in the mind of each recipient or audience member. The paper considers some of the implications of this in the Greek narrative tradition, from Homer, through archaic poetry, tragedy and Aristotle’s theory of tragedy to a detailed examination of the persistence of the phenomenon and its extensive influence on narrative shape in Plutarch’s Life of Aemilius Paullus, a splendid example of how later Greek narratives return explicitly to the most authoritative of all Greek narrative sources as a way of locating themselves in what their authors clearly regard as a distinctive Greek tradition.Download Free PDFView PDF‘A Short History of Shudders’, in A.

Rivista di Letterature ClassicheOther selves in fiction: philia, eleos, and the ethics of narrative2017 • Pia CampeggianiThis paper is divided into four parts. After briefly discussing Aristotelian philia and some of its most important conditions, I will claim that these conditions give us good reason to believe that Aristotle’s notion of philia implies what I will define as an emotion of sympathy. I will argue that in an Aristotelian perspective sympathy as an emotion has at the same time an ethical and aesthetic nature and that for this reason our inclination to enter a fictional world and sympathetically engage in it resembles and improves our ability to become ethically involved in real-life egalitarian interactions, such as those between friends. Finally, I will turn to the emotion of eleos arguing that a parallel reading of the ethical notion of philia and the poetic conception of eleos can provide us with a fresh perspective on the much discussed concept of mimetic pathos.Download Free PDFView PDFMind, Body, and Metaphor in Ancient Greek Concepts of EmotionDouglas  CairnsDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche's "Daimonic Force" of Tragedy and its Ancient Traces (Arion 11.1, 2003, 103-23)Stephen  HalliwellDownload Free PDFView PDFHelios 40‘Empire of the Gaze’: Despotism and seraglio Fantasies à la grecque in Chariton’s Callirhoe2013 • Lloyd Llewellyn-JonesDownload Free PDFView PDFVision and Viewing in Ancient Greece, edited with Sue Blundell and Douglas Cairns, 2013Nancy RabinowitzDownload Free PDFView PDFBlessed is he, who has seen... the power of ritual viewing and ritual framing in EleusisGeorgia PetridouDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
