La narrativa globale è lo specchio e la lampada dell'epoca globale. Quando la globalizzazione è entrata nel vocabolario comune negli anni '80, una nozione di narrativa globale è a sua volta passata, e scrittori come Ishiguro hanno potuto confidentemente proclamare nel 1987 che stavano "lavorando sullo scrivere un tipo di narrativa epica globale" e supporre che "molte persone stessero lavorando per scrivere lo stesso tipo di narrativa". La narrativa globale non è stata e non è tuttora sempre desiderata, e questa 1 dicitura non è stata inserita negli studi di letteratura contemporanea fino all'ultimo decennio. Il libro di Adam Kirsch del 2016 , pubblicato dalla Colombia global reports, è il 2 primo tentativo di introdurre la narrativa globale come una categoria legittima e paradigmatica dello scrivere nel mondo del XXI secolo. La legittimità della letteratura globale è stata contestata attraverso l'Atlantico, tanto che Kirsch scrive "la letteratura mondiale e le sue insoddisfazioni" come primo capitolo della sua difesa. I detrattori criticano la letteratura del mondo per la sua estetica e per il fronte politico, denigrandola come annacquata e sradicata, afflitta da problemi semiotici come "l'intraducibilità" e da mancanze stilistiche unite a complicità politiche ed 3 economiche. Una comune accusa è che questo genere evita particolarità difficili per massimizzare la leggibilità attraverso una lingua e una rappresentazione semplificata, creando per stranieri una merce omogenea in un mondo capitalistico, e quindi facendo prevalere la mediocrità con effetti di un instupidimento, prevenendo un incontro genuino tra le differenze e le sfide derivate. Tim Parks, per esempio, disprezza la crescita della narrativa globale praticata da Ishiguro e altri, e si sente nostalgico per scrittori come Jane Austen che scrivevano "di un disordine cultura-specifico e con virtuosità linguistica", non argomenti semplificati o "il dispositivo di fantasia sopravvalutato di Rushdie o Pamuk". 4Save to LibraryDownloadby Greta Martini Cioncolini•  20  World Literatures, Comparative Literature, French Literature, Spanish LiteratureWorld Literature and Postcolonialism, 2012Save to LibraryDownloadby Robert J C Young•  5  World Literatures, Postcolonial Studies, World Literature, Postcolonial LiteratureGlocalizing the (Arab) Nahḍah: An Investigation of the Nahḍah's Literacies and MultimodalitiesOne of the principal yet not favored consequences of approaching al-nahḍah has been representing it as another paramount example of world literature.

There is, however, little interest in foregrounding what the (Arab) nahḍah does not share with the other renaissances, that is, the literary/cultural phenomena that are closely culture-bound. In view of seeing al-nahḍah's “Big Picture,” a global-only or local-only approach is inadequate and short of intellectual insight. Therefore, the idiosyncratic, diverse, and, at times, complex textual and cultural productions of the (Arab) nahḍah call for a “glocal” approach. Al-nahḍah's diverse narratives and literacies invoke, among other things, questions of translingualism and multimodality. With the advent of printing, radical and lasting transformations underwent al-nahḍah's narratives and literacies, as with the reception of zajal recitals for both reading and listening audiences. In addition, the shift from manuscripts to printed books not only radically changed literacy conventions but likewise introduced “new” arts like book illustration, caricature, and comics, not to overlook fundamental developments in composition. More specifically, the journals of Ya'qūb Ṣannū' (1839–1912), where fuṣḥā Arabic, colloquial Egyptian, and French coexist, along with illustrated caricatures, can be viewed as evidence of al-nahḍah's translingual and multimodal literacies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alaaeldin Mahmoud•  7  World Literatures, Literacy, Globalization, GlocalizationNarrative Theory: Film & LiteratureOur time is characterized by a crisis of representational practice, fuelled by unprecedented technological and economic changes on a global level.

Narrative, therefore, takes a wide variety of forms. This course examines the aesthetics and techniques of film and literature from around the world, and analyses the masters of each art form. Through short stories and plays, we will study different ways a story can be told and the many exciting ways embedded "narratives" (or discourses) can be framed. Similarly, through films and film adaptations of great literary masterpieces, we will study how visual elements challenge the reader's imagination.Specifically, we examine the relationship between meaningand narrative structure. The course considers the tensionsbetween claims for originality and poetic license, betweenproducers and audiences, between fiction and reality, narrative and history, memory and representation. We will study representative theorists of narratology, such as J. Hillis Miller, Wolfgang Iser and Hayden White. Cutting-edge scholarship on film and the new media will also be introduced, such as Seymour Chatman, Rey Chow, as well as Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's Remediation. In addition to becoming familiar with major issues in film studies and East-West comparative studies, students will acquire a working knowledge of narrative theory.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexa Alice  Joubin•  13  American Literature, British Literature, World Literatures, Comparative Literature"An Underdeveloped James Bond" and a "Rectangular Head": Uneven and Combined Aesthetics in Pepetela and MabanckouThis is a pre-print English-language draft of an article that has been translated into Portuguese for a special issue on “A Literatura-Mundial e o Sistema-Mundial Modern”(World-Literature and the Modern World-System) of Via Atlântica 40... moreThis is a pre-print English-language draft of an article that has been translated into Portuguese for a special issue on “A Literatura-Mundial e o Sistema-Mundial Modern”(World-Literature and the Modern World-System) of Via Atlântica 40 (2021), edited by Mário César Lugarinho, Paulo de Medeiros, and Emanuelle Rodrigues dos Santos, and available at https://doi.org/10.11606/va.i40.173463Save to LibraryDownloadby Sharae Deckard•  9  World Literatures, Uneven and Combined Development, Franco Moretti, Roberto SchwarzCultural Literacy Everywhere Symposium 2022 (Booklet with Abstracts & Bios)Cultural Literacy Everywhere Symposium 2022: "Dwelling".

The text's libidinal investment of personal anguish with public discontent, or a psychopathological fury, is read through Fredric Jameson's account of third-world allegory as a symptom of the novel's registration of America's hegemonic decline. The scalping of several upper-class young women in New York City by their financier boyfriends is examined as an aspect of the text's aesthetics of excess and use of allegory, which frames the violent interrelation between public discontent and private hubris. The murdered women are read as symbols of American hegemony and class under threat by turbulent financial markets, and hoarding their scalps is represented as a crude and violent attempt by their boyfriends to halt the dwindling value of America's cultural capital and financial markets.Save to LibraryDownloadby Treasa De Loughry•  2  World Literatures, Postcolonial Studies" A country with land but no habitat " : Women, violent accumulation and negative-value in Yvonne Vera's The Stone VirginsPre-print draft of an article to be published in the Journal of Postcolonial Writing In the work of Zimbabwean novelist Yvonne Vera, land is shown to be a complex and contested resource to which the typically abject fates of her female... morePre-print draft of an article to be published in the Journal of Postcolonial WritingIn the work of Zimbabwean novelist Yvonne Vera, land is shown to be a complex and contested resource to which the typically abject fates of her female protagonists are inextricably bound. As she put it in a 2001 interview shortly before the publication of her final novel: " the connection between women and land in Zimbabwe is negative ". This article situates Vera's work in the context of debates over Zimbabwean land reform, and considers examples of how the " negative " connection between women and land is articulated in her fiction through contrasting leitmotifs of abjection and habitat, culminating in the cautiously redemptive conclusion of her last published novel, The Stone Virgins (2002). The discussion draws on Silvia Federici's work on women, the body and primitive accumulation and on Jason Moore's theory of negative-value in the capitalist world-ecology, to account for why, in Vera's work, the female body is invariably positioned, abjectly, at the nexus of colonial governance and what David Moore has described as Zimbabwe's postcolonial regime of " violent accumulation " .Save to LibraryDownloadby James  Graham•  9  World Literatures, Postcolonial Studies, Cultural Landscapes, Postcolonial Literature"Belarus in Berlin, Berlin in Belarus: Moyshe Kulbak's Raysn and Meshiekh ben-Efrayim between Nostalgia and Apocalypse"Save to LibraryDownloadby Marc Caplan•  8  World Literatures, Comparative Literature, Yiddish Literature, Jewish StudiesContesting Locatedness in English: A study of Jokha Alharthi's Celestial BodiesCelestial Bodies, winner of the Man Booker International Prize 2019, signals the transitory nature of a singular world as the narrative displaces the characters between national territories like Oman, Egypt, and Canada and stresses the... moreCelestial Bodies, winner of the Man Booker International Prize 2019, signals the transitory nature of a singular world as the narrative displaces the characters between national territories like Oman, Egypt, and Canada and stresses the futility of emplacement within an absolute geographical signifier or language, even as their interpersonal relations struggle to hold on to the normalcy defined by tradition. The novel, originally written in Arabic and translated into English by Alharthi's PhD supervisor Marilyn Booth, co-winner of the prize, demonstrates the politics inherent in being housed in the English language. The paper argues that the problematization of the genre of the novel and the questioning of the efficacy of linguistic self-location within source and target languages allows for larger negotiations with issues of literary cosmopolitanism and the characterizations of the spatial signifier of the world. The expansion of the cultural and political identity of the Omanis, arising from a conflicted assimilation of modern European values, leads to changes in the form of the novel that attempts to hold on to its Arabic roots while rethinking the structure of the genre itself. The trope of forgetting, of both national and individual pasts and presents, is motivated in the novel to qualify a cosmopolitanism that acknowledges these very incommunicable gaps between national histories.Submitted Dialogics Journal, October 2021Save to LibraryDownloadby Rupsa Banerjee•  3  World Literatures, Cosmopolitanism, Translation and literatureMaritime Literature and Culture SeriesNEW BOOK SERIES: Maritime Literature and Culture offers alternative rubrics for literary and cultural studies to those of nation, continent and area, which inter-articulate with current debates on comparative and world literatures,... moreNEW BOOK SERIES: Maritime Literature and Culture offers alternative rubrics for literary and cultural studies to those of nation, continent and area, which inter-articulate with current debates on comparative and world literatures, globalization and planetary or Anthropocene thought in illuminating ways. The humanities have paid increasing attention to oceans, islands and shores as sites of cultural production, while the maritime imagination in contemporary literatures and other cultural forms has presented ways of responding to human migration, global neoliberalism and climate change. This series provides a forum for discussion of these and other maritime expressions, including enquiries that engage maritime and coastal zones as spaces that enable reflection on labour and leisure; racial terror and performances of freedom; environmental wonder and degradation; metaphor and materiality; and the various implications of globe, world and planet.Save to LibraryDownloadby Meg Samuelson•  20  Cultural Studies, World Literatures, Pacific Island Studies, LiteratureTHE ORIGINS OF THE DEBATE GENRE IN NEW PERSIAN LITERATURESave to LibraryDownloadby Firuza Melville•  2  World Literatures, Persian LiteratureHanım!

Savaşçı, cesur ve neredeyse insanüstü özelliklere sahip kahramanların ekseninde gelişen olaylar savaşçı kültür kodları ile beslenir. Soylu akrabalardan oluşan yönetici sınıfa mensup savaşçıların hükümdarlarına her koşulda sadık kalması gerekirken hükümdarlarının onları ganimet, toprak veya diğer savaş yağmaları ile cömertçe ödüllendirmesi beklenir. Modern adalet sisteminin henüz oluşmadığı zamanları hikâyelendiren destan kahramanları, toplumlarının içinden ya da dışından düşmanlara ve hatta ejderha ve devler gibi doğaüstü güçlere karşı kendinden yardım bekleyen halkları korumak zorundadır. Tetikte bekleyen ölüme karşı kazanılan her zafer, varoluşsal bir sevinci simgeleyen ziyafetlerle kutlanır. Dünya edebiyatında ilk ve orta çağ dönemlerine ait, çoğu sözlü gelenek ürünü, farklı coğrafyalarda ortaya çıkmış birçok destan bulunmaktadır. Bu destanlar anlatı türünün gerektirdiği ortak unsurları taşımalarına rağmen var oldukları kültürlerin aralarındaki farklılıklar sebebiyle birbirlerinden ayrışırlar. Bu çalışmada Türk edebiyat geleneğinin en önemli epik eserlerinden Dede Korkut Kitabı ile eski İngiliz edebiyatının en bilinen örneklerinden Beowulf destanı karşılaştırmalı edebiyat çerçevesinde ele alınacaktır. Dede Korkut Kitabı on üç boylamadan oluşur ve her boylamanın odağında farklı kahramanlar bulunmaktadır. Bu anlatıları bir araya getiren ve destanları birbirine bağlayan ana kahraman ise Oğuz toplumunun en saygın kişisi bilge Dede Korkut’tur. Çeşitli Anglosakson kabilelerinin ıstıraplarını anlatan Beowulf destanında ise olaylar bir kahramanın merkezinde gelişir. Bu iki destan evlilik, aile yapıları, kadın erkek ilişkileri gibi konularda Oğuz ve Anglosakson toplumlarına dair birçok detaya işaret eder.Save to LibraryDownloadby Fatoş Işıl Britten (Cihan)•  2  World Literatures, Comparative LiteratureEncyclopedia of Coastal ScienceSave to LibraryDownloadby Historically Digitized•  17  Cartography, Law, World Literatures, Renewable EnergyWorld Literatures: Exploring the Cosmopolitan-Vernacular Exchange.

Adichie’s auto-fiction tells a tale of a child transgressing beyond a complicated set of interwoven boundaries in order to find herself and establish herself in the realms of religion and tradition – embodying two assumed contesting concepts. It is only through an extreme disassociation with herself that Kambili finds a sense of physical and emotional piece and forgiveness – she assumes the role of Kambili that was previously denied by her tyrannical father. Kambili’s shared, yet emotionally exclusive experiences with her mother and brother Jaja, provided the opportunity for these characters to emancipate themselves from the absolutist dystopian reality they were led to believe was the only reality.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dedre Engelbrecht•  23  African Studies, World Literatures, English Literature, African HistoryThe Norton Anthology of Western Literature | W.

COVID-19 severity varies. Mild cases often recover within two weeks, while people with severe diseases may take 3 – 6 weeks to recover. Among people who died, the time from the onset of symptom to death ranged from 2 – 8 weeks. Children constitute a small percentage of reported cases, with around 1% of cases under 10 years and 4% aged 10 to 19 years. The risk of death is below 0.5% in those younger than 50 years, while more than 8% in those older than 70. Most of the people who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing conditions, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. The impact of COVID-19 and its rate of mortality are different for both men and women; mortality rate is higher in men. As of May 2020, it is not known if past infection provides long-term and effective immunity in those who recover from the viral disease. Some of the infected people were reported to develop protective antibodies; the acquired immunity is presumed possible, based on other coronaviruses’ behaviour. The total infection fatality rate (IFR) is estimated to be 0.66%. No approved vaccine to treat the disease yet. International research on medicines and vaccines in COVID-19 is underway by academic groups, industry researchers, and government organizations. As of May 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials underway. Many existing medications are under evaluation for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta; as of May 2020, there is tentative evidence for remdesivir efficacy. Other candidates in trials are vasodilators, immune therapies, lipoic acid, corticosteroids, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, bevacizumab, etc. Preliminary evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine might have anti-cytokine storm properties. Transferring concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of those who recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as non-vaccine method of passive immunization.Save to LibraryDownloadby Chinaza G Awuchi•  11  Microbiology, World Literatures, Infectious disease epidemiology, VaccinesSalman Rushdie in the Cultural MarketplaceTaking up the roles that Salman Rushdie himself has assumed as a cultural broker, gatekeeper, and mediator in various spheres of public production, Ana Cristina Mendes situates his work in terms of the contemporary production,... moreTaking up the roles that Salman Rushdie himself has assumed as a cultural broker, gatekeeper, and mediator in various spheres of public production, Ana Cristina Mendes situates his work in terms of the contemporary production, circulation, and consumption of postcolonial texts within the workings of the cultural industries. Mendes pays particular attention to Rushdie as a public performer across various creative platforms, not only as a novelist and short story writer, but also as a public intellectual, reviewer, and film critic. Mendes argues that how a postcolonial author becomes personally and professionally enmeshed in the dealings of the cultural industries is of particular relevance at a time when the market is strictly regulated by a few multinational corporations. She contends that marginality should not be construed exclusively as a basis for understanding Rushdie’s work, since a critical grounding in marginality will predictably involve a reproduction of the traditional postcolonial binaries of oppressor/oppressed and colonizer/colonized that the writer subverts. Rather, she seeks to expand existing interpretations of Rushdie’s work, itineraries, and frameworks in order to take into account the actual conditions of postcolonial cultural production and circulation within a marketplace that is global in both orientation and effects.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ana Cristina  Mendes•  4  Cultural Studies, World Literatures, Postcolonial Literature, Salman RushdieGoethe’den Orhan Pamuk’a Dünya EdebiyatıSave to LibraryDownloadby Arif Tapan•  20  World Literatures, Comparative Literature, Literature, Literary CriticismChapter 6 'The Sky is Falling': The Narrative Screen of TerrorMyriad iterations of Debord's society of the spectacle circulated in a frenzy as the visual horror of September 11 unraveled on screens around the world.

Another auteur/theatrical personage who was variously invoked as the world witnessed falling figures from the towers was Anton Artaud, the celebrated exponent of the Theatre of Cruelty. This chapter explores the ramifications for the world novel of the aesthetic excess of these visual and performative interpretations that variously came into play during this unprecedented act of terrorist warfare. How, I ask, does the contemporary novel constellate twenty-first century warfare as sensorium, performance and spectacle? What narrative and tropological strategies does it marshal? I begin with an exploration of the aesthetic and ethical conundrum that the performative model of the theatre of cruelty poses in accounting for the WTC terrorist attack, and then explicate in some detail the ways in which the novel addresses this conundrum. The tense interplay between performance as trope and performance as terror will be central to my explication. Theatres of Cruelty Art Spiegelman's iconic graphic novel, In the Shadow of No Towers, begins with a preface entitled 'The Sky is Falling', where he vividly describes the prolonged temporality of the end-of-the-world kind of terror he experienced on seeing the burning towers. A 'Slow motion diary,' he calls it. Tempered by his reflections on the radical transformation of America and the world, and his desire to make sense not just of the immediate horror of the event but its long-term ramifications, the preface is a snapshot of a novelistic imagination at work. It promises a careful calibration of the event, points of view, plots, characters, tropes and images-in other words, a mode of aesthetic meditation that is simultaneously sensitive to the incomprehensible horror of the event and distant from the visual noise of the spectacle. The object of his meditation is an image that haunted him for years after the tragedy.

It argues that such revisions render protagonist Bigger Thomas an icon of global class conflict rather than a national figure of racial tension. By revealing the continuities among critical essays that bookend the writing of Native Son, this essay also reveals how the novel&#39;s restructuring further elaborates Wright&#39;s globalism – highlighting his desire to produce work that transcended both national and racial categories. Finally, it considers Native Son as a work of “world literature” and a model for global minoritarian discourse. By examining “translations” of the novel into postcolonial contexts, it argues that the global afterlife of Native Son is no departure from the localized vision of the novel, but rather the recapitulation of its explicit globalism.

It intends to show that the reasons of the discipline emergence are the need to complement the model imposed by the study of literature in its strictly national context. In fact, we will show that this emergence is completely subordinated to the hegemony of those national literatures. Moreover, the article studies certain symptomatic moments in which, by getting rid of that hegemony, its object of study and methodology become more imprecise; actually, the discipline acknowledges receipt of the inconveniences brought by that amplitude. Finally, the paper argues that the way in which comparatism is articulated in the field of American cultural studies reveals a basis in determined hegemonic spaces, built in first person, that puts again at the forefront the problem of national identity.Save to Libraryby Manuel Abeledo•  19  World Literatures, Comparative Literature, Political Science, World Literature“Untranslatability, Discomfort, Ideology: Should We Teach Arabic Literature?”Found in *Teaching Arabic Literature in Translation* edited by Michelle Hartman (MLA Publications 2018; pp 41-61), this essay is an exploration of the potential pedagogical spaces of alternative methodologies and theories for teaching... moreFound in *Teaching Arabic Literature in Translation* edited by Michelle Hartman  (MLA Publications 2018; pp 41-61), this essay is an exploration of the potential pedagogical spaces of alternative methodologies and theories for teaching Arabic literature in English translation in North American university classrooms. This proposal encourages academics—specialists, comparativists, and generalists alike—to reflect not only on the contexts of Arabic literary production (i.e., the context of the text, author, language, etc.) but also on the social relations in which educators, their students, classrooms, and institutions are enmeshed with the translation, circulation, deployment, and reading of Arabic texts within any given political moment. In exploring teaching Arabic literature in translation, this chapter takes a decolonial approach where the students and instructor not only locate themselves in regards to the text and the origins of that Arabic text (for example, in the age of  the Cold War, the American Unipolar World, or post-American Empire). But also, the pedagogical thoughtfulness considers ideological constructs of reading and writing (the commuting between the context, history and contact points of Arabic and English) that might be mutually untranslatable but also could yield ways to decenter the coloniality of the learning process in US higher education and its experience with the Global South.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Sheehi•  16  World Literatures, Translation Studies, Arabic Literature, TranslationDavid Mitchell's Post-Secular World: Buddhism, Belief and the Urgency of CompassionRose Harris-Birtill analyses the secular reworking of Buddhist religious influences across David Mitchell’s complete fictions, including his novels, short stories, and libretti, arguing that their shared ethical perspectives draw them... moreRose Harris-Birtill analyses the secular reworking of Buddhist religious influences across David Mitchell’s complete fictions, including his novels, short stories, and libretti, arguing that their shared ethical perspectives draw them into a continuous post-secular world, and introducing the Tibetan Buddhist mandala as a fittingly post-secular comparative model through which to analyse Mitchell’s fictional worldview. Harris-Birtill demonstrates that Mitchell’s fictions cumulatively map not a physical terrain but the metaphysical world of belief, creating an interconnected world-system in order to suggest new ethical approaches to global humanitarian crises, revaluing the role of secular belief in galvanising both compassionate action and collective resistance. This study also reads the recurring character of Marinus as a form of secular bodhisattva, analysing Mitchell’s use of reincarnation as a form of non-linear temporality aimed at generating future-facing ethical action amidst the worryingly linear temporality of the Anthropocene. Harris-Birtill also identifies shared post-secular world-building in other contemporary literature, analysing novels by Michael Ondaatje, Ali Smith, Yann Martel, Will Self and Margaret Atwood in order to suggest the emerging literary category of mandalic literature. This perceptive study combines Buddhist philosophy with critical theory, drawing on Jung, Derrida, Foucault and Spivak, alongside contemporary theories of metamodernism and globalization. Taking a post-Jungian approach to the Tibetan mandala not as an ahistorical symbol but as a living socio-cultural artefact in diaspora, Harris-Birtill also identifies the wider implications of the mandala’s theorisation, noting the urgent need to resituate this ‘holistic’ symbol within the ongoing socio-political struggles that led to its increased international visibility.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rose Harris-Birtill•  20  Buddhism, World Literatures, Buddhist Philosophy, Jungian psychologyThe Politics of the Archive in Semi-PeripheriesAlthough the first world, as seen through the lens of academia, seems to be prospering, and the third world has found its own place in the postcolonial intellectual order, the post-cold war world of semi-peripheries in East and Central... moreAlthough the first world, as seen through the lens of academia, seems to be prospering, and the third world has found its own place in the postcolonial intellectual order, the post-cold war world of semi-peripheries in East and Central Europe (ECE) has largely disappeared from the discourse of Comparative Literature.

Both are shown to muddle the inside-outside binary that delineates nations and continents, and which has been particularly stark in framing Africa in both imperial and nativist thought. At the same time, coastal form is found to decenter, extend and thicken constructions of world literature, while opening to a planetary perspective sensible to the prodigious and implacable forces of the Anthropocene.Save to LibraryDownloadby Meg Samuelson•  17  African Studies, World Literatures, African Literature, World LiteratureIt's Only the End of the WorldExtended review and discussion of Emily Apter's "Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability" (New York: Verso, 2013).

The book's most powerful argument, in my view, is that the "untranslatable" profitless excreta of the world's literatures are both the matter with which to rethink comparison and the limits of the inflationary World Literature industry.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ben  Baer•  12  World Literatures, Comparative Literature, Translation Studies, PoststructuralismShiv K.

Kumar, who began his poetic journey with Articulate Silences (1970), consummated it mysteriously with Where Have the Dead Gone? and Other Poems (2014). Where Have the Dead Gone & Other Poems” (2014) is a collection of 67 poems which reveal Kumar’s maturity, imagination and intuitions. He does not wish to give any message through his poetry though the reader himself becomes aware and shows his interest in understanding life through his poems—the poems which speak of the experiences in life.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sudhir K Arora•  9  World Literatures, Literature, Poetry, SpiritualityItalo Calvino, "Cosmicómicas" y el socialismo humanitario, La PrensaDiálogo con Italo Calvino, publicado en el diario "La Prensa", en Buenos Aires, en 1986Save to LibraryDownloadby amelia barili•  9  World Literatures, Social Sciences, Literature, Jorge Luis BorgesEl paisaje literario (estudio y antología de las literaturas hispánicas)Si bien las antologías son libros que pertenecen al que Marrero Henríquez denomina “género de la disculpa”, libros ad hoc y finalistas que mantienen el precario equilibrio de su objetividad como lo mantiene una moneda que se sostiene por... moreSi bien las antologías son libros que pertenecen al que Marrero Henríquez denomina “género de la disculpa”, libros ad hoc y finalistas que mantienen el precario equilibrio de su objetividad como lo mantiene una moneda que se sostiene por un instante sobre su canto antes de mostrar caprichosamente su cara o su cruz, no por sus aporías renuncia El paisaje literario a ser útil, ni por ellas desatiende sus fines programáticos, antes al contrario, en las dificultades de seleccionar y ordenar el corpus de la descripción paisajística de las literaturas hispánicas halla El paisaje literario el estímulo para la consecución de los retos que desde su título anuncia. El paisaje literario privilegia los hechos de la historia de la literatura y se pliega a sus evidencias porque sus fines son servir al conocimiento de las condiciones en las que el paisaje se origina y desarrolla y reflejar la evolución de la descripción paisajística en tanto tal evolución afecta tanto a los lugares a los que los textos literarios han prestado atención descriptiva como al tratamiento literario que tales lugares han tenido a lo largo del tiempo. No en vano, y muy lejos ya de la hipotiposis de la naturaleza, o del topos retórico que da lugar al locus amoenus en la forma breve de la enumeratio o en la forma prolija de la descriptio, el paisaje, sin dejar de ser un elemento retórico, sin dejar de ser lo que ha sido, es hoy lo que ha ido siendo y lo que va siendo con la riqueza de los nuevos sustratos que abonan día a día su magia literaria.Save to LibraryDownloadby José Manuel Marrero Henríquez•  10  Landscape Ecology, Cultural Studies, Latin American Studies, World Literaturesthe domino effects of terrorism Terrorism happens to have grown on a global scale, what are are presently witnessing is the multiplier effect of the Arab spring.Save to LibraryDownloadby peter Okafor (pexgraphics)•  20  Nigerian Literature, History, Sociology, PsychologyUtopías críticas: la literatura mundial según América LatinaSave to LibraryDownloadby Guillermina De Ferrari•  3  World Literatures, Latin America and World Literature, Literatura MundialCaietele Echinox vol. 38Planetary Spaces.

My contention is that this shift in his novelistic project can be understood as a career-spanning interest in the dynamic between constraint and freedom that generic conceits force upon us in any conceptualization the world. The genre conventions of The Buried Giant, and Never Let Me Go signify not unbounded fantasy, but indeed the opposite: a writer hemming his style and characters into worlds in which structures necessary for understanding have been reduced tothe barest elements by which meaning might be produced. Such constraints flag a parallel concern about the way the novel can and should be read as it concerns knowledge gleaned about the world. Thinking with the structures of the novel’s limits are in this way thebeginning of meaning-making, rather than the end.Save to LibraryDownloadby Chris Holmes•  7  British Literature, World Literatures, Speculative Fiction, Kazuo IshiguroOn world literature's frontier: Jules Verne and the portable printing press(Free e-print available: https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/MCHGJSZ75C4HF8HZYQ86/full?target=10.1080/08905495.2021.1867815)Save to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Riordan•  10  World Literatures, Translation Studies, History of the Book, Periodical StudiesWorld at Work: Indian Women RagpickersBackground: Society, as a whole, regards rag pickers as antisocial elements, an embarrassment to the community, and unfits to live.

However, their useful contribution to society and ecology is little understood and generally ignored. The waste collected by these women is recycled and produces 25% of the paper, the packing materials, egg trays, plastic and metal household items, etc., used in homes. This benefits the society and world-ecology enormously by the production of cheaper household goods, and the slowing down of the destruction of the already threatened forests.Objectives: To study the socio-economic condition of women rag pickers in the present-day scenario. To understand the health problems of women rag pickers. To examine the earning, spending and debt patterns of women rag pickers. Methods: The present study is based on primary and secondary data. The primary data have been collected from three towns of Warangal, Karimnagar and Khammam of Telangana State, India and the sample of the study comprised of 100 rag pickers and selected purposively by using a snowball sampling technique. Results: Majority of women rag pickers age group 21-30 years, 80 per cent are married, 74 per cent of illiterates, 50 per cent of scheduled caste, 87 per cent belong to the nucleus family, their family size is 5-7 members and 83 per cent staying at small huts. Nearly 68 per cent of women rag pickers income is below Rs.11,000/ per annum. Eighty per cent are in debt. Fifty-two per cent has drawn loan from moneylenders, the purpose of the debt on medical expenses, 90 per cent means of transportation for collecting garbages on foot. Majority of women rag pickers opinion that they do not continue this job for a long period, 85 per cent are facing health problems and 94 per cent also opinion that rag-picking is not an appreciated job. Most of the hazardous content was quite high in developing countries since the regulatory and enforcement system to control such waste disposal is usually not in operating.Save to LibraryDownloadby B Suresh Lal, PhD•  19  World Literatures, Poverty, Women's Rights, Women“The Unwanted One Wants More: Plurality Through Heritage in Ken Bugul’s Le Baobab fou” in Edwards, N. and Hogarth, C.

Mais les représentations du Tibet au 20e siècle présentent-elles véritablement pareille homogénéité ? Ne faut-il pas tracer une histoire globale des représentations du Tibet traversée de phénomènes locaux de discontinuités et d'hétérogénéités ? C'est pour répondre à ce projet que le présent article s'intéresse à la résurgence récente du Tibet au sein de l'espace littéraire francophone, notamment sous la plume des poètes Kenneth White, Maurice Chappaz et André Velter. De par leurs projets esthétiques et leurs situations géolittéraires propres, ces trois auteurs témoignent d'une élaboration nouvelle d'un espace interculturel tibétain en littérature.Save to LibraryDownloadby Samuel Thévoz•  36  Fiction Writing, Cultural History, World Literatures, Comparative Literature多语间的“四分之一”及一世纪的“古今之变”~关于新加坡华文文学的两个面向/
