After several major surgeries, food allergies were determined by serum immunoglobulin E testing, and when he finally went on a gluten-free diet, he stopped forming calculi and has had no surgeries related to kidney calculi since. Hyperoxaluria was not identified in this child by 24-hour urine analysis, unlike most other reports of kidney calculus formation in individuals with gluten intolerance.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This use was studied, and, subsequently, isolated berberine was found to be so effective for treating diarrhea that the substance was approved as an over-the-counter diarrheal remedy in China in the 1950s. This article reviews the research on use of berberine for treating congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This research suggests that berberine should be more widely used to address these conditions. Berberine is an inexpensive chemical, and virtually every culture has some exposure to berberine-containing plants used in traditional medicine. This wide usage and exposure suggests that berberine is a very safe compound.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
