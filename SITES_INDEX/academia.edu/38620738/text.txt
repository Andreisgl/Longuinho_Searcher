The environment took on an acute importance in the rapidly industrialis- ing and colonising Empire, prompting a wide range of projects, from landscape conservation and the design of garden suburbs to pioneering soil research and colonial planning. What made these diverging scientific, political and design undertakings understandable as environ- mental projects is the notion of Bodenständigkeit—the quality of something rooted in, or uniquely appropriate to, the soil on which it stands. This idea was more than just the symptom of a romantic or anti-modern mind set; it was part and parcel of a novel environ- mental way of thinking, prompting discussions about the future and conservation of urban and natural landscapes, the form of new buildings and settlements, and the methods of dom- estic and overseas colonisation. Bodenständigkeit, this article argues, is not only a primary category of early environmental conservation but the first version of an environmental deter- minism that would come to structure twentieth-century modernism at large.Download Free PDFView PDFModern Figures, Visionaries, and InventorsClaudia Perren, Alexia PoothBig Plans! On Applied Modernism in Saxony -- Anhalt 1919 --- 1933 The development of modernism in what is today Saxony-Anhalt was shaped by visionaries, artists, engineers, alternative therapists, architects, politicians, and inventors in the period between 1919 and 1933 with their experiments in urban planning, education, flying, industry, or advertising. Whether in Dessau, Halle, Magdeburg, Leuna, or Merseburg—women and men throughout the state consistently worked on designing life, home, work, and pleasure for the new, healthy, mobile, athletic, and fashion-conscious individual. The related awareness of being “modern” was propagated as a credo in books, magazines, and posters. Pioneering inventions such as the “Pilotenrakete” (manned rocket) in Magdeburg, the handyman-suitable “Zollingerdach” (Zollinger roof) in Merseburg, and the test drives of the RAK “rocket sled” in the district of Harz shaped the view of current events, while the “crop” haircut became modern and the topic of self-sufficiency by having one’s own garden played a big role in parallel. The Bauhaus’s move to Dessau in 1925 therefore took place at a “breathtaking” time. “Big plans” were circulating on a large scale...Download Free PDFView PDFConference Program Architecture And the Paradox of Dissidence2012 • Ines WeizmanConference Program of 9th International Conference of the Architectural Humanities Research Association (AHRA) 15-17 November 2012 School of Architecture The Sir John Cass Faculty of Art, Architecture and Design London Metropolitan University Organised by Dr. Ines WeizmanDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of the Society of Architectural HistoriansFrom "National Style" to "Rationalized Construction": Mass-Produced Housing, Style, and Discourse in the East German Journal Deutsche Architektur, 1956–19642015 • Emily PughThis article examines architectural critique of housing and style as it unfolded in the East German journal Deutsche Architektur (German architecture) from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. Through an analysis of articles published in the journal as well as primary source documents, Emily Pugh investigates the reception of newly built housing developments in East Germany by a group of influential socialist architects, historians, and critics who were then writing for Deutsche Architektur. Pugh highlights individual architects’ attempts to subvert or resist the control of state and party authorities and considers how these individuals’ efforts might have influenced the development of the East German building economy. She also argues that these architects’ understanding of architectural modernism differed from that of their counterparts in the Cold War West, having been influenced by political and economic circumstances specific to East Germany.Download Free PDFView PDFUrban Planning (Open Access Journal) ISBN: 2183-7635 | Publisher: Cogitatio PressHousing Builds Cities2019 • Chiara Monterumisi, Alessandro PorottoFar from nostalgically celebrate the 90th anniversary of the second CIAM, which indeed opened in October 1929 in Frankfurt, the present issue is intended as collective work, a springboard which aims to widen the debate over housing experiences beyond geographical and temporal frameworks. The focus of that event, the Existenzminimum , has often been cited as representing a fundamental contribution to the rational design of the modern dwelling. But, the debates during that event went beyond the definition of this concept, because demonstrated, on the one hand, how the responsibility of architects would imply the resolution of multiple technical aspects, starting from the typological concern stretching towards the town planning aspects, and on the other hand, the calling to develop a multifaceted intellectual vision of society. The title selected for the present issue denotes the different scales of the project, the aim is to achieve a something more. First and foremost, the objective is not strictly confined to a historical understanding of facts around the 1929 congress. Today a critically objective approach is useful to examine past contributions and, if applicable, their actualization. Secondly, this special issue intends to address the CIAMs’ theoretical and architectural legacy. The hypothesis on their interpretation suggests that these are still topical issues today. The issue comprises fourteen articles which investigate, through different applied methodologies, the years from the first steps of the CIAMs to the 1929 aftermath, analyze the post-war production and explore many case-studies, of which some are also geographically far from a Eurocentric vision as well as contemporary realities. > guest authors Paola Viganò, Bruno Marchand and Eric Mumford > authors Susanne Komossa and Martin Aarts ; Lidwine Spoormans, Daniel Navas-Carrillo, Hielkje Zijstra and Teresa Pérez-Cano ; Silvia Malcovati ; Andreina Milan ; Hamed Khosravi ; Yael Allweil and Noa Zemer ; Gérald Ledent ; Rhea Rieben ; Nicola Braghieri ; Nelson Mota ; Manlio Michieletto, Olatunde Adedayo and Victor Bay Mukunya ; Marson Korbi and Andrea Migotto ; Valentin Bourdon ; Sara BryschDownload Free PDFView PDFModular Design.

A first article will give an overview of the spread of the buildings from this time in Europe, focusing on a new construction material: the reinforced concrete, on the basis of a chapter from the doctorate thesis of Maria Bostenaru supervised by Cristina Gociman. For the documentation of these, Maria Bostenaru did study trips to investigate the buildings on site in the past 15 years. At the basis of these study trips was the literature review in the field, from which we highlight the references provided by a study seminar at the University of Karlsruhe about architecture in the first half of the 20th century in Eastern Europe and the series of books on 20th century architecture by Prestel. Apart of this monographs dedicated to the countries subject of the research were consulted. The result of the research on site were mostly the investigation through photography of the facade, which displayed a new language compared to the previous period. Where it was possible, this was combined with the investigation of the interior space. Also, sources of the floor plan were looked for, from the references but mostly from archives. As a result, the book includes a review of the study trips documentation, with example images, references and the connection to the online database of photography. The online database built the subject of a common research of Maria Bostenaru with Alex Dill during a short visit funded by NeDiMAH at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the goal of this publication is to document this database. Browsing the database is predecesed by forms on selected architects, for which we present also the biography, along with main works and visual material. In the idea of forms are also the posters of Cristina Gociman about Romanian architects which created cultural heritage during this time. The research thus started at the University of Karlsruhe, where Alex Dill, chair of DOCOMOMO Germany (The association for the documentation and conservation of buildings, sites and neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement) approached the second pillar of the association apart of documentation: conservation. A series of workshops were dedicated to invite specialists from different countries, thematically organised, who were involved in conserving these buildings. The book contains reviews of these conferences and a chapter by Alex Dill about this conservation.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
