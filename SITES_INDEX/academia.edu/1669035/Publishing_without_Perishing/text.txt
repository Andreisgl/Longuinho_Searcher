It arose from the understanding that emerging scholars today are navigating a particularly challenging career landscape. As new technologies and shifts in institutional support structures affect all aspects of academic activities, including publishing, these changes are felt perhaps most strongly by those who are near the beginning of their careers. This forum is intended to create a space for airing concerns, challenges, and also senses of possibility and transformation. http://www.contemporarytheatrereview.org/2015/forum-on-academic-publishing/Download Free PDFView PDFPublish and Perish.pdfNick  ButlerDownload Free PDFView PDFPublish or Perish" in Academia: On Its Way Out?: A Study Examining Recent Popular and Academic Trends Concerning the Issue, With a Focus on Possible Effects …1996 • James BrandonPaper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Speech Communication Association (82nd, San Diego, CA, November 23-26, 1996). ...

(1) Workgroup2016 • Rikk MulliganThe mechanisms used for scholarly publishing have remained largely unchanged over time, even as we’ve moved from a print-based world to a digital world. The scholarly communication ecosystem, however, is now undergoing a period of rapid transformation, including the introduction of new actors, new services, and increased pressure to improve the means of scholarly communication in order to meet the growing expectations of an information-rich world. Where to begin? The first question is to ask how scholarly publishing can provide the greatest benefit to global society in a sustainable way. Our two-day conversation about this question led us to the conclusion that the “black box,” monolithic model of scholarly publishing no longer serves most researchers.

This workshop seeks to open the question of new modes of publication on digital media, in term of writing modalities, but also in term of new scientific and business models. What is possible today? Where are the limits? The workshop will help the doctoral candidate to ask the right questions about publications, in order to make conscious choices that correspond to his/her personal goals. At the end of the workshop, participant: - Can perform thoughtful choices for pu...Download Free PDFView PDFHelping Publish not PerishDavid HarmeyerA personal narrative is presented in which the author, a university departmental research librarian, recounts using his knowledge and skills to help a researcher to find journals to which he can submit work for publication.Download Free PDFView PDFPublish but Perish; Digital Publication as an AlternativeVinsensio  DugisDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
