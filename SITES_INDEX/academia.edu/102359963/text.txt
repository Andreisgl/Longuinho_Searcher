(2015, July). An experimental study of physiological connectedness among twins in relation to attachment. Paper presented at the combined 58th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association and 39th International Society for Psychical Research Annual Conference, University of Greenwich, 16-19th July. Parapsychological research into distant interactions between individuals seems to indicate that the bond between sender and receiver is important. The present study was designed to investigate the ostensible relationship between telepathy and attachment between twins. By applying the concept of attachment from developmental psychology, this becomes the first study in parapsychology to explore the degree of attachment between twins as a potential dependent variable relating to their apparent telepathic connection. At the current stage of evaluating a new methodology, we report the design and findings of the pilot study. From an initial pool of thirty pairs of twins, four pairs of identical twins were selected on the basis of their responses to the Exceptional Experiences Questionnaire and on the basis of the availability of both twins to take part in the study. The test procedure required each of them to alternate in the role of sender in which they were exposed to a shock or surprise stimuli and in the role of receiver in which they were physiologically monitored for their electrodermal responses (EDR). Senders were presented with altogether five stimuli, one stimulus during each of the five trials per twin session. For each trial, the stimulus was presented during a 30 second period randomly chosen from eight possible such epochs composing in total four minutes. With a further 30 seconds added to establish baselines before and after each session, this meant each session would last five minutes. Graphs from 19 of the useable sessions belonging to 3 pairs of twins were analyzed by the lead researcher (GB), who was blind to the time epochs in which the stimuli had been presented by the researcher working with the senders (AP). An independent evaluation of the EDRs from the EDR, in this study used for the receiver was carried out by the designer of the equipment. The task here was to identify a peak of the graph in the receiver’s reaction which might approximately correspond to the midpoint in the period the stimulus had been presented to the sender. In four sessions out of the 19, these identifications corresponded to the actual exposure period for the shock or surprise stimulus – constituting so-called “hits”, compared to the MCE = 2.375. Although this fails to reach significance, p >.05, three out of these four correct placements were contributed by just one of the twins. The attachment data that twins contributed via the EEQ questionnaire indicated that all the twins in the current study seemed to experience similar high levels of attachment. This consistency in strong and close relationships meant of course there was a lack of variance as concerns the hypothesis that attachment would predict the scores. The results of the Experiences in Close Relationships – Revised (ECR) indicated that all the twins had very low scores on attachment-related anxiety and avoidance in their relationships. The profiles of twins having many hits in the telepathy experiment as regards any aspects of dysfunctional attachment (anxiety and avoidance) were not significantly different from those of the others. The data provides justification for a major study using this methodology with selected pairs of twins. Some major improvements in the design were suggested. One of these involves the synchronous monitoring of the electrodermal activity for the sender as well as the receiver in order to give a precise record of the timing and the effect of the shock stimuli.Download Free PDFView PDFIndividual differences in psychosocial and neurological predictors of surveillance detection via extrasensory meansDavid  LukeFriday, R., & Luke, D. (2015, July). Individual differences in psychosocial and neurological predictors of surveillance detection via extrasensory means. Paper submitted for presentation at the combined 58th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association and 39th International Society for Psychical Research Annual Conference, University of Greenwich, 16-19th July. Many people have turned to see someone behind them due to a ‘sense’ they were being watched. Others have ‘inexplicably’ become aware of a conversation involving them, despite it being inaudible. There are many theoretical explanations for these events, one of which is that extrasensory awareness is evolutionarily advantageous, and therefore may have developed during an era in which danger was everpresent with survival depending on such capabilities. Evidence supporting the existence of extrasensory surveillance detection would have implications beyond purely scientific interest, yet the phenomena remains under-researched and may benefit from a fresh approach. A new study being conducted at the University of Greenwich is examining not only the possible existence of ‘psychic’ detection - but also which psychosocial and neurological factors may predict this ability, as well as the belief in such phenomena. The ability to detect attention has previously been restricted to the psychic staring effect, also known as scopaesthesia - a phenomenon in which people respond via non-conventional means to being the subject of another persons’ gaze (Sheldrake, 2003). However this new investigation will further the research by these abilities will be gauged by the accuracy of participant’s reports of being watched and/or listened to, differences in their behaviour during surveillance, and physiological reactions determined by electrodermal activity (EDA) which measures the electrical conductance of the participant’s skin to indicate arousal. All participants’ will have the opportunity to detect being watched and/or listened to via all of these methods in a randomly assigned order. During the experiment, participants are to be subjected to varying re-occurring conditions a) not under any surveillance, b) being watched, c) being listened to, and d) being watched and listened to). Participants will not be (conventionally) made aware that all of these conditions will occur, when they will happen, and if all the varations will take place. However they will be asked to report when they ‘feel’ they are being watched and/or listened to so that these reports can be compared against actual periods of surveillance to determine reporting accuracy. Results will also be analysed to examine whether participants exhibit a physiological response to surveillance, and if any behavioural differences coincide with being watched and/or listened to. Psychosocial and neurological factors which may be related to surveillance detection will also be investigated, and so participants’ paranormal belief, temporal lobe lability and levels of schizotypy will be measured as both predictors of extrasensory ability, and as possible explanations for reported anomalous experiences. This original and unique fusion of parapsychological, anomalistic, neuroscientific, and social factors represents an essential and progressive step in understanding possible extrasensory ability, as well as its psychosocial and neurological relationships. This paper presents planned research which will begin soon at the University of Greenwich.Download Free PDFView PDFTheoretical approaches in parapsychologyDavid  LukeTheoretical approaches in parapsychology: Chaired symposium at the combined 58th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association and 39th International Society for Psychical Research Annual Conference, University of Greenwich, 16-19th July.

Panel discussion paper submitted for presentation at the combined 58th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association and 39th International Society for Psychical Research Annual Conference, University of Greenwich, 16-19th July. Video of panel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg8gAGc1sFE Audio recording here: http://jack-hunter.webstarts.com/contact.html Field reports from explorers, anthropologists and ethnobotanists have long since attested to the apparent psi-inducing properties of shamanic plant psychedelics, such as the Amazonian decoction ayahuasca and the mescaline-containing cacti San Pedro and peyote. After reviewing the literature an initial experimental precognition protocol was developed for use in field research and piloted in Brazil and Ecuador with participants who were taking part in ayahuasca rituals. The preliminary findings did not provide evidence for precognition under the influence of ayahuasca, nevertheless a number of methodological issues became apparent from conducting the study that may account for the findings. Taking into consideration problems identified with the test protocol a new experimental design was developed and was planned for use with participants under the influence of San Pedro cactus in a ritual context, however the implementation of the second protocol was hampered by cultural rather than internal design factors and an alternative solution was sought by testing the protocol in principle using just one participant, with encouraging findings. The process of, and problems associated with conducting and developing experimental field research with participants utilizing plant psychedelics in a ritual context are discussed and proposals for future research are put forward.Download Free PDFView PDFThe combined 58th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association and 39th International Society for Psychical Research Annual Conference (2015)David  LukeThe combined 58th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association and 39th International Society for Psychical Research Annual Conference, University of Greenwich, 16-19th July.

KellyThe Classification and Statistical Manual of Extrasensory Experiences (CSM-EE) is a classification of extrasensory experiences (i.e. telepathy, clairvoyance, mediumship, precognition, synchronistic events, etc.) with associated criteria designed to facilitate more reliable classification. CSM-EE assists in identifying like experiences that are similar in phenomenology, but otherwise widely differ in narrative due to culture, language, and religious/spiritual belief. Whereby, the CSM-EE can assist in accurate classification and is therefore a valuable resource for clinicians and students, and a valuable reference for researchers, dealing with extrasensory experiences in a wide diversity of context. The criteria and associated phenomenological features and specifiers serve in part as a textbook for students who require a well-structured method to understand and classify extrasensory experiences as well as for experienced professionals encountering these experiences for the first time.Download Free PDFView PDFParapsychology: An introductionAlkshendra Kunal AshokDownload Free PDFView PDFParanthropology: Journal of Anthropological Approaches to the Paranormal Vol. 2 No. 3 (July 2011)Jack  HunterDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
