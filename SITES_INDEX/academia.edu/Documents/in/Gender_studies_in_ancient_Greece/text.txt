One happened in a theatre on a hillside in the center of Athens on a spring day in late March of 431 BCE. The second happened there sixteen years later, in March of 415 BCE. Both took place as the audience watched tragedies by the poet Euripides. These plays were about gendered oppression, sexual pain, rape, slavery and the horrors of war.Save to LibraryDownloadby jonathan neale•  8  Gender Studies, Greek Tragedy, Gender and Sexuality, Gender studies in ancient GreeceThe Brutality of Citizen WivesAn essay on the ancient Greek feminine fertility cult, The Thesmophoria, and its oftentimes harsh rules against male participation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mary Naples•  6  Ancient Greek Religion, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Ancient Greece, Ancient Greek LiteratureA misoginia na tradição biográfica de EurípidesEurípides, entre os três tragediógrafos canônicos da Grécia clássica, é aquele de quem a Antiguidade nos legou maior quantidade de material biográfico.

Percorrendo esse material, nota-se a persistente caracterização do poeta como misógino (μισογύνης). A palavra figura em dois dos textos biográficos mais importantes em torno do poeta (a Vida anônima anexada aos manuscritos medievais de sua obra e o verbete do Suda), e sua “aversão às mulheres” é aludida direta ou indiretamente em todas as Vidas que chegaram aos nossos dias. Este artigo apresentará essas ocorrências e buscará analisá-las à luz da comédia de Aristófanes, propondo uma articulação entre as paradoxais recepções da obra do poeta na Antiguidade e na modernidade, quando será construída a imagem de um Eurípides “feminista”.Save to LibraryDownloadby Camila de Moura•  16  Gender Studies, Greek Tragedy, Greek Theatre, Gender studies in ancient GreeceAspectos demográficos sobre los hilotas espartanos (Demographic aspects of the Spartan helots)Save to LibraryDownloadby Arturo S.

It serves as an introduction to Greek and Roman history and culture, plus a look at Diversity-keyed issues such as poverty, ethnicity, inequality, slavery, gender, and "sexual minorities." Finally it looks (critically) at some modern appropriations of the ancient Mediterranean heritage such as the Second Wave Feminist notions of an ancient "Goddess Culture" in Europe; Mussolini's appropriation of Ancient Rome and Hitler's of Sparta; and the Black Athena controversy and Afrocentrist appropriations of Greek philosophy. In rewriting the class, my goal was to take an honest look at these issues (particularly ancient inequality) without the sort of trite and clichéd "P.C." attitude that I often found during my 10 years (BA, MA, and PhD) at UC Berkeley.Save to LibraryDownloadby Timothy D Doran•  5  Roman History, Spartan history & modern reception, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Classical Reception StudiesBride of Hades to Bride of ChristThis volume argues that ancient Greek girls and early Christian virgins and their families made use of rhetorically similar traditions of marriage to an otherworldly bridegroom in order to handle the problem of a girl’s denied or... moreThis volume argues that ancient Greek girls and early Christian virgins and their families made use of rhetorically similar traditions of marriage to an otherworldly bridegroom in order to handle the problem of a girl’s denied or disrupted transition into adulthood.In both ancient Greece and early Christian Rome, the standard female transition into adulthood was marked by marriage, sex, and childbirth. When problems arose just before or during this transition, the transitional girl’s status within society became insecure. Walker presents a case for how and why the dead Greek virgin girl, depicted in Archaic through Hellenistic sources, in both texts and inscriptions, as a bride of Hades, and the life-long female Christian virgin or celibate ascetic, dubbed the bride of Christ around the third century CE, provide a fruitful point of comparison as particular examples of strategies used to neutralize the tension of disrupted female transition into adulthood.Bride of Hades to Bride of Christ offers a fascinating comparative study that will be of interest to anyone working on virginity and womanhood in the ancient world.Save to LibraryDownloadby Abbe Walker•  6  Early Christianity, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Early Church Fathers, Women in ancient GreeceLucian's Dialogues of the CourtesansThe aim of this book is to make The Dialogues of the Courtesans by Lucian of Samosata (c. 120 CE –190) accessible to intermediate students of Ancient Greek.

The running vocabulary and grammatical commentary are meant to provide everything necessary to read each page, so that readers can progress through the text, improving their knowledge of Greek while enjoying one of the most entertaining authors of antiquity. These dialogues are another example of Lucian presenting unusual perspectives on Greek culture and literature, this time by creating amusing dialogues that occur mostly among the professional companions, hetairai, who formed a special form of upscale entertainment for elite men in the classical period. The women in these dialogues sometimes interact with male clients, but in most of them we find only women, as they speak of their hopes and fears and the business of love.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephen  Nimis•  5  Second Sophistic, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Ancient Greek Language, Ancient Greek LiteratureThe Sexuality of AdonisSave to LibraryDownloadby Jay Reed•  80  Religion, Comparative Religion, Mythology And Folklore, Ancient HistoryThe Politics of Sacrifice in Early Greek Myth and PoetryThis book offers a new interpretation of ancient Greek sacrifice in early Greek myth and poetry.

Through close readings of the Theogony, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the Homeric Hymn to Hermes and the Odyssey in conjunction with recent anthropological theory, it demonstrates how sacrifice narratives in early Greek hexameter poetry are intimately connected to a mythic-poetic discourse referred to as the “politics of the belly.” This mythic-poetic discourse presents sacrifice as a site of symbolic conflict between the male stomach and female womb for both mortals and immortals. Ultimately, the book argues that the ritual of sacrifice operates as a cultural mechanism for the perpetuation of patriarchal ideology not just in early Greek hexameter poetry, but throughout Greek cultural history.Save to LibraryDownloadby Charles H Stocking•  19  Mythology, Classics, Greek Literature, HomerMaidens, fillies and the death of Medusa on a seventh-century pithosSave to LibraryDownloadby Kathryn Topper•  5  Women in the ancient world, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Classical Mythology, Ancient Greek and Roman ArtQuestioni di genere e metafore animali nella letteratura grecaOn the threshold of separating humans from animals, we can trace not only taxonomic and cognitive issues but also power dynamics through literature and language.

Anthropology has long started focusing on the normative function of the zoomorphic images created by these cultural media. In the ancient Greek culture this function can be found in the construction of gender identities, as shown by the very ancient model by which women formed their own génos, conceived in term of a species completely different from the male one, and marked with a specific nóos. Another example can be found in the set of metaphors illustrating the woman as a sort of animal to be tamed. In a specular way, the animal species met with a gender characterization: this is quite clear in the physiognomy, whereby "male" species such as the lion, the wolf and the wild boar, were opposed to "female" species like the leopard, the dog and the swine. This phenomenon could sometimes find an equivalent in the linguistic use, where the semantic gender of some animal names shifts to match the marked male/female features of the species, reinforcing the impression that the gender characterizations of the different species could constitute a coherent and meaningful semantic set, with well defined functions in the building of the social identities man/woman.Save to LibraryDownloadby Cristiana Franco•  3  Gender Studies, Animal Studies, Gender studies in ancient GreeceDionysus and His Cult and Worship: A Gender StudyDionysus has always been a god of mystery and subversion.

However, reexamination of the iconography--together with a reconsideration of gender roles and the archaeology of Greek houses dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BC--suggests that these images idealize female contributions to the household in a positive way. The scenes utilize the dual metaphor of weaving and marriage to express the harmonia of oikos and polis, a theme particularly significant under the evolving Athenian democracy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sheramy Bundrick•  11  History of Textiles, Textile Archaeology, Greek Archaeology, Gender studies in ancient GreeceThe Aphrodite of Knidos and Doryphoros in the study of the roles of women in Classical GreeceSave to LibraryDownloadby Lara Berry•  13  Ancient History, Classics, Feminist Theory, WomenGender and SlaveryThis chapter investigates the relation between gender and slavery among the Greeks and Romans.

It considers the gendered division of labour for enslaved people with a special emphasis on enslaved females and female enslavers in the domestic context. Important topics covered include sexual violence against enslaved individuals, manumission, and prostitutes as enslaved. It argues that enslaved females were most common in domestic contexts and the sex and entertainment industry. Both contexts, however, meant that they were open to sexual abuse, but close contact with the free might also benefit enslaved women by leading to their manumission. Enslaved people frequently appear outside ancient constructions of gender, officially denied socio-political status as husbands, wives, fathers, and mothers, and free from behavioural expectations like male courage and female virtue; but this lack of a gendered identity was likely another element of their oppression.Save to LibraryDownloadby Allison Glazebrook•  8  Gender History, History of Slavery, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Ancient Greek HistoryHouse and Veil in Ancient GreeceSave to LibraryDownloadby Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones•  10  Archaeology, Anthropology, Iconography, Gender HistoryDress and Adornment in Archaic and Classical GreeceSave to LibraryDownloadby Mireille M Lee•  2  Gender studies in ancient Greece, Ancient Greek DressBody-Modification in Classical GreeceSave to LibraryDownloadby Mireille M Lee•  8  Dress and the Body, Ancient Greece (Anthropology), Dress and Personal Adornment (Archaeology), Gender studies in ancient GreecePerseus, the maiden Medusa, and the imagery of abductionSave to LibraryDownloadby Kathryn Topper•  5  Women in the ancient world, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Classical Mythology, Ancient Greek and Roman ArtThe Wide World of Caricature in Greek Vase Painting Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexander "Teddy" Mazurek•  8  Caricature (Visual Studies), Greek Archaeology, Gender studies in ancient Greece, Ancient Greek IconographyJokes on Him:  Caricature and Male Clients of Prostitutes on Greek-Vase PaintingSave to LibraryDownloadby Alexander "Teddy" Mazurek•  9  Gender Studies, Iconography, Caricature (Visual Studies), Greek ArchaeologyHelen's Hands: Weaving for Kleos in the OdysseyIn lieu of an abstract, here is a preview of the article: When Helen offers Telemachus a robe she herself has made in book 15 of the Odyssey, she bestows her gift with the hope that it will act as "a monument to the hands of Helen"... moreIn lieu of an abstract, here is a preview of the article:When Helen offers Telemachus a robe she herself has made in book 15 of the Odyssey, she bestows her gift with the hope that it will act as "a monument to the hands of Helen" (μνῆμ᾿ Ἑλένης χειρῶν, 15.126). Helen's peplos attests to the potential for handcrafted objects to immortalize those who have made them. It also serves as a useful reminder that even within Homeric epic, which in itself is an outstanding example of male kleos, various technologies exist for men and women to craft their own kleos. Helen's is the only garment in either epic to have its commemorative function expressly articulated, but other woven textiles are intricately bound up with scenes of recognition and reciprocity, where they implicitly refer to their makers' hands. The connection between aural and material sources of kleos is suggestively drawn by a scholiast to the Iliad who comments that, in representing Helen weaving the Trojan War ( Il. 3.125-8), "the poet has crafted a worthy model for his own poetic enterprise" (ἀξιόχρεων ἀρχέτυπον ἀνέπλασεν ὁ ποιητὴς τῆς ἰδίας ποιήσεως). 2 Helen as a model for Homer? Weaving, as the scholiast's words suggest, is an apt metaphor for the production of epic verse. But insofar as textile makers in the Homeric poems are all female, weaving and its associated products provide what appears to be a unique opportunity for women to circulate their kleos…Save to LibraryDownloadby Melissa Mueller•  9  Greek Literature, Homer, Women in the ancient world, Greek EpicGender Studies and Queer Theory (1970s-present) GENDER(S), POWER, AND MARGINALIZATIONGender studies and queer theory explore issues of sexuality, power, and marginalized populations (woman as other) in literature and culture.

Since the epithet ‘ιοκολπος (,,with a violet breast“) is attested not only, as is commonly believed, in Sappho's lyrics, but also in an inscription of Athenian Artemis Agrotera's altar (IG II (2), Ν 4573), we can better understand the religious outlook of the poetess as well as the working of the Sapphic guild on Lesbos. A comprehensive analysis of the sources allows us to conclude, that the poetess probably was a priestess of Artemis Agrotera as well as of Artemis Thermia, who was an ancient aquatic divinity of the island. We argue that the poetess had performed songs in a festival of this divinity and that the cult of Artemis in the thiasos of Sappho experienced strong Lydian influence during the life of the poetess. In addition Sappho was linked with Artemis by other varied ties of sacred service.Save to LibraryDownloadby Timofey Myakin•  16  Ancient History, Classical Archaeology, Gender Studies, ClassicsHerodotus and the Black BodyHerodotus’ view of Blackness is discussed only in relation to his 2.104 passage where he describes the Egyptian physical appearance.

This is a consequence of the modern debate on ancient Egyptian racial identity. Inevitably, commentators on 2.104 have been heavily concerned with defending their predispositions about ancient Egyptian racial identity. As a result, there has been no critical engagement with Herodotus’ conceptualization of Blackness. This analysis uses critical race theory to address this methodological problem. Contrary to the consensus in Greco-Roman studies, Blackness was a factor in ancient Greek racial thought. It is evident that Herodotus’ own understanding of Blackness did not differ from the general Greek worldview. Ultimately, this analysis shows that Blackness was a significant aspect of Herodotus’ ethnography for particular racial groups.Save to LibraryDownloadby Talawa Adodo•  31  History, Ancient History, Black Studies Or African American Studies, African StudiesConstru(ct)ing Gender in the Feminine Greek PeplosSave to LibraryDownloadby Mireille M Lee•  5  Gender studies in ancient Greece, Dress and Gender as a lens for Classical Antiquity, Ancient Greek Dress, History of Greek ArtA tale of two sisters: studies in Sophocles' TereusThis paper aims to reassess the role of sister- and siblinghood in the fragmentary 'Tereus' of Sophocles, a play unusual in its dramatization of a close and collaborative relationship between two sisters.

The plot hinges on their recognition and reunion, and the all-female bond of sisterhood is shown to outweigh both wife-husband and mother-son obligations. Finally, a close reading of three fragments suggests that the play was characterized by the language and imagery of siblinghood, reflecting the thematic centrality of sisterhood to this tragedy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lyndsay Coo•  57  Gender Studies, Mythology, Classics, Greek LiteratureVae victae.

Der Beitrag behandelt typische Frauenschicksale in antiken Konfliktsituationen, besonders am Beispiel des römischen Belagerungskrieges. Bei dieser einzigen antiken Approximation einer ‚totalen‘ Kriegsführung lässt sich am besten die katastrophale Überschneidung zwischen militärischer und ziviler Welt beobachten. Dabei werden sowohl die antiken literarischen als auch die wenigen vorhandenen ikonographischen Quellen ausgewertet, die sich explizit mit der Behandlung von Frauen auseinandersetzen, wobei vor allem die Themenkomplexe Kriegsgefangenschaft und anschließender Verkauf in die Sklaverei, Vergewaltigung und Mord im Vordergrund stehen.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christian Rollinger•  6  Gender studies in ancient Greece, Ancient Military History, gender studies, women in ancient Rome, Greek and Roman siege warfare"Sappho is wise" or the Philosophy of Female Initiation (the Sapphic "thiasos" in the light of the latest discoveries in papyrology and epigraphy) //ΣΧΟΛΗ.

It focuses on shaping of gender and sexuality in ancient Greek and Roman world. Thus, it is a sample study of gender studies in contemporary Turkish archaeology.The cognitive evolution of human brought with it a new era which human abandoned seeing itself as a part of nature. In the Neolithic period, human became a power that no longer finds its food by coincidentally, producing its own food and thereby capturing the land. The conquest of the mother earth has brought many transformations by itself. The people who can produce their own food, beyond their ability to determine their destiny, the old cones-nomads living in small communities, have already met with resident life, and they have preserved and stored food. Also they have had to create the state organization to protect their food. Social relations have become even more complex and the gender inequalities between the sexes have begun to emerge significantly. The patriarchal period, which still continues its presence, and the matriarchal period which keeping equal fertility of the woman and fertility of soil, the blood bond is determined by the mother is over. The new system brought with the life of the resident, the trail of the woman began to be erased, while the cult of the Mother Goddess continued to exist effectively in such a way that it contradicted it. Although this cult with the Phrygians’ Cybele shows its traces in the Greek and Roman world, a strict male-dominated culture is waiting for us.Most researchers, thinks gender inequality, which is considered to be the most fundamental problem in the ongoing women struggle emergence in ancient Greece. In fact, when we look at the life styles of the ancient Greeks, women only played a role in the reproduction of men. The woman has always been obliged to be at the behest of her master called kyrios. Kyrios, sometimes the father, sometimes has been another relative or husband; if none of them were alive, the woman had to be subject to the order of her own son. Although they cannot leave the house alone, they are forbidden even with the household to enter into the andron that room of the man. Especially in the periods when men started to play an active role in cities together with democracy, in the feasts organized by the men, even the women living in the households could create a very unpleasant situation. It is observed that the ancient Greek thinkers always see the female body as inadequate as compared to the male and female physiology. That's why women's intelligence is under the intelligence of men and the man has to educate the woman he married.Hetairas, the only women group in the community, who were respected and acted in a comfortable manner, were able to develop themselves in every field in an interesting way and were able to participate in the men's world, especially in the feasts.It is not surprising that the male body was blessed and idealized in the Greek society, which was believed to have been woman body created as a curse, especially in the gymnasium where men were engaged in sport activities as naked. It would be wrong for us to expect Greek women to show themselves as athletes in gymansium excluding Sparta. At that time, the Greeks' exposing themselves to young girls in Sparta is considered immoral. In the works of the Greek Archaic Period, it is seen that the kuros men’ statues are known to be naked, while kores the young girls' statues are always dressed. The nakedness of the female body did not appear until the Helenistic period.In the early period, Rome, which emerged with the loss of the importance of the Greeks now, has begun to show itself with a strict patriarchal system. We see that the father, who is the absolute ruler of the family structure, has the full authority in the Early Imperial Period and intervenes the rights of the individuals in the household, while the woman does not have any right to speak. However, in advance of the process, the woman started to have a voice in and out of the house and even with the emperor in the country's administration, she had a place in it. Homosexuality is also active and passive concept in this society, far away from its current meaning. In Rome, a slave society, passivity is only valid for slaves, and it is not welcomed that a free citizen is passive, and even under laws, it is a matter of sanction.This study can be summarized as a simple look at the daily life of the peoples of Greece and Rome. In these two successive cultures, women, men, how the institution of marriage works, the place of prostitutes in society, the gods and goddesses who have similar characteristics with people were analyzed briefly.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ergun  LAFLI•  20  Archaeology, Classical Archaeology, Gender Studies, Classics“Retrieving the Original Aphrodite of Knidos.”  Atti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

This is a student-driven seminar based on readings, presentations, and in-class discussions on the societal, religious, and political developments of the Greek world in antiquity. Students will become familiar with the Bronze, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, and early Roman periods of Greek history. The foundation of this course is the geopolitical history of the expanding Greek world; however, students also will engage the importance of ancient Greek culture, literature, religion, art, and gender roles. Through the investigation of texts, architecture, and archaeology, students will gain an appreciation of not just the ruling classes of the ancient Greek world, but also of the daily lives of normal Greeks and Hellenized native peoples. This will be a reading seminar course driven primarily by student participation. It will focus mostly on modern studies but also will feature a wide array of literary and archaeological source materials. Students will investigate historiographical arguments, lead class discussions, and prepare presentations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nikolaus L Overtoom•  227  Creative Writing, Ancient Egyptian Religion, History, Ancient HistoryΤο μυστικό του Τύμβου Καστά της Αμφίπολης αποκαλύπτεταιSave to LibraryDownloadby Makis Katis•  42  Ancient History, Hellenistic History, Ancient Religion, Ancient Greek ReligionReview of Race and Ethnicity in the Classical WorldThis is a review of *Race and Ethnicity in the Classical World: An Anthology of Primary Sources in Translation*, edited by Rebecca F.

But what were the gender politics that resulted in monstrosity being linked with human femininity? To tackle this question, I’d like to focus on the origins of two popular female monsters, Lamia and the Sirens, and explore how they became associated with monsters, in both antiquity and more modern literature. For me, their subsequent shift from antagonists to sympathetic female figures in the 19th century emerges is especially interesting: both John Keats’s poem “Lamia” (1819) and Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale The Little Mermaid (1837) can be usefully explored from a feminist perspective, especially because both these works have exerted a positive influence on the representation of female monsters in contemporary culture, including Pre-Raphaelite painting and Disney's The Little Mermaid (Ariel).Save to LibraryDownloadby Nina Triaridou•  17  Semiotics, Comparative Literature, Mythology, RomanticismThe Body Politic: Sexuality in Greek and Roman Comedy and MimeSave to LibraryDownloadby Monica Florence•  16  Gender Studies, Greek Comedy, Gender History, Religion and Sexuality"THE SEXUAL PHILOSOPHIES OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE", IN G.
