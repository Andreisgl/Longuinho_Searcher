The weaving imagery of the miracle in the Homeric Centos (GRBS, forthcoming)Anna LefteratouAbstract: This paper discusses an early evidence of the Woman with the Issue of Blood weaving a cloth for Jesus, in Eudocia’s Homeric Centos. This is earliest testimony to the later Veronica legend. The analysis shows how the HC contribute to the understanding of the early stage of the merging of classical myths and Christian legends. Moreover, the particular tale about the Haemorrhoissa and her loom help to discuss gendered poetics in late antiquity Keywords: Berenice, Veronica, Eudocia, Homeric Centos, weaving, gendered epic voiceDownload Free PDFView PDF.

In the 5th Century AD, The Empress Eudocia Augusta composed more than 2,000 lines of Homeric centones. These centones describe a Christian narrative spanning the creation of the world to the Ascension of Jesus. Many scholars have considered the cento form to be an inconsequential act of plagiarism. As a result, the form has been almost unilaterally neglected in classical scholarship, and many works have not been fully edited or translated into modern languages. In Late Antiquity however, centones were a popular literary form because of their links to prestigious literary works such as Homer. As a form, centones made use of the cultural memories of their readers to great effect. This thesis examines the ways in which centones draw on collective memories of classical culture. Homeric centones as a form derive prestige from their associations with classical culture. This allows them to communicate Christian content within the confines of an existing literary tradition. They also draw upon classical rhetorical techniques such as ethopoeia to successfully manipulate biblical narrative. It is also argued that experience of reading a cento also heavily relies on a knowledge of Classical culture. This thesis proposes that readers would have used their memory of Homeric and Biblical texts to perceive the consonances and dissonances between the work’s simultaneous intertextual allusions. This methodology differs from previous attempts to analyse the intertextual mechanism of centones, which have mostly attempted to pick out particularly ‘significant’ allusions in the work.Download Free PDFView PDFJESUS' LATE ANTIQUE EPIPHANIES: HEALING THE BLIND IN THE CHRISTIAN EPICS OF EUDOCIA AND NONNUS.
