The historical setting is Caria in the first half of the fourth century BCE. The most decisive year in Coan history was 366 BCE. This was the year of the synoecism, when the different settlements on the island were gathered into one common political unit, an incident most often associated with a ‘democratic’ movement. The synoecism entailed a relocation of the capital to the easternmost part of the island, the point closest to the mainland of Asia Minor and the capital of the Hecatomnid dynasty. The Coan coin issues in question are used by historians as (the only) evidence for an early interference by Hecatomnid rulers on Cos and, based on this, to consider Mausolus himself as a driving force behind the synoecism on Cos in 366 BCE. The idea of the Hecatomnids as rulers of a more or less ‘Caria...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersINC 2009 Survey: Asia Minor in the Archaic and Classical Periods (full version)Kenneth SheedyDownload Free PDFView PDFD.

The Southwestern Asia Minor has been recognized by the research as a particular artistic milieu particularly of sculpture in the Hellenistic period, when the Greek cities produced similar works of art, typological and stylistical distinct from the production of Pergamon and mainland Greece. Cos and Rhodes belong to this regional milieu. The famous artists of the 4 th cent. B.C. and their activity in the Mausoleum of Alicarnassus, in Artemision of Ephesos and in Asclepieion of Cos, influenced significantly this development. Large sculptural programmes of the Hellenistic period, such as Colossus of Rhodes, the altars of Magnesia, Priene, Cnidus and Pergamon and the frieze of Hekateion of Lagina made possible the cooperation of various artistic workshops. Rhodes, judging by the great number of artistic signatures on bronze portrait statues, emerges as a lively cosmopolitan centre, where bronze sculptors from Athens, Asia Minor and the islands work together. Their activity is traced in a wide artistic region, related to the area of political influence of Rhodes and Rhodian Peraia. Caria, from the Maeander river down to Lycia, was the main field of political and cultural interrelations. Common statuary types for the popular gods of Hellenistic period, Aphrodite and Asclepius, in large and small scale sculpture, Ptolemaic portraits in statuesque format (due to Alexandrian influence) and particular types for the male and female portrait statues of the emerging middle class (representative group of sculpture of the region), are the characteristic features of the artistic unity. The early Byzantine Architecture in Kos: cultural interactions with the nearby regions of Asia Minor Isabella Baldini, DISCI, University of Bologna. The cultural connections between the early Byzantine architecture of Kos and the nearby regions of Asia Minor can be verified from different points of view thanks to numerous archaeological researches carried out on the island. Comparisons can be made at the level of the workers involved in mosaic decoration as well as at the level of the architectural and liturgical sculpture, but a particularly significant and more general aspect concerns the organizational models of the religious spaces. This aspect concerns the shape of the structures, their physical partition and the way to perceive and use the sacred areas. Some Coan buildings and artifacts can be used as examples of these architectural and cultural relationships.Download Free PDFView PDFin A. Meadows / U.

These accomplishments, as argued by this paper, are often overshadowed by the actions of Alexander and the rise of the Roman Republic. Similarly, the period following Alexander's death in 323 B.C. is arguably overlooked - an aspect which this paper attempts to dispel through an analysis of its prime movers - the 'Diadochi' - and the cultural transformations brought about by the creation, and eventual fragmentation, of Alexander's Macedonian Empire. These are then contrasted with the actions and portrayal of Philip II, where the paper then attempts to link many of the decisions of the Diadochi to Philip.Download Free PDFView PDFin A.

Monumental tombs such as the tumulus and temple tombs, their architectural forms and features, contents and artworks are within the scope of this study. The distinction between the burials of elites and administrators was not attested in Hellespontine and Greater Phrygia, nor in Lydia, whereas the securely identified tombs of the dynasts in Lycia and Caria, and their privileged locations separated the rulers from the other elite. The variations in the architectural features in tumulus tombs and the iconography used in these tombs are considered as indicators of identity in western Anatolia. Even though the 6th century BC tombs illustrated continuation of the pre-Persian period mortuary traditions, the conspicuous increase in monumental tomb construction seems to have been owed to the prosperity provided by the Persian Empire. The tumulus, which had been used by the Lydian royals, was now a common burial type in the Persian period, and the wealth required to erect such monuments was now available for the western Anatolian elite. The 5th century BC illustrated a predominant Persian influence and support for the empire, and this phenomenon was considered as a response to the historical events that occurred in the region in the early 5th century BC. Caria and Lycia had freer and more original monuments because they were not satrapal centers in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Dynast tombs of the 4th century BC were distinguished from the early Persian period tombs and symbolized the changing social and political agenda of these regions.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
