[MediaWiki-announce] Maintenance release: MediaWiki 1.37.4

8:33 p.m.
 
I would like to announce the availability of MediaWiki 1.37.4.

This primarily fixes an issue identified in the MediaWiki 1.37.3 release.
The incorrect version of guzzlehttp/guzzle was included in the tarball (and
git repo) vendor, meaning that update.php would not run successfully.

It also includes some minor backported fixes for PHP 8.1 support, which
would reduce log spam when logging was enabled. These fixes will be
included in later point releases for 1.35 and 1.38.

=== Changes since MediaWiki 1.37.3 ===
* Localisation updates.
* (T311568) UploadBase::setTempFile() handle $tempPath being passed as null.
* (T311559) SpecialListFiles: user parameter isn't always present.
* (T311561) ImageListPager: Don't call htmlspecialchars() on null.
* (T311920) SpecialBlockList: Prevent passing null to trim().
* (T311921) SpecialUserrights: Don't pass null to str_replace.
* (T311570) SpecialWithoutInterwiki: Don't pass null through to
  Title::capitalize().
* (T311574, T311576) SpecialLinkSearch: Don't pass null through to the
parser.
* (T312059) Update guzzlehttp/guzzle to 7.4.5 in vendor.
* (T296435, T297669) cache: Add four fields to LinkCache::getSelectFields.
