The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Library and Information Science define a journal as "the record of proceeding of transactions of a learned society". This study found in Ph.D scholars, more respondents (52.1%) participated in the study than the M.Phil. scholars (47.9%). It is pertinent to mention here that some responses received from M.Phil. Scholars were not usable as most of the questions were left unanswered. This study also shows that in M.Phil Scholars, 72.8 % respondents were aware of e-journals and 27.2 % were not aware of them. In Ph.D Scholars 100 % respondents were aware of e-journals. Overall, in research scholars, more than third of the respondents (86.9 %) were aware of e-journals while 13.1 % were not aware at all. This study found about place of accessing e-journals, In Ph.D Scholars, more respondents (54.5 %) became access of e-journals from Department Lab than in the Scholars M.Phil scholars (38.9%). 15.2% respondents in M.Phil Scholars and 14.7% Ph.D scholars came to access about e-journals from cyber cafe. Similarly In M.Phil Scholars, more respondents (27.1 %) became access of e-journals from university central library than in the Ph.D Scholars (12.5 %). 18% respondents both M.Phil Scholars and Ph.D scholars came to access about e-journals from hostel campus. Overall, in research scholars one important place of accessing e-journals were Department lab. It is also clear from the above table that majority of users have become accessing of e-journals by using Dep.lab Ph.D scholars and as well as in M.Phil Scholars, while least number of users access from cyber cafe.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. G Stephen•Use of E-JournalsUse and Usefulness of E-journals: A Case Study of Research ScholarsSave to LibraryDownloadby Velayutham  Chandrakumar•Use of E-JournalsService quality of the University of the Punjab's libraries : An exploration of users' perceptionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alia Arshad•Use of E-JournalsUSE OF E-JOURNALS IN THE DISCIPLINES OF LIFE SCIENCE IN K.U.K: AN ANALYTICAL STUDYThe present study has been undertaken to assess the Use of E-Journals in the disciplines of life science in K.U.K. A well structured questionnaire was distributed among the research-scholars and teachers of six departments viz.

Botany, Zoology, Microbiology, Bio-chemistry, Bio- technology, & Environment science under Life Science in K.U.K. The responses were gathered from 77 users (35 teachers, 42 research scholars). The findings of the survey reveal useful facts about E-Journals. 89.24% of the respondents were aware of E-journals. 81% of the respondents read the printouts of e-journals. On the basis of the findings, it was suggested that in order to improve the library network speed and library should organize training programmes for the upcoming information professionals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anil Kapoor•Use of E-JournalsEvolution of the big deals use in the public universities of the Castile and Leon region, Spain Andrés Fernández-RamosThe evolution of the use of electronic scientific journals in the 2007-2018 period by the academic communities of the public universities of Castilla and Leon, members of the Bucle consortium, is studied.

Downloads of articles distributed by four broad-spectrum providers are analyzed: Emerald, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Wiley. Unexpectedly, in spiteof the new ways of accessing content, this analysis shows that the number of downloads in public universities in Castile and Leon has increased. However, it has been found that despite the growth, a few journals concentrate most of the downloads and that a large number of titles are not used. It has been verified that the universities with a higher numberof staff and greater diversity of knowledge areas use a wider range of titles and thus obtain a higher benefit from their contracts. All of the above leads us to question the system of contracting big deals, i.e., bundles of hundreds of multidisciplinary journals and other resources. In a moment of change promoted by Plan S, we consider it more necessary than ever to understand the situation of the provision of serial scientific publications and to find the best strategy to have access to them.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andres Fernández Ramos and +2Lourdes Santos De PazIsabel Olea•  3  Journals, University libraries, Use of E-JournalsEvolution of the big deals use in the public universities of the Castile and Leon region, SpainSave to LibraryDownloadby Andres Fernández Ramos•  4  Library and Information Studies, Journals, University libraries, Use of E-JournalsUse of E- Journals by Research Scholars in Alagappa University: A StudyThe phrase electronic journal or &quot;e-journal &quot; is used to denote a broader category of electronic publications that may or may not have a print counterpart.

The aim of the CBUC study was to analyse the period of change from the paper to the digital format in the collections of the CBUC member libraries. During the period covered by the study, users maintained access in paper format to retrospective collections and some current subscriptions, and the comparison with previous collections on paper was made with an acceptable degree of chronological proximitySave to LibraryDownloadby Cristóbal Urbano and +3Lluís AngladaNuria ComellasÁngel Borrego•  7  Academic Libraries, Academic library collection Management, Library Statistics, E-journals consortiaRelated TopicsDigital LibrariesFollowFollowingLibrary ScienceFollowFollowingInformation ScienceFollowFollowingKnowledge ManagementFollowFollowingLibQualFollowFollowingLibrary and Information ScienceFollowFollowingAcademic LibrarianshipFollowFollowingActive LearningFollowFollowingProblem Based LearningFollowFollowingAcademic LibrariesFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
