This system is designed for a use with economic deictic and control gestures in air and it allows free mobility in the environment to the users. PlusControl consists in light worn devices with infrared emitters and Bluetooth accelerometers. In this paper the architecture of the system is presented. A prototype has been developed in order to test and evaluate the system performances.

PEGASO: A Personalised and Motivational ICT System to Empower Adolescents Towards Healthy LifestylesStudies in health technology and informatics,  2014Unhealthy alimentary behaviours and physical inactivity habits are key risk factors for major non... more Unhealthy alimentary behaviours and physical inactivity habits are key risk factors for major non communicable diseases. Several researches demonstrate that juvenile obesity can lead to serious medical conditions, pathologies and have important psycho-social consequences. PEGASO is a multidisciplinary project aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles among teenagers through assistive technology. The core of this project is represented by the ICT system, which allows providing tailored interventions to the users through their smartphones in order to motivate them. The novelty of this approach consists of developing a Virtual Individual Model (VIM) for user characterization, which is based on physical, functional and behavioural parameters opportunely selected by experts. These parameters are digitised and updated thanks to the user monitoring through smartphone; data mining algorithms are applied for the detection of activity and nutrition habits and this information is used to provide p...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
