This study traces the idiosyncratic behaviour of Presidents Andrew Jackson and Donald Trump. It details four historical traditions-Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jeffersonian, and Jacksonian. The study expands upon Jacksonian tradition and sees that how Trump pursued this tradition and how is his political behaviour remained similar to that of Andrew Jackson. Three specific areas in which these variables are determined are personal lives, narcissism and authoritarian behaviour, and populism and corruption. The paper also charts out the ways and means through which Donald Trump's administration is termed as Jacksonian in nature.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr Muhammad Nadeem  Mirza•  16  Personality Psychology, American Studies, Political Behavior, Political PsychologySyllabus: Popular Music - University of Virginia (Summer 2015)Save to LibraryDownloadby Jarek Paul  Ervin•  4  American Studies, Popular Music Studies, Popular Music, American Popular MusicHistorian Cara Caddoo Discusses Envisioning Freedom: Cinema and the Building of Modern Black LifeAn interview with Cara Caddoo about her book Envisioning Freedom: Cinema and the Building of Modern Black LifeSave to LibraryDownloadby Regina Longo•  8  American Studies, African American History, African American Studies, CinemaHamilton as Cultural PhenomenonA special issue of Studies in Musical Theatre offering a range of new critical perspectives on Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton, including: “Is It Like a Beat Without a Melody?”: Rap and Revolution in Hamilton | Jeffrey Severs Rise... moreA special issue of Studies in Musical Theatre offering a range of new critical perspectives on Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton, including: “Is It Like a Beat Without a Melody?”: Rap and Revolution in Hamilton | Jeffrey Severs Rise Up: Nuyorican Resistance and Transcultural Aesthetics in Hamilton | Gabriel Mayora Hamilton’s Women | Stacy Wolf Blackout on Broadway: Affiliation and Audience in In the Heights and Hamilton | Elena Machado Sáez Staging a Revolution: The Cultural Tipping Points of John Gay and Lin-Manual Miranda | Tiffany Yecke Brooks Miranda’s Les Miz | Jeffrey Magee Hamilton Meets Hip-Hop Pedagogy | Alison Dobrick “Hey Yo, I’m Just Like My Country”: Teaching Miranda’s Hamilton as an American Chronicle | Timothy J.

Focusing on the cultural, legal, and scientific controversy over Kennewick Man, the ancient human remains discovered in Washington state in 1996, the article explores the narrative politics of American national belonging. Through a popular historical novel on Kennewick Man's life, the article further theorizes nostalgia as a narrative tool in imagining the evolutionary origins of the nation. The article argues that nostalgia produces a temporal dynamic that bridges the gap between national history and global prehistory, and that this dynamic is reinforced through cultural ideas of genetic knowledge. At the same time, prehistoric nostalgia renders problematic ideas of ethnic difference largely invisible.Save to LibraryDownloadby Venla Oikkonen•  44  American History, Cultural Studies, American Studies, Indigenous StudiesThe Atlantic James ConnollyInternationalist Review of Irish Culture. 2 (Spring 2009): 134-152Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter D O'Neill•  6  Irish Studies, American Studies, Atlantic World, Migration StudiesThe Black Arts MovementEmerging from a matrix of Old Left, Black Nationalist, and bohemian ideologies and institutions, African American artists and intellectuals in the 1960s coalesced to form the Black Arts Movement, the cultural wing of the Black Power... moreEmerging from a matrix of Old Left, Black Nationalist, and bohemian ideologies and institutions, African American artists and intellectuals in the 1960s coalesced to form the Black Arts Movement, the cultural wing of the Black Power Movement http://ow.ly/HtWx3066Rh6Historical Overviews of The Black Arts MovementSave to LibraryDownloadby Rashid Booker•  10  Black Studies Or African American Studies, Latin American Studies, American Studies, American PoliticsThe "art of witness" in US Central American cultural production: An analysis of William Archila's _The Art of Exile_ and Alma Leiva's _Celdas_US Central Americans are destabilizing, reconceiving, and revitalizing the US Latina/o canon, and in doing so, they are forcing us to reconsider hegemonic ideas about Latinidad.

The cultural production of Latinos/as of Central American descent has engaged in a critical denunciation of the violence that characterizes not only the history, but also the current situation, of the Central American isthmus. This essay examines the strategies used by US Central American poet William Archila and visual artist Alma Leiva to (re)construct the past and memorialize the victims of violence across Central America. I argue that Archila’s poetry collection The Art of Exile and Alma Leiva’s installation-photography series Celdas are examples of the “art of witness.” As such, their works play a key role in the reconstruction of Central American collective memory from the diaspora.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marisel  Moreno•  20  American Literature, Latino/A Studies, Latin American Studies, American Studies“Native Messengers of God in Canada?” (1996)NATIVE MESSENGERS OF GOD IN CANADA?: A TEST CASE FOR BAHA’I UNIVERSALISM (1996) *** Christopher Buck, “Native Messengers of God in Canada?: A Test Case for Baha’i Universalism.” Baha’i Studies Review 6 (1996): 97–133. *** Award... moreNATIVE MESSENGERS OF GOD IN CANADA?:A TEST CASE FOR BAHA’I UNIVERSALISM (1996) *** Christopher Buck, “Native Messengers of God in Canada?: A Test Case for Baha’i Universalism.” Baha’i Studies Review 6 (1996): 97–133.  *** Award for Excellence in Baha’i Studies.

Goldenweiser’s Manuscript. Memoir 9 (Winnipeg: Algonquian and Iroquoian Linguistics, 1992): 36–41.  ABSTRACT Academic and popular interest has lent prestige to native spirituality and has brought it into prominence. The United Nations proclamation of 1993 as the International Year of Indigenous People gave native peoples international recognition. A corresponding interest in native culture has “valorised” (brought respect to) native spirituality.  The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Canada took a position of advocacy on behalf of First Nations Canadians in its formal submission to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in the fall of 1993. The strong native presence in Canadian Bahá’í community life raises the question of the place of native spirituality within a Bahá’í worldview.  Homefront “pioneers” have extended Bahá’í universalism to a recognition of the richness and authenticity of native cultural values. Such recognition has been supported by local Bahá’í policy, as attested in teaching pamphlets addressed to native peoples, in which the concept of First World messengers of God has been validated. Although theoretically acknowledged, explicit recognition of native messengers of God has yet to be formalised in Bahá’í doctrine.  This study discusses the possibilities of incorporating the principle of “Messengers of God to Indigenous Peoples” within formal Bahá’í doctrine, reflecting a development that has already taken place in popular Bahá’í belief in the North American context. A hitherto under-studied Persian text of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá establishes the principle in such a way that its explicit enunciation is now possible.  The problem of historical attestation remains. The prophetic credentials of Iroquois culture hero and statesman Deganawida are critically examined as a test case. The legend of Deganawida has a kernel of historicity overlaid by hagiography, with admitted Christian influence. Nonetheless, if the Bahá’í principle of “Progressive Revelation” can assimilate the Amerindian spiritual legacy as distinct from and developmentally asynchronous with Irano-Semitic and Sino-Indic religious histories, then it might be possible to accord Deganawida a provisional status with Bahá’í prophetology, and still affirm Bahá’u’lláh’s unific role in world history, as oral cultures take their place alongside the more familiar “literate” traditions.  https://www.academia.edu/36294314/_Native_Messengers_of_God_in_Canada_1996_Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher Buck•  43  Religion, Abrahamic Religions, Native American Religions, New Religious Movements"By Force of Expectation: Colonization, Public Lands, and the Property Relation"Not-guilty verdicts, mistrials, and impunity for the Bundy family and many of their supporters in the armed confrontations over public land use in Nevada and Oregon.

Expanded access for private oil, gas, mining, and logging industries and the downsizing of national monuments such as Bears Ears lead by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke. A number of highly contentious debates and sensationalized events have again focused attention on land held in the public domain by the United States. This essay argues that federal land policy as a form of colonial administration has been constitutive for the logic of expectation as property in what is now the United States. From the state land cessions negotiated on behalf of the Articles of Confederation to the preemption acts (1830–1841) to the homestead acts (1862–1916) to present-day demands for land transfer, the acquisition and disposal of the so-called public domain have been central to westward colonization, the consolidation of the nation-state, and the promise of land ownership as the ostensible foundation of individual liberty. These dynamics are evident in contemporary conflicts over public lands and arguments for the transfer of public lands to either state or private ownership. Approaching the Bundy occupations as flashpoints that illuminate competing interpretations and claims to land within the history of westward colonization, this essay seeks to demonstrate the ways in which expectation emerges from particular economies of dispossession of indigenous peoples that have historically worked through and across the division of public and private property.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alyosha Goldstein•  97  Critical Theory, History, American History, Cultural StudiesThe World the Historians Made: Twentieth-Century Historians' Portrayals of American SlaveryAn exploration of the questions, methods, and debates that shaped the historiography of American slavery over the twentieth century, beginning with Ulrich Phillips and ending with Melton McLaurin.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ben Ford•  5  American History, American Studies, History of Slavery, African American StudiesIntroduction Pearl Buck, Fighting Angel and The Exile.Introduction to reprint of Pearl Buck, Fighting Angel, a memoir of her father published in 1935, and The Exile, of her mother, also 1935.Save to LibraryDownloadby Charles Hayford•  6  American Studies, United States In The World, Missionary Studies, Modern China (especially late Qing and Republican history)Modern Print Activism in the United StatesEdited volume exploring the use of print culture as a form of social and political activism in the United States during the 20th century.

Print activism continued throughout the century as the central vehicle by which activists on all points of the political spectrum—left, right, and center—spread their opinions, elicited support, created networks among like- minded individuals, and attempted to establish cohesive group identities for the larger world. This book was republished in paperback by Routledge.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rachel Schreiber•  4  American Studies, Print Culture, Periodical Studies, ActivismBuilding Resiliency: The Role of Faith-Based Organizations in the Trauma-Affected Community of Santa Fe, TexasJordan, Mandy M.

Using ethnographic methods, this research examines the role of faith, rituals, language, and symbols in the trauma-affected community during the response, recovery, and resiliency efforts as perceived by the Santa Fe community and those impacted by the tragedy. Qualitative data collected from 100 individuals ages of 17-84 illustrated how historical trauma, community culture, and faith-based organizations impact community resiliency and how illusions of a homogenous view of the community left many feeling shocked, divided, forgotten or muted.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mandy Jordan•  15  Semiotics, Christianity, Social Psychology, American Studies"Predatory Value: Economies of Dispossession and Disturbed Relationalities" / by Jodi A.

In the Americas broadly and the United States specifically, colonization and transatlantic slavery set in motion the dynamics and differential racialized valuations that continue to underwrite particular forms of subjection, property, commerce, and territoriality. The conception of economies of dispossession introduced in this essay draws attention to the overriding importance of rationalities of abstraction and commensurability for racial capitalism. The essay problematizes the ways in which dispossession is conventionally treated as a self-evident and circumscribed practice of unjust taking and subtractive action. Instead, working across the lethal confluences of imperial conquest and racial capitalist predation, this essay critically situates the logic of propriation that organizes and underwrites predatory value in the historical present. Against the commensurabilities and rationalities of debt and finance capitalism, conditioned through the proprietary logics of settler colonialism and racial capitalism, the essay gestures toward alternative frameworks for building collective capacities for what the authors describe as a grounded relationality.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alyosha Goldstein and +1Chandan Reddy•  20  Critical Theory, Cultural Studies, Black Studies Or African American Studies, Native American StudiesASCESA E DECLINO DELL'IMPERO STATUNITENSEÈ uscito il volume A.

Cultural savants have noted the rise of the zombie in American popular culture in the twenty-first century. And many scholars have found the zombie useful as a lumbering, empty-headed metaphor that could signify just about anything. The zombie might look like a loved ovne, but their flesh is rotting and their individualism has tragically withered away. Before I came to zombology, I was already fascinated by an American obsession with preventing the decay of the corpse through an exceptional devotion to embalming. I argue that the intersection of the new zombie-ism, the rapid decline of embalming, and the mass trauma of 9/11 is significant. Playing with zombies along a spectrum from fright to humor allows Americans to work through not a crisis of meaning, but a crisis of being. The cult of individualism no longer needs a perfect biological body.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shannon Lee  Dawdy•  5  American Studies, Death Studies, Embodiment, Death and Burial (Archaeology)"Black Light, White Revolution: Translation, Adaptation, and Appropriation in Galway Kinnell’s Cold War Writings on Iran"Save to LibraryDownloadby Amy Motlagh•  7  American Literature, American Studies, Translation Studies, Persian Literature“The Colors of Nature: Sullivan’s Architectural Polychromy and 19th–Century Color Theory,”Save to LibraryDownloadby Lauren S.

The country was frustrated with over two years of conflict with no end in sight. America was bogged down in its first “limited war” and turned to the former supreme commander and national hero who led American and British forces to victory against Nazi Germany less than a decade before. Eisenhower visited the Korean front in December of 1952 as promised during his election campaign and also kept his commitment to end the fighting in Korea seven months into his presidency. Both President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles credited their use of nuclear weapons coercion to end the communist delay tactics at the negotiations at Panmunjom to bring about the July 1953 truce. This also validated their New Look approach to national defense threatening “massive retaliation” when U.S. national vital interests were at stake.Scholars have been divided in the six decades since the truce in Korea ended the war, or “police action” using the Truman administration’s euphemism. The debate and historiography centers on cynicism regarding the effectiveness of “massive retaliation” as a defense policy in general, and specifically whether President Eisenhower’s hint of considering the utilization of nuclear weapons to break the deadlock in Korea produced the truce. Some scholars assert no such nuclear threat occurred; and as David Mayers contends it was the combination of Stalin’s death in March of 1953 with the new Soviet leadership wishing to reduce tensions with the U.S. to concentrate on political consolidation and economic development.  It is also asserted China and North Korea were weary of the war and also wanted to focus on domestic economic development as their primary motivation to end the fighting in Korea.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joseph  Enge•  3  Military History, American Studies, Korean WarThe Role Television has Played in the Changing Representations of Black WomenAs Olivia Pope hangs up on the President’s Chief of Staff, and starts strutting away, audiences have seen a character unlike any Black female character.

For Olivia embodies a new kind of Black woman, one who commands respect wherever she goes, and one not held back by labels like Mammy, Matriarch or Black Lady. She is a woman on a mission to fix the lives of Washington’s elite, as well as the negative images of Black women (BW) that have graced the screens since slavery. She defies stereotypes and shows audiences how unique, flawed and normal BW really are. This chapter will examine the ways in which the negative stereotypes of BW discussed in the previous chapter, as well as dominant Eurocentric beauty standards, have started to be dispelled by popular television shows: Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder (HTGAWM). However, while these shows have started to dispel negative stereotypes, they only do so to an extent. Maxine Craig’s Ain’t I a Beauty Queen? about the experiences of BW will be used parallel to television roles to help demonstrate the changes in portrayal and representation. This chapter will also use Laura Mulvey’s Gaze Theory as a framework to look at the ways in which the female protagonists are viewed by the audience.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alice Okoye•  8  Black Studies Or African American Studies, American Studies, Television Studies, Black Women's StudiesFiction e non-fiction nella "letteratura di cose viste" di Sandro VeronesiA reflection about "Occhio per occhio" and "Superalbo" by Sandro Veronesi.

I focus my discussion on Giovanni’s Room, since, after teaching this text for several years, I have only recently come to realize that James Baldwin’s second novel can provide us with some crucial insights into how privilege operates. Originally I placed this Baldwin novel in my course—”20th-century African-American Novel”—in order to provoke discussions about canonicity, normative assumptions about US “ethnic” literature, the relationship between the author’s racial identity and the text as well as to stimulate students to think more critically about race and heteronormativity. After all, Giovanni’s Room, written during the hyper-heteronormative period of the 1950s, is about a tragic love affair between two white men, but it is also a novel written by aqueer African American. Over the years, however, I have become more and more convinced that it is important to move away from a focus on any particular category of identity, such as homosexuality, masculinity, and/or race, and to highlight, instead, the broader notion of stratified privilege as it manifests itself in the novel.Save to LibraryDownloadby Catherine Rottenberg•  7  American Literature, American Studies, Israel/Palestine, Pierre BourdieuDesigning the “Great City”: Walt Whitman's Vision as an Urban PlannerIdentifying himself with the “builder at work in cities,” Whitman aspires to transform his city into an ideal city.

Particularly, his experiences as a journalist inspire him to ameliorate the widespread urban problems in New York. As early as the 1840s, Whitman consistently captures the various urban ills and offers reasonable solutions from an urban reformer’s perspective. He also reveals his aspiration to be an urban planner whose primary goal is the use of land and design of the urban environment. His desire to erase the boundaries between nature and civilization distinguishes the poet from his contemporary writers and landscape architects. With the perspective of a “builder” or a “architect,” Whitman strongly advocates more “open places” in the city like a park. Overcoming Frederick Law Olmsted’s dichotomy of the park versus the city, Whitman has an insight into the efficient usage and layout of the “open places” to facilitate the amelioration of the city. Most of all, Whitman’s “great city” represents the cleanly, organic, democratic, ecological and healthy city where technology, human beings and nature have a harmonious relationship. Ultimately, his “great city” like Mannahatta corresponds with the sustainable city in the modern sense.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jin-Ho  Shim•  3  American Studies, Literature and Visual Arts, Photography (Visual Studies)The World on a Ship: Producing Cosmopolitan Dining on Mass-Market CruisesThis article analyzes how mass-market cruise lines mobilize food, laborers, and built environments to offer passengers cosmopolitanism with the purpose of maintaining a unique business model.

It is argued that while companies target a growing demand for culturally immersive dining experiences, they do not seek to offer complete immersion in any one culture but cosmopolitanism through a combination of multiple themed establishments on a mobile platform. Culinary themes are installed using labor and built environments, for instance through the placement of visual and material culture in eateries. While some onboard dining experiences are themed around the cultures of nations on the ship’s itinerary, many evoke international cultures. In studying how mass-market cruise lines as mobile spaces of containment combine both international and localized dining experiences to offer the “world on a ship,” scholars of tourism can better understand how touristic companies produce cosmopolitanism at destinations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shayan S Lallani, PhD•  20  Marketing, Sociology, Cultural Studies, American StudiesHistory of the LAPD 1 PAPERSave to LibraryDownloadby Clinton Clad-Johnson•  54  American History, Chicano Studies, American Studies, American PoliticsWhat happened to the Sexual RevolutionThis op-ed considers the drastic change in mores that has taken place between the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s and what I call the Sexual Counter-Revolution of 1990s America and the Post-September 11th world.

Afrofuturism is understood in terms of its inherent delineation from any attempts by a universal cultural modernity to categorise it within the structures of conventional discourse.Instead, I adopt a deconstructive approach to Afrofuturism’s exploration.In this essay, I discuss Afrofuturism in relation to theories of Decoloniality, and, in turn, explain the history and rationale behind its subversion to conceptions of a universal modernity. I then explore the methodology and importance of autonomous subjectivity formation in Afrofuturism. The next chapter discusses Afrofuturism and music, using Detroit techno as a case study. The final chapter covers Afrofuturism in relation to hauntology, with a particular focus on the parallels between Afrofuturist and Intercultural cinema.The aim of this essay is to broaden the reader’s understanding of Afrofuturism through the contextualisation and explanation of the issues that Afrofuturism seeks to transcend, and the examination of the means with which this transcendence is to be achieved.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Dryhurst•  12  American Studies, Musicology, Cybernetics, HauntologyRace and Racisms: A Critical ApproachSave to LibraryDownloadby Aaron Winter•  14  Sociology, Latin American Studies, American Studies, Race and Racism[Edward Quinn] History in Literature A Reader's G(Book Fi org)Save to LibraryDownloadby erick falcon•  3  Military History, American Studies, Comparative LiteratureComedy Syllabus (Spring 2017)What makes some jokes so funny?

Is laughter just catharsis—a therapeutic release of personal and social discontent—or can it also voice real opposition? Another basic question that we often take for granted, why do we laugh?  In this course, we will approach the topic of comedy from every angle, while also keeping the funny alive. We will read philosophies and theories of comedy, satirical newspapers, and social histories of stand-up. We will watch funny movies, TV shows, Internet memes, viral videos, and talk about them. And, of course, we will write and perform our own comedy in the classroom.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maggie  Hennefeld•  20  Critical Theory, History, Cultural Studies, American StudiesDissertation: Keeping Up With the Kardashians and Jenners: An Analysis of Postfeminism in Contemporary Social Media PracticesThis dissertation analyzes the postfeminist tendencies and biopolitics in contemporary media practices by considering the pop culture exemplar, the Kardashian-Jenner family.

On the surface, games do not appear ideological, nor are they categorized as national products. Instead, they seem to reflect the open and uncontaminated reputation of information technology.Video games are undeniably imperial products. Their very existence has been conditioned upon the spread of militarized technology, the exploitation of already-existing labor and racial hierarchies in their manufacture, and the utopian promises of digital technology. Like literature and film before it, video games have become the main artistic expression of empire today: the open world empire, formed through the routes of information technology and the violences of drone combat, unending war, and overseas massacres that occur with little scandal or protest.Though often presented as purely technological feats, video games are also artistic projects, and as such, they allow us an understanding of how war and imperial violence proceed under signs of openness, transparency, and digital utopia. But the video game, as Christopher B. Patterson argues, is also an inherently Asian commodity: its hardware is assembled in Asia; its most talented e-sports players are of Asian origin; Nintendo, Sony, and Sega have defined and dominated the genre. Games draw on established discourses of Asia to provide an “Asiatic” space, a playful sphere of racial otherness that straddles notions of the queer, the exotic, the bizarre, and the erotic. Thinking through games like Overwatch, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Shenmue II, and Alien: Isolation, Patterson reads against empire by playing games erotically, as players do—seeing games as Asiatic playthings that afford new passions, pleasures, desires, and attachments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher B Patterson•  10  American Studies, Gender Studies, Game studies, Media StudiesOn PhotographySave to LibraryDownloadby John  Muriel•  7  American Studies, Aesthetics, Art History, Art TheoryThe Mexican threat: the construction of a new enemy.

Thus, in addition to being characterized as a product of the “Founding Fathers”, Huntington's concept of the American nation was closely tied to the Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture created by the called “Founding Settlers”. This strict definition of the United States made it impossible for other groups, such as Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans, to fully incorporate themselves into the American mainstream. Because they came from different historical backgrounds that deviated from the Anglo-Saxon norm, they were seen as challenging the “proper” ways of American immigration and assimilationism, such as those established by the massive flows of European immigration from the 19th and the first half of the twentieth century.  Furthermore, for Huntington, the war between Mexico and the United States in 1846-1848 produced the current idea that Mexicans are able to make political claims to the territories annexed by the United States after the course of the war, and therefore they represent an active threat to the physical integrity of modern US-territory. It is also important to highlight that, behind the apparently benevolent notion of assimilationism, there are structural relations of colonialism that nullify the power of agency of assimilating groups, subordinating them to a system of colonial rule that denies their full political engagement in the social landscape of the United States. As to the assimilation of both Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans this cannot take place because the concept of American assimilationism itself is linked to a hidden ideal of whiteness that does not accept the brown phenotypical traits of people of Mexican origins.   Key words: national identity; American nation; Anglo-Saxon culture; Mexicans Americans;Save to LibraryDownloadby Rafael Antonio Rodrigues•  8  Cultural History, Cultural Studies, Latin American Studies, American Studies"Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto"Save to LibraryDownloadby David Martínez•  4  Native American Studies, American Studies, Native American Politics, American Indian StudiesFemale genital mutilation (FGM) and male circumcision: Should there be a separate ethical discourse?It is sometimes argued that the non-therapeutic, non-consensual alteration of children’s genitals should be discussed in two separate ethical discourses: one for girls (in which such alterations should be termed ‘female genital... moreIt is sometimes argued that the non-therapeutic, non-consensual alteration of children’s genitals should be discussed in two separate ethical discourses: one for girls (in which such alterations should be termed ‘female genital mutilation’ or FGM), and one for boys (in which such alterations should be termed ‘male circumcision’). In this article, I call into question the moral and empirical basis for such a distinction, and argue that all children—whether female, male, or intersex—should be free from having parts of their genitals removed unless there is a pressing medical indication.Save to LibraryDownloadby Brian D.

It analyzes credible sources that claim a Deep State apparatus exists. Much discussion is cutting-edge. The Deep State’s existence has not mainstreamed in public knowledge during pre- or recorded history. This book synthesizes the consensus that appears in various public sources. Examples include mainstream and alternative media reports, scholarly publications and institutional documents. Discussions are Western-centric. They focus on power structures in Europe, the Near East (e.g. Israel) and the United States of America (USA). These are the core locations of Deep State bases. This book aims to arm readers with the tools required to form their own opinions. Much language in this book unambiguously informs the audience of the author’s informed opinions.

Video games can convey ideas, attitude, belief s; hence video games possess significant abilities to change other forms/mediums of popular culture. Increasing popularity, diverse player base, and the rise of different genres of games transformed video games into a popular entertainment phenomenon in America, and a sub-cultural phenomenon named video games culture has emerged. Video games and video game culture has inf influenced significant changes i n other forms/mediums of popular culture through introducing new approaches, techniques, aesthetics etc. That resulted in the creation of new media forms and genres. Video game culture plays an indispensable role in some of these transformations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Raihan Uddin Bhuiyan•American StudiesAfter Lot's Daughters: Kathryn Harrison and the Making of Memorya/b: Auto/Biography Studies Volume 14, 1999 - Issue 1EXTREMITIES: MEMOIRS AT THE FIN DE SIÈCLESave to LibraryDownloadby Laura  Frost•  10  American Literature, American Studies, Gender and Sexuality, Trauma StudiesPantone The 20th Century in ColorSave to LibraryDownloadby Moises Quisbert•  3  American Studies, Art History, DesignNextLast »Related TopicsAmerican LiteratureFollowFollowingAfrican American StudiesFollowFollowingCultural StudiesFollowFollowingAfrican American LiteratureFollowFollowingAmerican HistoryFollowFollowingRace and EthnicityFollowFollowingPopular CultureFollowFollowingBlack Studies Or African American StudiesFollowFollowingAsian American StudiesFollowFollowingAmerican CultureFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
