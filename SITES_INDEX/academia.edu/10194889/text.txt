(Bert) van der SpekThe article explores in a comparative way the monetization and the role of silver in the Persian and Seleucid empires on the one hand and the flow of silver in early modern history from America via Europe and the Pacific to China on the other hand. The sudden increase of the role of silver, esp. in taxation, under Darius I, Alexander the Great (who brought the Persian treasury into circulation) and the 'Single Whip Tax Reform' in China 1571 are compared. The article makes use of the theories of D.O. Flynn and A. Giráldez, who treat silver both as 'money' and as a commodity (sometimes in the form of bullion, sometimes in coin).Download Free PDFView PDF'The volatility of prices of barley and dates in Babylon in the third and second centuries BC', in H.D. Baker and M. Jursa eds., Documentary Sources in Ancient Near Eastern and Greco-Roman Economic History. Methodology and Practice. Oxford: Oxbow Books: 2014: 234-259.The volatility of prices of barley and dates in Babylon in the third and second centuries BC2014 • R.J. (Bert) van der SpekABSTRACT This volume breaks new ground in approaching the Ancient Economy by bringing together documentary sources from Mesopotamia and the Greco-Roman world. Addressing textual corpora that have traditionally been studied separately, the collected papers overturn the conventional view of a fundamental divide between the economic institutions of these two regions. The premise is that, while controlling for differences, texts from either cultural setting can be brought to bear on the other and can shed light, through their use as proxy data, on such questions as economic mentalities and market development. The book also presents innovative approaches to the quantitative study of large corpora of ancient documents. The resulting view of the Ancient Economy is much more variegated and dynamic than traditional ‘primitivist’ views would allow. The volume covers the following topics: Babylonian house size data as an index of urban living standards; the Old Babylonian archives as a source for economic history; Middle Bronze Age long distance trade in Anatolia; long-term economic development in Babylonia from the 7th to the 4th century BC; legal institutions and agrarian change in the Roman Empire; papyrological evidence for water-lifting technology; money circulation and monetization in Late Antique Egypt; the application of Social Network Analysis to Babylonian cuneiform archives; price trends in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, as well as the effects of locust plagues on prices.

Mediterranean Grain Prices c. 300 to 31 BC: the Impact of Rome Rathbone, D. Mediterranean and Near Eastern Grain Prices c. 300 to 31 BC: Some Preliminary Conclusions Indexes Abstract of my own paper: In this paper I focus on market integration. Two aspects are considered: the volatility of the prices and the purchasing power of silver. Volatility of prices is an indicator of market integration. When there is a scarcity of grain, prices will rise, but thanks to grain imports prices can return to a more favourable level after some time. The same is true for periods of superabundance. Prices will be low in such a case, which makes export to countries with higher prices profitable. The superabundance will diminish and prices will rise again. This process will mitigate price fluctuations. Hence a high volatility of prices is an indicator of low market integration (cf. K.G. Persson, Grain Markets in Europe 1500-1900 (Cambridge 1999). Mutatis mutandis the same is true as regards silver. In an integrated market situation it will be profitable to invest silver in a region where the purchasing power is high. However, due to the import of silver the purchasing power will gradually diminish and so the market will equalize the value of silver in different regions. Hence the continuation of strongly different exchange values of silver in neighbouring regions is an indicator of low market integration. The evidence comes from the Astronomical Diaries from Babylon, in which Babylonian astronomers recorded, apart from celestial phenomena, the prices of barley, dates, cuscuta, cress, sesame and wool. Thanks to this meticulous work we have a dataset of prices for the period of c. 485 - 61 BC, which allows statistical research.

(Bert) van der SpekEncyclopedic article on the history of Alexander the Great and the Seleucids until 129 BC with focus on Babylonia and the cuneiform sources. The article is in English. CORRIGENDA: p. 374: The so-called Lehmann text has now been published by Ronald Wallenfels and myself in CTMMA IV, no. 148. p. 377: BM 45661 a goal year text mentioning Antiochus III is published as H. Hunger, Astronomical Diaries and Related Texts from Babylonia, vol. VI (2006), no. 41. p. 381: The publication of Berossus' Babyloniaka did not occur in 278, the third year of Antiochus I. The sources are ambivalent. It is said that the Babyloniaka was dedicated to the third king after Alexander (so not third year!) or, in a variant, the third after Seleukos. See Johannes Bach, 'Berossos, Antiochos und die Babyloniaka,' Ancient West & East 12 (2013) 157-180, esp. p. 161. He argues (but not quite convincingly) that Antiochus II was intended. The matter is complicated and is for me unresolved.Download Free PDFView PDFR.J. van der Spek & Bas van Leeuwen, ‘Quantifying the integration of the Babylonian economy in the Mediterranean world using a new corpus of price data, 400-50 BCE,’ in: F. de Callataÿ ed., Quantifying the Greco-Roman Economy and Beyond, Pragmateiai 27, (Bari: Edipuglia 2014), 79-101.Quantifying the integration of the Babylonian economy in the Mediterranean world using a new corpus of price data, 400-50 BCER.J. (Bert) van der Spek, Bas van LeeuwenSince the work of Persson (1999), market efficiency has gained attention once more. Most studies focus on the medieval and early modern period, where the often heard argument is that higher market integration leads to more efficiency and better economic development. This argument has made many scholars of medieval and ancient economies aware of the importance of market institutions. It is therefore not strange that an increasing number of publications have been appearing that confirm the existence of market behaviour in medieval and ancient economies. Indeed, as pointed out by Andreau (2002), the primitivist, Finleyan, way of thinking has almost completely been abandoned nowadays. But the mere existence of markets does not say much about their efficiency. Market efficiency, broadly defined as the capacity of the market to deal with external demand – or supply shocks, is often equated with trade. Indeed, a well developed transport network makes it possible to transport grain to places with the highest prices, hence smoothing price fluctuations. Hence, if price volatility is low, it is a sign that markets can deal with external shocks. For the ancient world in the heyday of the Roman Empire, it has often been argued that Rome was at the centre of the grain trade in the Mediterranean. For example Kessler and Temin (2005: 2) have argued that, in the Roman Empire, there must have been extensive trade relations. They based their conclusion on the observation that the further the distance from Rome was, the lower the prices were. The price difference they explain from transport costs. Few studies, though, have looked at this question for the second largest empire: the Seleucid and its successor, the Parthian Empire. In this paper we assess if the same effect of trade and market efficiency applies to Babylon, being a city in the Seleucid and then, from 141 BC, the Parthian Empire with abundant price data. In the next section, we discuss the data and measurement issues. Section 3 discusses the market integration in Babylon and the Mediterranean world. Since the (non-)existence of trade relations has an effect on the adaptation of markets to external shocks, we turn in Section 4 to the consequences for price volatility. Yet, the existence of shocks is only half the story since trade does not necessarily only limit the number of times high prices occur, but also their duration. Hence, in Section 5 we have a closer look at the duration of high prices. We end with a brief conclusion.Download Free PDFView PDFDirbas, H. 2017.

(Bert) van der SpekAn estimate is made of the capacity of the hinterland of Seleucia on the Tigris and Babylon to feed their inhabitants. The estimate is made on the basis of archaeological surveys, data concerning the Babylonian yields, the size of the cities and irrigated area, data concerning famines. The conclusion is that Seleucia and Babylon could be fed by their own hinterlands even if we accept the highest figures for the population of Seleucia (600,000).Download Free PDFView PDFBibliography of 150+ years of historical research on the Seleucid Empire.
