Interestingly, weight gain, food craving and binge eating have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease after subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), a therapeutic option in the treatment of the disease widely used nowadays . Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this outcome, including changes in energy metabolism (due to motor improvement) or in medication, dysphagia and hypoosmia.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersActa Neurologica BelgicaSubthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease: a descriptive reviewViviana Lo BuonoStandard treatment of Parkinson’s disease involves the dopaminergic medications. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an important neurosurgical intervention often used as alternative treatment to drug therapy; however, it can be associated with increase of impulsive behaviors. This descriptive review focused on studies investigating the correlation between Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease patients, arguing, the action’s mechanism and the specific role of the subthalamic nucleus. We searched on PubMed and Web of Science databases and screening references of included studies and review articles for additional citations. From initial 106 studies, only 15 met the search criteria. Parkinson’s Disease patients with and without Deep Brain Stimulation were compared with healthy controls, through 16 different tasks that assessed some aspects of impulsivity. Both Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleu...Download Free PDFView PDFBody weight and its association with impulsivity in middle and old age individualsFrancesco  ForoniImpulsivity, conceptualized as impulsive personality trait, poor inhibitory control and enhanced reward sensitivity , has been strongly linked to obesity. In particular, a disequilibrium between cognitive control and reward sensitivity has been observed in obese individuals in both behavioural and imaging studies. While this issue has been widely investigated in children and adults, it has received little attention in older adults. Here, obese and non-obese participants aged between 40 and 70 years completed the Barratt Impulsiveness scale (assessing motor, non-planning and attentional impulsiveness), a Go/no-go task with foods and non-foods (assessing in-hibitory control) and a reward sensitivity battery with high and low caloric foods (assessing liking, wanting, tastiness and frequency of consumption). We observed that participants with higher BMI reported increased wanting for high calorie foods, but did not show poorer inhibitory control. Interestingly, participants who scored lower on the MMSE reported to consume high calorie more than low calorie foods. Finally, those who presented low scores on non-planning and motor impulsiveness subscales reported higher tastiness ratings for low calorie foods. These results show that increased reward sensitivity but not reduced inhibitory control may characterize higher BMI during aging. Importantly, they also highlight new findings concerning food preferences among older adults.Download Free PDFView PDFMovement DisordersSubthalamic nucleus stimulation affects incentive salience attribution in Parkinson's disease2011 • Filip RůžičkaDownload Free PDFView PDFMovement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder SocietyWeight gain following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation: a PET study2014 • Dominique Drapier, Jean-François HouvenaghelSeveral hypotheses have been put forward to explain weight gain after deep brain stimulation (DBS), but none provides a fully satisfactory account of this adverse effect. We analyzed the correlation between changes in brain metabolism (using positron emission tomography [PET] imaging) and weight gain after bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS in patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. Body mass index was calculated and brain activity prospectively measured using 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose 3 months before and 4 months after the start of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in 23 patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. Motor complications (United Parkinson&#39;s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]-IV scores) and dopaminergic medication were included in the analysis to control for their possible influence on brain metabolism. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) body mass index increased significantly by 0.8 ± 1.5 kg/m(2) (P = 0.03).

These complications are relatively frequent, affecting 6-15.5% of patients, and they most often appear, or worsen, after initiation of dopaminergic therapy or dosage increase. Recently, impulse control disorders have also been associated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. Here we present a systematic overview of literature published between 2000 and January 2013 reporting impulse control disorders in Parkinson&#39;s disease. We consider prevalence rates and discuss the functional neuroanatomy, the impact of dopamine-serotonin interactions, and the cognitive symptomatology associated with impulse control disorders in Parkinson&#39;s disease.

New text, figures, and tables that elaborate on previously published material (going beyond mere reproduction) are welcome.  In accordance with the policy of some (not all) journals, where authors may publish an extended paper, a proceeding will be acceptable also in the absence of the following features: methodological details necessary to ensure replicability of the study; precise quantitative data supporting statements about obtained effects (typically included in figures and tables); values of statistical indices (e.g.; F, t, p).  Differently from extended papers on refereed journals, which should support replicability and evaluation of the study in the context of the relevant literature, TSPC proceedings aim at attracting the attention of colleagues on current work conducted by authors.

A review of the association to non-motor symptomsRaffaella Ida RumiatiResearch on eating behaviours has extensively highlighted that cognitive systems interact with the met- abolic system in driving food intake and in influencing body weight regulation. Parkinson’s disease is a good model for studying these complex interactions since alterations in both body weight and cogni- tive domains have been frequently reported among these patients. Interestingly, even if different non- motor symptoms may characterize the course of the disease, their contribution to weight and food preference has been poorly investigated. This review describes body weight alterations and eating habits in patients with Parkinson’s disease, including those who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery. In particular, the review considers the link between non-motor symptoms, affecting sensory perception, cognition, mood and motivation, and food intake and weight alterations. The take home message is twofold. First, we recommend a comprehensive approach in order to develop effective strategies in the manage- ment of patients’ weight. Second, we also suggest that investigating this issue in patients with Parkinson’s disease may provide some useful information about the mechanisms underlying food and weight reg- ulation in healthy subjects.Download Free PDFView PDFNeuroImage: ClinicalNeuroimaging and neuromodulation approaches to study eating behavior and prevent and treat eating disorders and obesity2015 • Luke StoeckelDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
