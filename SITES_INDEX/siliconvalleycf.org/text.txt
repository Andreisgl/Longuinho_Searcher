Q&A: How Equity Forward builds the power of Silicon Valley communities to lead change
Community Impact
Racial Equity & Social Justice
Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion spans multiple initiatives.
Addressing systemic disparities is preeminent among our core strategic priorities, and it is the unifying goal of our key funding initiatives. All of our work is centered on building equity and transforming systems to create a Silicon Valley where everyone can thrive.
Housing
SVCF believes having a place to live is a human right.
Our goal is to invest in strategies that will create communities in which everyone has a place to live.
Emergency Response
As a community foundation, SVCF is uniquely positioned to meet the ongoing needs of our local communities and take on unexpected challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
SVCF is leading multiple efforts with our Bay Area philanthropic, government and corporate partners to assist those who have been most deeply affected, including communities of color and immigrants.
Advancing Financial Stability
Silicon Valley’s endemic and growing income inequality is at the root of many of the biggest challenges we face as a region.
We are at the epicenter of the economic equity gap that exists along racial lines.
Community Partnerships
We launch and participate in initiatives and cross-sector solutions that multiply our reach and impact.
Most of these targeted initiatives are three to six years in length. We occasionally take on shorter, high-impact projects.
Early Childhood Development
Early Childhood Development
Silicon Valley is one of the wealthiest regions in the nation, but inequities deeply rooted in long-standing systems of racial injustice stack the deck against many of our youngest children, particularly those who are Black and/or Latinx, low-income, have undocumented status and/or special needs.
Who We Are People working together for the greater good is where transformation happens
Silicon Valley Community Foundation is a hands-on collaborator, catalyst and connector.
Our partners are philanthropists, community and movement-leaders, businesses and leaders in local and state government. We help harness and mobilize the incredible resources, expertise and skills of our Silicon Valley community to deliver systemic changes that will create an equitable, economically secure and vibrant future for all.
