Description:
It should be possible to include templates that are stored on Commons. Just like we can do with images! This would be for centralized templates. Examples would be:
 Templates for interwiki links (interlanguage links); this would make the interlang bot activity almost unnecessary. Solved by Wikidata
Templates with current information like software versions, etc.
There is much more application range, of course. This would help reducing redundancy! Currently all the work that is the same in every wiki has to be done xxx-times. With template inclusion from Commons enabled we only have to do that once. The template names could be in English, or in the language of the creator (who comes first...).
Best regards, Melancholie

Not necessarily. It was originally merged into core during the SVN days, when code review happened after merging. In this case, there were enough flaws that the code was deemed unsuitable for the impending release of MediaWiki 1.19, so it had to be reverted. However, the last few comments at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/95396 are quite optimistic, so I wouldn't write it off completely.
Its probably bitrotted beyond belief at this point. It would probably have to be mostly rewritten in order to keep up with changes in core since it was written.TTO added a comment.Edited · Sep 4 2015, 7:42 AM2015-09-04 07:42:07 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsMy point was that the approach and ideas in that code could still be very useful today for anyone who was going to go ahead and reimplement this.Bawolff added a comment.Sep 4 2015, 7:50 AM2015-09-04 07:50:07 (UTC+0)Comment Actions

It's high priority because it's the first thing one should do when starting work on this MediaWiki core component i.e. templates. However, nobody has been working in this area for a while.
Do you have evidence that there are Gerrit patches to fix this problem, if not, then I don't think that this can be a reason to keep High priority for more than a decade.Vermont added a subscriber: Vermont.Mar 21 2019, 11:31 PM2019-03-21 23:31:47 (UTC+0)Aklapper removed a project: Developer-Advocacy.Mar 22 2019, 4:23 PM2019-03-22 16:23:14 (UTC+0)Capankajsmilyo added a comment.Apr 10 2019, 9:48 AM2019-04-10 09:48:04 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsThis task was authored in 2006, now its 2019.

Please note that Wiki.Melancholie is a Bugzilla user name, not a Phabricator one, so this user won’t get any notification about your ping. Although there’s no direct connection between Bugzilla user names and Meta user names, it seems quite likely that this name belongs to User:Melancholie, a user inactive for almost eleven years, so I don’t expect any answer even if someone writes on their talk page. (This also means that this user went inactive well before Wikidata’s launch eight years ago, so they had no chance to incorporate this change in the description.)
I personally think that such important justifications should not be removed from the description, but crossing it out or marking it
 resolved
with a note about Wikidata is totally okay.Bouzinac added a subscriber: Bouzinac.Jan 10 2021, 4:53 PM2021-01-10 16:53:13 (UTC+0)Comment ActionsHello, I don't know if it's the right topic here but if someone has a nice template in xxwiki, how to make it crosswiki ?

There's no good way to make it crosswiki. "Copy paste among wikis and basta" is the only thing we have. It may sound simple to somebody who is very experienced with programming templates, but for most people it's extremely difficult. This is exactly the thing that this very old request is trying to address.
I wrote what I know about the current way to import templates across wikis on the page https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Global_templates/Transition in the section "What happens today". The other sections on the same page are proposals of how it can be improved, and none of them are actually usable today. I asked a few experienced people, and no one could think of anything more comprehensive than what is written on that page, but if anyone reading this can think of something better, then by all means let me know.AdHuikeshoven updated the task description.
