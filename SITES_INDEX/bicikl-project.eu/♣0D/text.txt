Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge LibraryWe connect infrastructures to enable researchers to access services across the biodiversity data lifecycle
Mission
BiCIKL will catalyse a culture change in the way biodiversity data is identified, linked, integrated and re-used across the research cycle. We will cultivate a more transparent, trustworthy and efficient research ecosystem.
 
Vision
BiCIKL will launch a new European starting community of key research infrastructures, researchers, citizen scientists and other stakeholders in the biodiversity and life sciences based on open science practices through access to data, tools and services. 
 
Results
BiCIKL is building the Biodiversity Knowledge Hub (BKH) - a single knowledge portal to interlinked and machine-readable FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) using unique stable identifiers on specimens, genomics, observations, taxonomy and publications.
