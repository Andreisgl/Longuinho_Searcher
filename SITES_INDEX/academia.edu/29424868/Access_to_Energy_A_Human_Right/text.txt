From employment creation to human development, from security interests to the empowerment of women; energy remains at the heart of all countries’ core interests. However, the statistics are quite alarming. Twenty percent of the world’s population is still without access to electricity; and almost three billion people still rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating.1 A major discussion point that stems from these statistics is that the lack of access to modern energy is a major barrier to addressing basic human rights and building shared prosperity; more specifically, a hindrance to achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersProfessor ; (Full), Chairman of the Chair of Administrative Procedure, Faculty of Law and AdministrationMariusz SworaDownload Free PDFView PDFTD: Journal of Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa Dejo Olowu, 'Privatisation and water governance in Africa: implications of a rights-based approach'(2008) 4(1) TD: Journal of Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa 59-93 Dejo OlowuEarly in the post-independence era, the control of water resources in many African states was a task of central planning. Regrettably, water management soon became a miry adventure in most African states largely because of warped planning and implementation. This article examines the phenomenon of private sector involvement in water resources management and seeks to understand the effect of such involvement on the right to water in Africa in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. The article explores the continuing relationship between African governments and non-state actors in the management of water resources in the privatisation age. The article further analyses the role of various national water governance initiatives vis-à-vis the efficient management of water resources and the sharp contradictions in their frameworks from a rights-based perspective. It evaluates the normative frameworks of access to water as a human right in Africa and contends that the human being must be placed at the centre of water discourses in assessing all role actors and their responsibilities. Extrapolating from experiences from various states within and outside Africa, this article advocates a rights-based approach to water issues and its value for the ultimate purpose of human-centred development.Download Free PDFView PDFGender, cities and the millennium development goals in the global south2007 • Sylvia ChantDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Human Rights in the CommonwealthReadjusting the Political Thermostat: Fuel Poverty and Human Rights in the UK2016 • Ben Christman, Hannah  RussellFuel poverty − the inability to afford adequate warmth in the home − is a widespread problem across the UK. Cold, damp homes are detrimental to human health and contribute to thousands of ‘excess winter deaths’ every year. This article analyses fuel poverty from a human rights perspective – asking whether it engages human rights protections. It first discusses the definition, scale and health impacts of the problem. Second, it explores the relationship between fuel poverty and the rights contained within the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the European Social Charter. It concludes that fuel poverty readily engages rights to adequate housing, food and health; and certain civil and political rights in extreme circumstances. It discusses the legal implications of these findings for fuel poverty policy, arguing for a ‘human rights approach’ to tackling the problem. These conclusions focus on the particularly drastic fuel poverty situation in the UK, but can also be applied globally to the various nations where citizens suffer similar problems and extend to the wider debate on the relationship between poverty and human rights.

Removing and treating human excreta is generally associated with the discrete machinations of local service delivery, the technical concerns of health professionals or the occasional demands by environment advocates. However, the scale and impact of the ‘global sanitation crisis’ and recognition of a right to water gave impetus to demands for recognition of sanitation as a human right. This chapter examines this new right from an interdisciplinary perspective. It asks whether sanitation can be justifiably recognized as a human right in moral theory and international law, discusses how the boundaries and content of the right should be delineated, and explores the emerging use of the right to sanitation in practice and its actual and potential contribution.Download Free PDFView PDFReport for the Gender and Development NetworkGender, the Millennium Development Goals, and Human Rights in the context of the 2005 review processes2004 • Genevieve Renard PainterDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
