First, the rich uppermost Devonian-Mississippian Bakken Formation source has contributed much less than the leaner Mississippian Lodgepole Formation source to known Mississippian Madison Group oil pools. Second, the rich and mature Upper Ordovician Bighorn Group sources have not fed many oil pools in the northeastern part of the basin. Bakken shales have an overpressure due to hydrocarbon generation and low vertical permeabilities. Low Bakken permeabilities accompany low porosities, which can be shown to be saturated with residual oil. The small storage capacity of Bakken shale porosities, but the large amounts of hydrocarbon generation in Bakken shales requires the &#39;forced expulsion&#39; of much Bakken-sourced oil. This oil remains generally dispersed in the drainage system and unlike Lodgepole-sourced oils, seldom accumulates to form significant pools; this explains the paradox of Bakken and Lod...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Detailed biomarker analyses indicate that oils from the Montana portion of the Williston Basin can be classified into two separate genetic oil families that were initially identified in the northern Williston Basin. Oils found predominantly in Ordovician reservoirs display geochemical characteristics known to be unique for Ordovician-sourced oils worldwide and are included into oil Family A. Oils occurring in the Mississippian Madison Group reservoirs belong to oil Family C or have intermediate compositions indicating the mixing of oils from multiple sources with a significant Family C component. Similarly, compositions of a few oils from Nisku reservoirs appear to have resulted from mixing of hydrocarbons, although a separate single source for these oils could be possible. In central Montana, the majority of oils produced from Pennsylv...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sub-permafrost gas hydrate bearing strata are widespread in the Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin (8MB). Initial direct evidence for highly concentrated GHs came from core samples in the Mallik 2L-38 well and a short production test in Mallik 5L-38 well. Many additional GH accumulations were inferred subsequently using geophysical well log data in conventional petroleum wells . The stable carbon isotopic composition ofGHs in the Mallik 2L-38 and 5L-38 wells indicate that the methane has thermogenic origin. The Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin is also a proven conventional petroleum province with a large prospective conventional natural gas and crude oil resource. Concentrated GHs are often co-located geographically with conventional petroleum accumulations, suggesting that shared geological controls affect both the conventional and GH accumulations.

Case Studies on Secondary Oil Migration in the Williston BASIN1The use of chemical tracers, determined by the analysis of reservoired oils and associated gases,... more The use of chemical tracers, determined by the analysis of reservoired oils and associated gases, to quantify petroleum migration processes could significantly improve the constraints for basin fluid models and help identify petroleum secondary migration pathways. This paper reviews the geochemical controls on one potential molecular tracer class (pyrrolic nitrogen compounds), particularly the effect of source and maturity. Three case studies illustrate how to utilize the changing concentrations of these compounds in related suites of migrated petroleums to constrain regional fluid models and to define small, efficient channels where petroleum has migrated from source rocks to traps in the Williston Basin. The first case deals with the Winnipegosis petroleum system in southeastern Saskatchewan, where oils previously thought to be sourced locally are shown to have the longest migration distances among a suite of related oils.

Source rock permeability and petroleum expulsion efficiency: modelling examples from the Mahakam delta, the Williston Basin and the Paris BasinGeological Society, London, Petroleum Geology Conference Series,  1993Petroleum source rock expulsion efficiency classification based solely on geochemical characteris... more Petroleum source rock expulsion efficiency classification based solely on geochemical characteristics can be misleading. Source rock permeability characteristics are also important, especially where petroleum expulsion occurs as a separate phase flow. Thermal and maturity history reconstructions and overpressure development, simulated with the TEMISPACK model of the Institut Français du Petrole (IFP) using two-phase (water, petroleum) Darcy flow, illustrates the importance and influence of bulk source rock permeability for expulsion efficiency. Poor dispersed type III Mahakam pelagic shales, rich marine type II Bakken shales and Paris Basin Lower Liassic source rocks, including both rich Lower Toarcian shales and underlying, less rich Hettangian–Lotharingian marls, illustrate how strongly expulsion efficiency is controlled by bulk rock permeability. Simulation of overpressures in Mahakam and Bakken shales requires very low bulk permeabilities, in the nD range.

The Middle to Upper Triassic Schei Point Group contains good to excellent quality oil-prone source intervals (Cape Caledonia Member of the Murray Harbour Formation and Eden Bay Member of the Hoyle Bay Formation). These source beds are in the catagenetic stage of oil generation and are characterized by high total organic carbon content (TOC) and high hydrogen index (HI) values (&gt;500 mg HC/g C org ). The HI values decrease significantly to org at or near the stage of maximum oil generation. The organic matter in the Schei Point rocks consists mainly of Tasmanales algae, dinoflagellates and amorphous fluorescing matrix bituminite. Moderate to good quality oil-prone source beds containing mainly Type II organic matter are also found in the lower part of the Lower to Middle Jurassic Jameson Bay Formation but the formation contains mainly gas-prone Type III organic matter. The other organic-rich formation in the area is the Upper Jurassic Ringnes, but it is relatively poor in hydrogen-rich organic matter and, as a result, has limited source-rock potential. The abrupt increase in the rate of subsidence during Aptian-Albian times is responsible for triggering the hydrocarbon generation from Schei Point rocks. Maturation gradients are very low (0.12 to 0.18% log R o /km) and it is estimated that approximately 1.0 km of Tertiary strata has been eroded due to the Tertiary Eurekan Orogeny.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We first apply a careful fluid substitution procedure to the results of reservoir gas saturation and pressure responses obtained from fluid flow simulations. We test different methods to compute the bulk modulus of the fluid for different fluid saturation models. Assuming a semi-patchy model and considering only the replacement of brine with a maximum saturation of 50% CO2, we estimate the reduction in P-wave velocity to be 20%. Adding an increase in pore pressure of 2.7 MPa increases the P-wave velocity reduction to 32%. After including a field-based signal-to-noise ratio of 5% to the synthetic seismic data, the time-lapse seismic anomaly should be detectable after one year of injection (266 tonnes of CO2).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A comprehensive study of marine reflection seismic data, including seismic inversion and spectral decomposition, and geological modeling and statistic inference based on machine learning techniques, provides insights into possible oil and gas occurrences and a petroleum system model for the offshore northern part of the rift margin. Combined with other geological constraints, our study suggests that the offshore rift margin becomes more oil-prone northward and may have significant petroleum resource potential. This paper illustrates the geological and geophysical evidence of potential petroleum occurrences, petroleum system model and oil and gas resource estimates in the offshore rift margin.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This characteristic motivated the examination of a fractal model for a quantitative description of petroleum resource spatial distribution. The proposed approach transforms the spatial information with respect to discovered petroleum accumulations into a frequency domain, represented by an amplitude map and a phase spectrum. The amplitude map is then calibrated using a fractal model, inferred from exploration data, to account for the sampling bias in exploration procedure. The information in the obtained phase spectrum provides no clue with respect to the locations of undiscovered accumulations, and cannot be enhanced by the established fractal model either. If the calibrated amplitude map and a random phase map are transformed back to the spatial domain and conditioned on the discovered petroleum ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Recent field investigations have identified the presence of oil-stained sandstone and shale inferred to have originated from two different sources. Biomarker analyses of solvent extracts have concluded that two compositionally distinct oil families are present in the region. Eight samples were submitted including one sandstone from the Cretaceous Martin House Formation, six samples of sandstone from the Upper Devonian to Carboniferous Tuttle Formation and one sample of the Ford Lake Shale. Oil biomarkers of the Martin House sample are distinct from all other samples submitted and compositional traces suggest a Lower? Cretaceous or younger marine source for the sample from the Martin House.

Fourteen wells have been drilled, of which seven are unique tests. Eight wells were cored and no samples are available for three wells. For a variety of reasons the wells do not test all of the prospective reservoirs and many are drilled in unfavourable diagenetic facies (i.e. high thermal maturity). Cores, samples, tests and log interpretations indicate both potential reservoirs and petroleum shows. Gas flowed on test from the Nazko c-95-E/93-B-11 well in Nechako basin and a Bowser basin well, Ritchie a-003-J/104-A-06, has a porous sandstone interval containing either gas or fresh water.
