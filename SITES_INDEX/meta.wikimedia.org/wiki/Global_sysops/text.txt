Global sysop requests
Translate
Shortcut: GSR
This page is monitored by global sysops and stewards for simple requests for deletion or blocking on wikis with no active administrators. It is an alternative option available to using IRC to make a quick request. Please do not use this page for controversial requests; this is intended to be a venue for quick cleanup of GS-wikis. Formal or controversial requests can be filed at Steward requests/Miscellaneous.
A bot automatically updates a list of all speedy deletion requests - global sysops can review it at Global sysops/Speedy delete requests.
Global sysops: Please clear page contents after processing requests.

Please brew page MediaWiki:Babel-footer with content Uzantaro de vikivortaro and page MediaWiki:Babel-footer-url with content :Kategorio:Uzantaro. Better link to existing cat. Taylor 49 (talk) 10:30, 6 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
footer-url's request seems invalid, default is a babel cat, Kategorio:Uzantaro is an umbrella category for all user-related pages. --Minorax«¦talk¦» 08:17, 19 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@User:Minorax: Alternatively eo:wikt:Kategorio:Vikivortaristo laŭ lingvo :Kategorio:Vikivortaristo laŭ lingvo. Still I do not agree that "Kategorio:Uzantaro" is "invalid" given that the "babel" syntax can eat templates and produce cat insertions outside of Cat:Wikipedians_by_language ie exactly matching the scope of the category that I proposed originally. Taylor 49 (talk) 18:34, 22 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Fixed an error in above proposal. BTW, 21 days have elapsed. Taylor 49 (talk) 11:14, 27 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
