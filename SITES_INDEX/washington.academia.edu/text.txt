Shannon DorseyUniversity of Washington,  Psychology,  Faculty MemberImplementation Science+8Shannon Dorsey, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology, Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Global Health, and Licensed Clinical Psychologist at the University of Washington. Her research is on evidence-based treatment (EBT) for children and adolescents, with a particular focus on dissemination and implementation of EBT domestically and internationally.  Her work has often focused on trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), with hybrid research designs that include both effectiveness and implementation questions. Research has focused on adaptation for unique populations (e.g., foster care or low and middle income countries) and on training and supervision strategies to deliver TF-CBT and other EBT.Address: 3939 University Wayless183 Followers23 Following20 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingPapersUsing Implementation Science to Close the Gap Between the Optimal and Typical Practice of Quantitative Methods in Clinical ScienceJournal of Abnormal Psychology,  2019Quantitative methods remain the fundamental approach for hypothesis testing, but in approaches to... more Quantitative methods remain the fundamental approach for hypothesis testing, but in approaches to data analysis there is substantial evidence of a gap between what is optimal and what is typical. It is clear that diffusion and dissemination alone are not maximally effective at improving data analytic practices in clinical psychological science. Amid declines in quantitative psychology training, and growing demand for advanced quantitative methods, applied researchers are increasingly called upon to conduct and evaluate research using methods in which they lack expertise. This "research-to-practice" gap in which rigorously developed and empirically supported quantitative methods are not applied in practice has received little attention. In this article, we describe how implementation science, which aims to reduce the research-to-practice gap in health care, offers a promising set of methods for closing the gap for quantitative methods. By identifying determinants of practice (i.e., barriers and facilitators of change), implementation strategies can be selected to increase adoption and high-fidelity application of new quantitative methods to improve scientific inferences and policy and practice decisions in clinical psychological science. General Scientific Summary Making studies more replicable will require more effective use of statistics in research, but there is a large gap between how statistics are applied in psychological research and how they should be applied. The current article describes how the lessons of clinical implementation science, which has focused on getting evidence based treatments into community practice settings, may be applied to improve research in clinical psychology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Under the hood: lay counsellor element use in a modular multi-problem transdiagnostic intervention in lower resource countriesThe Cognitive Behaviour Therapist,  2019The use of transdiagnostic mental health treatments in low resource settings has been proposed as... more The use of transdiagnostic mental health treatments in low resource settings has been proposed as a possible aid in scaling up mental health services. Modular, multi-problem transdiagnostic treatments can be used to treat a range of mental health problems and are designed to handle comorbidity. Two randomized controlled trials have been completed on one treatment-the Common Elements Treatment Approach, or CETA-delivered by lay counsellors in Iraq and Thailand. This paper utilizes data from two clinical trials to explore the delivery of CETA by lay providers, examining fidelity and flexibility of element use. Data were collected at every therapy session. Clients completed a short symptom assessment and providers described the clinical elements delivered during sessions. Analyses included descriptive statistics of delivery including selection and sequencing of treatment elements, and the variance in element dose, clustering at the counsellor level, using multi-level models. Results indicate that lay providers in low resource settings (with supervision) demonstrated fidelity to the recommended CETA elements, order and dose, and occasionally added in elements and flexed dosage based on client presentation (i.e. flexibility). This modular approach did not result in significantly longer treatment duration. Our analysis suggests that lay providers were able to learn decision-making processes of CETA based on client presentation and adjust treatment as needed with supervision. As modular multi-problem transdiagnostic treatments continue to be explored in low resource settings, research should continue to focus on 'unpacking' lay counsellor delivery of these interventions, decision-making processes, and the level of supervision required.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Individual and organizational factors that affect implementation of evidence-based practices for children with autism in public schools: a cross-sectional observational studyImplementation Science,  2019Background: Children with autism receive most of their intervention services in public schools, b... more Background: Children with autism receive most of their intervention services in public schools, but implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) for autism varies. Studies suggest that individual (attitudes) and organizational characteristics (implementation leadership and climate) may influence providers' use of EBPs, but research is relatively limited in this area. This study examined individual and organizational factors associated with implementation of three EBPs-discrete trial training, pivotal response training, and visual schedules-for children with autism in special education classrooms in public elementary schools. Methods: Participants included 67 autism support teachers and 85 other classroom staff from 52 public elementary schools in the northeastern United States. Participants reported their attitudes toward EBPs (e.g., intuitive appeal, willingness if required, openness, and divergence), implementation leadership and climate of their school, and the frequency with which they deliver each of three EBPs. Linear regression was used to estimate the association of attitudes about EBPs with organizational characteristics and intensity of EBP use. Demographic covariates with a bivariate association with EBP use significant at p < .20 were entered into the adjusted models. Results: There were significant findings for only one EBP, discrete trial training. Teachers who reported higher perceived divergence (perceived difference of usual practice with academically developed or research-based practices) between EBPs and current practices used less discrete trial training (f 2 = .18), and teachers who reported higher appeal (willingness to adopt EBPs given their intuitive appeal) of EBPs used more discrete trial training (f 2 = .22). No organizational factors were significantly associated with implementation with any of the three EBPs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This pragmatic trial examines a novel healthcare delivery model (Screen-Refer-Treat [SRT]), which capitalizes upon existing health care and early intervention (EI) infrastructure to increase community capacity for ASD detection and treatment before age 3, when it is likely to have the greatest impact. This model comprises three components: (1) universal use of Stage 1 ASD screening by primary care providers (PCPs) at 18-month well-child visits (i.e., Screen); (2) immediate referral of positive screens to a community-based EI program (i.e., Refer); and (3) provision of an inexpensive, evidence-based ASD-specialized treatment by EI providers, after verifying ASD risk with a Stage 2 screen (i.e., Treat). This paper describes our research design and the initial successes, challenges, and adaptations made during the early implementation phase.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, it is unknown whether discrepancies in leadership perceptions also predict EBP use. This study examined the association of principal-staff alignment and discrepancy in perceptions of implementation leadership with the dosage of three Autism-focused school-based EBPs, Discrete Trial Training, Pivotal Response Training (PRT), and Visual Schedules. PRT dosage was higher when principals underrated their implementation leadership and when it was agreed upon that implementation leadership was low. Findings have implications for leaders support of EBPs implemented in school-based settings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Workplace-based clinical supervision, in which supervisors provide oversight, feedback, and training on clinical practice, may be a method to support EBT implementation. Our prior research suggests that the intensity of supervisory focus on EBT (i.e., thoroughness of coverage) during workplace-based supervision varies. This study explores predictors of supervisory EBT intensity. Methods: Participants were twenty-eight supervisors and 70 clinician supervisees. They completed a baseline survey, and audio recorded supervision sessions over 1 year. Four hundred and thirty eight recordings were coded for supervision content. We chose to explore predictors of two EBT content elements due to their strong evidence for effectiveness and sufficient variance to permit testing. These included a treatment technique ("exposure") and a method to structure treatment ("assessment"). We also explored predictors of non-EBT content ("other topics"). Mixed-effects models explored predictors at organizational/supervisor, clinician, and session levels. Results: Positive implementation climate predicted greater intensity of EBT content coverage for assessment (coefficient = 0.82, p = 0.004) and exposure (coefficient = 0.87, p = 0.001). Intensity of exposure coverage was also predicted by more time spent discussing each case (coefficient = 0.04, p < 0.001). Predictors of greater non-EBT content coverage included longer duration of supervision sessions (coefficient = 0.05, p < 0.001) and lower levels of supervisor EBT knowledge (coefficient = −0.17, p = 0.013). No other supervisor-or clinician-level variables were significant predictors in the mixed effects models. Conclusion: This was the first study to explore multi-level predictors of objectively coded workplace-based supervision content. Results suggest that organizations that expect, support and reward EBT are more likely to have greater intensity of EBT supervision coverage, which in turn may positively impact clinician EBT fidelity and client outcomes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There were 64 children with at least mild symptoms of grief and/or traumatic stress and their guardians who participated in this open trial. The TF-CBT for Child Traumatic Grief protocol was adapted for use with a group, resulting in 12 weekly sessions for children and guardians separately with conjoint activities and 3 individual visits with child and guardian. Using a task-sharing approach, the intervention was delivered by lay counselors with no prior mental health experience. Primary child outcomes assessed were symptoms of grief and posttraumatic stress (PTS); secondary outcomes included symptoms of depression and overall behavioral adjustment. All assessments were conducted pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment. Results showed improved scores on all outcomes posttreatment, sustained at 3 and 12 months. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) for baseline to posttreatment were 1.36 for child reported grief symptoms, 1.87 for child-reported PTS, and 1.15 for guardian report of child PTS.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Effect sizes (Cohen's d) for baseline to posttreatment were 1.36 for child reported grief symptoms, 1.87 for child-reported PTS, and 1.15 for guardian report of child PTS.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
