Twenty-one isolates of C. neoformans were grown for 24 or 48 h in four chemically defined media: yeast nitrogen base (BYNB 7); RPMI 1640; synthetic amino acid medium--fungal (SAAMF), buffered at pH 7.0 to select the medium that best supported growth of this fastidious yeast; and yeast nitrogen base, pH 5.4 (YNB 5.4). Maximum growth of C. neoformans, at 35 degrees C, was obtained in YNB 5.4, with the next highest growth levels in BYNB 7, SAAMF, and RPMI. Growth at 24 h was uniformly poor in all media and lacked reproducibility. In contrast, incubation for 48 h gave adequate growth with low standard deviations, and 48 h was selected as the optimal incubation period for this study.

The positive and negative predictive values of vanB PCR were 1.42% and 99.9%, respectively. A positive vanB result by PCR is poorly predictive and necessitates culture for differentiation of VRE-positive and -negative individuals.Save to LibraryDownloadby George Chong•  18  Microbiology, Glycopeptide Research, Screening, Clinical MicrobiologyExpanded Multilocus Sequence Typing for Burkholderia SpeciesSave to LibraryDownloadby John LiPuma•  10  Clinical Microbiology, Biological Sciences, Phylogeny, Cluster AnalysisSpoligotyping followed by double-repetitive-element PCR as rapid alternative to IS6110 fingerprinting for epidemiological studies of tuberculosisA total of 129 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis representing 91 patients were typed by a combination of direct-repeat (DR)-based spoligotyping and an inter-IS6110-PGRS (polymorphic GC-rich region)-PCR, also designated... moreA total of 129 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis representing 91 patients were typed by a combination of direct-repeat (DR)-based spoligotyping and an inter-IS6110-PGRS (polymorphic GC-rich region)-PCR, also designated double-repetitive-element PCR (DRE-PCR). During the first phase of this investigation, 72 clinical strains representing 52 patients were initially typed by IS6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DR-RFLP, followed by spoligotyping and DRE-PCR. In the second phase of this investigation, the discriminating ability of spoligotyping plus DRE-PCR was studied for 57 isolates from 39 patients who were suspected to be epidemiologically linked, and the typing results were later confirmed by IS6110-RFLP and DR-RFLP analyses. The molecular clustering of the isolates remained identical irrespective of the methods used.

The organism was identified asC. accolensby biochemical identification, amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis, and DNA-DNA hybridization. This is the first case of C. accolens endocarditis reported, adding to the increasing number of Corynebacterium-related cases of endocarditis. Cases of endocarditis are rarely caused by corynebacteria. A total of 126 cases have been reviewed recently (4). Fifty-three ofthesecaseswererelatedtothepresenceofprostheticvalves, and 107 of the organisms were related to Corynebacterium species living commensally on the skin.

Optimal sample processing protocols for diagnostic broad-range bacterial PCR should release DNA from an array of target organisms with equal efficiencies and wash out inhibitory factors from various sample types without introducing bacterial DNA contamination to the amplification reaction. In the present study, two physical cell wall disintegration methods, bead beating and sonication, for enhanced detection of organisms with difficult-to-lyse cell walls were studied. The analytical sensitivities of several commercially available DNA purification kits, which were used with and without additional cell disintegration steps, were compared by using dilution series of model bacteria.

These species may easily be confused. However, clear-cut differences between C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis were found in their acid production from maltotriose and ethylene glycol, susceptibility to vibriostatic agent O129, and alkaline phosphatase. Absence of growth at 20 degrees C and lack of alpha-glucosidase and 4MU-alpha-D-glycoside hydrolysis activity differentiated C. amycolatum from C. pseudotuberculosis and C. ulcerans. The mastitis C. pseudotuberculosis strains differed from the biovar equi and ovis reference strains and from caprine field strains in their colony morphologies and in their reduced inhibitory activity on staphylococcal beta-hemolysin.

When selected drugs are tested on human; unique resistance were shown by this bacterial infection known as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). If holistic approach is disregarded fewer options are left for medication to overcome this lethal toxicity. If solo range of drug treatment is applied only, the allied complications and consequences of infections may proliferate beyond critical levels. The research article is centred on primary microbial data collection (from urine and blood) in hospital. The emphasis of experimentation is to scrutinize the highest risk susceptible hospital area including sampled fluid. The precautionary and therapeutic measures are discussed along with alternative means of medication with judicious selection to achieve targeted and optimum outcome.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aiman Rashid•  6  Web Engineering, Semantic Web, Medicine, Clinical MicrobiologyMolecular procedure for rapid detection of Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomalleiSave to LibraryDownloadby C.

In order to define the bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. All specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum , Prevotella heparinolytica , Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus micros , Streptococcus milleri group, Actinomyces israelii , and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum . These organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. The isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptibl...Save to LibraryDownloadby Ellie Goldstein•  10  Clinical Microbiology, Biological Sciences, Animals, ClinicalSimultaneous Detection of Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Cryptosporidium parvum in Fecal Samples by Using Multiplex Real-Time PCREntamoeba histolytica , Giardia lamblia , and Cryptosporidium are three of the most important diarrhea-causing parasitic protozoa.

For many years, microscopic examination of stool samples has been considered to be the “gold standard” for diagnosis of E. histolytica , G. lamblia , and C. parvum infections. Recently, more specific and sensitive alternative methods (PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and direct fluorescent-antibody assay) have been introduced for all three of these parasitic infections. However, the incorporation in a routine diagnostic laboratory of these parasite-specific methods for diagnosis of each of the respective infections is time-consuming and increases the costs of a stool examination. Therefore, a multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of E. histolytica , G. lamblia , and C. parvum in stool samples.

The diagnostic performance of the mu-capture ELISA was compared with that of a conventional indirect ELISA. Sera from untreated patients with erythema migrans (n = 50), neuroborreliosis (n = 100), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA; n = 48) were investigated. The cutoff of the ELISAs was adjusted to a diagnostic specificity of 98% on the basis of examination of 200 serum specimens from healthy controls. The mu-capture ELISA increased the diagnostic sensitivity in patients with erythema migrans from 32 to 48% (P less than 0.01) and in patients with neuroborreliosis from 37 to 57% (P less than 0.001).

Fifty strains isolated from such wounds were characterized with commercial kits for preformed-enzyme detection, carbohydrate fermentation, and other biochemical tests. PCR fingerprinting was performed on these strains to further characterize subgroups within these species. Bacteroides tectum is a frequent isolate in bite wounds and resembles Prevotella bivia in colony morphology and saccharolytic activity, except that it grows in 20% bile and hydrolyzes esculin. Profile numbers generated by various kits associate B. tectum with P. bivia, Prevotella oralis group, or Prevotella melaninogenica.

In vitro, 98% (n = 96) of sputum samples with a known number of bacilli (10(7) to 10(2) bacilli) could be enumerated within 0.5 log(10). In comparison to culture, the molecular bacterial load (MBL) assay is unaffected by other microorganisms present in the sample, results are obtained more quickly (within 24 h) and are seldom inhibited (0.7% samples), and the MBL assay critically shows the same biphasic decline as observed longitudinally during treatment. As a biomarker of treatment response, the MBL assay responds rapidly, with a mean decline in bacterial load for 111 subjects of 0.99 log(10) (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.81 to 1.17) after 3 days of chemotherapy. There was a significant association between the rate of bacterial decline during the same 3 days and bacilli ml(-1) sputum at day 0 (linear regression, P = 0.0003) and a 3.62 increased odds ratio of relapse for every 1 log(10) increase in pretrea...Save to LibraryDownloadby Timothy  McHugh•  10  Clinical Microbiology, Biological Sciences, Therapeutic drug monitoring, TuberculosisGenetic diversity of clinical and environmental isolates of Vibrio cholerae determined by amplified …Save to LibraryDownloadby Kwai Lin  Thong•  20  Genetics, Environmental microbiology, Malaysia, Food MicrobiologyEvaluation of Three Commercial Latex Agglutination Tests for Identification of Campylobacter sppSave to LibraryDownloadby Albert Lastovica•  7  Food Microbiology, Clinical Microbiology, Biological Sciences, HumansBacteremia Caused by Arcobacter butzleri in an Immunocompromised HostArcobacter butzleri is an emerging pathogen that has been implicated as the causative agent of persistent watery diarrhea.
