Sergiu  VacaruMathematics+9Dr Sergiu Vacaru has almost 40 years of research (including 5 years of university teaching) experience on mathematical particle physics, gravity and cosmology, and geometric methods in physics, with more than 140 peer-reviewed articles and 190 scientific works (390 titles including 8 monographs and university textbooks and lecture notes, preprints, scientific talks etc.). He received the equivalents of MS and PhD degrees and Research Professor title, CS1, in the former USSR and Romania: at Tomsk Polytechnic University and Moscow State University "M.

Quantum geometric information flows and emergent gravityWe investigate classical and quantum geometric information flow theories (respectively, GIFs and ... more We investigate classical and quantum geometric information flow theories (respectively, GIFs and QGIFs) when the geometric flow evolution and field equations for nonholonomic Einstein systems, NES, are derived from Perelman–Lyapunov type entropic type functionals. There are defined canonical (nonholonomic, i.e. with non-integrable distributions) geometric variables which allow a general decoupling and integration of nonlinear systems of equations describing GIFs and QGIFs and (for self-similar geometric flows) Ricci soliton type configurations. Our approach is more general and different from the ideas and methods used for special classes of solutions with the area–hypersurface entropy, and related holographic and dual gauge–gravity models, involving the concepts and generalizations of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy and black hole thermodynamics. Formulating the theory of QGIFs and GIFs (in particular, encoding models with flow evolution of NES), a set of fundamental geometric, proba...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The theories we study are modelled on (co) tangent Lorentz bundles with a star product structure determined by R-flux deformations in string theory. For the nonassociative vacuum Einstein equations we consider both real and complex effective sources. In order to analyze the nonassociative vacuum Einstein equations we develop the anholonomic frame and connection deformation methods, which allows one to decoupled and solve these equations. The metric coefficients can depend on both space-time coordinates and energy-momentum. By imposing conditions on the integration functions and effective sources we find physically important, exact solutions: (1) 6-d Tangherlini BHs, which are star product and R-flux distorted to 8-d black ellipsoids (BEs) and BHs; (2) nonassocitative space-time and co-fiber space double BH and/or BE con...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
