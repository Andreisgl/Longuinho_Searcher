Bacon samples from pigs fed 4% SF were considered to have a sweeter flavor (4.07 .07) than those fed 0% SF (3.89 .07; P &lt; .04). The intensity of salty flavor was higher in bacon samples from pigs fed CO (6.18 .09) compared to those fed CLA (5.86 .10; P &lt; .02). The intensity of salty aftertaste was greater when CO was combined with YG (5.21 .14; P &lt; .07) or T (5.44 .14; P &lt; .01) than CO alone (4.85 .14) but SF combined with CLA was not different from CLA alone (SF * LA; P &lt; .02). Sour flavor intensity tended to be lower in loin samples from pigs fed CLA than from those fed CO (1.60 vs 1.73 .06; P &lt; .09). Samples from animals fed 4% T tended to have slightly lower (P &lt; .09) notes of astringent aftertaste (1.42 .08) compared to those fed 0% SF (1.62 .09) or 4% YG (1.66 .09).

Fat was partially (25, 50 or 75 %) replaced with potato starch or pea fiber resulting 16-17%, 31-33% and 45-50% decrease in gross energy content, respectively. Differences in measured color values were small, being undetectable by assessors. Reduced fat sausages containing medium or high levels of potato starch (3.9%, 5.8%) or high level of pea fiber (1.8%) were perceived less salty than control and scores of saltiness were in line with that of juiciness. Organoleptic properties of sausages with low and medium levels of pea fiber (0.6, 1.2%) and potato starch (1.9%) were similar than that of full fat sausage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

X-ray density frequency curves were developed from the whole body to determine the different tissue volumes. The calculated meat to fat ratio values were 3.4, 3.2 and 1.9 (meat-type pigs), while those of fat-type pigs were 1.0, 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, in the average weight of 30, 60 and 90 kg. In these weights, the meat percentage values were 35.5, 30.9 and 28.5 of the Mangalicas and 61.5, 57.7 and 53.2 % of meat-type pigs. The investigation of the tissue development in the body was carried out by means of 3D histograms. In the cross-sectional images the surface of the m. longissimus dorsi and also the m. semitendinosus was determined and the fat thickness at the back and the rump were measured. The intramuscular fat content was characterised by the average X-ray density value.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Fiber-optic NIR technique and Aquaphotomics for detecting high fructose corn syrup adulteration of honeyObjective Characteristics of unifloral False Acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia) honey (liquid due to t... more Objective Characteristics of unifloral False Acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia) honey (liquid due to the high fructose content, very light colored and flavored) may easily be spoiled, negatively influencing market growth by damaging consumer confidence. Large scale honey adulteration appeared on the world market in the 1970s when high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) was introduced by the industry [1]. Aquaphotomics considers water as a multi-element system that can be well described by its multi-dimensional near infrared (NIR) spectra. Since moisture is present in most of the natural samples, this analytical approach using water through its perturbations in different environments as a mirror of the sample itself can be applied in many fields very effectively [2]. The goal of the present study was to build an applicable NIR model for screening Robinia honey by using fiber-optic probe and to describe its spectral characteristics using recent findings of auqaphotomics.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In case of skatole women tended to be more sensitive than men. In contrast, for androstenone the sensitivity was independent of sex. Results obtained with PanelCheck V.1.3.2. soft ware show that the panellists were more sensitive to the samples with both substances, than the samples with only androstenone or skatole. Discriminant Factor Analysis (DFA) model classification based on electronic nose sensory data shows 100% correct classification of the samples with only androstenone and only skatole. With using of all samples except control samples in development of discriminant analysis (DF) model, three groups were classified with 80% success: only androstenone, only skatole and the different combination of androstenone and skatole levels.

With the help of these indices, the difference of vegetational and other land covers can be contrasted and many useful and applicable data can be gathered ranging from vegetation health to growth dynamics among others. In recent decades, starting from the first Landsat satellite, a huge number of VIs were developed in order to be able to effectively monitor vegetation – the reason for the immense number is due to the fact that every sensor, topographic, geographic, vegetative and atmospheric feature is different, and more so are their combinations. This is the reason why there is no unified spectral band mathematical formula. The aim of this short overview is to provide the reader insight of the main vegetation indices (VIs) that have been used in scientific literature and their development over the last 40 years.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The native Mangalica pig breed is one of the most important issues in this matter in the Hungarian meat industry. Mangalica pigs are used for extensive rearing on prairie-like areas under severe conditions, utilising only the available feed. This pig has a dark and fatty, marbled meat, giving a very favourable taste, and it is beneficial for culinary techniques because it increases the level of sensory qualities. Also this meat is excellent to produce the original Hungarian salami sausage or meat products, with extremely prolonged ripening, such as Serrano ham. Among other reasons, the high commercial value of meats of high consumer popularity leads to an expressed need for fast and reliable methods to identify the animal species and type, either in carcass meats, or even more in meat products.

Food restriction had a significant impact on every parameter. Hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatix index and condition factor decreased linearly, while in case of body composition parameters a slight fluctuation can be observed. Body fat and dry matter content decreased, protein and ash increased due to 12-week-long starvation. It can be concluded that body lipids constituted the major energy source for starved carp juveniles and 12-week-long starvation did not induce proteolysis in tissues.
