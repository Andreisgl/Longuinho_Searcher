The demographics of the elderly were outlined and key components of the service system described. Attention was given to access hospital-based care, the closing of hospitals and the reasons for bypassing rural hospitals for those in large towns or cities. Special emphasis also was given to mental health services and their uneven accessibility. A review of the policy implications closed the workshop.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Rural HealthThe Influence of Insurance Status and Income on Health Care Use Among the Nonmetropolitan Elderly1996 • A.

The survey used in this study was the National Survey of Self-care and Aging (NSSCA). A cross-sectional design was employed using weighted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan residential location and self-reported ability to perform basic, mobility, and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs), as well as to assess the degree to which the levels and types of functional limitations affect metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan older adults' performance of self-care activitiesThe bivariate logistic analyses pointed to modest, often insignificant metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan differences in the ability to perform functional tasks. However, larger positive effects of nonmetropolitan residence were generally observed once other factors likely to account for some of these differences were taken into account. Older adults from nonmetropolitan areas were more likely to report being able to perform functional activities but also were more likely to report performing self-care activities both in the presence and absence of disability. This study, therefore, concluded that nonmetropolitan older adults may discount the significance of declining functional status, thus normalizing the trajectory of aging in a different way than do their metropolitan counterparts. If this process occurs, it may affect how nonmetropolitan persons use primary health care and/or long-term care services, challenging the economists' concept of demand, the clinicians' concept of need, and the policy analysts' concept of equity. Additional work is required to assess whether such a normalization process actually occurs and, if so, to explore its distribution, causes, correlates, and consequencesDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Aging StudiesIntroduction: Serving the needs of rural elders1991 • Dena ShenkDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Consumer Studies and Home EconomicsSatisfaction of disabled rural elders and adults with the quality of community-based long-term care services2001 • Jane KolodinskyDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Aging StudiesHealth and social service utilization patterns of Mexican American older adults1998 • Diana TorrezDownload Free PDFView PDFRural SociologySocial Capital in Rural and Urban Communities11998 • Sandra HofferthDownload Free PDFView PDFNutritional Self-Management of Elderly Widows in Rural Communities2000 • Mara VitolinsDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
