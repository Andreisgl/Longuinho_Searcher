Teaching – Learning – AssessmentPublished on Sep 19, 2011Kids educationFundacja Rozwoju Systemu EdukacjiFollow this publisherAboutWe are pleased to present the publication entitled Issues in multilingualism. Teaching, Learning, Assessment devoted to language teaching. We are thrilled that the book is published at the time of the Polish presidency of the Council of the European Union, whose top priorities n the field of education embrace the promotion of language learning, including less frequently used languages. Ensuring quality education at any level would not be possible if not for the command of foreign languages, modern and efficient language teaching methods, and the opportunities for exchange of experiences by partners coming from different countries f the European Union. Modern teacher training, raising the attractiveness f in-service training and grasping the opportunities resulting from educational mobility would also hardly be possible if not for the active use of foreign languages.More fromFundacja Rozwoju Systemu EdukacjiPolska Kadra EurosSkills 2023 GdańskAugust 28, 2023Europa dla Aktywnych nr 3/2023August 24, 2023Edukacja bez granic.
