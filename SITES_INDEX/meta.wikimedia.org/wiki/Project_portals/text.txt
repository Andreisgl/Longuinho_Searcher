[edit]
The central Wikimedia portal wikimedia.org and the multilingual portal pages provide central access to the Wikimedia projects. This page provides a list of the portals and information on how to update them.

Portal pages[edit]
These are the nine portals that currently exist for our multilingual projects, including the Wikimedia movement portal and API portal.
wikimedia.org
wikipedia.org
wikinews.org
wiktionary.org
wikiquote.org
wikiversity.org
wikibooks.org
wikivoyage.org
API listing: Action API (Application Programming Interface) and RESTBase documentation
Note that www.wikisource.org includes actual texts and is not just a portal for editions of Wikisource.
Statistics[edit]
Project portals get approximately 3 to 5% of our total page views. For instance, wikipedia.org gets 3% of page views from many countries, but 5% on average and as many as 33% in India. See the following links for more statistics.

Wikipedia.org Portal Traffic
Wikipedia.org[edit]
As a result of a poll in 2008, the ring of Top Ten Wikipedias in the wikipedia.org template is defined by number of views per hour, rather than the number of content pages.
As a result of a A/B test in 2016, the ring of Top Ten Wikipedias are now resorted automatically by the visitor's preferred language (as set by their web browser preferences). If the portal is unable to detect the visitor's preferred language, the remaining top ten Wikipedias will be displayed in the order of "page views per hour".
Updates to the statistics on the Wikipedia.org portal are performed approximately every two weeks and are tracked in this Phabricator task.
Updating portals[edit]
Starting in June 2016, the Portal team of the Discovery department at the Wikimedia Foundation is updating the Wikipedia.org portal. The team has performed a number of A/B tests and documents their changes and process on MediaWiki.org.
The Wikipedia.org portal code is hosted at https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/wikimedia/portals with a subdirectory for each version of the portal. All code is managed via Gerrit.
The data for the portals comes from https://pagecounts.toolforge.org/pagecounts.json. How the process works is described in https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/wikimedia/portals/+/refs/heads/master/data/ .
To request changes, create a task in Phabricator or discuss on the Wikipedia.org portal talk page.
As of November 2022, all projects now use the same system.
Bug reports and feature requests can be created in Phabricator or on the talk page for the Project Portals.
The Wikimedia portals are deployed to the production servers via a code management tool called Gerrit.
Portal code[edit]
The published code for the portals is hosted at https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/wikimedia/portals with each project's production code stored in the prod sub-directory. Use git to download a copy of the portal code. In a terminal window, enter the following command:
git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/wikimedia/portals
This clones the entire portals repository into a subdirectory named portals. If you would like to learn more about using git/gerrit there is a tutorial available on MediaWiki.org.
