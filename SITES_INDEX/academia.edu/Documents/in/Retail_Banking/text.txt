Many on-site banking services are now delivered through technology-based service delivery channels such as Self-Service Kiosks and Automat- ed Teller Machines. The quality of services offered by retail banks plays a key role in enhancing their market competitive positions. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for measuring qualities of traditional and automated on-site retail banking services. The authors carried out a comprehensive chronological review of literature, 36 papers, in service quality and service excellence, marketing and related topics. The review found a lack of distinctive frameworks for measuring on-site banking services delivered through traditional and automated channels.

Also investigated in the study is the intervening role of person-job fit in the process. Data collected from 530 frontline bank employees in New Zealand serve as the study setting. Results show that both customer orientation and servant leadership significantly reduce burnout and ultimately turnover intentions. Results also show that person-job fit mediates the influences of customer orientation and servant leadership on burnout and turnover intentions. Implications of the results are discussed and future research avenues are offered.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ömer Öter•  7  Marketing, Servant Leadership, Customer Orientation, Retail BankingCustomers’ adoption and use of e-banking services: the South African perspectiveSouth African retail banks, like retail banks elsewhere in the world, are investing significant amounts of capital into the provision of e-banking services in the hope that this will translate into higher returns and market penetration.... moreSouth African retail banks, like retail banks elsewhere in the world, are investing significant amounts of capital into the provision of e-banking services in the hope that this will translate into higher returns and market penetration. However, the rapid adoption of these e-banking services is still in doubt. Any strategy aimed at achieving widespread adoption and use of these e-banking services rests on solid understanding of factors that influence customers’ adoption and use of the services. This study adds trust in the e-banking system, customer awareness of e-banking services and perceived self-efficacy, together with the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and ease of use to improve the understanding of the predicators of Internet and cellphone banking services adoption in South Africa. For this study, a cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to obtain data from 394 customers of the four major retail banks in South Africa through self-administered questionnaires...Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Maduku•  7  Business, Adoption, Technology Acceptance, Retail BankingThe Importance of Perceived Service Value in Retail Banking ServicesPurpose – In many industries, perceived service value is found to be a significant mediator between perceived service quality and customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Therefore, this paper aims to test a conceptual model of perceived service value with its antecedents, such as perceived price and perceived service quality, and consequences, customer satisfaction and loyalty, in the retail banking industry. Design/Methodology/Approach – For the empirical study, a measurement instrument was developed and tested for validity and reliability. Measures were assessed with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). A structural model with five reflective constructs was evaluated to test direct and indirect relationships among constructs. Findings and implications – Results confirm a mediating role of perceived value in relationships between perceived price, perceived service quality, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty in the case of retail banking services. Limitations – Because the results are directly relevant only to customers and marketing managers of retail banking services, generalizations of the findings beyond the immediate population observed should be made with caution. Originality – This paper extends existing knowledge with both direct and indirect effects among researched concepts, and shows the importance of perceived service value in achieving satisfied and loyal customers in retail banking services.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jasmina  Dlacic•Retail BankingEuropean banking: An overviewSave to LibraryDownloadby John O.

Technological innovations, along with changes to the preferences of the modern customer open up the way to a digitalised world. Banking services and delivery channels go through an enormous shift from traditional non-digitalised processes supported by bank employees, to fully online and self- serviced; rendering physical branches and employees vastly redundant. This research aims to examine this evolution by analysing the technological and sociological factors that have contributed to it, including advances in mobile telephony and online data management, as well as customer trends of reducing visits to physical branches and liaising with bank employees.This thesis further illustrates how, with the use of cloud technology, big data analysis and internet of things devices, the transformation of financial institutions fostered the rise of tech-savvy start-ups, which are widely known as fintech companies. It also examines the effort made by traditional banking institutions to catch up with this new environment, by introducing mobile banking services that substitute their physical services. This thesis will also analyse some of the novel services provided by these start-ups including new ways of account management, mobile payments and wallets, cryptocurrency trading, P2P lending, AI robots, etc. Lastly, this research analyses the demographic characteristics of the customers adopting these novel services, as well as the regulations applied in the EU and UK in which financial and non-financial institutions operate in.The research concludes that the future of banking is characterised by innovative services and products offered online which, however, would need to be supported by a regulatory framework, able to eliminate entry barriers for newcomers in the banking sector.Save to LibraryDownloadby Antonios Kalaitzakis•  9  Mobile Technology, Banking, Mobile Banking, Retail
