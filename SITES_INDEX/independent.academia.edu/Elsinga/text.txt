The first section considers social investment in relation to four policy areas: early childhood education and care, housing, financial services and water. The second part of the report provides an overview of social investment and disinvestment trends in the healthcare system in Italy since the 1990s. This section includes a detailed account of service users&#39; and professionals&#39; experiences of the impact of liberalisation and austerity measures on health service delivery drawing on qualitative data collection. Throughout the report we identify policy recommendations to address the effects and impacts of emergent trends towards social disinvestment and liberalisation of public services. This study is part of the wider pan-European RE-InVEST project to investigate the impact of the EU Social Investment package on marginalised groups since the 2007 crisis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It identifies which regional housing markets are influenced by house price movements in Amsterdam. Design/methodology/approach The paper considers the ripple effect as a lead-lag effect and a long-run convergence between the Amsterdam and regional house prices. Using the real house prices for second-hand owner-occupied dwellings from 1995q1 to 2016q2, the paper adopts the Toda–Yamamoto Granger Causality approach to study the lead-lag effects. It uses the autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL)-Bounds cointegration techniques to examine the long-run convergence between the regional and the Amsterdam house prices. The paper controls for house price fundamentals to eliminate possible confounding effects of common shocks. Findings The cumulative evidence suggests that Amsterdam house prices have influence on (or ripple to) all the Dutch regions,...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A Network Perspective on the Organization of Social Housing in the Netherlands: the Case of Urban Renewal in The HagueHousing, Theory and Society,  2007ABSTRACT In the past 15 years Dutch housing associations have undergone a transformation from str... more ABSTRACT In the past 15 years Dutch housing associations have undergone a transformation from strictly regulated and heavily subsidized organizations to financially and administratively independent enterprises. This transformation has sparked a lively debate on regulation and the role of the government in social housing. There is a broad consensus that something needs to be done about the operations of housing associations in the Netherlands. Hence, their position and performance are a current topic of discussion in the Dutch Parliament. In this paper we examine public management from a network perspective. We envisage the policy environment as a network of players and explore three key concepts: “multiformity”, “closed‐ness” and “interdependence”. The government is not the dominant party in this scenario, but one of several players with their own specific goals and resources. To be sure of a good performance, instruments of governance need to be in tune with the characteristics of the network. This paper discusses the instruments applied in the Dutch social housing network and uses the results of a case study in The Hague to illustrate the efficacy of the network perspective in social housing analyses and to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the current governance structure.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In lieu of this, the two main institutions through which government provided and managed public housing – the TDC and SHC sold off most of their dwellings. The few remaining dwellings were transferred to local authorities to own and manage. There have been concerns about the poor management of public housing by local authorities, with commentators calling for sale of the remaining stock. Unfortunately, not much research has sought to identify and address the weaknesses in the management of public rental housing. This paper reports on a study that investigated the weaknesses of public rental housing management by local authorities. It examined the existing structure for public housing management using the ‘7S’ model as an analytical framework. The study collected data through interviews with professionals, local authority managers and tenants.

Inclusionary Housing: An Evaluation of a New Public Rental Housing Governance Instrument in ChinaLand,  2021Inclusionary housing (IH) is a regulatory instrument adopted by local governments in many countri... more Inclusionary housing (IH) is a regulatory instrument adopted by local governments in many countries to produce affordable housing by capturing resources created through the marketplace. In order to assess whether it is efficient, scholarly attention has been widely focused on its evaluation. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating IH from a governance perspective. Since IH is about involving private actors in affordable housing production, the governance point of view of cooperating governmental and non-governmental actors governing society to achieve societal goals is highly relevant. The two most important elements of governance—actors and interrelationships among these actors—are taken to build an analytical framework to explore and evaluate the governance of IH. Based on a research approach that combines a literature review and a case study of China, this paper concludes that the ineffective governance of Chinese IH is based on three challenges: (1) The distribution of co...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Even though descriptions of the governance results are numerous, the previous studies are not underpinned by a theoretical foundation from a governance perspective, nor have they empirically examined whether PRH governance works on the ground. This explorative and empirical paper aims to fill this gap of an outcome-oriented evaluation of the impacts of governance as perceived by the final user. Central government formulated the objective for PRH governance as maintaining stability in the society. Whether the tenants perceive the goal of social stability as achieved was measured along three governance outcome dimensions: satisfaction with housing quality, satisfaction with housing quantity, and willingness to communicate with the government about PRH governance. Data were collected from questionnaires to PRH-tenants in Chongqing,...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nederland voerde omvangrijke bezuinigingen door waarbij het systeem van sociale zekerheid werd hervormd. Er kwam een sterkere nadruk te liggen op het stimuleren van werken en het moeilijker maken van de toegang tot zorgvoorzieningen mede door het aanscherpen van de voorwaarden. Met de recessies van 2012 en 2013 ook achter de rug, zijn in de praktijk de aantallen uitkeringsontvangers toegenomen en is ook de armoede gestegen.

This approach is regarded as an alternative to the needs-based approach of paternalistic welfare states in Europe and seems to match well with the ambitions of the European Commission ‘to show a more social face’ and the Dutch government to make the participation society work. The RE-InVEST project 1 aimed to both advance theoretical thinking as well as empirical testing of the capability approach. The RE-InVEST philosopher team developed an application of three anthropological roles that a human being can adopt: the doer, the receiver and the judge (Bonvin and Laruffa, 2017a; Bonvin and Laruffa 2017b).

Homes constitute the largest single land use in the ‘built environment’, they are generally the largest single item of expenditure in household budgets and the largest form of household wealth, and they are instrumental in our social networks and our psychological wellbeing. The scale and extent of the connections have complex impacts on, and are impacted by, both the demand for and supply of labour and the socio-ecological transition. The ageing of European populations, for example, will continue to influence the demand for housing in terms of location, size and services, which in turn will create jobs in construction, raw material acquisition and delivery, infrastructure (ranging from roads to medical services) and transaction activities (such as legal services, new furniture and fittings).

The barriers to sustainability measures in general and NZEBs in particular have been extensively explored by academic literature and despite different research scopes, perspectives, locations and times, previous studies have reached similar outcomes. Similar barriers were perceived by different housing professionals in different geographic contexts and these same barriers also persisted through time. This study argues that while this could be interpreted as a validation of outcomes, it also underlines a limitation resulting from a general level of analysis. Thus, this study contributes to the discussion by adopting a context-specific approach in its investigation of barriers to near zero-energ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This drives mass demolition and reconstruction and leaves a short lifespan of existing buildings through unsustainable urban renewal. Many developed countries/regions, such as the UK and Hong Kong, have long history of urban renewal. The urban renewal governance has shifted from government-led to broad participation. However, a lack of compatible governance causes the unsustainability during the urban renewal process in China.

This included local performance agreements for social housing policy obtaining a legal status.
