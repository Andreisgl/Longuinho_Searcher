OBA Foundation's EDI Statement
The OBA Foundation is committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion as essential elements of the justice system. We believe the justice system is strongest when it embraces and reflects all individuals it serves. Accordingly, the Foundation’s priority is to support and fund equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives and projects within the justice system, including within the legal profession. The Foundation encourages organizations and individuals to apply who serve historically-excluded, equity-seeking groups identified by: race, ancestry, place of origin, skin colour, ethnicity, faith, citizenship, sexual orientation, gender or gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability.
