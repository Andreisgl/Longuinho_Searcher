She remains, on one level, a feminine muse, the inspiration for masculine creativity and national progress, but lacks herself the qualities that define the romantic and modern conceptions of the artistic genius. On another level, though, this New Woman acquired signifiers of action and confidence that seem distinctly different from images of Victorian restraint.

Her form of online theater, played out in the multi-user environments known as MOOs, involves scenario-based, episodic, directed verbal improvisation by a small group of performers. This hybrid of theater and fiction exploits the fact that what is perceived as very low tech in the computer world (text) is paradoxically a high-bandwidth medium for exploration as a quasi-literary, quasi-dramatic character. Interestingly this online performance shows a marked leaning toward the shadow side of the psyche. Our familiar Aristotelian theater is ego-centric, marked by our desire for controlled rhythms, careful deployment of detail, tight structure, and neat denouement. Online theater is, by contrast, id-centric, marked by loose structure, tangled narrative, chaotic rhythm, superfluous detail, and refusal to end.Download Free PDFView PDFRespectable Vamp: A Black Feminist Analysis of Florence Mills' Career in Early Vaudeville Theatre 2012 • Zakiya R.

I posit that their creation of diegetic alter egos demonstrates how the subjective splitting once attributed to hysteria has become a postmodern norm. This mainstreaming of hysteria arose in the wake of the demystification of the modernist notion of the sovereign subject as well as the supplantation of reality with simulacral images. These two developments have resulted in a cultural shift characterized by the notion that subjectivity is a performance of the self as a series of simulacral images devoid of any original referent. Though hysteria is widely perceived to be an antiquated relic of the nineteenth-century fin-de-siècle, I argue that the mimetic condition epitomizes postmodern subjective shifts. Identity, like the ostensibly obsolete malady, is a performance of subjective lack projected upon the surface of the body. This void manifests as dissociative split selves produced by way of hysterical identifications in which the self is (con)fused with an other. As with hysterics, Walker, Barney, and Sherman pose themselves to viewers as a question. By implication, they ask audiences to diagnose or fix their protean symptoms and identities. Thus, viewers, like clinicians, are hystericized in the process of attempting to convert performative displays of discordant and ahistorical symptoms into coherent narratives and stable identities. These artists’ alter egos compel us to recognize ourselves as similarly fragmented and mimetic subjects. In the postmodern era, binaristic conceptions of race, gender, and sexuality have become more fluid. This subjective mutability is the result of widespread recognition that identities are performative. Presenting oneself as raced and gendered in accordance with established codes reifies the ideologies that motivated the performances in the first place. While postmodernism has seen the efflorescence of posts – post-racial, post-feminist, post-human – we are hardly free of the instinct to categorize others. Thus, we live in an intriguing moment in which identities are seen as fluid and evolving yet we cannot seem to relinquish the notions of racial and sexual difference. However, these artists suggest that we are moving toward the possibility of abolishing such divisive identity categorical criteria and are beginning to formulate alternative means of defining ourselves in relation to others.Download Free PDFView PDFSeeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film. University of Illinois Press. (Supported by an Australian Academy of the Humanities Grant; winner of Choice Outstanding Academic title (2016)2015 • victoria duckettThis book explores the most famous stage actress of the nineteenth century, Sarah Bernhardt. Bernhardt enjoyed a surprising renaissance when the 1912 multi-reel film Queen Elizabeth brought her international acclaim. The triumph capped her already lengthy involvement with cinema while enabling the indefatigable actress to reinvent herself in an era of technological and generational change. Placing Bernhardt at the center of the industry's first two decades, Victoria Duckett challenges the perception of her as an anachronism unable to appreciate film's qualities. Instead, cinema's substitution of translated title cards for her melodic French deciphered Bernhardt for Anglo-American audiences. It also allowed the aging actress to appear in the kinds of longer dramas she could no longer physically sustain onstage. As Duckett shows, Bernhardt contributed far more than star quality. Her theatrical practice on film influenced how the young medium changed the visual and performing arts. Her promoting of experimentation, meanwhile, shaped the ways audiences looked at and understood early cinema. A leading-edge reappraisal of a watershed era, Seeing Sarah Bernhardt tells the story of an icon who bridged two centuries--and changed the very act of watching film.Download Free PDFView PDFPatriotic Acts of Consumption: Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon) and the Vaudeville Fashion Show Craze2008 • Marlis SchweitzerDownload Free PDFView PDFSister Aimee's Dutch Swan Song2009 • Tom FishDownload Free PDFView PDFAmsterdam University PressThe Cinema of Attractions Reloaded2006 • Wanda StrauvenDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
