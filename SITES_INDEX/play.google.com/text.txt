The app overall is excellent, the random article button offers a dangerous game to play if you have any plans of being productive, and the ability to easily curate a personal collection of articles is very nice. My only gripe so far is the apparent lack of a "return to main page" button. If you fall down a rabbit hole, be ready to click the back button a lot.287 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSoni Jasmore_vert Flag inappropriateAugust 24, 2023We got a project in school for the research of Chandrayan 1, Chandrayan 2, and Chandrayan 3. And this application was my only hope, it gives us in-depth knowledge of a particular topic. I loved the concept of themes, we can't use light theme for extended periods, but we can switch it to dark mode, impressive! If a word is confusing me, I would just double click and the definition will be under my fingers. Definitely useful application, you should download this. Thankyou very much for this app...22 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAnjal Jaiswalmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyAugust 25, 2023It's good it's free and it can almost tell articles for everything.
