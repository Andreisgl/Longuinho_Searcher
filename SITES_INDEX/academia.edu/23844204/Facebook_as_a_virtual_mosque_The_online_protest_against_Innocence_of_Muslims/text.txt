The study builds on Anderson's concept of 'imagined communities' and argues that Facebook provides the platform for an online nation in which users, whether Canadians or prospective immigrants, interact and exchange ideas about a country whose imagined concept varies from one user to another. Facebook here is a virtual nation that offers the community members an imagined sense of identity and belonging which they aspire to get. The results of the study revealed that the majority of comments carry highly positive sentiments towards Canada and its people, yet there is evidence that some comments are moderated. The study concludes that the Facebook administrator functions as a centralized gatekeeper who filters online chatter and leads the discussion to a certain direction. Building on the theory of networked gatekeep-ing, the study argues that vertical and horizontal flows of communication shape the online debate that takes place in this virtual space. Through a close analysis of these practices , the article sheds light on the role of social media in shaping online identities constructed around virtual nationhood.Download Free PDFView PDFVideo games, terrorism, and ISIS's Jihad 3.0Ahmed Al-RawiThis study discusses different media strategies followed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In particular, the study attempts to understand the way ISIS's video game that is called " Salil al-Sawarem " (The Clanging of the Swords) has been received by the online Arab public. The article argues that the goal behind making and releasing the video game was to gain publicity and attract attention to the group, and the general target was young people. The main technique used by ISIS is what I call " troll, flame, and engage. " The results indicate that the majority of comments are against ISIS and its game, though most of the top ten videos are favorable towards the group. The sectarian dimension between Sunnis and Shiites is highly emphasized in the online exchanges, and YouTube remains an active social networking site that is used by ISIS followers and sympathizers to promote the group and recruit others.Download Free PDFView PDFMediated Conflict: Shiite Heroes Combating ISIS in Iraq and SyriaAhmed Al-RawiThis article analyzes a number of Shiite media productions in Iraq in order to investigate the significance of heroism and religious symbols during a time of heightened sectarian tension. Many of the popular heroes and symbols discussed here have direct and indirect connotations that extend beyond the national boundaries of individual countries, especially since the regional sectarian conflict is very dominant. The article relies on YouTube videos and screenshots taken from a variety of sources and argues that these symbols, heroes, and media productions play an important role in propagating popular political and religious beliefs that contribute toward the solidification of a distinctly Iraqi Shiite Ummah identity whose shared values demarcate them from the rest of the society. This article deals with some of the implicit and explicit meanings of symbols and heroes such as Abu Deraa, Abu Azrael, and General Suleimani that have emerged as central figures in the Shiite media productions at the current time of sectarian tensions in Iraq. For the purpose of this article, symbols such as figures and narratives will be the focus of the discussion. The study relies on a variety of online sources that are found on social media, especially YouTube and Facebook as well as a few online articles that carry Shiite symbols and deal with the current fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). These online sources provide indications that there is a distinct Shiite Ummah whose shared values and popular beliefs are highlighted in different media productions and are clearly distinguished from the rest of the Islamic world. Aside from the actual physical fight against ISIS, there is also a mediated war that is waged on different media outlets as well as on social media platforms, video games, and mobile apps (Al-Rawi, 2016a). Indeed, this kind of mediated experience is not only limited to the Iraqi context but also extends to other aspects of our daily livesDownload Free PDFView PDFFraming the online women's movements in the Arab worldAhmed Al-RawiThe events of the Arab Spring led to several reforms in the Arab world and facilitated the creation of feminist movements. Social networking sites such as Facebook were used as tools to promote this kind of online activism and create a collective secular identity for the members of these movements. This study investigated over 220,000 Facebook posts and comments taken from three online feminist movements which supported gender equality in the Arab world. The results show that these movements sometimes face fierce resistance from Islamists who believe that their religion is under attack. Instead of having one type of poster and commentator, three main online groups are identified; each one competes to garner attention and support from the public.Download Free PDFView PDFFaith, Freedom and Phobia, The Companion, November page 13-14Omair AnasDownload Free PDFView PDFAdvances in Consumer Research, V. 40, eds.

The study contributes to consumer activism literature by highlighting the role of religious discourse and authorities as market-structuring forces.Download Free PDFView PDFAssessing public sentiments and news preferences on Al Jazeera and Al ArabiyaAhmed Al-RawiThis article investigates the online comments made by Arab Facebook users on news items posted on the Facebook pages of two very popular TV channels: Al-Jazeera Arabic and Al-Arabiya. This study employs different methods to closely examine over 620,000 comments posted on the two Facebook pages as well as studying the most commented on news stories from a total of 11,685 news reports. The results indicate that commentators expressed some dominant sentiments that are mostly in line with the TV channels' coverage of certain events, while certain news topics attracted most of the online public's comments especially on Al Jazeera channel. This research study investigates the online public comments posted on two Facebook pages that belong to two well-known TV channels in the Arab world. There are no previous studies that examined this aspect of social networking sites (SNS) use; there are no other studies that investigated comments in Arabic in such a large scale despite the fact that they have significant importance as part of audience sentiments toward news stories. The theoretical framework of this research article is based on the selective exposure theory, and this study offers a novel approach in examining the social media audiences of TV stations since previous studies have been largely focused onDownload Free PDFView PDFSectarianism and the Arab Spring: Framing the popular protests in Bahrain.2015 • Ahmed Al-RawiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
