Adopting plug-in electric vehicles (EV) would reduce light motor vehicle travel emissions, a significant and rising emissions source. To encourage EV uptake, many governments have implemented policies which may be less effective than desired. Using New Zealand as a case study, we surveyed private motorists. The results show that consumers are heterogeneous, with varying car-buying motivations, perceptions, attitudes to EVs and awareness of policies. Uniquely, we segmented motorists into four attitudinal groups to ascertain characteristics potentially affecting EV readiness to provide evidence to improve policies and aid social marketing. Our results show the next-most-ready to buy EVs are early mainstream consumers—designated the EV Positives—who were most concerned about vehicle range, perceptions of EV expense, charging-related inconvenience and the unknown value proposition of batteries, and were relatively ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Integration of remote-sensing based metrics and econometric models to assess the socio-economic contributions of carbon sequestration in unmanaged tropical dry forestsEnvironmental and Sustainability Indicators,  2021Abstract Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the gl... more Abstract Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-benefits of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-benefits of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic benefits. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efficiency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a benefit transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration’s monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 ​± ​3.3 tCO2 ha-1 yr-1 or in total, 1.16 GtCO2. The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ​ha-1 ​yr-1 to USD 2828 ​ha-1 ​yr-1. These results can open new perspectives regarding the benefits of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Switching from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EV) would significantly reduce most countries’ emissions, but for many consumers perceived barriers deter EV adoption. Consequently, government policies designed to incentivise a transition to EVs could benefit from consideration of the utility of communication channels such as print media for influencing consumer behaviour. This research explores the role that media and other communication channels writing about EVs play in consumer perceptions and awareness of government-initiated programs and policies to incentivise EV market transition. Using mixed methods of a media review and New Zealand car buyer surveys (questionnaires, interviews) (n = 893), we identified car buyers’ media use to update knowledge about cars, perceptions about EVs, and likelihood to buy, and tested awareness and popularity of incentiv...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Accurate information over burned areas (BA) is essential for governments and communities to prioritize recovery actions. Prior research over the past decades has established the potentials and limitations of space-borne earth observation for mapping BA over large geographic areas at various scales. The operational deployment of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 constellations significantly improved the quality and quantity of the imagery from the microwave (C-band) and optical regions on the spectrum. Based on that, this study set to investigate whether the existing coarse BA products can be further improved by the synergy of optical surface reflectance (SR), radar backscatter coefficient (BS), and/or radar interferometric coherence (COR) data with higher spatial resolutions. A Siamese Self-Attention (SSA) classification strategy is proposed for the multi-sensor BA mapping and a multi-source dataset is constructed at the object level for the training and testing. Results are analyzed by test sites, feature sources, and classification strategies to appraise the improvements achieved by the proposed method.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using data collected on a monthly basis over 30 years (1985–2015) at 14 stations located along the Lower Mekong river, this study explores whether spatiotemporal relationships exist between LULC changes and instream concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrate—as proxies of water quality. The results show seasonal influences where temporal patterns of instream TSS and nitrate concentrations mirror patterns detected for discharge. Changes in LULC influenced instream TSS and nitrate levels differently over time and space.

This l... more Carbon farming is a new land use option over extensive areas of the Australian rangelands. This land use change has been promoted by government incentives to mitigate climate change, with most of Australia’s land sector abatement to date being delivered in rangelands. Aside from these mitigation benefits, carbon farming has also demonstrated potential co-benefits that enhance socio-ecological resilience by diversifying land uses and income streams, providing opportunities for sustainable land management to enhance soil and vegetation and creating opportunities for self-organisation and collaboration. However, factors such as policy uncertainty, perceived loss of future land use flexibility and the potential for carbon farming eligibility to create social divisions may negatively affect resilience. In this paper we weigh up these risks, opportunities and co-benefits and propose indicators for measuring the impact of carbon farming on the resilience of rangeland systems.

The development of efficient management plans is critical to the implementation success of the framework; in this regard, unresolved challenges remain for measuring the effectiveness of planning plans and monitoring implementation progress. This paper describes the development of a Bayesian Belief Network as a prototype Decision Support Tool to assist coastal planning in the catchment areas of the Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia. The model was co-designed with local managers, underpinned by the Drivers-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses analytical framework to identify key coastal cause-effect relationships, and by the Recreational Opportunity Spectrum framework to account for significant recreational areas. The Bayesian Belief Network was structured on a conceptualisation of the relationships between key pressures affecting coastal management targets (biological areas and human activities) and their impacts on the state of the variables, with emphasis on the beach ecosystem. The socio-economic component of the model consists of predictive socio-economic modelling on preferred beach activities, the assessment of beach recreational settings, and a beach quality survey. Conditional probability tables were derived from local and regional databases. The model structure allows decision makers enhanced understanding of key interactions between management variables, assessment of management scenarios, and increased accountability of planning decisions. Future work on the prototype could expand the model to become a Bayesian Decision Network, through the integration of proposed management actions and their utilities, thereby helping managers identify optimal decisions.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Improved understanding of the status, trend, and consequences of land changes is relevant to the engagement of Land System Science (LSS) in transformations for sustainability. While remote sensing has been a major tool for documenting land cover change, new opportunities are emerging to understand land as a socio-ecological system by integrating crowd-sourced social sensing data (e.g. through mobile technologies). Increased access to remote sensing time series and social sensing data are improving mapping of land and providing new information on the coupled social-ecological system for better land governance. Given advances in data availability and machine learning algorithms, land mapping efforts have evolved to more sophisticated analysis strategies. In addition, the emergence of planetary-scale geospatial analysis platforms facilitates regional and global land change monitoring in a rapid, scalable, and convenient way. This review aims to document current status and prospects on data, algorithms, and processing platforms in the era of ‘Big Earth Data’, providing examples of how it can contribute to LSS at the interface of normative and policy concerns, including those in support of internationally agreed environmental goals and land governance.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Government action to correct insufficient market incentives has been essential in countries working to enhance EV acceptance; however, to date in Australia, there has been little government support to enact EV uptake. This paper identifies barriers and incentives to EV adoption in Australia through a survey of pro-environmental motorists, including an experimental component to test information provision influences on attitude change. Results evidence that wide ranging factors influence vehicle choice including EVs. Purchase barriers are focused on lack of a comprehensive recharge network and high EV purchase price. Factors encouraging fully EV uptake showed affordable price (56%) increased vehicle ra...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Environmental mainstreaming and policy coherence: essential policy tools to link international agreements with national development—a case study of the Caribbean regionEnvironment, Development and Sustainability,  2017The 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted in September 2015 advocates for a balanced in... more The 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted in September 2015 advocates for a balanced integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Existing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) can provide guidance for policy-makers to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, within safe ecological limits. This paper presents a practical approach to mainstream international obligations of MEAs with national development priorities and strategies. It identifies pathways of policy coherence from national strategies to specific instruments and indicators to advance implementation of MEAs and help counties to fulfill agreed obligations. The approach is grounded in the driving forces–pressure–state–impact–response (DPSIR) framework, and it was applied in two national and two regional case studies in the Caribbean. The outcomes from the case studies show that mainstreaming rate of MEAs is low, and linkages across multiple MEAs are rarely considered. The DPSIR framework was useful for addressing national development priorities and those of MEAs in tandem, through adopting a cross-sectoral, multistakeholder perspective. The research shows that addressing environmental degradation and improving MEAs’ implementation requires that international and regional agencies identify linkages among MEAs to assist in creating policy coherence to ensure their integration into national strategies by connecting with policies and strategies in tandem implementation of MEAs for national policy-makers to work with.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The challenge now becomes one of addressing its operation, in order to achieve these new policy goals and targets by the year 2030. Advancing LDN demands attention to what the concept seeks to achieve, as well as unravelling the perspectives of the key multi-lateral environmental agreements through which progress can be made. The three Rio Conventions (the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)) all play key roles in shaping the international LDN governance and implementation context. Their different but related foci create a number of challenges and opportunities for advancing LDN.

The goal of the SPI is to facilitate a two-way dialogue between scientists and policy makers in order to ensure the delivery of policy-relevant information, knowledge and advice on desertification/land degradation and drought (DLDD). The SPI established several initial objectives, including working with the scientific community to bring to the UNCCD and the other Rio conventions (climate change and biodiversity) the scientific evidence for the contribution of sustainable land use and management to climate change adaptation/mitigation and to safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper identifies barriers and incentives to EV adoption in Australia through a survey of pro-environmental motorists, including an experimental component to test information provision influences on attitude change. Results evidence that wide ranging factors influence vehicle choice including EVs. Purchase barriers are focused on lack of a comprehensive recharge network and high EV purchase price. Factors encouraging fully EV uptake showed affordable price (56%) increased vehicle ra...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Environmental mainstreaming and policy coherence: essential policy tools to link international agreements with national development—a case study of the Caribbean regionEnvironment, Development and Sustainability,  2017The 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted in September 2015 advocates for a balanced in... more The 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted in September 2015 advocates for a balanced integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Existing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) can provide guidance for policy-makers to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, within safe ecological limits. This paper presents a practical approach to mainstream international obligations of MEAs with national development priorities and strategies. It identifies pathways of policy coherence from national strategies to specific instruments and indicators to advance implementation of MEAs and help counties to fulfill agreed obligations. The approach is grounded in the driving forces–pressure–state–impact–response (DPSIR) framework, and it was applied in two national and two regional case studies in the Caribbean. The outcomes from the case studies show that mainstreaming rate of MEAs is low, and linkages across multiple MEAs are rarely considered. The DPSIR framework was useful for addressing national development priorities and those of MEAs in tandem, through adopting a cross-sectoral, multistakeholder perspective. The research shows that addressing environmental degradation and improving MEAs’ implementation requires that international and regional agencies identify linkages among MEAs to assist in creating policy coherence to ensure their integration into national strategies by connecting with policies and strategies in tandem implementation of MEAs for national policy-makers to work with.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Unpacking the concept of land degradation neutrality and addressing its operation through the Rio ConventionsJournal of environmental management,  Jan 22, 2016The world&#39;s commitment towards land degradation neutrality (LDN) became enshrined in various ... more The world&#39;s commitment towards land degradation neutrality (LDN) became enshrined in various international agreements and decisions throughout the year 2015. The challenge now becomes one of addressing its operation, in order to achieve these new policy goals and targets by the year 2030. Advancing LDN demands attention to what the concept seeks to achieve, as well as unravelling the perspectives of the key multi-lateral environmental agreements through which progress can be made. The three Rio Conventions (the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)) all play key roles in shaping the international LDN governance and implementation context. Their different but related foci create a number of challenges and opportunities for advancing LDN. In this paper we critically analyze the literature to elucidate potential challenges and opportunities in moving LDN towards implem...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The UNCCD Science-Policy Interface (SPI) -Exploring the sustainable land management nexus among the Rio ConventionsAt its 11th meeting in Windhoek/Namibia, in September 2013, the United Nations Convention to Comb... more At its 11th meeting in Windhoek/Namibia, in September 2013, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Conference of the Parties (COP) decided to establish a Science-Policy Interface (SPI)* (decision 23/COP.11). The goal of the SPI is to facilitate a two-way dialogue between scientists and policy makers in order to ensure the delivery of policy-relevant information, knowledge and advice on desertification/land degradation and drought (DLDD). The SPI established several initial objectives, including working with the scientific community to bring to the UNCCD and the other Rio conventions (climate change and biodiversity) the scientific evidence for the contribution of sustainable land use and management to climate change adaptation/mitigation and to safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
América Latina y el Caribe: Atlas de un Ambiente en Transformaciónby Emilio Sempris and Graciela  MetternichtAmérica Latina y el Caribe: Atlas de un Ambiente en Transformación,  2010El Atlas de un Ambiente en Transformación recopila más de 200 imagenes que muestran los principal... more El Atlas de un Ambiente en Transformación recopila más de 200 imagenes que muestran los principales problemas ambientales de la región.   Mucho más que un libro de mapas, esta publicación supone el primer esfuerzo de análisis de las transformaciones que está experimentando el medio ambiente de la región, combinando precisas y espectaculares imágenes con el análisis de datos rigurosos. Las imágienes aquí recopiladas permiten observar la riqueza y diversidad de ambientes, ecosistemas, especies y paisajes de la región.  Pero también muestran como esta riqueza natural y humana se encuentra actualemente muy presionada por las pautas del los modelos de desarrollo económico predominantes, que aunque han generado recimiento económico, han producido cambios sociales y ambientales importantes.Este Atlas constituye una herramienta imprescindible para refleccionar sobre las acciones futuras de las políticas públicas necesarias para hacer realidad un desarrollo más sostenible.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
