I studied Classics and Classical Archaeology at the University of Padua. I have a BA/MA in Roman Archaeology (2002), a post-graduate diploma of Specialization in Archaeology (2005) and a PhD in Ancient History (2009, Verona University). Before joining Verona University, I worked in the UK from 2012 to 2021. I was at the British Museum Department of Coins and Medals as a Newton International Fellow (2012-2013) and as a Leverhulme Trust Project Curator (2014-2017). I then joined Warwick University, Department of Classics and Ancient History, to work on the Leverhulme research project The Materiality of Graeco-Roman Festivals from 22017 to 2020. In Italy I worked as a researcher for Civic and State Museums (Verona, Venice, Piacenza, Rovereto and Brescia) to study and catalogue their collections of Greek and Roman coins from 2003 to 2011, and since 2010 I have been in charge of publishing the collections of Roman Provincial coins of the National Museum in Rome. I was also teaching assistant in Numismatics from 2004 and 2011 at the Universities of Verona and Padua. In the UK I taught classes and seminars at King's College Department of Archaeology, at the UCL Department of History (2013-2014) and at Warwick University, Department of Classics and Ancient History (2017-2020). My field experience includes excavating at Nora and St. Antioco in Sardegna, at Montegrotto Terme in Veneto and at Grumentum in Basilicata, where I was a Member of the Scientific Committee of the Archaeological Mission in the Roman Forum in 2006-2011. I was a member of the council of the Royal Numismatic Society from 2013 to 2016 and of the council of the Roman Society from 2017 to 2020.Address: Verona UniversityDepartment of Cultures and CivilisationsViale dell'Università, Polo Zanotto 2.1037121 Verona (ITALY)less604 Followers401 Following2 Co-authorsTotal Views ;1 Public MentionFollowFollowingall5 Books37 Papers3 Papers in Magazines5 Book Reviews1 ExhibitionsMore  2 Conference Presentations10 Talks1 Seminars1 Teaching Documents1 Book LaunchBooksDefacing the Past.

It aims to narrate how the images of Roman emperors could be attacked and subverted for political and ideological reasons, illustrating the objects of the museum collection that have inspired the show in London alongside a broad range of other examples from different sources and provenances from across the Roman world. The book is intended for a wider audience than just the specialists of the ancient world. It aims especially at considering a broad range of available sources, literary, epigraphic, archaeological and papyrological, but with special emphasis on coins; it focuses on the evidence from the imperial provinces from the 1st to the 3rd century AD; and it discusses examples of defacement of the past resulting not only from the condemnation of the memory of individuals but also from acts of opposition to political power.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nicopolis d'Epiro. Nuovi studi sulla zecca e sulla produzione monetale, BAR S2214, Oxford 2011The city of Nicopolis (Epirus, northern Greece) was founded by Augustus to mark his victory over ... more The city of Nicopolis (Epirus, northern Greece) was founded by Augustus to mark his victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra in 31 BC at the nearby Battle of Actium. The city flourished during the period of the Roman empire and its civic coinage was one of the most important and most interesting of the empire. It continued in production for over 250 years from the reign of Augustus to that of Gallienus. It has many unusual features, such as the very rare silver coins produced for the emperor Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina, and, more particularly, the long series of coins with the name and portrait of Augustus. It was originally thought that they were all produced during Augustus’ reign, but it is now known that, even though their exact chronology is difficult, they were minted for most of the time that the mint was active. This new study builds on existing scholarship but establishes a new level of understanding of the mint. The author has been able to find many new specimens of the coinage, often with previously unknown designs, and has found much new important material which was previously unknown in both Italian and Greek museums. The new collection of material is incorporated in a new and well-illustrated catalogue. The catalogue is accompanied by a series of analytical chapters that place the coinage very securely in the context of our literary and archaeological knowledge of Nicopolis, and which analyse how it can contribute to our understanding of Roman provincial coinage – its rhythm of production, its extent of circulation, its pattern of denominations and its iconography. The discussion is based on a very full understanding of the coinage and of the literature concerning other provincial coinages and will make a very lasting contribution, not just to the understanding of the coinage of Nicopolis and of ancient Achaea, but also of the problems and issues of the Roman provincial coinage more generally.

The focus of this study is the imagery designed to express his relation with the divine through the overlapping representations of the emperor as a devotee and peer of the gods, and as a divine being. The first part of the study compares Rome to Asia Minor to show divergences as well as possible links between provincial and metropolitan media, discussing local and imperial responses to the emperor governing from the Roman East. The second part focuses on the imagery introduced in Asia Minor to represent the worship of the living Roman emperor and his cult-image in particular, providing insights into the creation of extraordinary visual patterns that remained unique to the reign of Caracalla.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Andrea, in the Regione Trentino in Northern Italy. The unearthed masonry structures in the dig areas named A and B are parts of a late antique-early medieval forti ed settlement (castrum), characterized by a sequence of different build- ing phases going back to the 6th and 7th centuries. Many  nds belonging to weaponry and soldiers equipment suggest that this site, strategically located along the ancient route going from the Adige Valley to the North Garda Lake, was settled for military reasons and housed soldiers with their families.A total amount of 90 coins has been found, mainly consisting of late Roman bronze specimens which served as local small change currency; Gothic and Byzantine coins in silver and gold are also well attested, offering a very representative view of integration of old 4th-5th centuries issues in the trimetallic 6th century monetary system, as well of their re-use within the Lom- bard society.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Because this evidence is extremely poor and Paulina was almost entirely regarded by the ancient sources as a ‘Diva’, scholars have traditionally believed that she was already dead when Maximinus became emperor. However this assumption is almost entirely based on information gathered from Roman imperial sources. In fact the analysis of the very rare inscriptions and coins from the provinces suggests that Paulina may have been honoured as a still living Augusta in the East and that the traditional view about her cultural and social background can be challenged.Cette étude propose un réexamen de l’ensemble des sources (littéraires, épi- graphiques et numismatiques) disponibles à propos de Diva Caecilia Paulina, femme de l’empereur Maximin le Thrace. En raison de l’extrême rareté des sources la concernant et compte tenu du fait que les auteurs anciens l’évoquent quasi-exclusivement en tant de « Diva », les chercheurs ont généralement considéré que Paulina était déjà décédée au moment où Maximin prit le pouvoir. Toutefois, cette idée se fonde essentiellement sur l’étude des sources de nature impériale. Or, l’analyse de rares inscriptions et monnaies issues des provinces laisse penser qu’en Orient, Paulina a pu être honorée de son vivant en tant qu’Augusta, et permet de remettre en question les opinions traditionnelles quant au milieu culturel et social duquel elle est issue.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The importance of Loppio - S. Andrea as a study case lies in the high reliability of most of the stratigraphic contexts, in the large percentage of legible coins (85%) and in the possibility of processing the data in relation with the peculiar typology and function of the site. There also is a very diverse range of coin finds; though the great majority are bronzes or debased radiates, there is a remarkable group of six silver pieces and an exceptional single gold specimen. The proportion of high value denomination issues is higher than average; this strengthens the argument that the site played a strategic military role (and possibly commercial as well) on the road between the Garda district and the Adige Valley.Only a small percentage of the finds (c. 9%) dates back to the phases in which the site was inhabited (not earlier than the second half of the 5th century AD); this suggests that late Roman coins (making up over 73% of the total) still played an important role in early Medieval times. Because the site yielded no evidence of a Roman occupation, it seems more plausible to account them as part of the small change in use during the 6th century rather than merely as residual material. This also seems to be confirmed by the fact that most of these finds belong to the same stratigraphic contexts such as Ostrogothic coins.A significant number of the small Roman bronzes (9 or 10) were intentionally pierced. The practice of using pierced coins (both in bronze and in precious metal) for producing ornamentation is widely attested within grave goods in Lombard cemeteries. All the specimens found at Loppio come from the latest structures of the castrum, which can be dated to the 7th century AD, confirming that they were in use during the Lombard phase of the site. What is very unusual about this sample is that the objects to which these pierced coins were supposed to belong do not come from graves but from habitation contexts. Such evidence suggests that, regardless of their final function for ritual or ornamental-symbolic purposes (necklace-bracelet pendants, amulets, talismans), these coins were used in everyday life, thus they could have also retained their basic function as a medium of exchange.The most remarkable single find from the castrum of Loppio is a gold tremissis struck by the mint of Rome in the name of Justinian I. This piece reveals a copper core beneath the gold surface, it being one of the very few plated gold specimens known at present. The rarity of these counterfeits seems to indicate that they were made on a small scale. For this reason, it is very difficult to determine in which circumstances the coin was produced. The prototype appears to be Byzantine. It could either be an ‘emergency’ issue by the Imperial mint to face an extraordinary demand for coinage during the Gothic War, or (although less likely) an ‘unofficial’ counterfeit.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses in particular on issues showing the deliberate use of bilingual legends, but only on a very lim- ited part of an otherwise entirely monolingual civic coinage. Two case studies are examined in detail. The first considers coins of Nicaea in Bithynia, which circulated on a large scale also outside Asia Minor, and especially in Moesia Superior, Dacia and Pannonia; the second presents some hitherto unknown bilingual issues from Nicopolis ad Istrum, in Moesia Inferior. The analysis of analogies and discrepancies between them offers the opportunity to discuss the function of these coins and to suggest a possible interpretation for the economic and cultural context in which they were produced.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses in particular on issues showing the deliberate use of bilingual legends, but only on a very lim- ited part of an otherwise entirely monolingual civic coinage. Two case studies are examined in detail. The first considers coins of Nicaea in Bithynia, which circulated on a large scale also outside Asia Minor, and especially in Moesia Superior, Dacia and Pannonia; the second presents some hitherto unknown bilingual issues from Nicopolis ad Istrum, in Moesia Inferior. The analysis of analogies and discrepancies between them offers the opportunity to discuss the function of these coins and to suggest a possible interpretation for the economic and cultural context in which they were produced.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The analysis of fabric and style of the coins, combined with the study of dies,shows that a remarkable change occurred in the mint during the reign of Severus, probably asa result of the turnover of workforce within the workshop. The main bulk of output is representedby the coinage of Plautilla, which marks the transition between an earlier phase in which the mintseems to have been influenced by a Corinthian or Peloponnesian workshop and a later one whichsaw the employment of much more skilled engravers, probably in cooperation with the mint ofNicopolis in Epirus. Résumé − Fondée sur l’étude du monnayage civique de Corcyre / Corfou de Septime Sévère àCaracalla, cette contribution propose un nouveau schéma de la production monétaire répartie entrois phases distinctes ainsi qu’un commentaire historique. L’analyse de la frappe et du styledes monnaies, associée à l’étude des coins, montre qu’un changement majeur intervient dansles émissions durant le règne de Septime Sévère, certainement en raison du fort turnover desgraveurs au sein de l’atelier. Le pic de la production correspond aux monnaies frappées au nomde Plautilla, marquant ainsi la transition entre une première phase au cours de laquelle l’atelierest influencé par des graveurs originaires de Corinthe ou du Péloponnèse, et une seconde qui voitintervenir des graveurs plus habiles, probablement dans le cadre d’une coopération avec l’atelierde Nicopolis d’Épire.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
