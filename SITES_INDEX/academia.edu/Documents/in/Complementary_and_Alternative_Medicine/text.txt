This study was aimed at evaluating the antibacterial activity of the acetone extract of A. mearnsii and its interactions with antibiotics against some resistant bacterial strains. Methods. The antibacterial susceptibility testing was determined by agar diffusion and macrobroth dilution methods while the checkerboard method was used for the determination of synergy between the antibiotics and the extract. Results. The results showed that the susceptibility of the different bacterial isolates was concentration dependent for the extract and the different antibiotics. With the exception of S. marcescens, the inhibition zones of the extract produced by 20 mg/mL ranged between 18 and 32 mm. While metronidazole did not inhibit any of the bacterial isolates, all the antibiotics and their combinations, except for ciprofloxacin and its combination, did not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis. The antibacterial combinations were more of being antagonistic than of being synergistic in the...Save to LibraryDownloadby Professor Roger M Coopoosamy•Complementary and Alternative MedicineEpilepsy in the Renaissance: A survey of remedies from 16th and 17th century German herbalsSave to LibraryDownloadby Matthias Hamburger•  19  Ancient History, Renaissance, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Traditional MedicineUsing Suggestion to Modulate Automatic Processes: From Stroop to McGurk and BeyondCognitive scientists typically classify cognitive processes as either controlled or automatic.

Whereas controlled processes are slow and effortful, automatic processes are fast and involuntary. Over the past decade, we have propelled a research trajectory investigating how top-down influence in the form of suggestion can allow individuals to modulate the automaticity of cognitive processes. Here we present an overarching array of converging findings that collectively indicate that certain individuals can derail involuntary processes, such as reading, by " unringing " the proverbial bell. We examine replications of these effects from both our own laboratory and independent groups, and extend our Stroop findings to several other well-established automatic paradigms, including the McGurk effect. We thus demonstrate how, in the case of highly suggestible individuals, suggestion seems to wield control over a process that is likely even more automatic than the Stroop effect. Finally, we present findings from two novel experimental paradigms exploring the potential of shifting automaticity in the opposite direction e i.e., transforming, without practice, a controlled task into one that is automatic. Drawing on related evidence from the neuroscience of contemplative practices, we discuss how these findings pave the road to a more scientific understanding of voluntary control and automaticity, and expound on their possible experimental and therapeutic applications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael Lifshitz and +1I.

Not only are such deficiencies common, and probably the rule, vitamin D deficiency is implicated in most of the diseases of civilization. Vitamin D&#39;s final metabolic product is a potent, pleiotropic, repair and maintenance, seco-steroid hormone that targets more than 200 human genes in a wide variety of tissues, meaning it has as many mechanisms of action as genes it targets. One of the most important genes vitamin D up-regulates is for cathelicidin, a naturally occurring broad-spectrum antibiotic. Natural vitamin D levels, those found in humans living in a sun-rich environment, are between 40-70 ng per ml, levels obtained by few modern humans.

An acid-forming diet can induce low-grade metabolic acidosis, which causes very small decreases in blood pH and plasma bicarbonate (HCO3-) that remain within the range considered to be normal. However, if the duration of the acidosis is prolonged or chronically present, even a low degree of acidosis can become significant. This article reviews supporting evidence in the literature that has shown that consumption of abundant alkaline-forming foods can result in improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle mass, protection from chronic illnesses, reduced tumor-cell invasion and metastasis, and effective excretion of toxins from the body.

The objectives of the research were to document the current and past uses of wild plants in this region for food and human/animal medication; to analyse the food, medicinal and veterinary areas in the context of wild plants; and to qualitatively compare the results with relevant publications concerning the wild food plants of Belarus. Methods: Fieldwork was carried out as a practical part of a development cooperation project in May 2016 in 11 villages of the Liubań district. One hundred thirty-four respondents were selected randomly. Information about local uses of wild plants was obtained via semi-structured interviews and the folk-history method.

Randomized controlled trials evaluating all forms of homeopathic treatment for AR were included in a systematic review (SR) of studies published up to and including December 2015. Two authors independently screened potential studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes included symptom improvement and total quality-of-life score. Treatment effect size was quantified as mean difference (continuous data), or by risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (dichotomous data), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analysis was performed after assessing heterogeneity and risk of bias. Eleven studies were eligible for SR. All trials were placebo-controlled except one.

However, despite this use, the estrogenic properties of Gouania longipetala (G. longipetala) have not been studied until now. The present study was aimed to assess estrogenic activities of the stem bark aqueous (GLA) and ethanolic (GLE) extracts of G. longipetala in post menopause-like model of ovariectomized (Ovx) Wistar rats. Animals were either sham-operated or Ovx. 84 days after ovariectomy, animals were divided into seven groups of five animals and were daily treated for 28 days with distilled water (10mL/kg) for group 1, 2% solution of Tween 80 (10mL/kg) for group 2, estradiol valerate (1mg/kg) for group 3, GLA (45 or 180mg/kg) and GLE (40 or 160mg/kg) for groups 4 to 7 respectively. Sham-operated animals daily received distilled water (10mL/kg). During the experimental period, the body weight was registered every week. At the day 29, blood pressure was registered by invasive method while uterine and vagina morphometry as well as body, uterine and abdominal fat weights changes were analyzed. Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were determined. Moreover, oxidative stress markers such as nitrites, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in homogenized liver and aorta. Compared with the sham control, vagina and uterine dystrophy and elevated blood pressure were observed in Ovx rats treated with vehicles. Biochemical parameters showed a significant increase of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and MDA as well as a significant decrease of nitrites and GSH in Ovx animals treated with vehicle as compared to sham group. GLA and GLE displayed estrogen-like effects on vagina and did not affect uterine wet weight and epithelial height compared with vehicle groups. Both extracts displayed anti-atherogenic properties by reducing AI, AIP and LDL-cholesterol level as compared to vehicles groups. GLA and GLE significantly prevented the increase of MDA induced by ovariectomy as compared to rats treated with vehicles. This study showed that GLA and GLE exhibited estrogenic effects by providing vaginal lubrication, by modulating blood pressure and improving lipid profile, oxidative status and endothelial function and may not have an undesirable influence on the endometrium in ovariectomized rats.Save to Libraryby Mireille Kameni and +1Dzeufiet Paul Desire•  20  Chemistry, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, EthnopharmacologyWhole body vibration therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A pilot studySave to LibraryDownloadby Junggi Hong•  12  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Vibration, Medicine, Pain ManagementGalactorrhoea following acupunctureA 41-year-old woman with breast cancer was referred to the pain management clinic for a course of acupuncture for intense pain following a subcutaneous mastectomy and a latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.

She was treated with a standard course of acupuncture for breast pain, using paravertebral segmental points, trigger points, plus contralateral LI4 on the non-lymphoedematous arm. She experienced an episode of galactorrhoea six days following the first treatment and during the second treatment. She had not previously lactated for four years. CT and MRI of the brain revealed no focal abnormality. Acupuncture has been used in to promote lactation in the Traditional Chinese literature using the ‘Tianzong’ acupoint SI11.

A critical appraisal of the recording and analysis techniques is presented. A broad based search of the English language literature was conducted utilising the databases Medline (1966-1996) and Chirolars (1800-1996), using the key words cavitation, noise, sound, audible release, crack/s/ing, vibration, sound recording, acoustic recording and accelerometers, coupled with the terms facet joint, spinal joint and apophyseal joint and chiropractic, osteopathic and spinal manipulation. A manual search was also conducted of non-indexed journals and text books relating to manual therapy of the library at RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria.

The effects were assessed by measuring the levels of secretory proteins and mRNA of TNF-αand IL-6, the levels of nitric oxide (NO) secretion and the expression of iNOS in THP-1 cells. Cells were treated with 5 μg lipopolysaccharide/ml (LPS) in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of extracts from the aerial parts ofH. triquetrifolium. During the entire experimental period, we used extract concentrations (up to 250 μg mL−1) that had no cytotoxic effects, as measured with MTT and LDH assays.Hypericum triquetrifoliumextracts remarkably suppressed the LPS-induced NO release, significantly attenuated the LPS-induced trans...Save to LibraryDownloadby Omar Said and +2Abdalsalam KmailSaid Khasib•  11  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Medicine, Herbal Medicine, LipopolysaccharideImmediate effects of Pilates based therapeutic exercise on postural control of young individuals with non-specific low back pain: A randomized controlled trialLow back pain affects the person&#39;s ability to keep balance, especially in challenging conditions.

The purpose of this study was to determine the immediate effects of Pilates exercises on postural sway and dynamic balance of young individuals with non-specific low back pain. Controlled laboratory design. Forty-six participants with non-specific low back pain were randomized to a Pilates (n=23, 10 males; age: 21.8±3.2years) and a control group (n=23, 9 males; age: 22.8±3.6years). Postural sway was assessed with a force platform and dynamic balance with the Star Excursion Balance Test, before and after the intervention or rest period. To assess postural sway, participants stood still on an unstable surface set on the force plate for 90s, with eyes closed.
