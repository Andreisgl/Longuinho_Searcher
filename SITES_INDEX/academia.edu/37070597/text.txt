Douglas Allen (Lexington Books, 2006)Wisdom and Violence: The Legacy of Platonic Political Philosophy in al-Fārābī and NietzschePeter S GroffA vast historical, cultural and philosophical chasm separates the thought of the 10th century Islamic philosopher al-Farabi and Friedrich Nietzsche, the progenitor of postmodernity. However, despite their significant differences, they share one important commitment: an attempt to resuscitate and reappropriate the project of Platonic political philosophy, particularly through their conceptions of the “true philosopher” as prophet, leader, and lawgiver. This paper examines al-Farabi and Nietzsche’s respective conceptions of the philosopher as commander and legislator against the background of their Platonic source, and reflects upon the human cost each thinker is willing to abide in order to establish a regime that would be conducive to the perfectibility and flourishing of the human being.Download Free PDFView PDFMA Thesis, Religious StudiesNIETZSCHE'S UNDERSTANDING OF SOCRATES1998 • Sean SteelDownload Free PDFView PDFReinterpreting modern culture: an introduction to Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy2000 • Paul van TongerenDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche and Untimeliness: The "Philosopher of the Future" as the Figure of Disruptive WisdomAlan Rosenberg, Steven HicksDownload Free PDFView PDFPhilosophy East and West 64.4Leaving the Garden: al-Rāzī and Netzsche as Wayward Epicureans 2014 • Peter S GroffThis paper initiates a dialogue between classical Islamic philosophy and late modern European thought, by focusing on two peripheral, ‘heretical’ figures within these traditions: Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyāʾ al-Rāzī and Friedrich Nietzsche. What affiliates these thinkers across the cultural and historical chasm that separates them is their mutual fascination with, and profound indebtedness to, ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. Given the specific themes, concerns and doctrines that they appropriate from this common source, I argue that al-Rāzī and Nietzsche should be read as Epicureans and seen in relation to their predecessor as part of the subterranean tradition of philosophical naturalism. However, while each figure appropriates the philosophy of Epicurus, they ultimately transform it in important ways: al-Rāzī offers us a qualified “Platonic” Epicureanism, while Nietzsche forges a radicalized “Dionysian” Epicureanism. The point of such a comparative examination is twofold. First, analyzing the divergent paths of these “wayward” Epicureans sheds new light on the historical trajectory of naturalism as a philosophical stance (as well as its current prospects and limitations). Second, by initiating a dialogue between the classical Islamic and modern European philosophical traditions, we can better understand the antagonisms and shared concerns between these two horizons, as well as the ambiguities and self-questioning that occur within them.Download Free PDFView PDFNietzsche disruptive wisdomAlan RosenbergDownload Free PDFView PDFVoegelinViewNietzsche's Gift: On the First Part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra2020 • Timothy H. WilsonFriedrich Nietzsche referred to his own philosophy as an inversion of Platonism. It has yet to be clearly established, however, what exactly this meant for Nietzsche. This paper examines the First Part of Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra in light of Nietzsche’s relation to Plato. The paper asserts that one key for understanding Nietzsche’s inversion of Platonism is coming to grips with the reversal of Plato’s art of philosophic communication that takes place in the First Part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra. This reversal of Platonic communication is undertaken by means of the thematic of the “Gift”. That is, Platonic communication is likened to a gift-giving that responds to the needs of its recipients. Platonic, or “esoteric”, philosophic communication adapts its message to the needs of the listener – veiling its message in order to protect listeners from harmful philosophic truths. Zarathustra, on the other hand, learns a new form of communication in the First Part, one that is driven by the imperatives of the speaker or giver, not the listener or recipient: “How can I give each his own? Let this be sufficient for me: I give each my own.”Download Free PDFView PDFThe Politics of TruthPaul F GlennDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche and the Becoming of Life.

WilsonThis paper attempts to uncover the political aspects of Nietzsche’s early thinking through an extended discussion of his essay “The Greek State.” The paper builds on a similar discussion of another essay from the same period, “Homer on Competition,” in arguing that Nietzsche’s thinking is based on a confrontation with the work of Plato. It is argued that the key to understanding “The Greek State” is seeing it, in its entirety, as an enigmatic interpretation and re-writing of Plato’s Republic. Nietzsche interprets the Republic as Plato’s accomplishment of the task of the genuine philosopher: the legislation of values and the moulding of human character.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
