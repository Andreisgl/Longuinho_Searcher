Most of their time was spent on routine tasks with small numbers of pupils who required enteral feeding and suctioning. They were also responsible for administering medications to around 1 in 6 of the pupils. Both nurses had an involvement in staff training and health promotion classes; more so in one school than the other. In two similar schools which did not have a nurse, the routine tasks were done mainly by teachers or assistants ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInternational Journal of Nursing StudiesNursing inputs to special schools in N.

However this review needed to take into account the wider service context and commissioning frameworks. The project commenced in November 2006. In addition to reviewing the international literature, information was gathered from 30 parents, nearly 200 frontline professionals and 30 service managers. Throughout the project, participants repeatedly demonstrated an interest and enthusiasm to produce more efficient and effective service responses to an estimated 500 children and families in Northern Ireland which to date has been ad hoc and often uncoordinated. Many inequities exist in provision across Northern Ireland. Yet individual packages can be a high expense to HPSS. A series of recommendations have been developed which command a consensus among informants.Download Free PDFView PDFIMPROVING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HEALTH AND EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS OR PHYSICAL DISABILITYSuzanne MukherjeeDownload Free PDFView PDFInvestigating the links between mental health and behaviour in schools2005 • Janet ShucksmithDownload Free PDFView PDFNurses���, midwives��� and health visitors��� involvement in cross���boundary working within child health services2006 • Alison WhileDownload Free PDFView PDFBritish Journal of School NursingExploring educationalists' views on the need for school nurses in secondary schools in Greece2013 • Dimos S MastrogiannisDownload Free PDFView PDFTeaching for Life  (Research Report) (2014)2014 • Dr Sally Robinson, Ian DurrantThere are increasing numbers of children with life limiting or life threatening conditions in mainstream schools. Previous research shows that the needs of these children are not being well met. The symptoms of their condition and its treatment can interfere with a child’s whole school experience including their learning, their self-esteem and their relationships. Many children and parents feel under supported by schools. One study showed that teachers report an insufficiency of information resources or guidance for themselves in relation to having children with cancer in their school. In England, the Children and Families Act (2014) aims to bring about better integration of health care, social care and education for these children. The Teaching for Life project aimed to explore the needs of teachers in relation to working with children with life limiting or life threatening conditions. It comprised an on-line questionnaire, completed by 90 teachers mostly from mainstream schools in south east England, and interviews with 38 teachers who were undertaking the Special Educational Needs Coordination training for special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs). Six members of staff from a Special school were also interviewed. The study showed that the most common life limiting or life threatening condition to be reported by the teachers was cancer followed by cerebral palsy, Duchennes muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. There was a wide variance across schools about who was responsible for keeping medical and care needs of pupils updated. About half the teachers in this study had provided medical care for a child. Many teachers were anxious and concerned that meeting a child’s medical needs in school was very challenging and some felt that they were failing children. Teachers want better and quicker access to information and support related to providing medical care and administering medicines in particular. Teachers recognised the need for good multi-disciplinary working around the child, but there were a number of barriers. These included teachers not always understanding which health care professionals could support them, or how to contact them, delays in the school receiving medical information from health care professionals, health care professionals not being able to provide the right kind of information at the right time, and the difficulties with getting the right professionals together for a meeting. Parents were cited as a key source of information and guidance for teachers who want to understand the medical and non-medical needs of a child. However parents’ own emotional trauma made this vitally important communication extremely difficult. Teachers felt a strong professional responsibility to be informed and to try to find support for themselves and the child, but their inability to get sufficient information or support from the parents, health professionals or the school, meant that many turned to what they could find on the internet. Teachers described themselves as floundering at the centre of an emotional web, as they tried to balance the needs of the child with the condition, their parents, other pupils and their parents, themselves and other staff, all within a school culture that could feel insecure and uncertain. Some spoke of the subject being ‘taboo’, and everyone not knowing whether they could or couldn’t ‘talk about it’. Teachers recognised that they needed support with the emotional strains that are associated with having a child with a life limiting or life threatening condition in school. Teachers wanted certainty and clarity. They wanted to work within a clear framework that provides clarity about school processes and decision making, in respect of issues such as the recording of pupil absences and pastoral support when a child has a life limiting or life threatening condition. Teachers wanted to be better equipped for communicating with the others about serious illness, death and bereavement. They wanted relevant educational resources that could provide a structure for their teaching and from which they could model what to say, what to do to and how to be a really supportive teacher in this difficult situation. They wanted to understand more about how life limiting and life threatening conditions affect children emotionally and behaviourally, and strategies for dealing with the outcomes. The experience of teachers who had worked with children with life limiting or life threatening conditions could be usefully shared with teachers for whom this is a new experience. In summary, teachers were well aware of the medical, emotional and social needs of both the child and the other children and adults that surround that child, as well as the importance of the physical attributes of the building and the culture of the school. They wanted more information, guidance and support. Teachers need emotional support for themselves if they are to be able to contain their own anxieties and be able to support others, and in turn they need to be supported by a whole school approach to emotional health and wellbeing, which includes addressing bullying and inclusion. Collaboration between themselves and inter-professional health and social care agencies needs to work more effectively.Download Free PDFView PDFReview of Nursing in the Community: Baseline Study2009 • Martine MillerDownload Free PDFView PDFHuman Resources for Health in South Africa - A draft strategyWilliam PickDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
