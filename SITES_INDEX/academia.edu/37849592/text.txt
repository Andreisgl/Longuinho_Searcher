However, an expanded lens on the life of the Siegelaub-Projansky Agreement in law yields another legacy for these endeavors, where the Agreement is instead evidenced as influencing artists’ rights laws in the United States, and where its rhetoric of collectivity can be viewed as a radical appropriation of private law in an effort to establish more equitable art industry norms. This reclaimed narrative of political influence emerges only when we recognize the capacity of these artistic documents as legal instruments, and consider how they have circulated through and challenged the limits of both fields they are cross-classified between: art and law.Download Free PDFView PDFCAA conference abstractsIntraplaces Ecofeminism Care and Spatialized Art2019 • Elena CologniDownload Free PDFView PDF17th-Century French Painting – New Thoughts, 2019, February 13–16, The 107th Annual Conference College Art Association of America (CAA) in New York CityAlexandre Ubeleski’s Work against the Background of the French Painting in the second Half of the 17th Century2019 • Barbara HryszkoLittle is known of Alexandre Ubeleski (1649/51–1718), an artist of Polish descent, Charles Le Brun’s pupil, the winner of prestigious Prix de Rome, a member of Accademia di San Luca in Rome, the King’s painter, an academician, and the professor of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris. Studies on his life and work in Paris and Rome offer a broader picture of the French art during the reign of the Sun King. The aim of the paper is to juxtapose his œuvre with other painters from the circles of Le Brun’s workshop and the Academy, and next to embed Ubeleski’s work against a background of the French painting in this period. The paper also discusses the origins of his artistic style and the impact the principles promoted in the Academy had on it, and analyses his position in the artistic environment in Paris. Additionally, the paper presents new works which have recently been attributed to Ubeleski.Download Free PDFView PDFInteractionism and Circulations of Arab “Futurist” AestheticsJoan Grandjean"Geographies and Art Histories: Diaspora, Decolonizing, and Praxis", panel chaired by Andrew Gayed and Chanda Carey, College Art Association, The Annual Conference, New York, 13 February 2019 Since the early 21th century, art production witnessed an emerging bunch of Arab “futurist” esthetics. These representations aim to explore alternative realities, creating scenarios where imagination and science fiction play a central role. From this moment onwards, artworks, writing and events emerged in the Arab Geocultural spaces all over the world. An increasing degree of interactionism has appeared from artists and cultural actors such as Sophia al-Maria, Larissa Sansour, Rachel Dedman and Shumon Basar. A look at the manifestations that arose in this “futurist” esthetic allows us to understand the Arab cultural malleability that takes its roots in the territorial complexities, the wide diaspora communities and transnational identities. It is a quite a difficult task to date and map this phenomenon using art historical standards, which are generally based on nationalism, the art market or more recently, reception theory. We would rather approach these Arab “futurist” esthetics by studying their circulations with an empirical method. This presentation will show the latest results of my study, using spatial humanities and georeferencing tools, allowing to highlight the life path of these artists (place of birth, education, residencies, awards, galleries) and to list their “futurist” artworks exhibited in the world (solo, group, biennial, art fair and festival). This spatial analysis, based on detailed field surveys, shows the conscious strategies shaping these paths. Rather than viewing it as some “Art from the Arab world”, an excessively geopolitical and essentialist notion, I choose to use the ‘urūba (arabness) as a pivotal tool to comprehend these esthetics inside the world of contemporary art history.Download Free PDFView PDFAudience and Receptivity in Animal-Style Art2019 • PETYA ANDREEVAElite tombs associated with Iron-Age non-sedentary communities are dispersed across an expansive geographic domain stretching from the Mongolian-Manchurian grassland to the Pontic Steppes. The interior décor of one’s final resting place exhibits a shared visual formula rooted in the repeated, strategic placement of portable luxury items: headdresses and jewelry with composite beasts in hierarchical arrangements decorate the human remains, whereas exuberant textiles envelop the walls, coffin covers and other interior surfaces. Animal-style portable art displays an emphasis on the concept of visual transmogrification as one fantastic beast transforms and terminates into another. Animal images are also represented through a visual synecdoche following the "pars-pro-toto" device: full-bodied animals are replaced by a single anatomic part or depicted as zoomorphic junctures of several beasts thus resulting in a composite monster. This study views the emphasis on movement and metamorphosis of fantastic animals as a politically-determined phenomenon. The author addresses the authority of two types of intended audiences, a real-life one in attendance during the funeral and a second (imagined) one present in the afterlife. The burial likely involved the attendance of other members of the highest echelons of society. Thus, the dramatic optical transformation within the surface of portable ornaments coupled with the theatrical setting of the tomb’s interior and the frequent incorporation of “exotic” goods from sedentary empires indicate that shaping the sensorial experience and expectations of an elite audience were at the heart of the construction of elite nomadic burials. Displays of portable luxury in a pastoral nomadic structure were thus driven by cosmological negotiations of political clout and concerns about sustained collective memory and legitimacy beyond a leader’s death.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
