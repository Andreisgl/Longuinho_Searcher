Is he betraying Stacey's trust or protecting her from revenge and tragedy? Don't miss a single book in the series: Blue is for Nightmares, White is for Magic, Silver is for Secrets, Red is for Remembrance.Read moreEditor's NoteSupernatural sequel…Stacey’s supernatural adventures continue in the fourth book in the “Blue is for Nightmares” series.
