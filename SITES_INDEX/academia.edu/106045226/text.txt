Authors take up Cowen's central concerns: re-theorising the fi eld of comparative education, rethinking the interpretive concepts that are used by comparative education researchers, and the relationships between them. The authors take us beyond old ideas to provide some new and fresh thinking on and about educational phenomena and the fi eld of comparative education. Writers engage in critical thinking about the intellectual agenda of comparative education, the role of theory in their work, the contexts that are shaping the fi eld, and epistemic consequences of these broader changes for comparative education. The volume contains voices from a variety of geographical regions, theoretical positions, newer and more well-established scholars in the fi eld. The book also includes shorter refl ections from individuals in the fi eld who know Robert Cowen personally. More well-established themes in the fi eld are discussed such as borrowing and transfer, as well as newer concepts and ideas from Cowen's work including shape-shifting, and transitologies. New Thinking in Comparative Education will be of interest to those who are studying and doing research in the fi eld of comparative and international education, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels of education.Download Free PDFView PDFProcedia - Social and Behavioral SciencesTheoretical basis of comparative education and suggestion of a model: comparative education council in Turkish education system2011 • Sadullah DedeThis study considers the theoretical basis of comparative education. The results presented here were obtained through literature review. This study first considers what comparative education is, and provides information about the field of comparative education. It then examines the historical and hypothetical development of comparative education in the world and provides brief information of the comparative education studies in Turkey. It also, by providing details on some important centers operating in this field, proposes the establishment of a similar committee or centre in Turkey as well.Download Free PDFView PDFEspañola de Educación ComparadaBeyond Binaries: A Way Forward for Comparative Education2012 • Marianne A LarsenBinary discourses shape and produce the stories we construct about the field of comparative education. In the first part of this article, I review a set of binary discourses that have characterized social science research since the Enlightenment, including: quantitative-qualitative, nomothetic-idiographic, inductive-deductive, and practice-theory. We can think of each of these binaries at opposite ends of a set of spectrums. In the second section of the paper, I show some of the ways in which these binaries have influenced the ways that we write and talk about research within the field of comparative education. I refer to the notion of binary discourses and the productive capacity of these discourses to shape our field. I then outline some critiques of these binaries to demonstrate the inherent limitations of binary discourses, and why we need to move beyond binaries in our research, and in the histories about our field. Finally, I present some tentative conclusions on ways to get ourselves out of the trap of binary thinking.Download Free PDFView PDFRevista Española de Educación ComparadaComparative Education and Empires2018 • Robert CowenHay una gran cantidad de literatura sobre imperios. Hay una gran cantidad de literatura sobre educación e imperios. Sin embargo, solo hay un poco de literatura dentro de la educación comparada sobre imperios. ¿Por qué? Dado el número de personas cuya educación se vio afectada por los imperios, dadas las intenciones declaradas de quienes crearon imperios y sistemas educativos imperiales, dadas las armonías y tensiones en la mayoría de los imperios entre la política y la religión que se desarrollaban en los sistemas educativos, y dadas algunas de las diferencias obvias entre, por ejemplo, los imperios británico, holandés, francés, portugués, ruso, español y soviético y sus discursos y prácticas en la educación, el silencio es llamativo. Este artículo, primero, reflexionará sobre las formas en que los cambios en la «educación comparada» ayudaron a construir ese silencio. En segundo lugar, se trazarán los cambios más recientes en la educación comparada que abren la posibilidad de volver...Download Free PDFView PDFRevista on line de Política e Gestão EducacionalPanorama histórico da educação comparada: as contribuições de George BeredayStelamary LahamO presente artigo busca apresentar um ângulo do panorama histórico traçado pela Educação Comparada, segundo a revisão bibliográfica documental realizada pelos autores e apresentar a proposta de um método comparativo de Bereday. Inicialmente nossa busca metodológica se voltou para as diferentes divisões em fases ou períodos propostas pelos autores clássicos. Logo a seguir optamos por trazer o transcorrer da educação comparada subdividindo em décadas e incluindo como ela se deu também no cenário brasileiro. No tópico seguinte, nosso estudo se debruçou em trazer a metodologia sistematizada para análises comparativas proposta por George F. Z. Bereday, autor clássico da Educação Comparada, cujo legado ainda podemos observar de forma recorrente nos estudos comparados da atualidade.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
