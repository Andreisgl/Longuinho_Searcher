Now we can examine them in the spotlight for the gifts that they are—memorable monuments to style and keys to understanding Wilder’s genius.” – Penelope Niven, Thornton Wilder BiographerFeaturing a foreword by Penelope Niven and a revealing afterword by Wilder’s nephew, Tappan, this reissue reintroduces the reader to the Thornton Wilder’s first novel, The Cabala, and to The Woman of Andros, one of the inspirations for his Pulitzer Prize-winning play Our Town.A young American student spends a year in the exotic world of post-World War I Rome. While there, he experiences firsthand the waning days of a secret community (a "cabala") of decaying royalty, a great cardinal of the Roman Church, and an assortment of memorable American ex-pats. The Cabala, a semiautobiographical novel of unforgettable characters and human passions, launched Wilder's career as a celebrated storyteller and dramatist.The Woman of Andros, set on the obscure Greek island of Brynos before the birth of Christ, explores universal questions of what is precious about life and how we live, love, and die. Eight years later, Wilder would pose the same questions on the stage in a play titled Our Town, also set in an obscure location, this time a village in New Hampshire. The Woman of Andros is celebrated for some of the most beautiful writing in American literature.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextClassicsLiterary FictionHistorical FictionLanguageEnglishPublisherHarperCollinsRelease dateAug 9, 2022ISBN9780063244504Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleTWAuthorThornton WilderThornton Wilder (1897-1975) was an acclaimed American playwright and novelist known for his profound exploration of human existence and the intricate interplay of time, memory, and individual experiences.

Tap to rateWrite a reviewReview must be at least 10 wordsgbill_7Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5This edition includes Wilder’s first and third novels, those that bookend ‘The Bridge of San Luis Rey’, the classic which launched him to fame.   Like that novel, the settings are somewhat artificial; in ‘The Cabala’ it’s the old guard aristocratic society in Rome, which Wilder visited as a young man but largely invents here, and in ‘The Woman of Andros’, it’s a made up Greek island at the time of Christ.    They are simply backdrops for Wilder’s character sketches, and for his exploration into the deep questions of life and the angst of the human condition, which he does in a quiet, economical way.These books are somewhat intellectual, and will not be for everyone, but I found the writing to be beautiful, and admire Wilder’s craft as an author.    As an example, the last clause of this passage really struck me:  “They longed to see one another again, but it would have been impossible.  They dreamed of one of those long conversations that one never has on earth, but which one projects so easily at midnight, alone and wise; words are not rich enough nor kisses sufficiently compelling to repair all our havoc.”Here are some other quotes:On Dante, from ‘The Cabala’; I couldn’t agree more:“Where, where is he, that soul of vinegar, that chose to assign the souls of the dead more harshly than God?  Tell him that though a pagan I too shall see bliss.  It is nothing that I must first pay the penalty of ten thousand years.  Behold the moment I exhibit the sin of anger; where is he in pain for the sin of pride?”On knowledge, from ‘The Cabala’:“Who can understand religion unless he has sinned?  who can understand literature unless he has suffered?  who can understand love unless he has loved without response?”On life and love, from ‘The Woman of Andros’:“Suddenly the hero saw that the living too are dead and that we can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasure; for our hearts are not strong enough to love every moment.”On love, from ‘The Cabala’, I loved the compression of the parenthetical summary:“Nature had decided to torment this woman by causing her to fall in love (that succession of febrile interviews, searches, feints at indifference, nightlong solitary monologues, ridiculous vision of remote happiness) with the very type of youth that could not be attracted by her…”And this one from ‘The Woman of Andros’:“The caress of hands in first love, and never so simply again, seems to be a sharing of courage, an alliance of two courages against a confusing world.”On men and women, from ‘The Cabala’:“Suddenly his eyes had been opened to a world he had not dreamed of.  So it was true that men and women were never really engaged in what they appeared to be doing, but lived in a world of secret invitations, signals, and escapes!   Now he understood the raised eyebrows of waitresses and the brush of the usher’s hand as she unlocks the loge.  It is not an accident that the wind draws the great lady’s scarf across your face as you emerge from the door of the hotel.   Your mother’s friends happen to be passing in the corridor outside the drawing-room, but not by chance.  Now he discovered that all women are devils, but foolish ones, and that he had entered into the true and only satisfactory activity in living – the pursuit of them.”On solitude, from ‘The Woman of Andros’:“Indeed the profession she followed was one of those that emphasize the dim notion that lies at the back of many minds: the notion that we are not necessary to anyone, that attachments weave and unweave at the mercy of separation, satiety and experience.  The loneliest associations are those that pretend to intimacy.”On stoicism and expressing oneself, from ‘The Woman of Andros’, on her deathbed:“’No, no.  I am very happy that you have come.’  To herself she thought: ‘Time is passing, and what are we saying!  Is there not something heartfelt that I can find to say to him, something to remember, for him and for me?’   But she distrusted the emotion that filled her heart.  It was perhaps mere excitement and pain; or a vague and false sentiment.  Probably the best thing to do was to be stoic; to be brave and inarticulate; to talk of trivial things.  Or was it a greater bravery to surmount this shame and to say whatever obvious words the heart dictated?   Which was right?”Lastly, the connection discovered to the book I read previously, which was Washington Irving’s ‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow’: two things, Miss Grier’s fear of ghosts, and the allusion to Dutch in New England: “We have his picture at this stage: the daguerreotype of the Dutch yokel with the protruding lower lip and grinning pugnacious eyes is reproduced in any history of the great American fortunes.”   As a bonus, Wilder also refers to Giorgio Vasari as having affirmed that a painting by Mantegna had been retouched by Bellini.Read moreBook previewThe Cabala and The Woman of Andros - Thornton WilderDedication To my friends at the American Academy in Rome, 1920–1921 T.W.

Endowed with an intense imagination, boundless curiosity, and an affinity for vivid stories, he dreamed about the books he would write. As a teenager he began composing a series of three-minute playlets for three characters. (Authors of fifteen and sixteen years of age spend their time drawing up title-pages and adjusting the tables of contents of works they have neither the perseverance nor the ability to execute, he wrote years later in the foreword to an edition of his short plays.) The young Wilder possessed the ability and the perseverance as well as the dreams, and as a college student frequently saw his work in print, usually in undergraduate publications. From 1920 until 1926, when his first novel, The Cabala, was published, Wilder was a graduate student and a school master, earning his bread-and-butter income teaching prep-school French and tutoring on the side. In the coveted leftover hours, he poured himself into the reading and writing that had always been his primary occupation. He also gravitated to the theaters from New York to Philadelphia, for he had fallen in love early with the magic of the stage. Wilder was twenty-nine when The Cabala appeared on the American literary scene, earning good reviews and modest royalties. It was followed in 1927 by a spectacular popular and critical success—the bestselling Pulitzer Prize–winning novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey, hailed internationally as an overnight sensation. In reality, it had been a fifteen-year-long overnight—a persistent apprenticeship of reading, writing, thinking, imagining, and experimenting, often while caught, as Wilder said, in the quicksands of Teaching. The Bridge of San Luis Rey brought honors, celebrity, and fortune—and for decades its vast shadow would overwhelm and even obscure the significance of The Cabala and The Woman of Andros, the novels that immediately preceded and followed it. This new volume sheds light on Wilder the novelist and on the two novels standing on either side of The Bridge. In 1920, twenty-three years old and fresh out of Yale College, Thornton Wilder booked passage on the French ocean liner Providence, bound for Italy and the future. He embarked with great excitement and very little money on what he later called his Italian year, becoming a visiting student in the School of Classical Studies at the American Academy in Rome. Isabella Thornton Niven Wilder, his mother, had always nurtured his imagination, his dreams and his artistic sensibilities. She was particularly pleased with her son’s plans to travel to Italy, where she and other family members spent time over the years. She translated the poems of Giosué Carducci from Italian into English, wrote poems of her own, introduced her children to classical literature and Greek drama, took them to the theater to see the plays of Ibsen and Shaw as well as stock company plays, and awakened in Thornton his lifelong love of music and of European literature and culture. He took with him to Italy a grounding in classical mythology, history, and literature, including Dante’s work. It is no wonder that in the fall of 1920 he was captivated by the treasures of Rome—art, architecture, music, literature, and his new enthusiasm, archeology. After I’d graduated from college I was sent to Europe to study archeology, Wilder recalled decades later. One day our class in Rome was taken out into the country to dig up a bit of the Etruscan world, a street. Once thousands of people had walked it. The rut was very deep. Those who have uncovered such a spot are never the same again. He wrote that each of us possesses something of the mind of an archeologist and that while people in previous centuries knew that many people had lived and died a long while ago and that there were many people living on the earth, the modern mind grasps the reality that millions and billions have lived and died, and that probably billions and billions (let us not despair of the human race) will live and die. The extent of this enlarged realization alters the whole view of life. Wilder’s pivotal Italian year helped to forge his vision of the individual’s relationship to the universe, the infinite permutations and combinations of the basic life events, or plots—birth, struggle, love, aspiration, defeat, transcendence, death. How perfect it is, my being here! he exulted in a letter home from Italy in 1920. How much happier a chance has fallen than a year in Paris or London or New York. Rome’s antiquity, her variety, her significance swallow these others up, and I feel myself being irresistibly impelled toward saying of her that she is the Eternal City. He wrote to his father that he wanted to develop a literary consciousness that took into account the artistic anxiety of the European and a new abundance and range of America. He said that his foray into ancient Rome evoked in him a new appreciation for the American experience. Amos Parker Wilder, father of Thornton and four other precocious children, was a journalist, consular official, and platform lecturer, with ambitious yet practical dreams for his sons and daughters. He deplored the fact that four of them seemed bent on becoming ‘artistic’ writers, that is to say unmarketable. Many years later, Wilder wrote that his father had read my numerous works with deep concern; they appeared to him to be—borrowing a phrase he had picked up in China—‘carved cherry stones.’ The Wilder children were well acquainted with this metaphor, for their father used it often when he sought to discourage their interest in writing. Amos Wilder hoped that Thornton would return from Italy in a year’s time uncorrupted and equipped to earn a living. He worried about his son’s seeming inability to concentrate and persevere, his tendencies toward woolgathering and dilettantism. Amos concluded that teaching was the best fit for Thornton’s temperament, and with the help of strong references from two of his son’s Yale professors, secured a teaching post for Thornton. By the autumn of 1921, the traveler was settling into his job as assistant housemaster for Davis House and French teacher at Lawrenceville School, a few miles from Princeton, New Jersey. At night, his duties done—lessons prepared, papers graded, and young charges asleep—Wilder turned to his reading and writing. Years later, former students in Davis House recalled hearing Wilder’s footsteps tracing a steady pattern across the floorboards as he worked on the novel and the plays he was writing after hours. He had rejoiced in his sojourn in the land of Virgil, Cicero, Tasso, and Dante. It was enough, he said, to set the imagination racing. As he worked on his first novel in his spare time, he was transmuting the Italian experiences, real and imagined, into art. Wilder’s papers reveal some of the winding pathway from conception to completion of the novel, an imaginary memoir of a young American mingling with a small clique of privileged, eccentric residents of early-twentieth-century Rome. He referred to his story variously as Notes of a Roman Student, Roman Memoirs, The Trasteverine, and The Memoirs of Charles Mallison: The Year in Rome, among other titles. Along the way Wilder experimented with characters and structure, with voice and style, even momentarily groping, like other writers of the time, for a literary response to World War I. The whole memoirs are to be a sort of adieu to the romance and medievalism that barely survived the war, he wrote to his mother. As was his habit, Wilder was deeply influenced by his reading—the plays of French dramatist Paul Claudel, for instance, especially Le Père Humilié (1920), depicting the decline and dissipation of noble families; Pierre Champagne de Labriolle’s Histoire de la Littérature Latine Chrétienne; and Ernest Renan’s Souvenirs d’enfance et de jeunesse. In July 1922, temporarily free of his teaching and house-parenting duties, Wilder rented a room on the top floor of the YMCA in Newport, Rhode Island, set up his Underwood typewriter and spent several hours a day typing the book he was composing in longhand. He wrote to his father that he had carved some cherry stones, and was working on "a type of sentence, on a hint from Lytton Strachey, wherein you crowd under one trait in common a host of disparate details, in order to give an impression of rich complicated life." As always, Wilder entrusted his dreams and his work-in-progress to his mother, who took a keen interest in her son’s reading and writing. Just as soon as I get a fair copy made of BOOK ONE, he wrote to her, I look it over and with my blue pencil start indicating alterations; within an hour the whole script is unsightly. My only consolation is that every touch has been an improvement. He was weaving an intricate tapestry of comedy, satire, irony and tragedy, and by August 1922, he sent his manuscript to the editors of The Dial, then one of the prestigious literary journals in the United States. I am submitting under separate cover the MSS of a series of imaginary memoirs of a year spent in Rome, entitled ‘The Trasteverine,’ Wilder wrote. These give the appearance of being faithful portraits of living persons, but the work is a purely fanciful effort in the manner of Marcel Proust, or at times, of Paul Morand. Attached hereto find return postage. Very truly yours, Thornton N. Wilder. The Dial declined the manuscript, but expressed an interest in seeing more when the book was further along. The Double Dealer, a monthly magazine in New Orleans, published an excerpt from the novel. (This journal published other fledgling writers—Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Jean Toomer, Edmund Wilson, and Amos Niven Wilder, Thornton’s older brother, who wrote poetry.) Wilder’s journal of that time reveals his continual experimentation and his struggles with form and direction. On September 9, 1922, he wrote, There is a great book in the idea; I have fertility of invention, but I soon tire of the clumsiness of my phrasing. I think my reluctance to go on with it is not mere lack of perseverance, but a consciousness of the real difficulty of combining the real and the fantastic; it must be long brooded. The conscientious if somewhat unorthodox schoolmaster created a flamboyant cast of characters in the five sections of the book. The members of the Cabala are introduced to the reader by James Blair, a young American scholar in Rome, and friend of the novel’s narrator, another young American, nicknamed Samuele. The Cabalists, says Blair, are Fierce intellectual snobs who are very rich and influential, so much so that everyone else fears them and suspects them of plots to overturn things. Furthermore, they are so wonderful that they’re lonely, and they derive what comfort they can out of each other’s excellence. Soon we meet the energetic Miss Grier, wealthy American spinster, Vassar College trustee, and a dominant force in the Cabala; Her Highness Leda Matilda Colonna duchessa d’Aquilanera and her young son, the doomed, handsome prince Marcantonio, who has fallen on bad ways; the cultured French woman Alix, Princess d’Espoli, unhappily married to her Italian prince; ancient, wise Cardinal Vaine, who has spent his life in the mission fields of China; and the fervently devout Mlle. Astrée-Luce de Marfontaine. There is even a cameo appearance in the novel by John Keats. Wilder’s lodging in Rome in 1920 had been a stone’s throw from the house where Keats died in 1821. Wilder wrote to his mother about his character’s bored attendance at the sick-bed of a not very likable poet, a faithful description of his tubercular symptoms day by day, his terror and weakness, and finally his funeral in the Protestant Cemetery—the death of Keats faithfully documented and seen through the veil of ‘my’ dislike and revulsion. The young American narrator of The Cabala’s interwoven stories calls himself the biographer of the individuals in the novel, not the historian of the group. He is also sometime-mentor, would-be savior, and occasional perpetrator of events—a character device Wilder would use in future fiction. He sought to evoke in the novel both the Rome he experienced and the Rome he imagined: From all these eccentrics and madmen and scoundrels—thousands of portraits—is supposed to arise the hot breath of life more romantic than Jules Verne—an escape from routine and weariness and stenographer’s anaemia, and a reproduction of the feeling that Rome gives you when you’re no longer in it. Of course it is only written to please myself, Wilder wrote to his mother. There is nothing in it except what I am madly curious about; no compromise made for people who do not like the particular forms of strangeness and disorder that I like. Wilder observed in later years that The Cabala presumes to give a picture of contemporary life among the highly privileged members of Roman society. That picture is almost entirely imagined. He had met very few members of the aristocracy, he said, and no members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. He noted that the book’s sources could be found in the reading of Marcel Proust, the memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon, and the characters of La Bruyère. These works I devoured rapturously in the reading-room of the Princeton University Library on the free evenings afforded me by my first job—teaching eight miles away at The Lawrenceville School. The Cabala was published by Albert & Charles Boni in 1926. The New York Times Book Review hailed the debut of a new American stylist, and called Wilder’s novel a literary event. According to the Saturday Review of Literature, the novel was a sophisticated extravaganza. Critics admired the novel’s charm, its irony, and its elements of comedy and satire. But it would soon be dwarfed by The Bridge of San Luis Rey, which followed in 1927 and quickly brought Wilder international fame, as well as his first Pulitzer Prize. As he was finishing the second book, Wilder had written in a 1926 journal entry, Some day someone will discover that one of the principal ideas behind my work is the fear of catastrophe (especially illness and pain), and a preoccupation with the claims of a religion to meet the situation. That same year, in a later journal entry pocked with words blotted out, Wilder had this to say about his novels: The Cabala was written because I brooded about great natures and their obstacles and ailments and frustrations. The Bridge was written because I wanted to die and I wanted to prove that death was a happy solution. The motto of The Bridge is to be found in the last page of The Cabala: Hurry and die! In The Cabala I began to think that love is enough to reconcile one to the difficulty of living (i.e. the difficulty of being good); in The Bridge I am still a little surer. Perhaps some-day I can write a book announcing that love is sufficient. There are riddles woven into these lines that a biographer works hard to unravel. And there is this question: What would Wilder’s third novel have to say about the sufficiency of love? Had a fine month at Peterborough, Wilder wrote to his brother Amos in August of 1929. He had traveled to the MacDowell Colony that summer to work on The Woman of Andros, and he found the long solitary hours in the Studio fine. Lots more Andros done but confused about the direction to take in the fourth quarter of it. No hurry, and no worry. He described The Woman of Andros as his first novel, in the sense, he said, that the others were collections of tales, novelettes, bound together by a slight tie that identified them a belonging to the same group. By the time Wilder finished his third novel, he had enjoyed a wealth of new experiences and friendships, as well as international celebrity and enough of a fortune to build a house for his family and otherwise support his parents and sisters. He had seen the first New York production of one of his plays, The Trumpet Shall Sound; had published The Angel That Troubled the Waters, a collection of short plays; and had toured the country as a platform lecturer with resounding success, speaking to full houses on The Relation of Literature and Life, The Future of American Literature, Enthusiasms and Disappointments of Play-Going, and other topics. He had bought his first automobile, had struck up friendships with two other young novelists making their mark, Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald, and had taken an internationally publicized walking tour in Europe with world heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney (as fine a person as you’d want to meet, Wilder wrote to Hemingway before the trip). When Fitzgerald wrote to Wilder about The Bridge of San Luis Rey, Wilder answered with an autobiographical snapshot: I have been an admirer, not to say a student, of the Great Gatsby too long not to have got a great kick out of your letter. It gives me the grounds to hope that we may sometime have some long talks on what writing’s all about. As you see I am a provincial school-master and have always worked alone. And yet nothing interests me more than thinking of our generation as a league and as a protest to the whole cardboard generation that precedes us from Wharton through Cabell and Anderson and Sinclair Lewis. . . . I like teaching a lot and shall probably remain here for ages; a daily routine is necessary to me. I have no writing habits, am terribly lazy and write seldom. With typical self-deprecation, Wilder underplayed his discipline as a writer, for his journals and letters testify to his habitual absorption in his work. As he wrote The Woman of Andros, based in part, he said, on a Greek comedy by Terence, Wilder was immersed in Greek drama and philosophy, spending time in ancient Greece in his imagination, his reading, and his preparations for lectures he would give at the University of Chicago, when he became a part-time faculty member in 1930. On a trip to England, in September 1929, he sketched ideas for the lectures in his journal: What fifth century Greece thought of itself; how it was viewed by successive ages and by modern archeology; how it was viewed by specific great authors. He wanted to learn Greek, and he was rereading Aeschylus and Euripides. When asked why he chose remote ages and settings for his early novels, Wilder answered Because I am not yet ready to do something modern. I cannot yet reconcile a philosophic theme with the ringing of doorbells and telephones. Actually, in Wilder’s novels as well as his plays, literal setting and time are almost incidental—embroidery rather than scaffolding. He experimented with setting in fiction just as he experimented with sets on stage. The sets of his novels are draped in richer detail than the minimalist sets for his plays, but in Wilder’s fiction as in his drama, time and place are not fundamental to the story. Character and theme dominate. This is especially the case in The Woman of Andros, set on Brynos, an imagined Greek island, before the birth of Christ. (One interviewer reported that Wilder said the novel was set in 400 BC, but he commonly wrote that it was about 200 BC—that is, in the decline of the Great Age of Greece.) Wilder’s major character, the woman of Andros, is Chrysis, a beautiful, intelligent hetaira, or highly cultured courtesan, who is the benefactress of a household of dependent stray human beings, misfits, outsiders like herself, whose physical and/or emotional needs Chrysis seeks to fulfill. She and her younger sister Glycerium love the same god-like young man. Throw into the brew two worried fathers, a contemplative priest of Apollo, some suspicious islanders, a battle-worn sea captain, and an avaricious pimp, and you are in for a compelling concoction of myth, fable, and fantasia, laced with memorable aphorisms. (The loneliest associations are those that pretend to intimacy, for example. It is true that of all the forms of genius, goodness has the longest awkward age. Stupidity is everywhere and invincible.) Wilder draws his readers into the interior lives of some of the inhabitants of Andros, especially lovely, alluring Chrysis. His 1929 journal reveals that she was his frequent imaginary companion as he worked on the book at the MacDowell Colony and on a trip to England with his mother. Revelations and lines of dialogue came to him as he took long walks, or rode the train, or spent hours at night copying the book by hand on the sea voyage from England to New York, beset by his habitual doubts. From time to time the whole book seems mistaken, he fretted in his journal in October 1929: Have I let myself go again to a luxury of grief? I remember this haunted me through the writing of the Bridge and I am still not sure whether that is the way the world is. Already I have begun to reduce some of the expressions. This perpetual harping on the supposition that people suffer within. Am I sufficiently realist? He indicated that there were autobiographical traits in three characters—Chremes, one of the fathers of Brynos, this happiest, and one of the least famous of the islands; Chrysis, the Woman of Andros herself; and the young priest of Aesculapius and Apollo. Space here does not permit an exploration of Wilder’s life to illuminate that intriguing premise. There is, however, a prophetic, life-affirming scene in the novel that points us toward pivotal themes in Wilder’s future work. If you have seen or read Our Town, which appeared eight years after The Woman of Andros, you will recognize the story Chrysis tells her banquet guests about the Greek hero who begged Zeus to permit him to return to earth for just one day. Granted his dangerous wish, the hero, like Emily in Wilder’s play, discovers that the living too are dead and that we can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasure. He kisses the soil of the world that is too dear to be realized. From the earliest pages of his first novels and plays, Wilder examined the universal quandaries encapsulated in the questions the young man Pamphilus asks in The Woman of Andros: How does one live? What does one do first? In March 1930, Wilder wrote to Norman Fitts, then the Boston Evening Transcript critic, It seems to me that my books are about: What is the worst thing that the world can do to you, and what are the last resources one has to oppose it? In other words: When a human being is made to bear more than a human being can bear, what then? Wilder’s novels and plays pose evocative questions about spiritual belief and the mysteries of the mind and the spirit. He came to believe that the questions about the vast themes took precedence over the answers, contending that writers have only one duty, namely to pose the questions correctly. This challenge absorbed and tantalized him. Wilder’s first two novels and his early plays oscillated between story lines and search for meaning, between fable and examination of faith–but the emphasis rested on story and style rather than on substance and revelation. His focus changed with The Woman of Andros, however. Here the story is driven by the characters and their multifaceted search for meaning, including Wilder’s ongoing examination of the sufficiency of love. The young man Pamphilus, for instance, perceives in many of his fellow islanders a sad love that was half hope, often rebuked and waiting to be reassured of its truth. He asks, But why then a love so defeated, as though it were waiting for a voice to come from the skies, declaring that therein lay the secret of the world. The islanders in The Woman of Andros struggle with the nature of the perpetual flames of love that burn in the human heart—romantic love, especially first love; love for family; love of wisdom; even love for the unlovable in society. If I love them enough, I can understand them, Chrysis reflects. She believes that life’s most difficult burden is the incommunicability of love. Ultimately Chrysis comes to the encompassing love of life itself: Remember me, she says, as one who loved all things and accepted from the gods all things, the bright and the dark. In The Woman of Andros Wilder was still probing other questions he had parsed in The Cabala and The Bridge of San Luis Rey, such as whether the associations in life are based upon an accidental encounter or upon a profound and inner necessity. The characters in The Woman of Andros also grapple with the enigma of suffering, the mystery of death, the understanding of the highest point towards which any existence would aspire. As the omniscient narrator, Wilder reflects that the most exhausting of all our adventures is that journey down the long corridors of the mind to the last halls where belief is enthroned. Chrysis epitomizes that journey, ultimately concluding that It is the life in the mind that is important.
