This paper argues that the libertarian justification for limiting individual liberty known as the ‘harm principle’ or the ‘Millian paradigm’ is inadequate as a basis of public health ethics and policy. But simply pitting some collectivist value or utilitarian criterion over against individual liberty is not theoretically satisfactory, either. John Stuart Mill himself was not a Millian, in this sense, and his utilitarianism does not pit itself against individual liberty as a situation of balancing conflicting values. A reconsideration of Mill, particularly in light of the later work of Berlin on liberty, points toward a conception of relational liberty that is crucial for public health ethics because it contains within itself the basis for its own moral limitation.Download Free PDFView PDFLiberty, Mill, and the Framework of Public Health EthicsYashar  SaghaiIn this article we address the relevance of J.S. Mill’s political philosophy for a framework of public health ethics. In contrast to some readings of Mill, we reject the view that in the formulation of public policies liberties of all kinds enjoy an equal presumption in their favor. We argue that Mill also rejects this view and discuss the distinction that Mill makes between three kinds of liberty interests: interests that are immune from state interference; interests that enjoy a presumption in favor of liberty; and interests that enjoy no such presumption. We argue that what is of focal importance for Mill in protecting liberty is captured by the essential role that the value of self-determination plays in human well-being. Finally, we make the case for the plausibility of a more complex and nuanced Millian framework for public health ethics that would modify how the balancing of some liberties and public health interests should proceed by taking the thumb off the liberty end of the scale. Mill’s arguments and the legacy of liberalism support certain forms of state interference with marketplace liberties for the sake of public health objectives without any presumption in favor of liberty.Download Free PDFView PDFPublic Health Ethics and LiberalismLubomira RadoilskaDownload Free PDFView PDFA Broader Liberty: JS Mill, Paternalism, and the Publicâ•Žs Health2013 • Lawrence GostinIn most cases authors are permitted to post their version of the article (e.g. in Word or Tex form) to their personal website or institutional repository.

Mill and widely adopted in bioethics, an appropriate principle to guide public health regulation? The harm principle limits liberty-limiting interventions to those instances where the person poses a significant risk of harm to others. However, much of public health regulation is not primarily directed to avert risk to others, but to safeguard the health and safety of the individual him-or herself. Regulations regarding seatbelts, motorcycle helmets and the fluoridation of water are examples of pervasive public health regulations that are primarily intended to safeguard the individual&#39;s own health or safety.

But is this contention still valid when we aim to protect our health by exercising our rights in this direction and, in the process, we encroach on another fundamental right such as economic freedom? The establishment, through fundamental national and international regulations, of the right to health preservation, entitles every human being to exist, to develop, as health, alongside life, is a goal that each and every one of us strives for. However, exercising economic freedom ensures our development and the chance to lead a better life. In this article our focus is on the analysis of some aspects regarding the limitations of exercising such fundamental rights.Download Free PDFView PDFPublic healthA broader liberty: J.S. Mill, paternalism and the public's health2009 • Lawrence GostinIs the &#39;harm principle&#39;, famously propounded by J.S.

The harm principle limits liberty-limiting interventions to those instances where the person poses a significant risk of harm to others.

Regulations regarding seatbelts, motorcycle helmets and the fluoridation of water are examples of pervasive public health regulations that are primarily intended to safeguard the individual&#39;s own health or safety. Even laws designed to reduce smoking are justified, at least in substantial part, by the reduction of risk to the smoker. Certainly, scholars argue that there are &#39;other-regarding&#39; aspects to these types of laws, but there is little doubt that there are strong paternalistic features to these, and many other...Download Free PDFView PDFPublic Health EthicsCan Republicanism Tame Public Health?2016 • Daniel  WeinstockDownload Free PDFView PDFEmerging themes in epidemiologyIndividual freedom versus collective responsibility: too many rights make a wrong?2006 • Zia SadiqueDownload Free PDFView PDFToward a Philosophically Sensitive Definition of Public Health LawPatrick S.

These institutions often justify these mandates as necessary public health measures. Objectors, however, criticise these mandatory vaccine programs on the grounds that they infringe on individual liberty, namely medical autonomy and the right to refusal of care. Striving to reconcile the proven public-health benefits of mass-vaccinations with the inviolable autonomy of individuals, we defend mandatory vaccine programs while establishing the criteria necessary for an ethical implementation qua individual liberty. First, we establish the prima facie conflict between mandatory vaccine programs and individual liberty. Second, we establish the empirical benefits of mass-vaccinations and the dangers of insubstantial public vaccination. Third, we examine when – if ever – institutions are entitled to limit individual liberty for public health, and argue they may do so only to prevent harm to the public, not the private individual. Lastly, we will establish the necessary criteria for ethical mandatory vaccination programs.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
