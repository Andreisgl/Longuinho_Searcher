Somatic cell reprogramming-free generation of genetically modified pigsScience advances,  Sep 1, 2016Genetically modified pigs for biomedical applications have been mainly generated using the somati... more Genetically modified pigs for biomedical applications have been mainly generated using the somatic cell nuclear transfer technique; however, this approach requires complex micromanipulation techniques and sometimes increases the risks of both prenatal and postnatal death by faulty epigenetic reprogramming of a donor somatic cell nucleus. As a result, the production of genetically modified pigs has not been widely applied. We provide a simple method for CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 gene editing in pigs that involves the introduction of Cas9 protein and single-guide RNA into in vitro fertilized zygotes by electroporation. The use of gene editing by electroporation of Cas9 protein (GEEP) resulted in highly efficient targeted gene disruption and was validated by the efficient production of Myostatin mutant pigs. Because GEEP does not require the complex methods associated with micromanipulation for somatic reprogramming, it has the potential fo...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study evaluated the effects of sugar supplementation on the cryosurvival of spermatozoa from Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae). The post-thaw characteristics and fertility of spermatozoa cryopreserved with different sugars (glucose, lactose, and trehalose) were evaluated using heterologous in-vitro fertilisation with cat oocytes. All parameters of post-thaw spermatozoa significantly decreased as compared with those of fresh spermatozoa. The index of sperm motility for semen cryopreserved with lactose was significantly higher than that for semen cryopreserved with trehalose. The percentage of total fertilisation for tiger spermatozoa cryopreserved with trehalose was significantly lower than that for control cat spermatozoa. Our findings indicated that supplementation with lactose or glycerol as the main sugar in the egg yolk extender resulted in a better motility and fertility potential for post-thawed spermatozoa.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Generation of a TP53-modified porcine cancer model by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene modification in porcine zygotes via electroporationPloS one,  2018TP53 (which encodes p53) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancers.

In this study, we generated TP53-mutant pigs by gene editing via electroporation of the Cas9 protein (GEEP), a process that involves introducing the Cas9 protein and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 3 and intron 4 of TP53 into in vitro-fertilized zygotes. Zygotes modified by the sgRNAs were transferred to recipients, two of which gave birth to a total of 11 piglets. Of those 11 piglets, 9 survived. Molecular genetic analysis confirmed that 6 of 9 live piglets carried mutations in TP53, including 2 piglets with no wild-type (WT) sequences and 4 genetically mosaic piglets with WT sequences. One mosaic piglet had 142 and 151 bp deletions caused by a combination of the two sgRNAs. These piglets were continually monitored for 16 months and three of the genome-edited pigs (50%) exhibited various tumor phenotypes that we presumed were caused by TP53 mutations. Two mutant pigs with no WT sequences develo...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

GGTA1 encodes α1,3-galactosyltransferase, which is essential for the biosynthesis of galactosyl-alpha 1,3-galactose, the major xenoantigen causing hyperacute rejection. GGTA1-modified pigs, therefore, are promising donors for pig-to-human xenotransplantation. In this study, we developed a method for the introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into in vitro-fertilized porcine zygotes via electroporation to generate GGTA1-modified pigs. Results We designed five guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting distinct sites in GGTA1. After the introduction of the Cas9 protein with each gRNA via electroporation, the gene editing efficiency in blastocysts developed from zygotes was evaluated. The gRNA with the highest gene editing efficiency was used to generate GGTA1-edited pigs. Six piglets were delivered from two recipient gilts after the transfer of electroporated zygotes with the Cas9/gRNA comp...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Triple gene editing in porcine embryos using electroporation alone or in combination with microinjectionby Veterinary  World, Zhao Namula, Quynh Le, Maki Hirata, Takeshige Otoi, Do Lanh, and Qingyi LinVeterinary World,  Feb 27, 2022Background and Aim: We previously developed the gene-editing by electroporation (EP) of Cas9 prot... more Background and Aim: We previously developed the gene-editing by electroporation (EP) of Cas9 protein method, in which the CRISPR/Cas9 system was introduced into porcine in vitro fertilized (IVF) zygotes through EP to disrupt a target gene. This method should be further developed, and a combination of EP and MI methods should be evaluated in pigs. This study aimed to determine that a combination of microinjection (MI) and EP of CRISPR/Cas9 system could increase the rates of biallelic mutation for triple-gene knockout in porcine blastocysts. We targeted the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox1 (PDX1) gene using cytoplasmic MI 1 h before or after EP, which was used to edit alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) and cytidine 32 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) genes in porcine zygotes.Materials and Methods: We introduced guide RNAs targeting PDX1, GGTA1, and CMAH with the Cas9 protein into IVF zygotes (one-cell stage) through EP 10 h after the start of IVF (IVF; EP group) or in combination with MI (1 h before, MI-EP group, or after EP treatment EP-MI group) and evaluated the blastocyst formation rate and efficiency of target mutations in the resulting blastocysts.Results: Our results revealed a significant reduction in the rate of blastocyst formation in the two groups that underwent MI before and after EP (MI-EP and EP-MI group), compared with that in the groups treated with EP alone (EP group) (p=0.0224 and p<0.0001, respectively) and control (p=0.0029 and p<0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference in the total mutation rates among the treatment groups in the resulting blastocysts. As an only positive effect of additional MI treatment, the rate of blastocysts carrying biallelic mutations in at least one target gene was higher in the MI-EP group than in the EP group. However, there was no difference in the rates of embryos carrying biallelic mutations in more than 2 target genes.Conclusion: These results indicate that although a combination of MI and EP does not improve the mutation efficiency or biallelic mutation for triple-gene knockout, MI treatment before EP is better to reduce mortality in porcine zygotic gene editing through a combination of MI and EP.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
