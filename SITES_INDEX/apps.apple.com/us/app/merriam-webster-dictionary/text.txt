    Love this app
I stumbled across the Word of the Day a few years ago, and was getting it in my email every morning. I word share it on social media every day. But then it stopped coming. Seriously, MW, whatâ€™s up with that? I checked my spam folder, I tried unsubscribing and then subscribing again, but nothing. It just would not send. (I know...this doesnâ€™t really seem like a 5 star review, does it? Stay with me, it gets better. ðŸ˜‚)But finally it dawned on me that I was using the website a lot to look up words, either in the dictionary or the thesaurus, and that I should just look for the app. Hey, Iâ€™m 62 and a little slow with technology, OK? I love the app, and I use every day...usually several times a day. I look up meanings of unfamiliar words, of course. But I use the thesaurus a lot. When I am writing an email, or text, or posting on social media I frequently find myself searching my brain for a word that I know is perfect for the context, but my brain just canâ€™t seem to grab onto. (Old and slow, remember?) I go to the thesaurus and start putting in words that are similar, but not quite what Iâ€™m looking for. Most of the time, I find the word I want. Occasionally I donâ€™t, but I do find an acceptable substitute. I still check out the WOD, and share it on social media. And I am absolutely LOVING the way they subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) throw shade at the current President and administration. Itâ€™s a master class in shade throwing. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‚

    Great, and Helpful, App
Iâ€™m still in school, so something like a portable dictionary can be really handy. Though I donâ€™t pay for the premium so I canâ€™t look up everything(especially names) itâ€™s still extremely helpful. Sometimes I hear this strange word on TV or see it in a novel Iâ€™m reading and wonder what it is. Sometimes Iâ€™m doing school and something asks for the exact definition of a word. Instead it trooping to my basement and flipping for ages through gigantic, long, make your eyes bleed pages, I turn to my phone charging behind me and switch on this app. Iâ€™m also a small time writer, so the thesaurus is REALLY helpful when looking for that just right word to fit your story and writing style.      I also love the quizzes-theyâ€™re really unique and honestly do teach me words. Itâ€™s a little tempting slice of the Quissitive app. I canâ€™t wait until next weekâ€™s comes out.      This also very easy to navigate, and everything is clear and concise-so if your not sure you want to use some electronic confusing dictionary, never mind that. Webster is just a few clicks and youâ€™re to your definitions, and one more easy to see button will lead you to the thesaurus. Making an account is easy too!     Great app overall; Itâ€™s helped me a ton through school, writing, and my endeavors to increase my vocabulary. Thanks, Merriam Webster! No complaints here on my part.

    Itâ€™s the best for reading/writing!
I read books that often have unusual, or at least not in the common vernacular, words in them. I used to write them down and at the end of the day look them up in my physical dictionary or Encyclopedia set. Now I have one right in my pocket that is constantly being updated (my physical dictionary was from the early 1990s and encyclopedias given to me by my grandpa before he died when I was ten - Iâ€™m 30 now. New things are out there, new ideas, new ELEMENTS. And since Iâ€™m a writer, and I hate reusing a word too many times in an essay, paper, or story, the Thesaurus is a great and convenient tool thatâ€™s a nice little add on. Plus my family and I try to make up alternative definitions for the â€˜Word of the Dayâ€™. Funniest or most outrageous wins. Try it! It awesome! Especially if you donâ€™t know what the word means in the first place!Also, like me, if you are writing a story and need someone with the ranking of town mayor but in a tribal setting, the Thesaurus can actually give you the word you are looking for. I typed in â€˜lordâ€™ in the thesaurus and it gave me â€˜nabobâ€™ and â€˜nawabâ€™ two Urdu words for a local Muslim governor in the Mogul Empire (so like a mix between governor, lord, tax collector, and sheriff). If my story develops into neading a Muslim- type country, I can make sure the provinces have â€˜nabobsâ€™- cause now I know that word!
