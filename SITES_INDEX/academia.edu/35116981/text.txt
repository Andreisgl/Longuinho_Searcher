[AUTHOR'S FINAL MS]Was Aristotle a literary historian? [AUTHOR'S FINAL MS]Was Aristotle a literary historian? [AUTHOR'S FINAL MS]Stephen  Halliwell2017, J. Grethlein and A. Rengakos, eds., Griechische Literaturgeschichtsschreibung (De Gruyter, Berlin)]This article attempts to analyse in detail the problematic relationship between those elements in Aristotle's Poetics which modern scholars typically refer to as a form of 'literary history' and Aristotle's own conception of 'history' as evidenced in both the Poetics and elsewhere. Could/did Aristotle himself conceive of something like 'literary history'? If he had, would it have involved modifications to what are widely taken to be his own restrictions on the nature of history as an intellectual practice?See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Purpose of Aristotle's PoeticsAndrew FordDownload Free PDFView PDFUniversals, Plot and Form in Aristotle's PoeticsC.

Within this context the philosopher highlights that at the theatre we gain pleasure by viewing events which in reality would cause us sorrow. He justifies this phenomenon as such: at the theatre as well as in poetry we experience the aesthetic pleasure, because we are actually learning something. In the article the technical terms that are used by Aristotle (μανθάνειν, συλλογίζεσθαι) are emphatically investigated and it is shown that learning through poetry consists a form of recognising individual elements and tracing them to broader concepts and realities.Download Free PDFView PDFAesthetic Value in Classical Antiquity (Leiden: Brill)Audience, poetic justice, and aesthetic value in Aristotle’s Poetics2012 • Elsa BouchardDownload Free PDFView PDFTrends in Classics 5.1 (2013) 144-158Aristotle, Eratosthenes and the beginnings of Alexandrian scholarship on the ArchaiaFausto MontanaIn his work On the Ancient Comedy, fr. 25 Strecker, Eratosthenes of Cyrene gives a positive appraisal of a play on words by the comic poet Cratinus, describing it as οὐκ ἀρύθμως παίζειν. In this paper I will argue that what the ancient scholar had in mind was Aristotle’s view according to which the poets of the Archaia had very little idea of how ἐμμελῶς παίζειν (EN 4.14, 1128a 9). Several ancient scholia to Aristophanes’ comedies seem to testify to the influence of Eratosthenes’ attitude in this regard.Download Free PDFView PDFS K E N È Journal of Theatre and Drama StudiesAndrew FordA ritual frame for Aristotelian katharsis is more relevant to drama than the prevalent medical or cognitive approaches.Download Free PDFView PDFMiddle Comedy and the "Satyric" StyleCarl ShawDownload Free PDFView PDFAisthesis 1(1): 75-86Seeing through Plato's Looking Glass. Mythos and Mimesis from Republic to Poetics2017 • Andrea CapraThis paper revisits Plato's and Aristotle's views on mimesis with a special emphasis on mythos as an integral part of it. I argue that the Republic's notorious " mirror argument " is in fact ad hominem: first, Plato likely has in mind Agathon's mirror in Aristophanes' Thesmoforiazusae, where tragedy is construed as mimesis; second, the tongue-in-cheek claim that mirrors can reproduce invisible Hades, when read in combination with the following eschatological myth, suggests that Plato was not committed to a mirror-like view of art; third, the very omission of mythos shows that the argument is a self-consciously one-sided one, designed to caricature the artists' own pretensions of mirror-like realism. These points reinforce Stephen Halliwell's claim that Western aesthetics has been haunted by a «ghostly misapprehension» of Plato's mirror. Further evidence comes from Aristotle's " literary " (as opposed to Plato's " sociological ") discussion: rather than to the " mirror argument " , the beginning of the Poetics points to the Phaedo as the best source of information about Plato's views on poetry.Download Free PDFView PDFGreek and Roman Musical Studies New Music and Early Peripatetic Scholarship: The 'Degeneration' of Music as a Historiographical Turning Point - FINAL DRAFT before publication (Feb 2019), "Greek and Roman Musical Studies" 7.1, 2019, pp. 33-502019 • Ambra ToccoThis paper aims at presenting a preliminary survey of Peripatetic statements about the so-called 'New Music' as a significant turning point in musical history, addressed by most of the main exponents of the Peripatos as part of a wider engagement in the study of μουσική. The establishment of a 'history of music' , whose main phases are represented by its origins, its development through Archaic and Classical times and, eventually, its corruption into a 'degenerated' musical style, is crucial in the Peripatetic foundation of μουσική as a scholarly field of enquiry and is inherited by later sources that rely largely on Peripatetic materials, namely the pseudo-Plutarchaean De musica.Download Free PDFView PDF"Aristotle's Ambivalence: Pathē and Technē in the Rhetoric and Poetics"David RosenbloomDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
