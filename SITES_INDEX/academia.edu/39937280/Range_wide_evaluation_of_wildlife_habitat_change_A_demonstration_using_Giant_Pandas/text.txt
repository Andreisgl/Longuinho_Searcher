While habitat distribution has been evaluated for many species, information on habitat change is often unclear, particularly across entire geographic ranges. Here we use the iconic giant panda (Ailuropoda melano-leuca) as a model species and present an advanced approach to evaluate its habitat change across an entire geographic range through the integration of time-series satellite imagery and field data. Our results show that despite a few areas showing habitat degradation, both the overall habitat suitability and habitat area increased between the early 2000s and the early 2010s. Our results also indicate that conservation efforts in China have achieved success beyond the boundaries of nature reserves, since panda habitat outside nature reserves shows a higher proportional growth than inside the reserves. Despite these promising trends, we found habitat fragmentation remains a threat to the species' long-term survival. These results provide valuable information to assess the appropriateness of recent decision by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that down-listed the giant panda from endangered to vulnerable species, while laying a good foundation for the design of future conservation efforts. The approach described here may also be easily implemented for evaluating range-wide habitat change for many other species around the world and thus help achieve biodiversity conservation objectives such as those set by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBiological ConservationRange-wide analysis of wildlife habitat: Implications for conservation2010 • Jianguo LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFBioOnePandas, plants, and people2014 • Jianguo LiuPlants are essential for the survival and sustainability of both humans and wildlife species around the world. However, human activities have directly and indirectly affected almost all plants, which in turn have produced cascading effects on humans and wildlife through disruption of crucial ecosystem services and wildlife habitat. Understanding such complex interactions is crucial for developing better policies that reconcile the needs of an ever-growing human population with biodiversity conservation. Using the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework, this article synthesizes research on the complex interactions of plant species, giant pandas, and people. The CHANS framework is particularly useful for uncovering key patterns and processes behind plant-animal interactions modified by human activities. Our synthesis shows that many human factors, including socioeconomic and demographic, together with other factors (e.g., projected global climate change), exhibit reciprocal interactions with pandas and the plant species that comprise their habitat. Although substantial efforts have been made to preserve plants and wildlife, much work still remains to be done, including the expansion and more effective management of protected areas, use of native plant species in reforestation/afforestation programs, and active participation of local residents in conservation actions.Download Free PDFView PDFChinese Geographical ScienceEvaluating Conservation Effectiveness of Nature Reserves Established for Surrogate Species: Case of a Giant Panda Nature Reserve in Qinling Mountains, China2014 • Jianguo LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFEcosphereHidden roles of protected areas in the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services2017 • Jianguo LiuMany of the current protected areas worldwide are established for the conservation of particular species of interest, yet their benefits may go beyond these species since they could also contribute to the conservation of entire biodiversity pools. In addition, they may also contribute to the provision of ecosystem services. However, these benefits are seldom evaluated or targeted for improvement. Using field and remotely sensed data, we evaluated how representative of the plant biodiversity pool and of carbon sequestration is a network of nature reserves specifically established for the conservation of a target species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), an icon of biodiversity conservation. Our results show that forest structure (including tree/bamboo species composition) within the nature reserve network is representative of the forest structure across the entire study region, with the exception of forests located at lower elevations which are not well represented. In addition, of the areas of forest cover gained across the study region between 2000 and 2010 (~10,700 km2 ) only about 15% occurred within panda reserves. Furthermore, accumulated net primary productivity (NPP) per year between 2000 and 2010 across the study region exhibited a monotonic increase, while the relative contribution of the reserve network to this accumulated NPP remained relatively constant (~25.5%). This suggests that the areas inside nature reserves may be reaching their maximum forest cover and NPP levels. Therefore, despite the significant positive roles of these reserves beyond the conservation of the species of interest, further conservation actions are needed to maintain and improve the conservation of regional biodiversity pools, as well as to improve gains in forest cover and in carbon sequestration. The procedures shown in this study are easily transferable to other study regions for assessing the benefits they provide beyond the conservation of the target(s) species of interest.Download Free PDFView PDFApplication of ecological-niche factor analysis in habitat assessment of giant pandas2008 • Wei XuDownload Free PDFView PDFUrsusA synthesis of giant panda habitat selection2014 • Jianguo LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFForest Ecology and ManagementNatural recovery and restoration in giant panda habitat after the Wenchuan earthquake2014 • Jianguo LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological ConservationEvaluating the efﬁcacy of zoning designations for protected area management2011 • Jianguo LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological IndicatorsLand surface phenology as an indicator of biodiversity patterns2016 • Jianguo LiuWith the rapid decline in biodiversity worldwide it is imperative to develop procedures for assessing changes in biodiversity across space. The synoptic view provided by imaging remote sensors constitutes a suitable approach for analyzing biodiversity from local to regional scales. A procedure based on the close relationship between floristic similarity and the similarity in land surface phenology was recently developed and successfully applied to assess diversity patterns using time series imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). However, as it depends on high temporal resolution remotely sensed data (e.g., MODIS), the procedure is constrained by the coarse spatial resolution characterizing these high temporal resolution data. Using an optimized technique for image fusion, we combined high temporal resolution data acquired by the MODIS sensor system with moderate spatial resolution data acquired by the Landsat TM/ETM+ sensor systems. Our results show that the MODIS/Landsat data fusion allows the characterization of land surface phenology at higher spatial resolutions, which better corresponded with information acquired within vegetation survey plots established in temperate montane forests located in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. As such, the procedure is useful for capturing changes in biodiversity induced by disturbances operating at large spatial scales and constitutes a suitable tool for monitoring and managing biodiversity.Download Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of  …Evaluating MODIS data for mapping wildlife habitat distribution2008 • gandotra nainaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
