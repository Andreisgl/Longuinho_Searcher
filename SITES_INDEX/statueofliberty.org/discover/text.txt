About the Database The Passenger Search database allows you to look for family members who arrived at the Port of New York from 1820 to 1957. At the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration and on the Foundation’s website you can explore your family heritage by searching nearly 65 million passenger records and ship manifests, examining information collected at debarkation points. Some passenger records are more complete than others, but many reveal name, age, date of arrival, ship name, nationality, birthplace, occupation, last residence overseas, and final destination. Some even have information about how many bags a passenger had, the amount of money they carried, and where they stayed on the ship.We invite you to explore the Passenger Search database and start uncovering your family’s story. Get a first hand sense of the road that brought you here, and find your place in the larger story of American immigration. Where to Begin All you need to get going is a name, but your search will be a lot easier and more accurate if you start off with more information. If you have only a name to work with — and that name is John Smith, for instance — you’re going to be combing through thousands of records with no clue as to which John Smith is your great-grandfather. Even more-uncommon names could give you hundreds of results.To prepare for your search and ensure best results, we recommend gathering as much information as you can. Did your relative have travel companions? What was their hometown? When did they arrive in the U.S.? Our database can account for different surname spellings, but if you believe your passenger made a dramatic change to the family name it will be beneficial to know their birth name.Search Passengers Making Edits The Foundation is now collaborating with FamilySearch to improve the process of annotating and correcting indexed manifest records, which enables researchers to find arrival records more effectively.If you have identified a record in need of editing (e.g., misspelled name), simply go to the FamilySearch website to submit the proposed changes. This article outlines the steps. This collaboration also includes annotations. If you would like to contribute an annotation (e.g., marriage date, place of residency), reference this article on the FamilySearch website for directions.The Foundation will receive updated data from FamilySearch periodically, which will make the information available through the Ellis Island Database.            Helpful Hints Research TipsIt’s good to prepare for your search by gathering details about your passenger. Helpful details include: the passenger’s first and last names; approximate year of arrival; “ethnicity” (which may include race, nationality, and/or religion); approximate age at arrival; ship of travel; port of departure; and whether the passenger traveled with other family members.While not all of this information is required for a successful search, having some knowledge about a passenger’s arrival is very useful. A Note on NamesRemember, ship manifest records were filled out at the ship’s Port of Departure, not at Ellis Island. The names listed on a manifest reflect the passenger’s “original” name and were not ‘changed’ at Ellis Island, despite this popular myth.For example, an Italian immigrant you knew as “Joseph” will likely be listed as “Giuseppe”. A German called “John” will likely be “Johan” or “Johannes”. And a Jewish male called “Sam” could be “Schmuel” or their given Hebrew name. The same applies for men, women, and children.
