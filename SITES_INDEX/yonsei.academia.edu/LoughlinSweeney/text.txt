'Critical Human Rights Education and Technologies of Peace: a teleology too far?' in M. Garrido, ed., Human Rights and Technology: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (San Jose, 2017), pp. 260-81.by Kris H. Lee, Loughlin J V Sweeney, and Kevin KesterIn this chapter, we discuss the intersections between human rights, human rights education, and t... more In this chapter, we discuss the intersections between human rights, human rights education, and technology. In particular, drawing on Foucault, we problematize the mainstream approaches to these endeavors as framed within liberal humanist ideals. To locate human rights within a liberal humanist framework, we first discuss human rights from its common historical and normative positions. Then, we introduce Foucault’s ‘technology’ and argue human rights education as the technological arm of liberal human rights discourse. By framing education (i.e. pedagogic action) as a technology, from an epistemological standpoint the article enters into a theatre of critique. Initially, there are three critiques: the first concerns the intersections of notions of progress and technologic solutions. The second deals with the de-politicization common within technocratic approaches to peacebuilding that dehumanize the subject. These critiques engender the importance of thoroughly examining the underlying premises of human rights and human right education as a technology prior to a de-political proliferation of UN ideals through the Millennium and Sustainable Development Goals. Finally, having gone through this reflexive argument, human rights education will then be discussed in relation to the new directions and new possibilities this argument supports.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The War of Independence represented the eclipse of the Irish military elite: while some of its members sought to continue rendering service to their homeland in various capacities, many opted instead to leave Ireland, never to return home. Most officers were strongly unionist in their convictions, though there were notable exceptions. What they all agreed on was the vital importance of maintaining the connection between Ireland and the overseas empire (in order to ensure access to employment), and the maintenance of the King as the head of state (to satisfy the deeply felt crown loyalty that was an essential component of an officer’s identity). Some opted for extreme measures—either because of their background as colonial officers, or simply due to financial necessity—and joined the notorious Auxiliary Corps of the Royal Irish Constabulary, which was responsible for a string of brutal extralegal reprisals during the War of Independence. This chapter examines a number of open questions relating to the war, concerning the activities of nationalist officers in the conflict, and the question of whether the Auxiliary Corps indeed contained members of the Irish military elite. The chapter is framed by a discussion of the narrative of decline that accompanied the Irish establishment’s loss of social position in this period.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of these was, of course, the First World War; the other, some months earlier, was the so-called Curragh mutiny, in which dozens of Irish officers staged a protest against War Office plans to mobilise against an anticipated Unionist uprising in Ulster. The tumult of the Irish question had finally, and dramatically, impacted the military elite, precipitating a systemic crisis in the British Army. Officers are found to have evinced a surprising diversity of reactions to the deteriorating political situation in Ireland and to the emerging nationalist and unionist militia organisations which directly contested Irish officers’ authority and legitimacy as military elites. Catholic and nationalist officers’ reactions to this crisis are particularly noteworthy, strongly reflecting the powerful contradictions in identity that this extraordinary situation engendered in the military elite.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Setbacks and inefficiencies during the Indian Rebellion and the Crimean War occasioned a number of reforms, notable among which was the abolition of the practice of purchasing officer commissions. From 1871 onwards, all officers would be promoted on merit—at least in theory. In Ireland, this provided an unprecedented opportunity for middle-class young men seeking to accumulate social capital by becoming military officers. The role of the British Army in Irish society is reviewed from a number of perspectives and difficulties relating to terminology are discussed—traditional histories of elites tend to conflate officers with the ‘Anglo-Irish’, which do not satisfactorily capture the surprising diversity of backgrounds in evidence in the officer corps and the subtle underlying class dynamics that directed the life of a British military officer. The case is made for the importance of class, empire, identity, and political and social context for arriving at a comprehensive understanding of Irish military elites in the complex and rapidly changing Ireland of the late nineteenth century.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Reflections on decolonizing peace education in Korea: a critique and some decolonial pedagogic strategiesTeaching in Higher Education,  2019ABSTRACT Universities and scholars around the world teach and research extensively in the field o... more ABSTRACT Universities and scholars around the world teach and research extensively in the field of peace education; yet, despite a plethora of diverse scholarship, educational programs are often critiqued as dominated by the English-speaking world. This paper employs the intersecting lenses of decolonization and postcolonial theory to explore and challenge the perceived dominance of Western literature and practice. Using a criss-crossing comparison method, English and Korean literatures are compared to ascertain the extent of Western-centricity within Korean higher education peace studies, and to offer a critical discussion of liberal peacebuilding, and linear problem-solving models within the literatures. Counter-arguments and policy recommendations are considered. The paper concludes that for peace education to fulfill its mission, global educational decolonization movements need to be strengthened. It is argued that efforts toward decolonization of Korean peace education could support the global movement toward a more socially just peace education for the twenty-first century.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Problems of the Far East': Imperial geopolitics reflected in the Korean travelogues of British officials, 1889-1900Acta Koreana,  2019At the end of the nineteenth century, western incursions into Korea had gradually opened the peni... more At the end of the nineteenth century, western incursions into Korea had gradually opened the peninsula to the outside world, and by the 1890s foreigners were not only permitted to reside in the country, but becoming commonplace in treaty ports and in the capital. At the same time, Britain, Russia, and increasingly, Japan, were engaged in a contest for geopolitical supremacy in the northern Pacific; Great Power contestation over access to trade in north China centred on the Korean peninsula as a major point of tension for the international balance of power. In this period a number of British official visitors came to Korea, and three prepared reports on the characteristics of the Korean people, society, economy, and geography. They were all politicians or colonial functionaries: Charles W. Campbell, a naturalist and consular official stationed in Seoul, George Nathaniel Curzon, a Conservative member of Parliament, who would later become Viceroy of India, and Joseph Walton, a Liberal member of Parliament from Yorkshire with a consuming interest in East Asian affairs. These men’s narratives provided a great deal of the information on Korea available to the British official mind as it formulated its East Asian policy. This article assesses the underlying motivations behind these visits, and examines the effect of British regional geopolitics on these men’s attitudes to encounter in Korea.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Having existed within the sphere of China for centuries, it found itself the subject of expansionary ambitions by the Russian and Japanese empires, and also drawn, in a limited way, into the sphere of Britain’s informal empire. This paper discusses the extent to which a Korean dimension was incorporated into British parliamentary discourse in this period. It analyzes the Korean issues that captured the attention of British MPs, and examines the extent of their knowledge of Korean affairs in the late nineteenth century. It also considers the relevance of concepts of ‘informal empire’ and the ‘official mind’ to the discussion of East Asian imperial and geopolitical history in the late nineteenth century.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Historians have taken Said’s work in many innovative directions: a greater emphasis on indigenous agency and the practicalities of direct and indirect colonial rule; the role of the ‘subaltern’ in mediating encounter between colonizers and the colonized; and, crucially, the extent to which orientalist preconceptions were eroded by the pragmatic, ‘transactional’ nature of colonial relations at an imperial frontier that was contested and ambiguous. Metropolitan attitudestoward empire have been given further complexity with the recognition of the differences between the ‘four nations’ constituting the Union. This paper reviews these new methodological frameworks and examines their relevance to the study of ‘imperial Irishmen’ in multiple Asian localities, all ofwhom were inculcated in the colonial military sphere, as officers, correspondents, and administrators. It cites new indicative examples of Irish attitudes to empire derived from correspondence and memoirs, and proposes new avenues of research into the complexities of colonial rule which marrythe lens of orientalism with historical approaches emphasizing transaction and indigenous agency.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Empire in the opening years of th... more This paper seeks to locate the Irish experience of the BritishEmpire in the opening years of the twentieth century through the lens of its military elite. The Edwardian era in Ireland was remembered by elites as a kind of 'calm before the storm' between the turbulent years of land agitation and the dislocating events leading eventually to the War of Independence – though political and national ferment was bubbling beneath the surface throughout. The Irish military establishment played a significant role in this period, both as a highly-visible component of the Anglo-Irish elite and on its own: Irish regiments and officers weredisproportionately represented in the Boer War, and Ireland, like the rest of the home nations, basked in imperial glory following victory; additionally, Irish landowners with military experience were integral to the settlement of the Wyndham Land Act in 1903, drawing on their network of army contacts. The army was called onto the streets of Belfast in 1907 (as it was previously in 1893), the first of many such occurrences throughout the twentieth century.The mentality of the officer corps in this period was informed not only by these influences, but also arguably by the increasing infiltration of the middle class (Catholic and Protestant) into its precincts, as explored in the work of Lawrence Mcbride and Fergus Campbell. Examining the mentalities of the Edwardian corps may give us some insight by contextualising the reactions of elites to the political struggles culminating in Irish independence and civil war, and explain the background to the sectarian split in the army surrounding Irish Home Rule in 1912.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Military Irishness at the frontiers of empire: a contested identity?' Trinity College Dublin, 13 February 2015This paper seeks to address, with reference to the research currently being undertaken by Irish s... more This paper seeks to address, with reference to the research currently being undertaken by Irish scholars across the world, the extent to which Irishness in the British Army was a problematic or contested identity, particularly among Irish military officers posted far from home in the unfamiliar and frequently hostile environments of Britain’s colonies. The written testimony of these men often indicates a bifurcated sense of allegiance: based on class and the social distinctions of the Anglo-Irish when at home, but animated by a sense of romanticism about Ireland when abroad. It will explore the implications of this identity in these men’s private and professional lives, as they moved within the social milieu of the pan-imperial elite, and the extent to which spaces could be found within the monolithic institutional identity of the officer corps for the expression of individual difference. It will also seek to understand Irish officers’ reactions to differing formulations of Irishness at home, positioning pre-First World War Ireland within the context of the British overseas empire. Through addressing these questions, an insight will be gained into the credulity of the claim that the British military, through its Irish regiments, promoted a non-sectarian martial identity of imagined Irishness distinct from other constructions of national identity.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

While the army resented aiding the civil power in such incidents, it generally undertook them without protest. When the possibility of a similar deployment was mooted in 1914 however, there was a crisis as officers resigned instead of following orders. What had changed? An examination of Irish officers’ status as political and religious minorities amid the radicalising environment of pre-First World War Ireland, and their imperial context as exemplars of ‘muscular Christianity’, may provide an answer.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Noblesse Oblige' and the socialization of Irish counter-elites in the pre-First World War military establishmentUniversity of Cambridge,  2015This paper examines the importance of social distinction and gentility - the 'officer and gentlem... more This paper examines the importance of social distinction and gentility - the 'officer and gentleman' - in Ireland before the Great War. According to the studies undertaken by Fergus Campbell and Lawrence McBride, elite networks in Ireland were becoming more open, meritocratic and professional in this period - however, despite the contemporary debates about professionalization at the War Office, the military has not been included in these studies. It is the contention of this paper that the military establishment in Ireland resisted professionalization, and that its failure to create space for a rising counter-elite contributed to the political alienation of officers which manifested itself in the decade 1912-1922. It argues that the political crises surrounding Irish officers, from the Curragh incident to the rise of armed volunteer movements, and subsequent narratives of decline and fall in Anglo-Irish reminiscences of the First World War, need to be understood in the context of an exclusive elite network which failed to reproduce itself in this period.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Forgotten First World WarIt is an unfairly Eurocentric reading of the First World War to dismiss the conflicts that took p... more It is an unfairly Eurocentric reading of the First World War to dismiss the conflicts that took place, under imperial officers but predominantly involving men and women from the Middle East, South Pacific, Australia, North America, China, Japan, India, and across the African continent between 1914 and 1918, as mere ‘sideshows’ to a European War; in much the same way as in Europe, the First World War globally sowed the seeds of conflict and upheaval, and the post-war environment provided the conditions for what came after. The following sections contain just a few examples of its crucial importance to global history, and attempt to put the ‘world’ back into the First World War.In Asia, the victory of Japan against a European power, Germany, in 1914 reinforced its ascendency as an imperial nation, which had begun with the Russo-Japanese war a decade earlier, while in India the huge cost in lives and revenue spent fighting a distant war fed anti-colonial and independence movements. In Africa, the deep scars riven across the land by war defined the boundaries, language and culture of many modern nations. Finally, in the Middle East, the outcome of the First World War on the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the British mandate in Palestine, and the Western involvement in Persia and the Arabian Peninsula echo down to the present state of the region. This topic seeks to look beyond the Western Front to provoke questions about the truly world-spanning nature of the First World War.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Though its industrial primacy is behind it, it continues to be a major player in international finance. Its military is garrisoned in stations around the world and frequently takes part in faraway conflicts. Its cultural and political reach is extended by the Commonwealth and by Britain's status as a cultural melting-pot. It retains a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. And yet, at the same time, there is a persistent aspect of British culture which emphasises the insular, the exceptional and the isolationist as desirable facets of Britishness. None of this happened overnight – the origins of contemporary Britain stretch far back into its history as an imperial power.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
