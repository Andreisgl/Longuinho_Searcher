Integrating perspectives from musicology with the cognitive sciences, author Zachary Wallmark advances a novel model of timbre interpretation that takes into account the bodily, sensorimotor dynamics of sound production and perception. The contribution of timbre to musical experience is clearest in drastic situations where meaning is itself contested; that is, in polarizing contexts of reception where evaluation of "musical" timbre by some listeners collides headlong against a competing claim-that it is just "noise." Taking this ubiquitous moment as a starting point, the book explores affect, reception, and timbre semantics through diverse cultural-historical case studies that frustrate the acoustic and perceptual boundary between musical sound and noise.Nothing but Noise includes chapters on the racial and gender politics in the reception of free jazz saxophone "screaming" in the late 1960s; an analysis of contested timbral ideals in the performance practices of the Japanese shakuhachi flute; and an historical examination of the overlooked role of "brutal" timbres in the moral panic over heavy metal in the eighties and nineties. The book closes with a discussion of the slippery social fault lines separating perceptions of musical sound from noise and the ethical stakes of encountering another's "aural face."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ranging from the twang of country banjoes and the sheen of hip-hop strings to the crunch of amplified guitars and the thump of subwoofers on the dancefloor, this volume attempts to bridge the gap between timbre, our name for the purely acoustic characteristics of sound waves, and tone, an emergent musical construct that straddles the borderline between the perceptual and the political. Essays engage with the entire history of popular music as recorded sound, from the 1930s to the present day, under four large categories. “Genre” asks how sonic signatures define musical identities and publics; “Voice” considers the most naturalized musical instrument, the human voice, as racial and gendered signifier, as property or likeness, and as raw material for algorithmic perfection through software; “Instrument” tells stories of the way some iconic pop music machines—guitars, strings, synthesizers—got (or lost) their distinctive sounds; “Production” then puts it all together, asking structural questions about what happens in a recording studio, what is produced (sonic cartoons? rockist authenticity? empty space?) and what it all might mean. With a general theoretical Introduction by the editors, and an Afterword by noted popular music scholar Simon Frith.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although evolutionary theories have proposed that both empathy and music help to foster social connection, few studies to date have examined the relation between behavioral assessments of empathic processes for people and music. We examined this question using 2 independent samples: a laboratory sample of undergraduates (n = 236) and a larger online direct replication with participants across the United States (n = 596). Across both samples, linear mixed effects models showed positive associations between empathic accuracy and affect sharing for people telling personal stories and for musical expression, and results were maintained when including relevant individual differences as covariates. These findings provide initial evidence of a relation between behaviorally assessed empathic processes across social and musical domains. Future research is needed to build upon this evidence by investigating whether active, socially engaged music listening may have a beneficial effect on social cognition.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Does Timbre Modulate Visual Perception? Exploring Crossmodal InteractionsMusic Perception,  2021Musical timbre is often described using terms from non-auditory senses, mainly vision and touch; ... more Musical timbre is often described using terms from non-auditory senses, mainly vision and touch; but it is not clear whether crossmodality in timbre semantics reflects multisensory processing or simply linguistic convention. If multisensory processing is involved in timbre perception, the mechanism governing the interaction remains unknown. To investigate whether timbres commonly perceived as ‘‘bright-dark’’ facilitate or interfere with visual perception (darkness- brightness), we designed two speeded classification experiments. Participants were presented consecutive images of slightly varying (or the same) brightness along with task-irrelevant auditory primes (‘‘bright’’ or ‘‘dark’’ tones) and asked to quickly identify whether the second image was brighter/darker than the first. Incongruent prime-stimulus combinations produced significantly more response errors compared to congruent combinations but choice reaction time was unaffected. Furthermore, responses in a deceptive identical-image condition indicated subtle semantically congruent response bias. Additionally, in Experiment 2 (which also incorporated a spatial texture task), measures of reaction time (RT) and accuracy were used to construct speed-accuracy tradeoff functions (SATFs) in order to critically compare two hypothesized mechanisms for timbre-based crossmodal interactions, sensory response change vs. shift in response criterion. Results of the SATF analysis are largely consistent with the response criterion hypothesis, although without conclusively ruling out sensory change.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Timbre is often described using crossmodal adjectives (e.g., bright, smooth). However, it is not clear whether these semantic conventions are primarily the result of low-level multisensory interactions or are more a product of associative learning and musical training. Do young children exhibit crossmodal correspondences involving timbre? The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of timbre, age, and sensory modality (visual and tactile) on the consistency and congruency of young children's patterns of crossmodal mappings. Preschool children (N = 69, M age = 4.51) completed a novel audiovisual and audio-tactile association task. Results indicate that children are moderately consistent in their associations; mappings are largely congruent with adult associations; and results suggest a possible developmental time course for the establishment of crossmodal correspondences between approximately ages 3 and 6. However, congruency is dependent on modality, with robust agreement in the tactile-auditory domain but a good deal more variance and a stronger developmental influence on visual-auditory associations. These results are the first to demonstrate that crossmodal correspondences are a feature of timbre perception early in development.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the standard experimental paradigm, participants hear timbral stimuli and provide behavioral responses. However, it remains unclear the extent to which descriptive consistency would be observed if this paradigm were reversed, that is, if participants were instructed to create novel timbres in response to target adjectives. Given an unfamiliar synthesis interface, would musically trained participants craft similar timbral profiles for the same familiar adjectives? In this study, we explore timbre semantics using a novel frequency modulation (FM) synthesis production task. Participants (N=64) created unique timbral outputs in response to 20 common timbre descriptors drawn from orchestration treatises (e.g., brilliant, dull, harsh). Acoustic analyses of the resultant 1,280 signals, in conjunction with linear mixed-effects modeling and clustering analysis, indicate that participants were moderately consistent in their timbral creations. Word valence and arousal interacted to influence average spectral centroid and noisiness. Specifically, clearly positive and negative words produced significantly different acoustical profiles than more affectively neutral words. This result confirms a number of findings from the perceptual literature while offering preliminary evidence that affective dimensions of timbre semantics systematically influence sound production in an unfamiliar context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although multisensory integration between visual/tactile processing and hearing has been demonstrated for pitch and loudness, timbre is not well understood as a locus of cross-modal mappings. Are people consistent in these semantic associations? Do cross-modal terms reflect dimensional interactions in timbre processing? Here I designed two experiments to investigate crosstalk between timbre semantics and perception through the use of Stroop-type speeded classification. Experiment 1 found that incongruent pairings of instrument timbres and written names caused significant Stroop-type interference relative to congruent pairs, indicating bidirectional crosstalk between semantic and auditory modalities. Pre-Experiment 2 asked participants to rate natural and synthesized timbres on semantic differential scales capturing luminance (brightness) and texture (roughness) associations, finding substantial consistency for a number of timbres. Acoustic correlates of these associations were also assessed, indicating an important role for high-frequency energy in the intensity of cross-modal ratings. Experiment 2 used timbre adjectives and sound stimuli validated in the previous experiment in two variants of a semantic-auditory Stroop-type task. Results of linear mixed-effects modeling of reaction time and accuracy showed slight interference in semantic processing when adjectives were paired with cross-modally incongruent instrument timbres (e.g., the word "smooth" with a "rough" timbre). Taken together, I conclude by suggesting that semantic crosstalk in timbre processing may be partially automatic and could reflect weak synesthetic congruency between interconnected sensory domains.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Perceptual studies have revealed a number of verbal attributes that reliably map onto timbral qualities, but the conventions of timbre description in spoken and written discourse remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration provide a valuable source of natural language about instrumental timbre. This article uses methods from corpus linguistics to explore the semantic features of timbre through a quantitative analysis of 11 orchestration treatises and manuals. Findings reveal a relatively constrained vocabulary for timbre: about 50 adjectives account for half of all descriptions in the corpus. The timbre lexicon can be categorized according to affect, matter, metaphor, mimesis, action, acoustics, and onomatopoeia, and further reduced to three latent conceptual dimensions, which are labeled and discussed. Descriptive patterns vary systematically by instrument and instrument family, suggesting certain regularities and consistencies to timbre description in the orchestral tradition. This study helps test the long-held assumption that conventions of timbre description are vague and unsystematic, and offers a cognitive linguistic account of the timbre-language connection.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Does empathy modulate neural responses to musical sounds? We designed two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to address this question. In Experiment 1, subjects listened to brief isolated musical timbres while being scanned. In Experiment 2, subjects listened to excerpts of music in four conditions (familiar liked (FL)/disliked and unfamiliar liked (UL)/disliked). For both types of musical stimuli, emotional and cognitive forms of trait empathy modulated activity in sensorimotor and cognitive areas: in the first experiment, empathy was primarily correlated with activity in supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula; in Experiment 2, empathy was mainly correlated with activity in prefrontal, temporo-parietal and reward areas. Taken together, these findings reveal the interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of empathy in response to musical sounds, in line with recent findings from other cognitive domains.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Embodied Listening and Timbre: Perceptual, Acoustical, and Neural Correlatesby Zachary Wallmark, Choi Deblieck, and Roger KendallMusic Perception,  2018Timbre plays an essential role in transmitting musical affect, and in recent years, our understan... more Timbre plays an essential role in transmitting musical affect, and in recent years, our understanding of emotional expression in music has been enriched by contributions from the burgeoning field of embodied music cognition. However, little attention has been paid to timbre as a possible mediator between musical embodiment and affect. In three experiments, we investigated the embodied dimensions of timbre perception by focusing on timbral qualities considered “noisy” and aversive. In Experiment 1, participants rated brief isolated natural timbres scaled into ordinal levels of “noisiness.” Experiment 2 employed the same design with a focus on polyphonic timbre, using brief (400 ms) excerpts from 6 popular music genres as stimuli. In Experiment 3, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore neural activations associated with perception of stimuli from Experiment 1. Converging results from behavioral, acoustical, and fMRI data suggest a motor component to timbre processing, particularly timbral qualities considered “noisy,” indicating a possible enactive mechanism in timbre processing. Activity in somatomotor areas, insula, and the limbic system increased the more participants disliked a timbre, and connectivity between the premotor cortex and insula relay decreased. Implications for recent theories of embodied music cognition, affect, and timbre semantics are discussed in conclusion.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Neural Correlates of Dispositional Empathy in the Perception of Isolated Timbresby Zachary Wallmark and Choi DeblieckProceedings of the International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC14), San Francisco,  2016Neuroimaging studies on sensorimotor integration and social cognition suggest that individuals wi... more Neuroimaging studies on sensorimotor integration and social cognition suggest that individuals with high dispositional empathy (measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, or IRI) process human-made action sounds with greater involvement from motor areas than individuals with lower dispositional empathy. Does high empathy correlate with increased motor activity when listening to musical sounds as well? To address this question, we performed an fMRI study with fifteen subjects. Stimuli consisted of 12 isolated 2-second natural instrument and vocal timbres in " regular " and " noisy " versions. With " empathic concern " scores from the IRI included as covariates, we found that high-empathy individuals processed noisier qualities of timbre with heightened motor activity relative to regular timbres, particularly in the supplementary motor area (SMA). We interpret these results through the lens of embodied music cognition to suggest that dispositional empathy modulates motor resonance during the perception of the sounds of others, especially when these sounds signal heightened arousal and negative valence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sounding Sawari: Body and Timbre in Shakuhachi PerformanceThe Japanese shakuhachi flute is a “tone-color instrument” (neiro-gakki): its chief aesthetic val... more The Japanese shakuhachi flute is a “tone-color instrument” (neiro-gakki): its chief aesthetic value lies in the manipulation of timbre independent of musical context. Yet while scholars have long acknowledged the primacy of timbre in shakuhachi expression (Gutzwiller 1974), the idiosyncratic performance practices required to manifest its kaleidoscopic array of sonic possibilities have long been overlooked as a locus of musical meaning. In this presentation, I track the relationship between body mechanics, ecological psychoacoustics, and aesthetics in the shakuhachi tradition through a detailed “timbral-corporeal” (Eidsheim 2008) analysis of representative classical (honkyoku) piece “Sokkan.” I argue that the interrelation of timbre and embodiment plays a crucial role in the affective grammar of “Sokkan,” and the shakuhachi more generally. Timbral manipulations in shakuhachi music—including “gloomy” sounds produced by the meri technique, “fuzzy” tones of “bamboo-grass blowing” (sasane), and the powerful, noisy rush of the “thrashing breath” technique (muraiki)—are supported by a range of head, jaw, lip, and tongue movements, some quite difficult to properly execute. This paradigm of body-instrument interaction is subsumed under a well-known yet poorly understood timbral-corporeal principle of Japanese music: sawari (literally “to touch”). Adding to standard accounts of sawari with a synthesis of embodied cognition theory and ten years participant-observer study with Japanese and American grandmasters (daishihan)—including demonstrations on the instrument—I conclude by suggesting that the bodily negotiations inherent in performance are as essential to shakuhachi aesthetics as the resulting timbral changes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Is Timbre a Metaphor?Musical timbre has long been understood in metaphorical terms. Since it lacks its own domain-spec... more Musical timbre has long been understood in metaphorical terms. Since it lacks its own domain-specific vocabulary, its description borrows pervasively from other sensory domains, particularly vision and touch (e.g., bright, rough). Accounting for this synaesthetic borrowing using cognitive linguistic and neuroimaging methods, in this paper I argue that common verbal descriptions of timbre reflect coherent, embodied, and fundamentally transformative characteristics of sonic experience. They are not arbitrary, as some have suggested. To make this point, I ask two broad questions: (1) why do we use the words we do to describe timbre? and (2) how do common metaphors influence how timbre is perceived and conceptualized? I address these questions through the framework of embodied cognition, with extensive reference to theories of image schemata and conceptual metaphor. Metaphors for timbre are grounded in certain shared experiential schemata of physical force: prior to the acoustic, all timbres are really “timbre-corporeal events.” The evental, embodied nature of sound production and perception is exhibited most clearly in “noisy” timbres, which often index high-force acts typically described using negative tactile metaphors (harsh, grating, etc.). Exploring this connection, I share findings from original fMRI research indicating a special three-way link between tactile, metaphor, and auditory processing in the perception of (noisy) timbre. Since certain timbral qualities trigger somatosensory reactions consistent with their grounding metaphors, I propose in conclusion that metaphors for timbre are performative as much as they are descriptive.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Timbral Noisiness Modulates Activity in Motor and Limbic RegionsAre motor areas involved in timbre processing?

Based on the results of a parallel behavioral experiment showing a correlation between physical exertion and timbral noisiness, we hypothesized that timbres with salient noise components (e.g., distorted electric guitar, vocal screaming, growled saxophone) would drive greater motor resonance than the same sound generators in non-noisy conditions (e.g., clean electric guitar, regular singing voice, normal saxophone tone). To test this hypothesis, we investigated neural activity associated with timbral noisiness using fMRI. Participants listened to isolated instrument and vocal signals scaled into ordinal levels of “noisiness” (duration 2 s); they also performed a ratings task evaluating implied bodily exertion, affective valence, and “noisiness” of each signal (outside the scanner). Using multivariate regression at both the single-voxel and whole-brain level, we found that increasing perception of bodily exertion modulates activity in amygdala; negative valence is related to activity in pre/primary motor cortices and left anterior insula; and perceptions of increasing “noisiness” correlate with activity in both motor and limbic areas. In short, negative timbral appraisals seem to involve the aforementioned regions. Conversely, positive evaluations of timbre are strongly correlated with activity in Rolandic operculum, a major larynx control center, and furthermore, acoustic parameters found in the other experiment to drive impressions of “noisiness” (spectral centroid, inharmonicity, spectral flatness, and roughness) all negatively correlate with BOLD signal change in this vocal motor area. Taken together, these results suggest a role for pre/primary motor cortices and limbic system in the perception of negatively-valenced, “noisy” timbral qualities, and a role for Rolandic operculum in positively-valenced timbres. Thus, motor resonance does not uniformly increase with the addition of timbral noisiness. We interpret these findings to indicate the contribution of the human mirror neuron system in the perception of certain spectral components of timbre. We further hypothesize a functional connection between mirror neuron and limbic systems in the generation of timbre-mediated affect, with anterior insula serving as a probable relay.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For both types of musical stimuli, emotional and cognitive forms of trait empathy modulated activity in sensorimotor and cognitive areas: in the first experiment, empathy was primarily correlated with activity in supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula; in Experiment 2, empathy was mainly correlated with activity in prefrontal, temporo-parietal and reward areas. Taken together, these findings reveal the interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of empathy in response to musical sounds, in line with recent findings from other cognitive domains.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Embodied Listening and Timbre: Perceptual, Acoustical, and Neural Correlatesby Zachary Wallmark, Choi Deblieck, and Roger KendallMusic Perception,  2018Timbre plays an essential role in transmitting musical affect, and in recent years, our understan... more Timbre plays an essential role in transmitting musical affect, and in recent years, our understanding of emotional expression in music has been enriched by contributions from the burgeoning field of embodied music cognition. However, little attention has been paid to timbre as a possible mediator between musical embodiment and affect. In three experiments, we investigated the embodied dimensions of timbre perception by focusing on timbral qualities considered “noisy” and aversive. In Experiment 1, participants rated brief isolated natural timbres scaled into ordinal levels of “noisiness.” Experiment 2 employed the same design with a focus on polyphonic timbre, using brief (400 ms) excerpts from 6 popular music genres as stimuli. In Experiment 3, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore neural activations associated with perception of stimuli from Experiment 1. Converging results from behavioral, acoustical, and fMRI data suggest a motor component to timbre processing, particularly timbral qualities considered “noisy,” indicating a possible enactive mechanism in timbre processing. Activity in somatomotor areas, insula, and the limbic system increased the more participants disliked a timbre, and connectivity between the premotor cortex and insula relay decreased. Implications for recent theories of embodied music cognition, affect, and timbre semantics are discussed in conclusion.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Neural Correlates of Dispositional Empathy in the Perception of Isolated Timbresby Zachary Wallmark and Choi DeblieckProceedings of the International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC14), San Francisco,  2016Neuroimaging studies on sensorimotor integration and social cognition suggest that individuals wi... more Neuroimaging studies on sensorimotor integration and social cognition suggest that individuals with high dispositional empathy (measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, or IRI) process human-made action sounds with greater involvement from motor areas than individuals with lower dispositional empathy. Does high empathy correlate with increased motor activity when listening to musical sounds as well? To address this question, we performed an fMRI study with fifteen subjects. Stimuli consisted of 12 isolated 2-second natural instrument and vocal timbres in " regular " and " noisy " versions. With " empathic concern " scores from the IRI included as covariates, we found that high-empathy individuals processed noisier qualities of timbre with heightened motor activity relative to regular timbres, particularly in the supplementary motor area (SMA). We interpret these results through the lens of embodied music cognition to suggest that dispositional empathy modulates motor resonance during the perception of the sounds of others, especially when these sounds signal heightened arousal and negative valence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet while scholars have long acknowledged the primacy of timbre in shakuhachi expression (Gutzwiller 1974), the idiosyncratic performance practices required to manifest its kaleidoscopic array of sonic possibilities have long been overlooked as a locus of musical meaning. In this presentation, I track the relationship between body mechanics, ecological psychoacoustics, and aesthetics in the shakuhachi tradition through a detailed “timbral-corporeal” (Eidsheim 2008) analysis of representative classical (honkyoku) piece “Sokkan.” I argue that the interrelation of timbre and embodiment plays a crucial role in the affective grammar of “Sokkan,” and the shakuhachi more generally. Timbral manipulations in shakuhachi music—including “gloomy” sounds produced by the meri technique, “fuzzy” tones of “bamboo-grass blowing” (sasane), and the powerful, noisy rush of the “thrashing breath” technique (muraiki)—are supported by a range of head, jaw, lip, and tongue movements, some quite difficult to properly execute. This paradigm of body-instrument interaction is subsumed under a well-known yet poorly understood timbral-corporeal principle of Japanese music: sawari (literally “to touch”). Adding to standard accounts of sawari with a synthesis of embodied cognition theory and ten years participant-observer study with Japanese and American grandmasters (daishihan)—including demonstrations on the instrument—I conclude by suggesting that the bodily negotiations inherent in performance are as essential to shakuhachi aesthetics as the resulting timbral changes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since it lacks its own domain-specific vocabulary, its description borrows pervasively from other sensory domains, particularly vision and touch (e.g., bright, rough). Accounting for this synaesthetic borrowing using cognitive linguistic and neuroimaging methods, in this paper I argue that common verbal descriptions of timbre reflect coherent, embodied, and fundamentally transformative characteristics of sonic experience. They are not arbitrary, as some have suggested. To make this point, I ask two broad questions: (1) why do we use the words we do to describe timbre? and (2) how do common metaphors influence how timbre is perceived and conceptualized? I address these questions through the framework of embodied cognition, with extensive reference to theories of image schemata and conceptual metaphor. Metaphors for timbre are grounded in certain shared experiential schemata of physical force: prior to the acoustic, all timbres are really “timbre-corporeal events.” The evental, embodied nature of sound production and perception is exhibited most clearly in “noisy” timbres, which often index high-force acts typically described using negative tactile metaphors (harsh, grating, etc.). Exploring this connection, I share findings from original fMRI research indicating a special three-way link between tactile, metaphor, and auditory processing in the perception of (noisy) timbre. Since certain timbral qualities trigger somatosensory reactions consistent with their grounding metaphors, I propose in conclusion that metaphors for timbre are performative as much as they are descriptive.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Based on the results of a parallel behavioral experiment showing a correlation between physical exertion and timbral noisiness, we hypothesized that timbres with salient noise components (e.g., distorted electric guitar, vocal screaming, growled saxophone) would drive greater motor resonance than the same sound generators in non-noisy conditions (e.g., clean electric guitar, regular singing voice, normal saxophone tone). To test this hypothesis, we investigated neural activity associated with timbral noisiness using fMRI. Participants listened to isolated instrument and vocal signals scaled into ordinal levels of “noisiness” (duration 2 s); they also performed a ratings task evaluating implied bodily exertion, affective valence, and “noisiness” of each signal (outside the scanner). Using multivariate regression at both the single-voxel and whole-brain level, we found that increasing perception of bodily exertion modulates activity in amygdala; negative valence is related to activity in pre/primary motor cortices and left anterior insula; and perceptions of increasing “noisiness” correlate with activity in both motor and limbic areas. In short, negative timbral appraisals seem to involve the aforementioned regions. Conversely, positive evaluations of timbre are strongly correlated with activity in Rolandic operculum, a major larynx control center, and furthermore, acoustic parameters found in the other experiment to drive impressions of “noisiness” (spectral centroid, inharmonicity, spectral flatness, and roughness) all negatively correlate with BOLD signal change in this vocal motor area. Taken together, these results suggest a role for pre/primary motor cortices and limbic system in the perception of negatively-valenced, “noisy” timbral qualities, and a role for Rolandic operculum in positively-valenced timbres. Thus, motor resonance does not uniformly increase with the addition of timbral noisiness. We interpret these findings to indicate the contribution of the human mirror neuron system in the perception of certain spectral components of timbre. We further hypothesize a functional connection between mirror neuron and limbic systems in the generation of timbre-mediated affect, with anterior insula serving as a probable relay.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Converging neuroscientific research suggests that when we hear the meaningful, goal-orientated action sounds of another person, our premotor cortex is activated as if we were performing the same action. Thus “humanly organized sound”—the sound of musical action—has the potential to induce a corporeal mirroring effect whereby the hearer and the producer of the musical signal affectively co-experience the same communicative act. In this paper, we review major MNS findings relevant to musicologists, share hypotheses and preliminary findings from our current experimental research, and formulate questions and topics for further study, theorizing some potential aesthetic, social, and ethical implications of the MNS for musicological inquiry.  Bringing together an interdisciplinary research team from musicology and cognitive neuroscience, our ongoing project uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to observe brain activity while subjects listen to music they have selected in advance as either “strongly liking” or “strongly disliking.” We hypothesize that musical liking is directly correlated to the listener’s level of bodily engagement with the sound itself, as indicated by the strength of MNS activation while listening. Confirming recent work by music scholars Marc Leman (2007) and Arnie Cox (2001 & 2011), it seems that liking a particular music requires us to resonate with the motor patterns embodied in it; in short, we must empathize with the sounding bodies behind the music. Conversely, disliked music leads to attenuated mirroring activity, signaling a breakdown of empathy with the motor activities producing the sound. Drawing on these findings, we suggest that musical empathy is fundamentally corporeal, and that processes of identification with or rejection of different music (and, in some cases, the people making it) are thus mediated by neurophysiological mechanisms of motor mimicry originating in the MNS. We conclude by suggesting three main ways musicologists can integrate these conclusions into their own projects."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this paper, I examine the starkly divided and highly physicalized reactions to free jazz by focusing on its most commented-upon and instantly recognizable sound, the timbre of the saxophonic scream. Approaching this extreme timbre from the perspective of embodiment, I argue that the breakdown of aural distinctions between “music” and “noise,” a contestation that is centered at the locus of the body, operates to structure listeners’ physical, aesthetic, and moral responses to the “screams” and “shrieks” native to the genre, either compelling empathy in listeners or triggering its collapse. Drawing upon research into the neurophysiology of audition, I contend that the timbre of the saxophonic scream is heard in distinctly embodied terms: indeed, it is perceived as if it were an actual screaming voice. Our aesthetic vulnerability to this particular timbre—whether interpreted positively (as music) or negatively (as unredeemable noise)—is thus bound up in a complex nexus of both innate biological responses and culturally inscribed modes of hearing. Timbre, as a sonorous reflection of resonating corporeality, calls forth the bodies that produce it, bodies that are indelibly marked by gender, race, and a variety of other cultural categories. I close by briefly examining the ethical stakes involved in how we parse the music/noise dichotomy in the perception of polarizing timbres, both in free jazz and beyond.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter examines the relationship between timbre and language, offering a critical review of theoretical and empirical thought on timbre semantics and providing a preliminary cognitive linguistic account of timbre description. It first traces the major conceptual and methodological advances in psychological timbre research since the 1970s with a focus on the mediating role of verbalization in previous paradigms. It then discusses the cognitive mechanisms underlying how listeners map timbral qualities onto verbal attributes. Applying a cognitive linguistic approach, the chapter concludes that timbre description may reflect certain fundamental aspects of human embodiment, which may help account for certain trans-historical and cross-cultural consistencies in descriptive practices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Integrating perspectives from musicology with the cognitive sciences, it advances a novel model of timbre interpretation that takes into account the bodily, sensorimotor dynamics of sound production and perception. The contribution of timbre to musical experience is clearest in drastic situations where meaning is itself contested—that is, in polarizing contexts of reception, where the evaluation of “musical” timbre by some listeners collides headlong into a competing claim that it is just “noise.” Taking this commonplace reaction as a starting point, the book explores affect, reception, and timbre semantics through diverse cultural-historical case studies that frustrate the acoustic and perceptual boundary between musical sound and noise.

However, few studies have examined whether affective empathy (i.e., sharing other people’s emotional states, referred to as “affect sharing”) may likewise be impaired in either form of psychopathology. In Study 1 ( n = 202), we examined the unique association between social anxiety (or depression) and affect sharing and the moderating role of anhedonia and stimuli valence above and beyond depression (or social anxiety). No main or interaction effects were found for social anxiety or depression in the prediction of affect sharing. In Study 2, we conducted a direct replication of Study 1 with a larger sample ( n = 324), which confirmed our findings from Study 1. Thus, the unique effects of social anxiety and depression may be more related to difficulties in cognitive, rather than affective, empathic processes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It adopts a critical organological orientation, detailing the bodily mechanics and acoustics of shakuhachi performance through the analysis of phrases from the representative pieces “Sokkan” and “Yamagoe.” It shows that the noise elements (sawari) in shakuhachi music play an aesthetically and ethically important role in the tradition, and have long been contested by different factions within the shakuhachi community. It explores this conflict as a manifestation of the psychoanalytic concept of abjection—which holds the abject to be something ugly. In contrast to the usual application of this theory, to some shakuhachi practitioners, playing beautifully represents the abject state.

Although evolutionary theories have proposed that both empathy and music help to foster social connection, few studies to date have examined the relation between behavioral assessments of empathic processes for people and music. We examined this question using 2 independent samples: a laboratory sample of undergraduates (n = 236) and a larger online direct replication with participants across the United States (n = 596). Across both samples, linear mixed effects models showed positive associations between empathic accuracy and affect sharing for people telling personal stories and for musical expression, and results were maintained when including relevant individual differences as covariates. These findings provide initial evidence of a relation between behaviorally assessed empathic processes across social and musical domains.

We then found that the two HSPS factors were significantly associated with constructs related to three domains of interpersonal sensitivity such as empathy (positive interpersonal sensitivity), social anxiety (negative interpersonal sensitivity), and theory of mind (social cognitive ability), and explained unique variance above and beyond neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and openness.

This strongly worded condemnation expresses an often overlooked aesthetic—and ethical—orientation within the shakuhachi tradition, one still active among certain practitioners: to play beautifully is something loathsome, expressive not just of poor musical judgment, but of bad character. “Splendid tone” is a mark, indeed, of the abject.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There remain many questions about the semantics of timbres and textures arising from orchestral combinations: for example, what leads orchestration pedagogue Samuel Adler (2002) to describe some orchestral textures as “flickering” while others are “noble,” “bombastic,” or “muddy”? Semantics of combinations of timbres and textures are germane to ecologically valid experiences of music, especially ensemble music. They also complement the much-discussed gray area between timbre and harmony (e.g., Hasegawa 2009; Harvey 2000) with another equally fascinating liminality: between timbre and texture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the standard experimental paradigm, participants hear timbral stimuli and provide behavioral responses. However, it remains unclear the extent to which descriptive consistency would be observed if this paradigm were reversed, that is, if participants were instructed to create novel timbres in response to target adjectives. Given an unfamiliar synthesis interface, would musically trained participants craft similar timbral profiles for the same familiar adjectives? In this study, we explore timbre semantics using a novel frequency modulation (FM) synthesis production task. Participants (N=64) created unique timbral outputs in response to 20 common timbre descriptors drawn from orchestration treatises (e.g., brilliant, dull, harsh). Acoustic analyses of the resultant 1,280 signals, in conjunction with linear mixed-effects modeling and clustering analysis, indicate that participants were moderately consistent in their timbral creations. Word valence and arousal interacted to influence average spectral centroid and noisiness. Specifically, clearly positive and negative words produced significantly different acoustical profiles than more affectively neutral words. This result confirms a number of findings from the perceptual literature while offering preliminary evidence that affective dimensions of timbre semantics systematically influence sound production in an unfamiliar context.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
