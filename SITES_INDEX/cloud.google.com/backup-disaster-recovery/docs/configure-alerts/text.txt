Configure a log-based alert

This page explains how to configure a log-based alert from the Log Explorer for the
Backup and DR Service in the Google Cloud console.
The Logs Explorer interface for creating and editing log-based alerts guides you through the following steps:
Provide a name and description for the alert.
Choose the logs for which you want to receive a notification.
Set the time between notifications.
Set the time for automatic closure of incidents.
Specify whom to notify.
Permissions and roles
To create and manage log-based alerts, your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
must include the permissions described in Permissions for log-based alerts.
Create a log-based alert
To notify an alert, you need to have a
notification channel. You can create the
notification channel before creating
an alert or while creating an alert.
To create a log-based alert, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, select Logging and then Logs Explorer.
Use the Query pane  to define the event on which you want to be notified. You can use the query examples shown in sample queries in the query pane to configure alerts.
The following is the sample query to get notified on an event with a specific event ID.
logName="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/backupdr.googleapis.com%2Fbackup_recovery_appliance_events"
jsonPayload.eventId=10046
In the header of the Query results pane, click Create alert. If your window is too narrow, the Create alert option  appears on the Actions menu instead.
In the Alert details pane, give the alert a name and description:
Enter a name for your alert in the Alert Policy Name field. This name gets displayed in the notification header.
In the Documentation field, enter the description for the alert. For information about how you can format and refine the content of this field, see Using Markdown and variables in documentation templates. We suggest you include the URL of the management console in the documentation field. You can also add the workaround to resolve the event.
Click Next.
In the Choose logs to include in the alert pane, check the query and results by clicking Preview logs. You can also edit the query in this pane, if necessary.
Click Next.
Select the minimum time between notifications. This value lets you control the number of notifications you get from this alert if it is triggered multiple times. For example, you can select 5 min from the options to limit the notifications to every five minutes. You can adjust the incident autoclose duration by selecting an option on the menu if applicable.
Click Next.
Select one or more notification channels for your alert, for example, select an email notification channel.
If you already have an email notification channel configured, then you can select it from the list. If not, click Manage notification channels and add an email channel. For information about creating notification channels, see Manage notification channels.
Click Save.
We recommend you to configure alerts for important Event IDs.
Test the log-based alert
To test the log-based alert you created, you can manually write a log entry that matches
the query. To write the log entry, follow these steps:
Go to the logEntries.write reference page, or click
the following button:
Go to logEntries.write 
Configure the following log entry by changing the PROJECT_ID
variable to your project ID. If your alert policy includes or excludes specific
event IDs then you need to modify the event ID as well:
  "entries": [
  {
    "jsonPayload": {
      "eventId": 10046,
      "errorMessage": "this is a manually generated error message created for testing"
    },
    "resource": {
      "type": "backupdr.googleapis.com/BackupRecoveryAppliance",
    },
    "severity": "ERROR",
    "logName": "projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/backupdr.googleapis.com%2Fbackup_recovery_appliance_events",
  }
  ]
Copy the log entry you configured previously.
In the Try this API pane, follow these steps:
Replace the content in the Request body field in APIs Explorer with the log entry you copied in the previous step.
Click Execute. If prompted, follow the authentication flow.
If the logEntries.write call is successful, then you get an HTTP 200 response code and an empty response body, {}. For more information about APIs Explorer, see Using the APIs Explorer, The APIs Explorer works the same way with the Logging API.
The log entry matches the filter specified for the alert in the following ways:
The logName value specifies the backup/recovery appliance event log in
your Cloud project.
The severity value for this log entry is ERROR.
The jsonPayload contains a 10046 pool full event.
After you write the log entry, the following sequence occurs:
The new log entry appears in the Logs Explorer and triggers the alert.
An incident is opened in Cloud Monitoring.
You receive a notification for the incident. If you configured an email
notification channel, then the notification displays.
You can click View incident in the email to see the incident in
Cloud Monitoring. For more information about incidents including how to
acknowledge and close them, see Manage incidents for log-based alerts.
Create multiple alert policies
You may want to create alert policies based on the priority and urgency of events.
From alerting perspective, events can be broadly categorized into the following categories:
Events that are required to be attended urgently and hence require more
frequent notifications. For example, the event ID 43901 (failed snapshot job) needs to be reported every 30 minutes. Use the following query to create the alert.
    Policyname = 'Snapshot job has failed'
    Notification rate limit = 30 min
    logName="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/backupdr.googleapis.com%2Fbackup_recovery_appliance_events" AND jsonPayload.eventId=43901
Events that are less urgent and hence require less frequent notifications. For example, the event ID 10085 (backup plan violations) need to only be reported once per day. Use the following query to create the alert.
    Policyname = 'Backup Plan Violation has occurred'
    Notification rate limit = 1 day
    logName="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/backupdr.googleapis.com%2Fbackup_recovery_appliance_events" AND jsonPayload.eventId=10085
Events that are non-impacting and can be ignored. For example, the event IDs 10229 (exceeded storage errors) and 42356 (file changes have been detected) can be ignored, as Google support have declared they are false positives. Use the following query to create the alert.
    Policyname = 'Backup/DR event has occurred'
    Notification rate limit = 6 hr
    logName="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/backupdr.googleapis.com%2Fbackup_recovery_appliance_events" AND NOT jsonPayload.eventId=(10085 OR 10229 OR 42356 OR 43901)
