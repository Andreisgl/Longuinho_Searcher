Text Sources

                Page text in BHL originates from one of the following sources:
                

                            Uncorrected OCR
                        

                            Machine-generated text. May include inconsistencies with the content of the original page.
                        

                            Error-corrected OCR
                        

                            Machine-generated, machine-corrected text.  Better quality than Uncorrected OCR, but may still include inconsistencies with the content of the original page.
                        

                            Manual Transcription
                        

                            Human-created and reviewed text.  For issues concerning manual transcription text, please contact the original holding institution.
