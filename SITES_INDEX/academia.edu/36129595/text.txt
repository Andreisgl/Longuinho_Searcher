Various methods have been employed including household archaeology and textual studies, viewed through frameworks of anthropological and social theories. This three year session tries to activate real discussions between archaeologists, historians and anthropologists on some problems still debated on houses: how do we identify the uses of domestic spaces and what does use of space tell us? What kind of ritual practices were carried out in the houses? Which are the best manners to vizualize ancient houses? Themes are not limited, but may include culture, economy, gender, ethnicity, and religion taking a bottom-up approach to understanding the ancient world. Varied methodologies, including household archaeology, domestic micro-archaeology, 3-D reconstructions, etc. welcome.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers“Living in Households, Constructing Identities: Ethnicity, Boundaries, and Empire in Iron IIB-IIC Tell en-Nasbeh.” Pp. 289-305 in Household Studies in Complex Societies: (Micro) Archaeological and Textual Approaches, ed. M. Müller.  Oriental Institute Seminars 10, 2015.Aaron BrodyThis study investigates aspects of the identity and ethnicity of the inhabitants of household compounds in late Iron Age Tell en-Nasbeh, who buried deceased ancestors in nearby family tombs. Earlier household archaeological studies researched ceramics and small finds in their original architectural contexts, in order to reveal aspects of daily life in this large fortified village. Were the pillared-houses at Nasbeh the residencies of nuclear or extended families? Data presented allowed me to define a particular five-building compound as the home of three nuclear families whose houses were physically linked. Shared resources of these three nuclear families, revealed through household archaeology, suggested that this compound housed one extended family. But how did this extended family, and others at the settlement, construct its ethnic identity? In general, regional studies of the southern Levant make assumptions about ethnic identities based primarily on texts. For the period of the Iron II these texts are mostly found in the Hebrew Bible, a curated anthology of sacred writings. Tell en-Nasbeh of the late Iron Age is usually equated with the biblical settlement of Mizpah, located on the northern border of the region of Benjamin in the Kingdom of Judah. We might assume that the inhabitants of the Nasbeh household compounds self-identified as Israelite, or Judean. But what is the view from the material culture of the households and tombs from the site? I will investigate modes of diet, dress, language, and ritual as markers for constructing the identity, including ethnicity, of the Iron II inhabitants of Tell en-Nasbeh. As the region was under imperial control throughout the Iron IIB-IIC periods, the effects of empire on local identity construction will also be explored along with notions of boundaries as an important locus intensifying ethnic self-awareness.Download Free PDFView PDFNear Eastern Archaeology vol. 81 no. 3“Materiality of Religion in Judean Households:  A Contextual Analysis of Ritual Objects from Iron II Tell en-Nasbeh.”  Near Eastern Archaeology 81/3:212-21.2018 • Aaron BrodyDownload Free PDFView PDFIdentifying residences of ritual practitioners in the archaeological record as a proxy for social complexityJennifer KahnDedicated ritual specialists often had indispensable roles in ancient religions and significant impacts on political histories. Few studies have developed methodologies for recovering direct evidence for ritual practitioners in the archaeological record. I argue that the study of religious practitioners must take a holistic micro-scale approach, documenting not only the places where ritual paraphernalia (sacra) were stored, but places where priests and their assistants lived and practiced intimate and communal rituals. I begin with a discussion of ethnohistoric and ethnographic data to model what priests did in ancient societies, and what the material correlates of their dwellings and activities might look like. I then present archaeological data from two late prehistoric house sites identified as priest dwellings from East Polynesian. Utilizing multiple lines of evidence, including portable artifacts, botanical specimens, site architecture, and site distribution patterns, I argue that there is close complementarity between the eth nohistoric–ethnographic model and the archaeological remains. That priests’ houses houses are often situated within corporate ritual centers speaks to the import of such sites and their associated ceremonial activities in the strategic use ideology to institutionalize social hierarchies and political status, a pattern seen in many other ranked societies in Polynesia and other case studies world-wide.Download Free PDFView PDFMesopotamia, Archaeology of, Prehistoric to Early Bronze Periods (Lexham Bible Dictionary)Clayton BenchDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE FUNCTIONALITY OF FEASTING AT LATE PREHISTORIC RESIDENTIAL AND CEREMONIAL SITES IN THE SOCIETY ISLANDSJennifer KahnMuch of the research into East Polynesian ceremonial sites focuses on temple-altar (marae-ahu) complexes as sacred sites where varied religious rituals and rites of passage were performed. Yet ethnohistoric documents and the Tahitian lexicon suggest a broader role for Ma‘ohi (indigenous Tahitian) ceremonial architecture as the foci of individual and corporate ceremonies of a religious, economic and political nature. Utilising a spatio-temporal perspective, I investigate the function of feasting at terraces attached to a range of community and familial level temples, in addition to communal spaces within residential sites in the Society Islands. My goal is to explore the ways that Ma‘ohi household leaders, chiefs and priests may have utilised feasting to materialise their economic authority, while at the same time facilitating the formation of communal identities. I utilise archaeological data to identify feasting at monumental architectural sites of varying scale and complexity and house sites of differing status. I then turn to ethnographic analogy and social theory to suggest differing functions of feasting at different site types. As I argue, feasting serves as a highly visible social act, representing not only a political leader’s generosity, but delineating boundaries of particular social groups and control over resources. In the Society Island chiefdoms, at both the household and community scales, feasting is strongly correlated, but not uniquely associated with, ceremonial sites and served varied secular and sacred functions. I conclude that feasting actively solidified local and community level leader’s economic, socio-political and ideological power in varied ceremonial contexts of the late prehistoric Society Island chiefdoms.Download Free PDFView PDFIn J.

Maier on the Occasion of His Sixtieth BirthdayWhen Considering Infants and Jar Burials in the Middle Bronze Age Southern Levant2018 • Beth Alpert NakhaiEds. I. Shai, J. R. Chadwick, L. Hitchcock, A. Dagan, C. McKinney and J. Uziel. Ägypten und Altes Testament 90. Münster: Zaphon ABSTRACT: The custom of burying infants in jars has been identified in the archaeological record from as early as the Pottery Neolithic. It continues into the Iron Age and beyond but is most common in the Middle Bronze II. MBII jar burials tend to include one, or perhaps two, infants less than two years of age. Found both under floors and in tombs, they commonly contained small vessels; sometimes, tools or a scarab were also included. To date, research into the MBII infant jar burial and its place in Canaanite society has been limited. Scholarship has considered infanticide, kinship affiliations and the social status of the deceased’s kin group, religious beliefs, and the relationship between jars, wombs, and fertility. The treatment of the child as child, including consideration of her/his value to family and society that is lost on account of death, has not been explored. This paper looks at correlations between the treatment of the deceased infant and the expectations for that infant, as she/he would have matured into a productive member of her/his social unit. It considers, as well, the ways in which mortuary treatment serves to integrate the nascent dead into the living society of the Middle Bronze II, and women’s agency in determining the placement of infant jar burials, and the grave goods included in them.Download Free PDFView PDFMaterial Remains: Kispum in Excavations MacDougal CH6Renata M MacDougalDownload Free PDFView PDFHouseholds, Communities, and Dimensions of Social Identity in the Early Iron Age at Tall al-ʿUmayri2016 • Monique D RoddyThe Early Iron Age Southern Levant was a place in transition. The various Late Bronze Age city-states were collapsing and the New Kingdom Egyptian empire, part of a Mediterranean world rich in interactions, was dwindling to a close. Populations were shifting and a number of small, agro-pastoral villages were emerging in the highlands and plateaus on either side of the Jordan River. This dissertation studies one such village, Tall al-ʿUmayri, located on the Central Plateau of Transjordan. Excavations uncovered a portion of this 1.5-hectare village, including five domestic structures, a deep refuse pit, and an impressive fortification system. Around 1200 BCE an intense conflagration consumed the settlement and sealed houses, domestic artifacts, and even some of the inhabitants under burned mudbrick. The well-preserved assemblage provides a wealth of information on life before the destruction. To build a picture of that life, this study uses the functional-ecological approach to reconstruct the inhabitants' activities and the identity-practice approach to explore the social importance of those activities. The independent village at ʿUmayri had well-defined architectural boundaries between households, which formed self-sustaining units for production of everyday necessities like food and clothing, as well as other items, such as seals. At the community level, socioeconomic inequality is evident in the range of sizes and complexity of the domestic structures and the presence of certain artifacts, such as administrative and ritual items, only in the larger houses. Compared to some other settlements in the region, ʿUmayri was more organized and cooperative, as evidenced by the fortification system and the shared walls between houses. The inhabitants would also have needed to cooperate to reduce agricultural and pastoral risks, and they participated in community ritual. Such cooperation may have helped build solidarity. Interestingly, ʿUmayri and the other settlements in the region that demonstrated cooperation through fortification systems simultaneously have evidence of individual households making greater efforts to protect or hide their grain stores from other households. Contextualizing and comparing these household and community practices with contemporary sites elsewhere in the Southern Levant thus allows for a discussion of the active ways in which villagers organized their societies and economies. This study is an important contribution to understanding the Early Iron Age Southern Levant, and Transjordan in particular, where little is known about everyday life at the village level. Rural settlements like ʿUmayri provide windows of opportunity in which to analyze households, communities, and the development of social identity across the region.Download Free PDFView PDFNeighborhoods from the Perspective of Anthropological ArchaeologyElements of Cahokian Neighborhoods2019 • Alleen Betzenhauser, Timothy PauketatAmerican Indian neighborhoods were very much under construction during the late-eleventh century at Cahokia in the American Bottom region of southwestern Illinois. A social order that transcended pre-Mississippian village life may now be defined based on large-scale excavations at East St. Louis and Cahokia proper. Architectural patterns and craft production debris within the greater central complex indicate possible religious, if not political or ethnic, divisions that did not form organically. At least some of this architecture was built specifically for sheltering and engaging other animate beings. The central problems in this analysis are distinguishing residential neighborhoods from other kinds of occupational zones and human neighbors from other-than-human residents. To this end, we generate new measures of architectural diversity, density, and positioning to identify the elements of Cahokian neighborhoods and examine how they were created and reconfigured.
