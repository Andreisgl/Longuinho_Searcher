                            The city of London in the United Kingdom had an estimated gross domestic product of 801 billion Euros in 2017/18, the most of any European city. London was followed by the French capital, Paris, which had a GDP of 685 billion Euros, and the Spanish capital, Madrid at 221 billion Euros. Milan, in the prosperous north of Italy, had a GDP of 207 billion Euros, 44 billion euros larger than the Italian capital Rome, and was the largest non-capital city in terms of GDP in Europe.
The engine of Europe
Among European countries, Germany had by far the largest economy, with a gross domestic product of over 3.33 trillion Euros. The United Kingdom or France have been Europe's second largest economy since the 1980s, depending on the year, with forecasts suggesting France will overtake the UK going into the 2020s. Germany however, has been the biggest European economy for some time, with five cities (Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart and Frankfurt) among the 15 largest European cities by GDP.
 Europe's largest cities
In 2020, two cities on the edge of the European continent, Istanbul and Moscow, were the largest, with populations of 15.2 million and 12.5 million respectively. Paris was the largest city in western Europe, with a population of over 11 million, while London was Europe's fourth-largest city at 9.3 million inhabitants.
