Marczuk, 2017. Origins of immigration to Australia, 1787-1914. Arhivele Olteniei, 31, pp. 39-50.2017 • Karina MarczukThe origins of immigration to Australia are intrinsically connected to the history of this state, that is its British, colonial heritage. Australia had been discovered, and then conquered, by Great Britain relatively late – the British fleet arrived to the Australian territory for the first time only towards the end of the 18th century to start the settlement of the British convicts. The paper concerns the first stage of immigration, which encompasses the time between the landing of the first British ships carrying the first group of convicts/colonists (1787) and the outbreak of World War I (1914) which prompted a rapid change of Australian immigration rules since a lot of citizens of various states desired to emigrate to this safe, calm and prosperous country. The main argument is that it was mainly the Chinese immigration impact which prompted a turn in Australia’s migration policy, which started to be much more restrictive and eventually led to the establishment of the White Australia Policy.Download Free PDFView PDFIt's complicated: a timeline of Australia-Iran relations in a historical perspectiveDr Nina Markovic KhazeDownload Free PDFView PDFHistorical Lessons for Australia's Foreign Policy: The Case of British EEC MembershipDr Nina Markovic KhazeThe Australian Government's attitudes towards major events in international politics such as the UK's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in the past and Brexit negotiations today, carry greater weight than previously assumed in political science literature. Australia was critical of the EEC (now called the European Union, EU) in the early 1960s, when its then most important trading partner, the United Kingdom (UK) first applied for membership. Australia was ill-prepared to deal with the repercussions from Britain's entry into the EU, as Australian foreign policy was heavily influenced by local as well as international anti-EEC attitudes. This paper will analyse political debates in Australia during the 1960s and early 1970s with reference to parliamentary Hansard records and newspaper articles in order to suggest a new framework for Australian foreign policy analysis. https://cesaa.org.au/anzjes_issue/volume-9-no-2/Download Free PDFView PDFAustralia’s evolving relationship with the European Union: an updateDr Nina Markovic KhazeDownload Free PDFView PDFAustralian Historical Studies'The Significance of the Northern Territory in the Formulation of "White Australia" Policies, 1880-1901'2018 • Natalie FongEconomic motivations for the formulation of Australia’s ‘White Australia’ policies were expressed by contemporaries and have been discussed by scholars. What is worthy of further attention is the significance of the Northern Territory (‘the Territory’) in the formulation of these policies. Attitudes of European elites in the Territory towards the Chinese coincided with and contributed to national debates. European elites in the Territory who initially supported Chinese migration to the Territory then stressed the Territory’s vulnerability to Chinese economic domination to campaign for national legislation. The same faction later protested the government’s unjust application of this legislation to Chinese.Download Free PDFView PDFAustralian Journal of Politics & HistoryAnti-Cartel or Anti-Foreign?

Often ignored are the ‘general public’, here used to mean those who are neither victim nor perpetrator. This thesis seeks to address this oversight in one specific case by examining the changes in public opinion towards the apology to the Stolen Generations in Australia across the period 1997-2008. Here, the general public is the non-Indigenous public of Australia, most of whom were not in any way involved in the policies which led to the Stolen Generations. The apology is an interesting aspect of TJ in Australia because it came to represent reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians during the 11-year period where former Prime Minister John Howard refused to make it. The thesis will argue that opinion towards the apology fluctuated drastically in the period between its suggestion in 1997 and it being made in 2008, due to factors including fluctuating political opinion and changes in attitude towards Indigenous reconciliation. It will conclude that while the apology was an important step in reconciliation, and was believed to be so by many of the general public, its actual and perceived effects on the reconciliation process for the Stolen Generations have been negligible.Download Free PDFView PDFThe End of the White Australia Policy in the Australian Labor Party; a discursive analysis with reference to postcolonialism and whiteness theory2012 • Luke WhitingtonDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
