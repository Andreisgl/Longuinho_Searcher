There,i) a set of three different industrial billet casting operations reported in the literature were mathematically modelled and it was observedl) that numerical estimates of solidified shell thickness were considerably different from the corresponding measurements. An extensive computational analysis was carried out to propose two possible reasons , error in the experimental measurements and inadequacy of the effective thermal conductivity basedheat flow model) for such discrepancy between theory and experiments.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersISIJ InternationalMathematical Modelling of Heat Transfer Phenomena in Continuous Casting of Steel1993 • S K ChoudharyDownload Free PDFView PDFISIJ International3-dimensional Mathematical Model for the Analysis of Continuous Beam Blank Casting Using Body Fitted Coordinate System1998 • Jung-Eui LeeDownload Free PDFView PDFModeling of Continuous castingBrian G ThomasDownload Free PDFView PDFModelling of continuous casting of steel under the influence of electromagnetic field with meshless method2015 • Katarina MramorDownload Free PDFView PDFOptimization of Pulsed Magnetic Field Application for Electromagnetic Stirring during the Continuous Casting2018 • Mattia GuglielmiQuesto lavoro di tesi, svolto presso l&#39;ETP di Hannover, propone l&#39;applicazione di un campo magnetico pulsato (PMF) per ottimizzare il processo di stirring elettromagnetico durante la colata continua dei metalli. Prove sperimentali e di simulazione sono state eseguite in parallelo, misurando la velocita dei vortici generati nel metallo liquido, a seguito dell&#39;applicazione del campo citato. Si e ottenuto un effetto di risonanza, quindi miglior mescolamento con il PMF.Download Free PDFView PDFTurbulent Flow and Heat Transfer Problem in the Electromagnetic Continuous Casting Process2011 • Theeradech MookumThis paper aims to study the effect of turbulence on the flow of two fluids and the heat transfer - solidification process in electromagnetic continuous steel casting. The complete set of field equations is established. The flow pattern of the fluids, the meniscus shape and temperature field as well as solidification profiles obtained from the model with and with no turbulence effect are presented. The results show that the model with turbulence gives a large circulation zone above the jet, much larger variation of the meniscus geometry, a slow solidification rate and higher temperature in the top part of the strand region. Due to these advantages, great efforts have been made to develop this process over the last decade and the percentage of steel in the world produced by this process is increasing. In the electromagnetic casting, a coil is mounted around the casting mould. The magnetic field gener- ated from the source current through the coil induces the electric current in the s...Download Free PDFView PDFISIJ InternationalMagnetohydrodynamic Phenomena, Fluid Control and Computational Modeling in the Continuous Casting of Billet and Bloom2014 • gonzalo toledoDownload Free PDFView PDFISIJ InternationalMelt Instabilities and the Effect of Surface Tension on Preventing Edge Serrations in Melt Overflow Alloy Strip Casting1998 • Ali KalkanliDownload Free PDFView PDFISIJ InternationalMorphology and Macrosegregation in Continuously Cast Steel Billets1994 • S K ChoudharyDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal For Numerical Methods in EngineeringThermal stress evaluation in the steel continuous casting process2006 • Jose RissoDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
