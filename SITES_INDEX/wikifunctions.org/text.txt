From Wikifunctions
Welcome to Wikifunctions
Wikifunctions is a free library of functions that (soon) anyone can edit.
Welcome!
Wikifunctions is a Wikimedia project for everyone to collaboratively create and maintain a library of code functions to support the Wikimedia projects and beyond, in the world's natural and programming languages. 
A "function" is a sequence of programming instructions that makes a calculation based on data you provide. Functions can answer questions, such as how many days have passed between two dates, or the distance between two cities.
