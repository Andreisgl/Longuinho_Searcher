Currently, two methods employing autologous cells are used to stimulate repair of articular cartilage. Micro-fracture induced repair induces autologous mesenchymal cell migration from bone marrow. Autologous chondrocytes&#39; transplantation involves in vitro expansion of chondrocytes, and later implantation. In 15 patients de-differentiated chondrocytes obtained by cartilage biopsy were compared to cells derived from repair tissue induced by micro-fracture. These patients all underwent micro-fracture during the cartilage biopsy procedure. Autologous chondrocytes&#39; transplantation was performed at least two months later then the biopsy. Tissue bits from articular cartilage and micro-fracture repair tissue were incubated in-vitro and explant cell cultures established. The cell cultures were assessed by immunohistochemistry and induced to differentiate.

The expression of five CXC chemokine receptors and their main ligands was analysed by RT-PCR in 31 human astrocytic neoplasms. The mRNAs for all the receptors analysed were identified in a high percentage of tumours, while their ligands showed lower expression. CXCR4 and SDF1 were the most frequently mRNA identified (29/31 and 13/31 of the gliomas studied, respectively). Thus, we further analysed the cell localization of CXCR4 and SDF1 in immunohistochemistry experiments. We show a marked co-localization of CXCR4 and SDF1 in tumour cells, mainly evident in psudolpalisade and microcystic degeneration areas and in the vascular endothelium. In addition, hSDF1α induced a significant increase of DNA synthesis in primary human glioblastoma cell cultures and chemotaxis in a glioblastoma cell line.These results provide evidence of the expression of multiple CXC chemokines and their receptors in brain tumours and that in particular CXCR4 and SDF1 sustain proliferation and migration of glioma cells to promote malignant progression.Save to LibraryDownloadby Antonio Daga and +1Adriana Bajetto•  20  Neurochemistry, Cell Migration, Immunohistochemistry, Cell CultureDifferent adhesion and migration properties of human HCV29 non-malignant urothelial and T24 bladder cancer cells: role of glycosylationSave to LibraryDownloadby Małgorzata Przybyło•  17  Cell Migration, Wound Healing, Cell Adhesion, Enzyme InhibitorsThe anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) gene is overexpressed in prostate cancer and may be useful as a urine sediment marker for prostate cancer detectionSave to LibraryDownloadby A.

Studies on actin regulatory proteins are now coupled with studies of the signal transduction that directs actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and we have gained insights into how external stimuli such as chemoattractants drive changes in actin cytoskeleton. Chemoattractants regulate actin regulatory proteins such as the Arp2⧸3 complex through WASP family proteins, ADF⧸cofilin downstream of LIM-kinase, and various other phosphoinositide-dependent or -independent pathways. Through branching of actin filaments, Arp2⧸3 complex-dependent actin polymerization is suffcient to generate the force necessary for protrusion.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shiro Suetsugu•  15  Cell Migration, Cytoskeleton, Signal Transduction, HumansThe Ontogeny of Mauthner Cells In the Brain of Labeo Rohita As Revealed by NADPH-D and NNOS ImmunohistochemistrySave to LibraryDownloadby Saikat  Biswas and +1Nikhil Palande•  16  Cognitive Science, Cell Migration, Immunohistochemistry, BrainChitosan-based injectable hydrogel as a promising in situ forming scaffold for cartilage tissue engineeringSave to LibraryDownloadby Hojjat Naderi-Meshkin and +1Hamid Reza Bidkhori•  196  Biochemistry, Clinical Psychology, Hydrogeology, Medical SciencesJane Eyre's Excruciating EndingSave to LibraryDownloadby Bonnie Zare•  205  Management, Marketing, Engineering, Ecological EngineeringNextLast »Related TopicsCell AdhesionFollowFollowingDevelopmental BiologyFollowFollowingCell SignalingFollowFollowingCell BiologyFollowFollowingNeuroblastomaFollowFollowingCytoskeletonFollowFollowingMorphogenesisFollowFollowingExtracellular MatrixFollowFollowingCannabinoidsFollowFollowingBiological PhysicsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
