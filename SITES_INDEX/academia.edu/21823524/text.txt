It sheds light on how music in general, and streaming technology in particular, is perceived, made sense of, experienced and practiced in the context of the individual streaming user’s everyday life. Its research perspective is inspired by sociological phenomenology, starting with Alfred Schutz’s action-oriented approach to understanding intersubjective meaningful experience. This perspective informs both the methodological model and the theoretical framework of the study, which is otherwise interdisciplinary and eclectic. The research was conducted in Norway, which currently boasts a globally pioneering streaming market. The study relies on a mixed-methods design using twelve heavy music-streaming users (ranging from seventeen to sixty years old) as informants. I began by devoting two months to sampling users’ self-reported practices and experiences with music-streaming services, combined with online observation and logging of all streamed tracks during this period. I followed up with individual in-depth interviews that were conducted while looking at the personal streaming-service interfaces together with the informants. This design is original to the dissertation and intended to make immediate experience sampling convenient for the informant. It is therefore also relevant for grasping everyday experiences of a taken-for-granted nature that arise in the context of mobile media and the ubiquitous Internet. I develop my arguments through a discussion that draws on theoretical frameworks that fundamentally revolve around notions of human action, which is also a focus of my analyses (via user practices and experiences). The principal study finding involves the extent of the role that music has assumed in daily life as a result of streaming services. Streaming-related musical meaning is found to be intensely self-referential and personal, and streaming presents itself as a malleable lifeworld resource. I also argue that music-streaming services afford involvements in diverse modes of experience and practice that are realised through the role and impact of these services in everyday life, as demonstrated by the micro-dynamics that follow upon the act of streaming among individuals, the technology, the music and the context. The dissertation’s overall structure is divided in two: (1) the covering paper that will survey the research project as a whole, and (2) four articles written over the three-year course of the project.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersStreaming the Everyday LifeAnja Nylund HagenHagen offers an analysis of uses of music streaming services, and discusses how such services participate in shaping individual experiences and acquire meaning through how the services are embedded in everyday life. Focusing on the services’ affordances, the chapter acknowledges the interactions arising within each moment of streaming, including the online streaming applications, the person, the music and the context. ‘Music Streaming the Everyday Life’ demonstrates that individual music streaming experiences arise immediately and with a taken-for-granted attitude that enhances music’s role in people’s daily life. The study also offers a productive methodological model for exploring online (listening) habits that stand to benefit from immediate sampling, as it produces a fleeting, contextual understanding of people’s individual everyday experiences. The collection "Networked Music Cultures: Contemporary Approaches, Emerging Issues" presents a range of essays on contemporary music distribution and consumption patterns and practices. The contributors to the collection use a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches, discussing the consequences and effects of the digital distribution of music as it is manifested in specific cultural contexts.Download Free PDFView PDFThe metaphors we stream by: Making sense of music streamingAnja Nylund HagenIn Norway music-streaming services have become mainstream in everyday music listening. This paper examines how 12 heavy streaming users make sense of their experiences with Spotify and WiMP Music (now Tidal). The analysis relies on a mixed-method qualitative study, combining music-diary self-reports, online observation of streaming accounts, Facebook and last.fm scrobble-logs, and in-depth interviews. By drawing on existing metaphors of Internet experiences we demonstrate that music-streaming services can make sense as tools, places, and ways of being. Music streaming as lifeworld mediation is discussed as a fourth framework for understanding online music experiences, particularly those arising from mobile and ubiquitous characteristics of contemporary Internet technology.Download Free PDFView PDFMusic streaming, festivals and the eventisation of musicArnt MaasøA key aspect of music streaming services is access to their vast libraries anytime and anywhere and an abundance of choices. This article explores how artists performing at a large music festival in Norway were streamed before, during and after the festival over the course of four different years. The data shows that festival streams grew over 40 percent compared to the control weeks, and were particularly pronounced among users who lived near the venue. The article then argues that changes in listening patterns may reflect the more general shift towards the " eventisation " of streaming media.Download Free PDFView PDFSocial Streaming Navigating music as personal and social preprintAnja Nylund Hagen, Marika LüdersMusic-streaming services embed social features that enable users to connect to one another and use music as social objects. This paper examines how these features are experienced within negotiations of music as personal and social through the acts of sharing music and of following others. The analysis relies on 23 focus-group interviews with 124 Spotify or/and Tidal users, and a mixed-method study including music-diary self-reports, online observation, and interviews with 12 heavy users. Our findings suggest that users incorporate social awareness in non-sharing, selective-sharing, and all-sharing approaches with strong, weak, and absent ties. These ties are characterized by different configurations of social and music homophily. Negotiations of music as personal and social shape how music-streaming services are experienced.Download Free PDFView PDFPopular Music and SocietyThe Playlist Experience: Personal Playlists in Music Streaming Services2015 • Anja Nylund HagenMusic streaming services encompass features that enable the organization of music into playlists. This article inquires how users describe and make sense of practices and experiences of creating, curating, maintaining, and using personal playlists. The analysis relies on a mixed-method study, including music-diary self-reports, online observations, and in-depth interviews with 12 heavy users of Spotify or/and WiMP Music. The findings suggest heterogeneous management of static and dynamic playlists based on structural and contextual schemes of aggregating music. User control motivates different playlist practices that demonstrate new ways of collecting music via streaming services but also derive from pre-digital collecting.

While it is well known that streaming services collect troves of data, little is known about how stakeholders, including managers or label executives, make metric-based decisions and how they understand the impact of algorithms. The article uses anonymized interviews with music industry professionals, exploring how they use metrics in streaming services and examining their decision-making processes. The analysis concludes that they rely on a growing volume of data when making decisions about what to promote, and how. Nevertheless, most of the stakeholders focused on fairly simple metrics, such as salient spikes that were noticeable “at a glance.” When discussing these !ndings, we draw attention to the reinforcing feedback loops between metrics, data-based decisions and algorithms, questioning whether data!cation acts to intensify trending events and di"usion of new music.Download Free PDFView PDFMusical Exploration via Streaming Services: The Norwegian Experience (Popular Communication)2016 • Yngvar KjusStreaming services for music are growing worldwide, and the Nordic countries are leading the way. In Norway, streaming represented 88 percent of digital music revenues in 2014, as opposed to 23 percent globally. In essence, streaming services offer subscribers access to vast databases of music, and offer artists new means of exposure and sources of revenue. This article argues that the possibility of musical discovery is essential to these services’ distribution model. It examines the provisions for exploration through streaming, pointing to automated algorithms and human curation as key devices. It then collects quantitative data on the presentation of music via a Norwegian service (WiMP/Tidal) and qualitative findings from interviews with consumers about their experiences with music streaming. Key discrepancies arise between the promise and the reality of streamed-music discovery, both for artists seeking new fans (and funds) and for audiences expecting streaming to supersede existing forms of musical exploration.Download Free PDFView PDFRegulating Dissemination: a comparative digital ethnography of licensed and unlicensed spheres of music circulationBlake DurhamDownload Free PDFView PDFMusic in Streams: Communicating Music in the Streaming ParadigmAnja Nylund HagenStreaming services have become a key player in the cultural industries in sharing media content with audiences. This chapter addresses how on-demand music-streaming services, the world's most popular format for the distribution of recorded music, have driven new professional music industry practices that are affected by, and affect in turn, the ways in which music communicates. Based on insights from two larger projects focused upon the digitization of the music industry and empirical material from interviews with Norwegian popular music managers, this chapter explores the work and the strategy behind contemporary music distribution in the context of streaming-service logics. By addressing how the streaming format disrupts the "audience-media engine" (Wikström 2013) in ways that radically impact music's media presence audience reach, audience approval, and audience action, the chapter identifies new dynamics in the relationship between listeners and music. It then analyzes the ways in which these dynamics afford yet other distribution practices in the music industry, according to two communication patterns. These patterns have particular purposes and methods but share an alignment with the logics of distributed communication, either within or outside of the streaming services, where the struggle for audience attention is paramount. The chapter concludes with a discussion of streaming's impact upon the negotiation of new practices in the music industry derived from the abundance and intangibility of those services, as well as their multiple options for music consumption. The chapter explains how the communication adapted to the streaming paradigm is characterized by content circulation among the layers and fragments of global networks and multiple platforms, linking artists, fans, music, and the industry in new, less predictable ways. The work of communication management hence grows in importance in a streaming-dominated music industry that might also be characterized as a communication industry in its own right.Download Free PDFView PDFMusic and DiscoveryNabeel ZuberiIntroduction to Special Issue on Music and Discovery, edited by Tom McCourt and Nabeel Zuberi in Popular Communication: The International Journal of Media and CultureDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
