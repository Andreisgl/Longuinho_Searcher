It is not uncommon to use foreign-developed psychological tests (e.g. PCQ-24 developed in the USA) in South Africa . However, test transportability should be substantiated by investigating the psychometric properties of the instrument when used on a South African sample. This study attempted to provide internal and external validation (in terms of outcomes related to PsyCap) evidence in favour of using the PCQ-24 as a measure of the PsyCap construct within South Africa.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPsychological capital, subjective well-being, burnout and job satisfaction amongst educators in the Umlazi region in South AfricaHerbert Kanengoni, Johanna BuitendachDownload Free PDFView PDFThe relationship between work locus of control and psychological capital amongst middle managers in the recruitment industry of South AfricaDr. Zurayda  ShaikIntroduction For the most part, personalities in the workplace play a significant role. Spector (1982, p. 482) notes that 'major theories in organisational psychology assume that the same basic processes account for behaviour across all individuals and that situational characteristics cause predictable behaviour across all individuals'. Youssef and Luthans (2009) note that traits and trait-like characteristics have been consistently shown to have a significant relationship to work-related outcomes. Moreover, psychological states of psychological capital (PsyCap), such as self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience, have been found to be a baseline for development and create a causal relationship with traits. This has implications for utilising traits as a predictor of positive work states, which can be further developed to improve organisational effectiveness. In addition, this study demonstrated the usefulness of work locus of control (WLOC) as a trait in predicting the positive psychological state of PsyCap amongst middle managers in the recruitment industry of South Africa. Hence, understanding of the trait versus the state approach in relation to enhancing positivity in the workplace can ensure that individuals' working lives are more fulfilling. Based on these statements the current study adopted a strength-based outlook in examining work. It is also further noted that the South African recruitment industry is a unique industry, facing its own set of challenges. The recruitment process itself is directed by people who need to understand the cross-cultural issues and applicability of legislations such as Affirmative Action policies, the Labour Legislations Act (No. 66 of 1995), based on South Africa's view of human dignity, and the Employment Equity Act (No. 55 of 1998), amongst others. These influence the industry to adopt practices that present unique challenges, and the applicability and understanding of the trait versus the state approach in enhancing work performance within the recruitment industry Orientation: The role of traits as a determinant of states has resulted in researchers closely examining their potential for enhancing work behaviour. This is achieved through the examination of the trait and state perspectives. Research purpose: This research sought to determine the relationship between work locus of control (WLOC) and psychological capital (PsyCap), with the objective of increasing alertness on the trait and state approach. Motivation for the study: The current study investigated the role of traits and states in contributing to the positive psychology arena within the recruitment industry.Download Free PDFView PDFSA Journal of Industrial PsychologyWork engagement and psychological capital in the Italian public administration: A new resource-based intervention programme2017 • Arianna CostantiniOrientation: Organisations need energetic and dedicated employees to enhance the quality of their services and products continuously. According to the Conservation of Resources Theory, it is possible to increase work engagement of employees by improving their personal resources. Research purpose: The main aim of this study was to examine the extent to which an improvement in psychological capital, as a personal resource, might enhance work engagement of employees in the public sector. Motivation for the study: This study was developed to investigate how and to what extent interventions aiming at fostering higher work engagement through the enhancement of psychological capital were certainly effective. Research design, approach and method: To improve psychological capital, a new resource-based intervention programme (FAMILY intervention) was developed and applied, in which six dimensions – namely framing, attitudes, meaningfulness, identity, leading self and yoked together – were improved. A semi-experimental research design (pre-test and post-test) was used to conduct this study. Participants were 54 employees working in an Italian public health administration. In the pre-test and post-test stages, data were collected by using the psychological capital and work engagement scales. Main findings: Results showed that there is a positive relationship between psychological capital and work engagement in the pre-test and post-test stages, considered separately. In addition, comparing pre-test and post-test results revealed that the intervention programme significantly improved both psychological capital and work engagement. This shows that an improvement in psychological capital is consistent with an increase in work engagement. Conclusion: Together, these findings prove that psychological capital can be considered as a set of personal resources which lead to increased work engagement. Contribution/value-add: This study bridged the gap found in the literature between the role of psychological capital in fostering higher work engagement and the extent to which interventions are effective among employees working in public administration.Download Free PDFView PDFMILITARY PSYCHOLOGYWorking in the hangar: The impact of psychological capital on work outcomes among army aircraft mechanics (MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY)Sait GURBUZBased on positive organizational behavior, this study aimed to explore the impact of psychological capital (PsyCap) on task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, affective commitment, and job satisfaction among army aircraft mechanics. Data was obtained from 260 aircraft mechanics working in various Turkish Army aviation units. The hypotheses were tested using a series of hierarchical regressions. The results indicated that those with higher PsyCap are more likely to depict task performance, engage in highly extrarole behaviors, be more committed to their organizations, and be highly satisfied with their jobs that are advantageous to army aviation settings. The authors concluded that promoting the levels of PsyCap could be effective in elevating aircraft mechanics’ work attitudes and behaviors. Military aviation units are encouraged to establish human resource development programs to foster the PsyCap of their soldiers, which in turn, enhances crucial work attitudes.Download Free PDFView PDFImpact of Positive Psychological Capital on Employee Well-Being Over TimeAlvaro QuirozDownload Free PDFView PDFOPUSRole of Psychological Capital and Spiritual Transcendence in Quality of Life Among Social Workers2017 • Publishing India GroupCertain professions are demanding and often the cause of stress among the professionals.

The effects of psychological capital on work engagement and employee morale2015 • Soyon PaekThis study examines work engagement as a partial mediator of the effect of psychological capital (Psy-Cap) on employee morale in a sample of hotel employees. A survey was carried out with 312 front-linestaff from 15 five-star hotels in Seoul, Korea. A one-month time-lag design (Time 1: PsyCap and workengagement; Time 2: employee morale) was used to reduce potential common method bias. The hypoth-esized relationships in the model were tested using structural equation modeling. The results suggestthat work engagement partially mediates the effect of PsyCap on job satisfaction and affective organi-zational commitment. Specifically, front-line employees with high PsyCap are more engaged with theirwork and more likely to display job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment. The studyconcludes with a discussion of its empirical findings, strengths, theoretical contributions, and practicalimplications. Limitations and their implications for future studies are also reviewed.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of ManagementThe Additive Value of Positive Psychological Capital in Predicting Work Attitudes and Behaviors2010 • Fred Luthans, James AveyDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
