This funerary custom appears to be anomalous in the context of Bronze Age southern Italy. On the other hand, such a burial location near to a fortification wall mirrors the funerary evidence from Bronze Age hillforts (castellieri/gradine) in Istria, a region that indeed had close relationships with northern Apulia. Evidence from other European regions is also taken into account, in order to evaluate to what extent this phe-nomenon was a distinctive trait pointing to interaction between the south-western and north-eastern Adriatic and what their nature was. European contexts offer only generic similarities, whereas the consistency of funerary practices at settlements in the Adriatic area, based on a close association with defensive lines, appears to be far from random.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Interpreting long-lived-in dwelling spaces: integrated spatial analysis of a Late Bronze Age area at Coppa Nevigata (south-eastern Italy)by Enrico Lucci, Giulia Recchia, girolamo fiorentino, Vittorio Mironti, milena  primavera, and Melissa VilmercatiUse of Space and Domestic Areas: Functional Organisation and Social Strategies,  2021archaeological and ethnoarchaeological studies.

For the Bronze Age in the central Mediterranean spatial analyses integrating various ranges of data, from artefacts to ecofacts, still remain limited in number. Moreover, studies have mainly focussed on well-preserved contexts affected by sudden destructions; spaces inhabited over long periods and so subjected to dynamic depositional processes, are more challenging to interpret as to their function(s). Yet, these latter are commonly encountered archaeological contexts. Representing palimpsests of repeated activities, they are valuable case studies for investigating the spatial organisation of activities.This paper presents an integrated spatial analysis of a long-occupied area of the Coppa Nevigata settlement from the Late Bronze Age. It is a trial, aimed at both building a viable methodology to deal with ‘dynamic’ deposits and verifying the potential of the observed record in terms of activity areas and fossilised patterns of behaviour.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Reaching across the Adriatic: northern and western interactions of the Cetina phenomenon (25th–20th centuries BC)Godišnjak/Jahrbuch 2020,49,  2020As is well known, peninsular Italy was considerably involved in the “Cetina phenomenon” during th... more As is well known, peninsular Italy was considerably involved in the “Cetina phenomenon” during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, as illustrated by the occurrence of pottery akin to Cetina-types at several sites on the Adriatic side; recent discoveries in present-day Campania have enriched this picture and evidence from the north-east (present-day Veneto and Trentino), besides that from the Trieste/Slovenian karst, may also enlarge this range of connections. The most probable hypothesis to explain the situation is that of small groups, which identified themselves with some elements that we consider as ‘Cetina’, moving from the eastern Adriatic (mainly Dalmatia) to the northern and western Adriatic. Several questions remain open, such as those related to the patterns of interaction between the eastern Adriatic small groups reaching the Italian regions and the local communities. What was the dimension of these cross-cultural contacts and how did they differ from one region to another? To what extent did the foreign groups blend with the local ones? Which were the aftermaths of these interactions? This paper presents a critical reconsideration of the available evidence from continental and penin- sular present-day Italy, including the geographical setting of sites and reciprocal distances, with the aim of tracing similarities and differences between the various cases. Hypotheses on both the chronology and patterns of these Cetina interactions are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper seeks to examine in detail some aspects considered of value in both proposing and discussing avenues of interpretation for this subject. In particular, the demography of Copper Age communities of central-southern Italy, their patterns of social self-representation through funerary costumes, the social role of warriors and warfare are discussed. These issues in the past have been mostly analysed separately from one another. Their correlation here, to achieve a broader, holistic picture of Copper Age societies, constitutes the main innovative point of this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular the historic trajectories of the Tyrrhenian regions and those of the Adriatic regions of Italy are compared and contrasted, taking into account their involvement in maritime exchange networks. 10 years ago the authors dealt with this subject. Although little time has passed since then, fresh archaeo- logical data and the renewed scholarly debate allow for revisiting the subject of Bronze Age maritime networks in the Central Mediterranean, especially as regards modes, times and places of these long-range economic and cultural interactions and the aftermaths these had on the Italian regions involved.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2500-2000 BC: connectivity phenomena between the Balkans, Greece, Southern Italy, Eastern Sicily, the Aeolian Islands and Maltaby Maja Gori, Alberto Cazzella, and Giulia RecchiaRecent research projects have provided new data to tackle the issue of long range cultural contac... more Recent research projects have provided new data to tackle the issue of long range cultural contacts and movements of small human groups across the Central Mediterranean during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. This complex phenomenon, whose epicentre was probably the Dalmatian culture of Cetina, implies intertwined processes of interactions between various regions. Unlike the previous periods, when evidence of cross-cultural contacts mostly consists of similarities in the material culture between regions, in the period under scrutiny it is possible to recognise both close parallels in pottery production and the circulation of imports/imitations of artefacts made of bone/antler, stone and metal. The paper offers a brief reconsideration of the available data from the western Balkans, western Greece and from various contexts in southern Italy, Sicily and the small adjacent islands that were involved in these long-range interactions. A critical evaluation of the incidence of allogenous artefacts in the various contexts is also provided. The impact of the Bell Beaker phenomenon in the area under scrutiny is also discussed. This was infact marginal, though Bell Beaker-type elements did actually co-exist with western Balkan-type ones in some of the examined regions. Finally, the chronological aspect of the ‘Cetina phenomenon’ is discussed: two sub-phases in these processes of interactions are argued to be discernible, which helps a more detailed understanding of the socio-ideological mechanisms at play on the local scale.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Over this span of time, the foundations were laid for the process towards urbanisation that occurred in various Italian regions at the threshold of the historic period.Two major settlement patterns are recognised, each having specific variations on a regional scale and depending on environmental conditions: 1) small hamlets, often forming definite clusters, which had a long tradition and tended to be resilient to socio-cultural changes; 2) larger settlements, devoted to exchange activities and craft production, which were mostly naturally/artificially fortified, long-lasting and more prone to internal changes. These latter in particular developed from the 18th century BC onwards. Some ceased at the end of the 1st millennium BC, but others instead grew, existing alongside new-established flourishing centres that based their success on both their agricultural and military potentials, so enabling their fast demographic growth.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Coppa Nevigata e i suoi rapporti con la facies dei CastellieriPreistoria e Protostoria del Caput Adriae - E. Borgna, P. Càssola Guida, S. Corazza (Eds),  2018Contacts between the Bronze Age settlement of Coppa Nevigata and the Castellieri culture –

In particular, the settlement of Coppa Nevigata not only has yielded ceramic and metal productions inspired by Dalmatian and north-eastern Adriatic models, but also the complex fortification lines and practice of interments near them closely recall similar features characterising the ‘Castellieri’ of Caput Adriae. The authors discuss evidence related to contacts and exchange across the Adriatic and propose some hypotheses about these patterns of relationships and their development during the Bronze Age period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This structure shows anomalous features in comparison with other structures at the site. In par- ticular it is defined on one side by a semi-circular bench made of clay, above which lie a series of 11 clay rings arranged in a row. The south-east side of the structure was severely damaged in recent time, so that it is not possible to work out its complete shape that could have been either horseshoe shaped or elliptical. It is also difficult to figure out the actual function of the clay rings. These could have been placed at the base of posts supporting the roofing, yet they appear to be too close to each other. Alternatively, they could have constituted the supports of vessels or other items, but in this case we should assume that the structure was unroofed. Inside the structure there were a hearth encircled by a clay kerb and various fragments of big por- table ovens made of raw clay. On the basis of parallels with other southern Italian contexts yielding portable ovens of the same type, the authors hypothesise that the structure was used to prepare collective meals for ritual occasions (feastings). This pattern of use would be consistent with that hypothesised for the area just north of the structure, characterised by several clay cooking platforms.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
NEW EVIDENCE ON PURPLE DYE PRODUCTION FROM THE BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT OF COPPA NEVIGATA (APULIA, ITALY)by Giulia Recchia and Claudia MinnitiTextiles and Dyes in the Mediterranean Economy and Society,  2018Evidence related to the gathering of murex for purple-dye production at the Bronze Age settlement... more Evidence related to the gathering of murex for purple-dye production at the Bronze Age settlement of Coppa Nevi- gata (Apulia, Italy) is considerable, as discussed elsewhere. Previous studies have shown that the processing of purple-dye possibly started from the 19-18th centuries BC and continued throughout the entire Bronze Age, reaching its highest peak in the Middle Bronze Age (15th –14th c. BC), and then decreasing in the Late Bronze Age (13th – 12th c. BC). The variation in the amount of crushed murex shells at the site in the different periods is likely to be linked to the exchange network with the eastern Mediterranean, where purple-dye was much appreciated. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that the disparity of the murex shell proportion per period also results from some biases, such as the different extent and volume of the deposits unearthed for each period. In view of a better understanding of the dynamics of purple-dye production and defining of the use of murex shells through time, new data from the on-going excavations at the settlement (seasons 1983-2005) are presented. Specific attention is paid to deposition process and contextual detail of shell assemblages, as well as to the “shell fragments/estimated soil removed” ratio, in order to evaluate to what extent bias factors could have affected the significance of the samples.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, the transformations of the defensive lines of the settlement through time are discussed, as in all likelihood these were strictly linked to both defensive and offensive strategies and their changes. In this framework, the evidence of the assault that the settlement witnessed around 1500 BC, which caused a severe  re in a portion of the village, is analyzed.Moreover, funerary data from northern Apulia and adjacent areas provide impor- tant evidence to deal with the problems related to both the weaponry and social role of the individuals that were actively involved in these warfare activities. Particular attention is devoted to this latter aspect, as it is closely related to that of the speci c goals and targets of organized violence and aggressions in Bronze- Age South-Eastern Italy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Ceramiche egee e di tipo egeo da Coppa Nevigata (FG): nuovi documentiby Giulia Recchia and Lucia VagnettiPreistoria e Protostoria della Puglia  - F.

This has significantly increased the quantity of Aegean-type pottery from the site that amounts to nearly two hundred pieces. The vast majority of these sherds, which are mostly local imitations of Mycenaean pottery, come from the Late Subapennine levels. Therefore, we have now good evidence that a specialised pottery production flourished at Coppa Nevigata in the Late Bronze Age, as it is already known at several south-eastern Italian settlements. The present paper offers a synthetic discussion of the different aspects related to the occurrence of this kind of pottery productions at the site, ranging from the chrono-typological aspects, to the spatial distribution of these finds within the settlement during the different periods, to the exchange networks which Coppa Nevi- gata was involved in over the Bronze Age.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The extensive systematic excavations at the site together with the results of a wide range of multi- disciplinary analyses provide us with an enlightening insight into the pattern of activities that were carried out in the set- tlement. Moreover, there is good evidence for figuring out the exchange relationships of the site on both local and international scales. This paper is aimed at giving a synthetic overview of the role that Coppa Nevigata played within the wider Bronze Age economic system during each phase of its long-lasting life. Furthermore, on the basis of the evidence coming from the 30 year long research at the site, authors deal with the problem of social transformations and the trajectory towards the development of a political organisation of a hierarchic type.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The detailed chronological sequence related to this region and specific local differences are highlighted, in particular the differentiation between central-northern and central-southern Apulia. Authors analyse then the available data to figure out the social and economic organisation of these Bronze Age communities. As far as the settlement pattern is concerned, it seems possible to single out two principal models: 1) long-lasting settlements characterised by a greater pop- ulation size, which were often fortified and were related to both craft and exchange activities; 2) small settlements often organised in clusters, which were principally devoted to agro-pastoral activities. Funerary customs are analysed too. These appear to vary according to both geographical and chronological factors. Finally, evidence of various cultic places occurring in this region is discussed and compared with contexts of the same kind in other areas of southern Italy. Some traces of cultic practices have been identified in settlements, nevertheless the major phenomenon is related to structures specifically built to carry out cultic activities, such as the well-known cultic hypogea.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Inside the structure there were a hearth encircled by a clay kerb and various fragments of big por- table ovens made of raw clay. On the basis of parallels with other southern Italian contexts yielding portable ovens of the same type, the authors hypothesise that the structure was used to prepare collective meals for ritual occasions (feastings). This pattern of use would be consistent with that hypothesised for the area just north of the structure, characterised by several clay cooking platforms.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
NEW EVIDENCE ON PURPLE DYE PRODUCTION FROM THE BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT OF COPPA NEVIGATA (APULIA, ITALY)by Giulia Recchia and Claudia MinnitiTextiles and Dyes in the Mediterranean Economy and Society,  2018Evidence related to the gathering of murex for purple-dye production at the Bronze Age settlement... more Evidence related to the gathering of murex for purple-dye production at the Bronze Age settlement of Coppa Nevi- gata (Apulia, Italy) is considerable, as discussed elsewhere. Previous studies have shown that the processing of purple-dye possibly started from the 19-18th centuries BC and continued throughout the entire Bronze Age, reaching its highest peak in the Middle Bronze Age (15th –14th c. BC), and then decreasing in the Late Bronze Age (13th – 12th c. BC). The variation in the amount of crushed murex shells at the site in the different periods is likely to be linked to the exchange network with the eastern Mediterranean, where purple-dye was much appreciated. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that the disparity of the murex shell proportion per period also results from some biases, such as the different extent and volume of the deposits unearthed for each period. In view of a better understanding of the dynamics of purple-dye production and defining of the use of murex shells through time, new data from the on-going excavations at the settlement (seasons 1983-2005) are presented. Specific attention is paid to deposition process and contextual detail of shell assemblages, as well as to the “shell fragments/estimated soil removed” ratio, in order to evaluate to what extent bias factors could have affected the significance of the samples.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, the transformations of the defensive lines of the settlement through time are discussed, as in all likelihood these were strictly linked to both defensive and offensive strategies and their changes. In this framework, the evidence of the assault that the settlement witnessed around 1500 BC, which caused a severe  re in a portion of the village, is analyzed.Moreover, funerary data from northern Apulia and adjacent areas provide impor- tant evidence to deal with the problems related to both the weaponry and social role of the individuals that were actively involved in these warfare activities. Particular attention is devoted to this latter aspect, as it is closely related to that of the speci c goals and targets of organized violence and aggressions in Bronze- Age South-Eastern Italy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Ceramiche egee e di tipo egeo da Coppa Nevigata (FG): nuovi documentiby Giulia Recchia and Lucia VagnettiPreistoria e Protostoria della Puglia  - F.

This has significantly increased the quantity of Aegean-type pottery from the site that amounts to nearly two hundred pieces. The vast majority of these sherds, which are mostly local imitations of Mycenaean pottery, come from the Late Subapennine levels. Therefore, we have now good evidence that a specialised pottery production flourished at Coppa Nevigata in the Late Bronze Age, as it is already known at several south-eastern Italian settlements. The present paper offers a synthetic discussion of the different aspects related to the occurrence of this kind of pottery productions at the site, ranging from the chrono-typological aspects, to the spatial distribution of these finds within the settlement during the different periods, to the exchange networks which Coppa Nevi- gata was involved in over the Bronze Age.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The extensive systematic excavations at the site together with the results of a wide range of multi- disciplinary analyses provide us with an enlightening insight into the pattern of activities that were carried out in the set- tlement. Moreover, there is good evidence for figuring out the exchange relationships of the site on both local and international scales. This paper is aimed at giving a synthetic overview of the role that Coppa Nevigata played within the wider Bronze Age economic system during each phase of its long-lasting life. Furthermore, on the basis of the evidence coming from the 30 year long research at the site, authors deal with the problem of social transformations and the trajectory towards the development of a political organisation of a hierarchic type.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
La Puglia tra Bronzo Antico e Bronzo RecentePreistoria e Protostoria della Puglia - F. Radina (Ed.),  2017APULIA BETWEEN THE EARLY AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE
In this paper the main cultural aspects that cha... more APULIA BETWEEN THE EARLY AND THE LATE BRONZE AGEIn this paper the main cultural aspects that characterise Apulia between the Early and the Late Bronze Age are taken into consideration. The detailed chronological sequence related to this region and specific local differences are highlighted, in particular the differentiation between central-northern and central-southern Apulia. Authors analyse then the available data to figure out the social and economic organisation of these Bronze Age communities. As far as the settlement pattern is concerned, it seems possible to single out two principal models: 1) long-lasting settlements characterised by a greater pop- ulation size, which were often fortified and were related to both craft and exchange activities; 2) small settlements often organised in clusters, which were principally devoted to agro-pastoral activities. Funerary customs are analysed too. These appear to vary according to both geographical and chronological factors. Finally, evidence of various cultic places occurring in this region is discussed and compared with contexts of the same kind in other areas of southern Italy. Some traces of cultic practices have been identified in settlements, nevertheless the major phenomenon is related to structures specifically built to carry out cultic activities, such as the well-known cultic hypogea.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sono presi in esame i diversi modi in cui si affermano tali diseguaglianze nel Mediterraneo centrale fra il 6000 e il 1000 circa a.C.: differenze di età e di genere; articolazioni nelle attività svolte, con il graduale mergere di specialisti; rapporti tra più gruppi di parentela all’interno della stessa comunità e rapporti tra più comunità, con lo sviluppo anche di attività belliche organizzate; relazioni diversificate tra nuclei emergenti e gruppi subalterni. Un ruolo importante in questo processo di trasformazione sicuramente ebbero i contatti con realtà esterne, soprattutto del Mediterraneo orientale, per quel che riguarda la circolazione di materie prime e manufatti, tecniche produttive e modelli culturali, anche nell’ambito della mobilità di piccoli gruppi di individui: non si tratta di tornare alle tradizionali ipotesi diffusioniste, ormai superate, in cui tutte le innovazioni derivano da oriente e le comunità occidentali si limitavano ad acquisirle passivamente, ma di tenere conto delle complesse interazioni culturali che ebbero luogo con molteplici meccanismi.Gli autori esplorano questi temi tenendo conto dei più recenti dati disponibili e degli apporti che le scienze fisiche e naturali forniscono per una più approfondita comprensione dei processi storici che condussero da situazioni di uguaglianza sociale, nelle più antiche comunità neolitiche, all’insorgere, nel corso dell’età del Bronzo, delle prime forme di potere trasmesse per via ereditaria e di stabili differenze nell’accesso alle risorse economiche, che saranno alla base delle articolazioni sociali di epoca storica.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
CALL FOR PAPERS: Archaeology of Mountainous Landscapes in Balkan Prehistory (provisional title)by Maja Gori, Giulia Recchia, Anja Hellmuth Kramberger, and Tobias KrapfThis edited book stems from the session "Archaeology of Mountainous Landscapes in Balkan Prehisto... more This edited book stems from the session "Archaeology of Mountainous Landscapes in Balkan Prehistory" held at the 25th EAA in Bern. In that occasion the interplay between human groups and the mountainous landscape of the Balkan Peninsula and its change over time were discussed. The term Balkan-a chain of wooded mountains in Turkish-describes indeed the region's main geographic feature. In the session, however, the interconnection between different Balkan landscapes-mountain ranges intersected by small plateaus and deep river valleys that give way to narrow plains near the sea-emerged. It was stressed that if the river system played a major role as communication route, connecting inland areas to both the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, throughout the Prehistory the Balkan mountains represented more often zones of contact rather than barriers. Connectivity between close and faraway regions was addressed by tracing exchange routes and corridors, and by pointing out the key role of different types of raw materials, goods and social exchanges. What can (or could) be seen when interpreting the human use of space was also thoroughly discussed by addressing the role of Bronze and Iron Age barrows in structuring ritualscapes, and the visual dominance over the surrounding landscape of stone fortifications-in some cases monumental-enclosing hillforts. The following issues emerged during the lively session debate will be addressed in the volume: 1) Social and cultural meanings of spaces and places in the Balkan Peninsula. These include "natural" (such as peaks, woods, rivers and springs) and "anthropic" (such as settlements, cemeteries, and shrines) places of significance, and the paths and routes connecting them. 2) Building "local" and "global" identities, change and endurance of cultural patterns and socio-political relations in different landscapes. When do mountains, rivers, lakes and seas represent borders? When do they represent connecting spaces? 3) Sacred landscapes: perception and reshaping of natural landscapes in connection with cult practices and funerary customs. 4) Appropriation of resources in different environments. Resources are intended as socially produced constructions expressing what people perceived as relevant for their life, and satisfying both physical and social needs. The main goal of the proposed volume is to stimulate a theoretical informed debate based on archaeological evidence by cutting across traditional geographic, methodological, and chronological boundaries and by challenging established assumptions and interpretative frameworks. We strongly encourage you to keep this focus in your papers. Papers adopting a comparative or diachronic perspective stressing both local characteristics and features shared on an interregional scale are especially welcome.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In fact, thi... more Coppa Nevigata was a key-site as regards southern Italy during the whole Bronze Age. In fact, this settlement played a central role in northern Apulia as a terminal of both transmarine and terrestrial exchange networks. Artefacts, productive activities and structures documented at the site testify how strong the connections with northern Adriatic regions, both Italian and Balkan ones, as well as with southern Adriatic regions and the Aegean have been. Moreover, multi-year field research at the site makes it one of the more extensively unearthed Bronze Age settlements in Italy so far. Systematic excavations, in fact, have been carried out since the '60s and have brought to light a wide portion of both the elaborate defensive lines and the dwelling. Therefore we have been provided with good evidence about the transformations this settlement underwent over the one thousand years of his unbroken occupation, which furthermore were strongly related to the broader ongoing social and economic changes within the central Mediterranean. This volume, which is divided into three parts, is aimed at giving a preliminary overview over the results of the research carried out at Coppa Nevigata during the last 40 years. In the first part overall results of the excavations led by Salvatore M. Puglisi in collaboration with Alba Palmieri between 1972 and 1975 are presented in detail. The second one, on the other hand, is devoted to discuss the results of the ongoing excavations, started in 1983. Finally, the third part collects papers by scientists and archaeologists that thoroughly approach various subjects, ranging from paleoeconomic and paleoenvironmental analyses, to archaeological and archaeometric analyses of artefacts linked to transmarine exchanges, to the study of funerary practices attested at the site, to the discussion of radiometric dates related to the different phases of the settlement.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cyclesof use and discarding of pottery at the site produced a massive amount of shards, whose primary deposition has been subject toalteration by anthropic and natural processes.Pottery productions are indeed a significant source for the understanding of socio-economic dynamics, besides their potential aschronological markers. Quantitative analyses have been applied to investigate different dimensions of the pottery assemblagesfrom Coppa Nevigata, ranging from stylistic variability through time, to synchronic stylistic variability among different areas of thesettlement, to pottery function and archaeometric analyses. However, most of the ceramic record at the site consists of non-diagnosticfragments. How can we fully exploit their potential as indicators for depositional processes? To what extent are they significantfor the understanding of the patterns of use of settlement areas?We will present the spatial analysis of a case study area from the site, belonging to the Late Bronze Age (12th century BC). Througha multi-scalar approach to the quantitative analysis of pottery distribution -including non-diagnostic shards, we seek to recognisepatterns of activities and use of spaces. Statistic-based quantitative analyses are adopted to define potsherd size groups andidentify patterns of pottery disposal, categories of pottery refuse and depositional processes, also considering variables such asthe intended function of pottery and the nature of deposits.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Evidence of people’s actions and natural events materialize in concentrations of artefacts and ecofacts that enable us to trace human past behaviors. Not surprisingly, quantification methods are a recurrent issue in archaeological research about all categories of objects, their typologies and distributions. Traditionally, much attention has been paid to the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques of quantitative analysis, greatly expanding the amount of data at our disposal. Yet, the lack of uniformity in their application does not always allow for comparison, making therefore those datasets not fully usable (Orton 1993; Arcelin&Tuffreau-Libre 1998). This lack of unified quantifying methods is not only a hindrance to the interpretation of datasets, but also to engaging with formation biases, which are essential for understanding whether these analyses are valid in the first place. This session aims to go beyond diverging enumeration methods of observed evidence in the present, and take a step to develop more synergy within the fragmented landscape of quantification in material studies. To do so we seek to gather a variety of case studies across Europe, the Mediterranean and beyond that illustrate innovative approaches to artefacts quantification, but that also go into the direction of setting common baselines against which different data can be more efficiently compared and measured. Topics to be explored could include, but are not limited to:- sampling strategies and their impact on the amount of information allowing reasonable interpretation of assemblages;- quantification of surface finds collected in field surveys and the effects of applied methodology on research results;- applicability of diversity measurements for tracing change in the material record, craft production and consumption patterns;- determining relative abundance: assessment of innovative and well-established mathematical models. We encourage contributions that provide (new) quantitative frameworks to investigate the material record, engage with methodological issues in quantifying material assemblages, foster to quantitatively integrate different datasets as well as discuss the problems and the needs for doing so.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
