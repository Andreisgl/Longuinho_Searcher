Influence of pH, adsorbent dose and contact time on the adsorption were investigated. The fluoride adsorption capacity of activated form was found to be higher than that of the original form. The maximum removal of fluoride ion was obtained at pH 5.5. The removal of fluoride was expressed with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve was found to be significant. It was found that the sufficient time for adsorption equilibrium of fluoride ions is 2 h. The possibility of removal of fluoride ion by using red mud is explained on the basis of the chemical nature and specific interaction with metal oxide surfaces and the results are interpreted in terms of pH variations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mustafa Ersoz•  6  Chemical Engineering, Analytical Chemistry, Red Mud, Adsorption Isotherm ModelsNitrate removal from aqueous solutions by cross-linked chitosan beads conditioned with sodium bisulfateSave to LibraryDownloadby Sudipta Chatterjee•  18  Engineering, Thermodynamics, Modeling, Water PurificationWater Vapor Adsorption Isotherms of Guava, Mango and PineappleSave to LibraryDownloadby M.

The influence of contact time, pH, initial concentration of studied dye and adsorbent dose on the adsorption process has been investigated applying batch experiments. The concentration of remaining dye has been determined using molecular absorption spectrometry at wave length of 580 nm. The maximum removal of studied dye has been realized at pH 7.5 with a percent removal of 99.2% after 20 min of agitation time. Langmuir, Freundlich,and Temkin isotherm models exemplify the best fit for the experimental data; while the elevated adsorption capacity was 181.1 mg.g1. Adsorption kinetics of crystal violet was expected sufficiently with the empirical pseudo-second-order model. Corresponding to the adsorption capacity, olive leaves powder thought as a low cost, effective, and environmentally friendly biosorbent for the removal of crystal violet dye from aqueous solutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Khaled  Elsherif•  4  Kinetics, Adsorption and wastewater treatment, Biosorption of water pollutants using biomass, Adsorption Isotherm ModelsActivated carbon/iron oxide magnetic composites for the adsorption of contaminants in waterSave to LibraryDownloadby Luiz Oliveira•  12  Engineering, Carbon, Activated Carbon, Physical sciencesThe Dynamic Adsorption of Charged Amphiphiles: The Evolution of the Surface Concentration, Surface Potential, and Surface TensionSave to LibraryDownloadby Sammy Datwani•  14  Engineering, Mass Transfer, Kinetics, ElectrostaticsMoisture adsorption behaviour of esterified rubber wood ( Hevea brasiliensis )Save to LibraryDownloadby Shakti Chauhan•  11  Building, Hevea brasiliensis, Maleic Anhydride, Relative HumidityAdsorption of phenolic compounds from aqueous solution onto a macroporous polymer and its aminated derivative: isotherm analysisSave to LibraryDownloadby Jessie Chen•  27  Engineering, Earth Sciences, Thermodynamics, KineticsRecombinant aprotinin produced in transgenic corn seed: Extraction and purification studiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Zivko Nikolov•  20  Production, Biotechnology, Multidisciplinary, Downstream ProcessingAdsorption of phenols by papermill sludgesSave to LibraryDownloadby Elisa Nardi•  9  Kinetics, Environmental Pollution, Multidisciplinary, AdsorptionHysteresis in the cyclic adsorption of acetone, ethanol and ethyl acetate on activated carbonSave to LibraryDownloadby Carlos Costa•  10  Engineering, High Pressure, Carbon, Activated CarbonInterfacial tension of gelatin/sodium dodecylsulphate solutions against air, toluene, and diethylphthalateThe adsorption isotherms between aqueous solutions of sodium dodecylsulphate and gelatin against air, toluene, or diethylphthalate were determined using the spinning drop method.

The results qualitatively and quantitatively agreed with those found by surface tension measurements on sodium dodecylsulphate/gelatin solutions using the ring method in the version of Du Noüy. Interaction between gelatin and the surfactant will yield complexes which are more interfacially active than the components by themselves. The saturation of the interfaces occurs at lower concentrations than in solutions of the single components.Save to LibraryDownloadby Torbjörn Wärnheim•  5  Materials Engineering, Interfacial Tension, Surface Tension, Adsorption Isotherm ModelsBiosorption of nickel(II) and copper(II) ions from aqueous solution by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)Save to LibraryDownloadby ihsan khan•  19  Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Kinetics, AdsorptionInteractions between Talc Particles and Water and Organic SolventsSave to LibraryDownloadby Harold Malandrini•  7  Engineering, Physical sciences, CHEMICAL SCIENCES, Surface TensionComparison of two and three parameters adsorption isotherm for Cr(VI) onto Kraft ligninSave to LibraryDownloadby Tatjana Došenović•  2  Chemical Engineering, Adsorption Isotherm ModelsSurfactant distribution in waterborne acrylic filmsSave to LibraryDownloadby Yves Holl•  9  Engineering, Raman Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Physical sciencesAdsorptive removal of congo red, a carcinogenic textile dye by chitosan hydrobeads: Binding mechanism, equilibrium and kineticsPhysico-chemical investigation on adsorption of congo red, an anionic azo dye by chitosan hydrobeads has been carried out.

Adsorption process has been found to be dependant on temperature with optimum activity at 30 °C. Both ionic interaction as well as physical forces is responsible for binding of congo red with chitosan. Theoretical correlation of the experimental equilibrium adsorption data for congo red–chitosan hydrobeads system would be best explained by linearized form of Langmuir isotherm model. The kinetic results follow pseudo second-order rate equation. pH of the experimental solution influenced congo red adsorption inversely, and ∼20.0% of the dye could be desorbed from the loaded beads by changing the pH of the solution to alkaline range (∼pH 12.0). Both sodium chloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate significantly influenced the adsorption process.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sandipan Chatterjee•  30  Engineering, Kinetics, Modeling, NanoparticleDesign of polyvinyl alcohol mercaptyl fibers for arsenite chelationSave to LibraryDownloadby Zhongren Yue•  9  Materials Engineering, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Infrared spectroscopy, Environmental ScanningA Study of Adsorption of Water Vapour on Wool under Static and Dynamic ConditionsAdsorption of water vapour on wool provides not only textile comfort, but also convenience in transportation due to increase in its bulk density.

The adsorption and desorption isotherms of water vapour for wool were determined by both volumetric technique using a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX instrument and gravimetric method employing a Cahn 2000 electronic microbalance. Adsorption isotherm fitting to B.E.T. model and hysteresis on desorption was observed. The average effective diffusion coefficient of water in wool was found to be 8.4 × 10-14 m2s-1 at 25°C from gravimetric data. The effects of packing height and air velocity on the breakthrough curves were also investigated in the wool packed columns. For pseudo first order model, k values changing between 0.33 × 10-6 − 69 × 10-6 s-1 was obtained for 2.2–6.4 cm s-1 air velocity and 0.05–0.20 m packing height ranges.Save to LibraryDownloadby Semra Ülkü•  9  Materials Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Adsorption, First-Order LogicNitrate removal from water by nano-alumina: Characterization and sorption studiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Mika Sillanpää•  15  Chemical Engineering, Environmental Science, Kinetics, ModelingAdsorption behavior and activity of horseradish peroxidase onto polysaccharide-decorated particlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Denise Petri•  18  Light Scattering, Catalysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy, PolysaccharidesKOH modified Thevetia peruviana shell activated carbon for sorption of dimethoate from aqueous solutionModified Thevetia peruviana shell activated carbon for sorption of dimethoate from aqueous solution derived with potassium hydroxide (KOH) was studied at different concentrations for its potential application in water treatment.

The batch sorption was investigated using dimethoate solution of 10–100mg/L concentrations. Proximate analysis was determined and changes on the surfaces and structure of the TPS were characterized after chemical activation with KOH using XRD, FTIR, SEM–EDAX, pHpzc, BET. The quantum chemical calculation for dimethoate yielded molecule associated energies of –9.8421  (HOMO) and –2.3879 (LUMO) and a total energy of –53,376.2. The  kinetic of the sorption was modeled which indicated the sorption equilibrium time as 90min and pseudo-first order kinetics model showing R2=0.994 provided a better description of the process. Analysis of sorption equilibrium revealed that the data fitted well to Freundlich sorption isotherm model (R2=0.966), indicating multi-layer sorption of dimethoate on the surface of sorbent. The sorption of dimethoate onto KOHTPS shows 92.60% removal efficiency.Save to LibraryDownloadby WILLIAMS E ND•  7  Kinetics, Adsorption, Pesticides, Adsorption Isotherm ModelsThe Inhibition of aluminium corrosion in hydrochloric acid solution by exudate gum from Raphia hookeriSave to LibraryDownloadby Saviour Umoren and +1E.

The bamboo was cut into sizes, washing and drying was carbonized at 400oC-500oC and activated at 800oC using nitric acid. The effect of process parameters such as particle size, carbon dosage, initial concentration of adsorbate and contact time were also investigated and were found to significantly affect the adsorption capacity. The adsorption process obeyed the Freundlich, Temkin and Langmuir isotherm model indicating a monolayer formation over the surface of the material. Langmuir isotherm had a better fit than Freundlich and Temkin models with maximum monolayer saturation capacity of 166.7 mg of iron II ions adsorbed per g of bamboo activated carbon. In order to determine the mechanism of sorption, kinetic data were modeled using the pseudo first order, pseudo second order kinetic equations, and intra-particle diffusion model. The pseudo second order equation was the best applicable model to describe the sorption process. Hence the pseudo second order kinetic reaction is the rate controlling step with some intra particle diffusion taking place.Keywords: Nigerian Bamboo, Activated Carbon, IronSave to LibraryDownloadby Awajiogak A Ujile•  6  Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Kinetics, Activated carbon adsorptionRemoval of ammonium from greywater using natural zeoliteSave to LibraryDownloadby nurul widiastuti•  13  Engineering, Thermodynamics, Kinetics, AdsorptionRemoval and recovery of acridine orange from solutions by use of magnetic nanoparticlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Shahnaz M Qadri•  16  Engineering, Kinetics, Modeling, NanoparticleAdsorption of bovine serum albumin on poorly crystalline apatite: influence of maturationSave to LibraryDownloadby Ahmed Legrouri•  9  Materials Engineering, Crystal Growth, PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY, Infrared spectroscopyThe adsorption of phosphate from an aquatic environment using metal-loaded orange wasteSave to LibraryDownloadby Biplob Biswas•  7  Engineering, Kinetics, Adsorption, Physical sciencesPreparation of activated carbons from used tyres by gasification with steam and carbon dioxideSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan Carlos Gonzalez•  8  Carbon Dioxide, Multidisciplinary, Activated Carbon, PorosityTemperature effect on the zeta potential and fluoride adsorption at the α-Al2O3/aqueous solution interfaceSave to LibraryDownloadby Alejandro López-Valdivieso•  13  Engineering, Water Treatment, Adsorption, ElectrokineticsSmall angle X-ray scattering from MCM-41 and its synthesis gels: optimisation of the synthesis parametersSave to LibraryDownloadby Karen Edler•  9  Engineering, Small Angle X Ray Scattering, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Electron DiffractionAdsorption studies of methylene blue and phenol onto vetiver roots activated carbon prepared by chemical activationSave to LibraryDownloadby Sarra Gaspard•  26  Engineering, Kinetics, Adsorption, Activated CarbonAdsorption Isotherm Analysis for CO2 Capture Using Barium Oxide Impregnated Iron(III) Oxide by Ultrasonic-Assisted SynthesisThe barium oxide impregnated iron(III) oxide (BaO/Fe2O3) adsorbent was synthesized by an ultrasonic-assisted method.

The adsorbent was calcined at 200-500 °C and its adsorption capacity was measured. The ultrasonic-assisted synthesis generated well-dispersed of BaO on Fe2O3 by giving none of the BaO peaks were observed through the XRD pattern. The most efficient adsorbent of BaO/Fe2O3200 was calcined at 200 °C with adsorption capacity for physisorption and chemisorption of 5.01 and 88.81 mg/g respectively. Besides other carbonate species, it was believed the presence of the hydroxyl group could enhance the sorption by forming bicarbonate upon CO2 chemisorption. It is also possessed a lower desorption range compared to BaO and Fe2O3 alone. The experimental CO2 adsorption isotherm at 25 °C fit better with the Freundlich isotherm model. It implies a favorable adsorption process with multilayer adsorption occurs onto the heterogeneous surface.Save to LibraryDownloadby Azizul Hakim  Lahuri•  9  Adsorption, CO2 capture and storage, CO2 Capturing Processes, Iron OxideMechanistic elucidation and evaluation of biosorption of metal ions by grapefruit peel using FTIR spectroscopy, kinetics and isotherms modeling, cations displacement and EDX analysisSave to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Iqbal•  12  Kinetics, Modeling, FTIR spectroscopy, MultidisciplinaryComparison of parameters calculated from the BET and Freundlich isotherms obtained by nitrogen adsorption on activated carbons: A new method for calculating the specific surface areaSave to LibraryDownloadby Nady Passe-Coutrin•  10  Engineering, Activated Carbon, Nitrogen, Specific surface areaRemoval of lead from water using biochars prepared from hydrothermal liquefaction of biomassSave to LibraryDownloadby zhengang liu•  19  Engineering, Thermodynamics, Water, BiomassAdsorption, exchange and retention phenomena at the solid-aqueous solution interface. 1.

The data were analyzed using the Hailwood Horrobin model for isotherm fitting and determination of monolayer moisture content. The Hailwood Horrobin model was found to provide good fits to the experimental data. The extent of hysteresis exhibited between the adsorption and desorption isotherms was dependent on fiber type studied and was larger with high lignin compared with low lignin content fibers. The area bounded by the hysteresis loop decreased as the isotherms were performed at progressively higher temperatures. This behavior is consistent with sorption interactions occurring with a glassy solid below the glass transition temperature. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
