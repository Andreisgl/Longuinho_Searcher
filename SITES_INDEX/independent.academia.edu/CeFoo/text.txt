These monodisperse assemblies are at least 20 °C more stable than the parent. This approach adds to the toolkit of bottom-up molecular design with applications in protein engineering and hybrid nano-materials.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
20th Annual Conference of the International Society for Quality of Life Research: Poster Session 1 (1052): The association of poor medication adherence and drug-related problems with health status of community-dwelling Asian elderly: an interim analysisAims: Poor medication adherence and drug-related problems (DRP) are prevalent in the elderly but ... more Aims: Poor medication adherence and drug-related problems (DRP) are prevalent in the elderly but few studies have evaluated their association with health status. This study aimed to evaluate the association of poor adherence and DRP with health status of com- munity-dwelling elderly Singaporeans. Methods: Eligible patients (age = 50 years) and taking at least 5 medications, a medication with narrow therapeutic index, or having multiple healthcare providers were referred by general practitioners. Home-based medication rec- onciliation and patient surveys were conducted by pharmacists and research assistants in English or Chinese. Health status was evaluated using EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) utility (range: 0.594 to 1), visual ana- logue scale (EQ-VAS, range 0 to 100), and Short Form-36v2 (SF-36v2) physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores (norm-based with mean 50 and standard deviation (SD) 10). Adherence (good/poor) was measured using Morisky 8-item medi- cation adherence scal...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
