An arcade of three scalloped and pointed arches that appears above the text of a Ketubah (a Jewish marriage contract). The ketubah is from Herat, Afghanistan, 19th or early 20th centuries. The text in the center arch is from the Book of Isaiah, chapter 61:10, which discusses the joy and beauty of a bride and groom. From the Yale Library Judaica collection.
