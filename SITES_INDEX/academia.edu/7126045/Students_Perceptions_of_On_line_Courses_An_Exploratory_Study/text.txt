Mamun Habib. Ph.D., FCILT, SMIEEEDistance education is becoming increasingly popular across all educational institutes, and students of all ages are increasingly adopting it. Academic institutions should be aware of students' requirements and expectations in order to provide excellent education and use this information to develop successful methods and solutions for adopting remote education. "Students' Attitudes toward Online Classes across Educational Establishments" is the response to the question which has played a key role in the development and implementation of a pedagogically sound online curriculum. The paper uses qualitative and quantitative data to validate students' attitudes in order for the study to be more efficient. A formal questionnaire was used in the collection of primary data for this study. In addition, secondary data was collected from other research papers based on the topic. The questionnaire was designed with the theoretical backdrop, research topic, and study objectives in mind. Location, income, and teacher are the independent variables in the questionnaire. In addition, the dependent variables comprise ease of use, the interaction between students, course structures, and attitude. The current edition of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used to show the data as graphical representations in order to interpret the collected results. Students had optimistic perceptions regarding online learning, according to the results of the study. They believe that e-learning assists them to organize their time better, ensures learning flexibility. But on the other hand, the study also revealed the obstacles that students face when using e-learning systems which are the lack of interaction amongst students in online classes, support from faculties, lack of interest in learning new skills, lack of confidence in using elearning, inability to understand contents delivered online, ignorance of the benefits of e-learning. The value of the research can be emphasized to make the process of accrediting additional remote education programs easier, and policymakers should integrate online learning themes in the curriculum, and the government should conduct workshops and seminars for instructors to qualify them with computer knowledge and application in the classroom.Download Free PDFView PDFStudents' Perceptions of Online Learning: A Comparative Study2006 • Karl SmartDownload Free PDFView PDFPerception and Acceptance of Online Education: Do Online Courses Pass the Muster?Deborah KellyThis study seeks to evaluate the current state of online educational delivery and assess the perception of the these six issues—quality, rigor, engagement, retention, discussion component, and critical thinking—as well as acceptance of online education courses credits compared to the traditional face-to-face academic model.

End-of course evaluation data were collected from a sample of 2,750 online multisection courses taught within a 12 month period and comparisons were made between highly rated courses (at 4.5 or higher on a 5 point scale) and low rated courses (at 3.0 or lower). There was a significant difference in course evaluations as a function of academic rank, with slightly lower ratings for faculty at lower ranks relative to those at higher ranks. In general, online teaching experience and experience teaching the same course were both weak predictors of course evaluation outcomes. Overall, in highly rated courses instructors were: receptive to questions, responded promptly to emails, provided timely feedback, posted grades in a timely manner, and were perceived as active participants in the online class. Further findings and recommendations to assist faculty in understanding online teaching evaluations are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFStudents Attitude towards Online Classes at Undergraduate Level2021 • Shumaila MahmoodARTICLE DETAILS ABSTRACT History: Accepted 30 April 2021 Available Online June 2021 During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is a good time to welcome the introduction of technology and its latest offerings to make educational delivery more effective and make it more productive with online learning.
