Dating the irrigation system of the Samarkand Oasis: A geoarchaeological studyRadiocarbon,  2012The oasis of Samarkand in the Middle Zeravshan Valley (modern Uzbekistan) was a major political a... more The oasis of Samarkand in the Middle Zeravshan Valley (modern Uzbekistan) was a major political and economic center in ancient western Central Asia. The chronology of its irrigation system was, until now, only constrained by the quality and quantity of archaeological findings and several different hypotheses have been proposed for it. We use a new approach combining archaeological surveying, radiocarbon dating, sedimentary analysis, and the numerical modeling of a flood event to offer new evidence for, and quantitative dating of, the development of irrigation system on the southern flank of the Middle Zeravshan Valley. We analyzed 13 bones and charcoals from 3 archaeological sites and obtained new 14 C ages from Afrasiab (ancient Samarkand), a dwelling damaged by flooding in the 2nd century AD (site code: SAM-174) and the fortress of Kafir Kala. We established the origin of sedimentary deposits at the sites to infer the presence of the 2 most important canals of the southern flank: the Dargom and the Yanghiaryk. Finally, we show with a numerical model of overland flow that a natural flood was unlikely to have produced the damage observed at SAM-174. The combined results of the study indicate that the canals south of Samarkand existed, and were mainly developed, in the 2nd century AD and were not connected to the main feeding canal of Afrasiab at that time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Change and Continuity in the Samarkand Oasis: Evidence for the Islamic Conquest from the Citadel of Kafir Kalaby Simone Mantellini and Serena di CugnoJournal of Inner Asian Art and Archaeology,  2016The archaeological complex of Kafir Kala is one of the largest and most important sites in the Sa... more The archaeological complex of Kafir Kala is one of the largest and most important sites in the Samarkand Oasis. After some preliminary works in the last century, the site has been the object of systematic investigation by the Italo-Uzbek Archaeological Expedition since 2001. The extraordinary discovery of 500 clay sealings is witness to the major role played by Kafir Kala in the rich trade along the “Silk Road.” Evidence of the Pre-Islamic occupation is dated to the end of the seventh – beginning of the eighth centuries ce, when a fire caused the upper citadel to be suddenly abandoned. Soon after this event the citadel was resettled for a few more centuries. Although the area around Samarkand is very rich in archaeological and historical sites, Kafir Kala represents a unique case study for understanding the changes connected to the Arab conquest of the early eighth century. The main goal of this article is to show how the transition related to the Arab conquest of Samarkand is evidenced by the archaeological record, through analysis of the stratigraphic sequences, reuse and transformation of architecture, and the changes and continuity in daily life and material culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Evaluating the human impact on the archaeological landscape of Samarkand (Uzbekistan): A diachronic assessment of the Taylak district by remote sensing, field survey, and local knowledgeArchaeological Research in Asia,  2019The territory of Samarkand (Uzbekistan) represents an excellent case study for understanding the ... more The territory of Samarkand (Uzbekistan) represents an excellent case study for understanding the damage in- flicted on the archaeological heritage of the region. The hinterland of Samarkand became one of the largest urban areas of Central Asia through a number of transformations to its landscape since the 1950s, changes that continue today and have seriously compromised the integrity of the remaining archaeological record. Here we infer the temporal sequence of this destruction through a multi-proxy approach based on the collection of spatial datasets from different periods, field surveys, and interviews with local farmers in the Taylak district. The present research also made it possible to ascertain whether the loss of archaeological information was more likely to be a consequence of either agricultural expansion or urban development.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Numismatic finds from Kafir Kala as evidence of the Islamic transition in Samarkand5th Simone Assemani Symposium on Islamic coins.

The overall number of coins discovered at Kafir Kala amounts to 178. The major part of them came from the citadel. Beside many Sogdian copper coins of the 7th and first half of the 8th century, the most important discovery was an Abbasid dīnār and a hoard of 132 dirhams. The coins are described in their stratigraphic context. Kafir Kala represents a very important case-study for the comprehension of the changes in the monetary circulation in Sogdiana at the beginning of the Islamic expansion in Central Asia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Landscape Archaeology and Irrigation Systems in Central Asia: A View from Samarkand (Uzbekistan)Urbanized Landscapes in Early Syro-Mesopotamia and Prehispanic Mesoamerica Papers of a Cross-Cultural Seminar held in Honor of Robert McCormick Adams.

Unlike the Near East and Mesopotamia, which have both a long experience in landscape archaeology, in Central Asia this approach is still limited. Only recently,new cooperation programs between local institutions and international teams, as well as improved methods and technologies in recording and analyzing spatial data, have allowed for new season of research in this area of the ancient world. Data from the Samarkand oasis (Uzbekistan) have been already used, though preliminarily, to reconstruct the historical interactions between man and the environment in this region. The main goal of this paper is to rather use the case of Samarkand to introduce some problems connected to the identification and dating of multilayered anthropic mounds (tepa) and abandoned irrigation canals. After a brief comparison between the landscape archaeology tradition in Central Asia, Mesopotamia and the Near East, methods and results from the Uzbek-Italian Archaeological Expedition in Samarkand are presented. Finally, the main markers used in chronological attribution will beconsidered in an attempt to provide some insights on both the benefits and limits of such a methodological approach.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A regional approach, based on a GIS remote sensing assessment followed by field validation, was used here to reconstruct the urban evolution of Samarkand in connection with its hinterland. The basic archaeological features in the landscape (anthropic mounds, canals and burials) allowed us to reconstruct the main forms of land use and resource exploitation according to site distribution and chronology. If Samarkand was established as early as the Achaemenid period (late 6th century BCE), the evidence dated to that time from its hinterland is scarce. A first significant increase occurred during the post-Hellenistic centuries (3rd-1st centuries BCE), and reached the peak at the time of the most intense trade along the Silk Road just before the major changes following the Arab conquest of the early 8th century CE. Data also demonstrated how the development of Samarkand must be closely linked with a proper exploitation of its territory. A massive and complex irrigation system in the floodplain ensured the supply of water necessary to develop extensive farming and daily-life activities, while rain-fed foothills were used as pastures.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Excavation at the Bronze Age tower of al-Khutm (Bāt, Sultanate of Oman): a preliminary evaluation of the monumentby Giacomo Vinci, Maurizio Cattani, Simone Mantellini, and Alessandro ArmigliatoTogether with other towers of Bāt and tombs of al-ΚAyn (al-Нāhirah region), the tower of al-Khutm... more Together with other towers of Bāt and tombs of al-ΚAyn (al-Нāhirah region), the tower of al-Khutm is one of the monuments inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage list of the Sultanate of Oman. A recent programme of investigations, led by the Ministry of Heritage and Culture of Oman and carried out by an Italian team, began in October 2015 and continued until June 2016 with the aim of completely uncovering the monument and enhancing its value. In this paper, we present the results of the excavations that allowed us to expose the overall plan of the tower and to detect the main features of the interior. The investigation revealed several additional structures nearby, connected with the use of the tower and belonging to several phases of occupation of the site. Among the most interesting results are the reasonable preservation of the outside wall; the presence of inner rooms with entrances and thresholds that are usually not preserved in other similar monuments; a possible pathway to enter the tower; and several other finds, including archaeobotanical remains of charred stone dates, cereals, and fruits. Some final remarks about the 3-D documentation carried out on a daily basis during the excavation will be presented for a discussion about the evolving methods of archaeological excavations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Climate and environmental features make the island inhospitable for human life. Since the earliest Punic occupation, the inhabitants solved the problem of water supply with cisterns. This article deals with the methods used and the results obtained from an extensive survey carried out across the island within the frame of the Archaeological Map of Pantelleria Island Project. After a short introduction to the research context, the paper focuses on the method used during the field survey with particular attention to the problems connected to the identification of underground cisterns in relation to their preservation. Cisterns are used as marker of ancient settlements and they, combined with other archaeological data available from Pantelleria (surveys and excavations at the Acropolis, Scauri Scalo and Lago di Venere) made possible the reconstruction of the major historical settlements of the island.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this context, the island of Pantelleria, where surface freshwater is virtually non-existent, represents a unique case for understanding human–environment interaction in waterless environments. Here, in historical times, year-round water supply was only possible through the storage of rainwater in underground cisterns. An intensive field survey carried out across the island led to the discovery of hundreds of cisterns dated from the Punic and Roman periods to the present day. The study of the spatial distribution of the cisterns was compared with archaeological data on the island to gain new insights on historical settlement and demographic patterns. The present work focusses on a semi-quantitative assessment of water storage on the island of Pantelleria based on the evaluation of potential volumes of stored water for different periods. Data available for cisterns in Pantelleria have been analysed and compared with those from coeval Mediterranean regions. Calculations on the seasonal fluctuation between water demand and supply have been estimated to evaluate the efficiency of such system for sustaining human population and subsistence activities through time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This was particularly true in the arid environments of the Near East and Central Asia. In the last decades, human-water interconnection has been analyzed in various ways. The analysis and reconstruction of ancient irrigation systems were essential steps in researching settlement development in regions where rain-fed agriculture was insufficient for basic subsistence. Although Wittfogel's theory on the political centralization of water management has been largely dismissed today, he fostered substantial research into the relationship between irrigation systems and social complexity. Since the 1990s advances in field data recording techniques, remote sensing, aerial photography and drones have all contributed to a significant development in studying the archaeological landscapes of the Near East and Central Asia. This multidisciplinary approach  signed  a  new  perspective  in  this  field  of  study  and  made  it  possible  to  grasp  the landscape in a digital form.This session aims to better explore and expand our current knowledge about the different aspects related to water in dry-lands of Near East and Central Asia. We welcome papers that relate to water  management  and  different  methodological  and  theoretical  approaches  for  both regions. The  session  may  include  (but  not  limited  to)  hydrogeoarchaeology;  agent-based  model  for irrigation system; irrigation as a proxy in evaluating the multi-temporal environmental evolution; remote  sensing; marshland  environments;  water  as  path-deterministic  agent;  social  complexity; human niches construction; ethnoarchaeology and heritage study that takes into account all the aspects of the human-water relation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
