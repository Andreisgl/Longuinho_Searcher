Artivismo_Teatro_TecnologiaSince the 2009 launch of NT Live, the National Theatre has been at the forefront of UK livecasting so the calls to respond to the complete lockdown of the UK in March 2020 weren’t surprising. This paper will analyse how this pandemic response utilised the multiple temporalities of NT Live to create a theatrical event in viewers’ homes. Despite using past recordings, the NT At Home programme was a response to a specific historical event and was structured around an “ontological now” that in return shaped the reception of those recordings. NT Live capitalised on the liveness and the exclusivity of their broadcasts. Performances were shown at a set time, streamed simultaneously into cinemas. NT At Home challenged every part of this system of liveness and in doing so created its own contradictory and fluid temporal identity. In this paper I will draw on liveness studies from multiple disciplines to cover three aspects of these new temporalities and present a case study of liveness prac...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersDigital theatricality: flickering documents in unsteady archivesLindsay Brandon HunterAs much as the ephemera associated with theatrical performance may contend with impermanence, for theatre, the primary "problem" attending documentation, archival practice, and analysis has been the seemingly necessary impermanence of theatrical performance itself. In particular, the use of media technologies to re-present theatrical performances in other places and times contends rather explicitly with an ephemerality still largely considered fundamental to theatre's ontology. Using the 1964 Electronovision recording of Richard Burton’s Hamlet and contemporary cinema broadcasts of theatre like NT Live as examples, this essay argues for understanding the mediatization of theatre not as an ontological rupture, but as a transposition of theatre’s patterns and data into digital forms.Download Free PDFView PDFConnessioni remote. Artivismo_Teatro_TecnologiaGradienti di liveness. Lo shaping socio-tecnico delle arti performative tra online e offline. IntroduzioneLaura GeminiIl presente articolo introduce il terzo numero della rivista dal titolo Gradienti di liveness. Lo shaping socio-tecnico delle arti performative tra online e offline. Dopo aver inquadrato il tema della liveness all’interno del processo di mediatizzazione del sociale e delle sfide alimentate dalla pandemia, viene discusso lo statuto del campo di studi sulla liveness. Si difende quindi e la necessità di uno sguardo che intende la liveness nei termini di “gradienti” con cui tale fenomeno si manifesta. Nella seconda parte vengono presentati i contenuti del numero, i quali mostrano le molteplici diramazioni della questione liveness attraverso ambiti spettacolari, tecnologici e teorici eterogenei, evidenziando la rilevanza di questo strumento d’indagine nel comprendere la costruzione del senso della presenza e della connessione nel contesto della mediatizzazione.Download Free PDFView PDFEmancipating the Spectator? Livecasting, Liveness, and the Feeling I2019 • Heidi  LiedkeRecently, the Metropolitan Opera, the National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company have produced livecasts of their shows that are shown in cinemas worldwide. What impact do livecasting technologies have on the experience of their spectators? Are they manifestations of the Rancierian epoch or do they bring about a new kind of emotional turn? And how do they influence the perceived liveness of the performances? This article investigates these questions by drawing on concepts from adaptation studies, performance philosophy and audience studies. I argue that, on the one hand, livecasting opens up new possibilities of audience participation and fosters a multimodal engagement with the “translated” sources. Livecasts allow their audiences (the feeling of) a key role in determining their shape, and theatres reach out to audiences to engage with their shows on social media. On the other hand, this new paradigm of spectatorship, with its emphasis on “first-person experiences,” may co...Download Free PDFView PDFUniversity of RoehamptonEncountering Shakespeare elsewhere : digital distribution, audience reception, and the changing value of Shakespeare in performance2020 • Rachael NicholasDownload Free PDFView PDFTheatre Research InternationalEditorial: Presence and Precarity in (Post-)Pandemic Theatre and PerformanceMonika Pietrzak-FrangerDownload Free PDFView PDFDocumenting the Visual ArtsWhen Art Exhibition Met Cinema Exhibition:: Live documentary and the remediation of the museum experience2020 • Annabelle Honess RoeThis chapter explores the short-lived phenomenon of the live broadcast of museum exhibitions into cinemas between 2011 and 2014, including Leonardo Live (2011) from London’s National Gallery, Pompeii Live (2013) and Vikings Live (2014) from the British Museum, and Matisse Live (2014) from the Tate Modern. These incongruous broadcasts, part arts documentary, part promotional material for their respective museums and exhibitions, appeared at the peak of the rapid growth of event cinema that took place at this time. However, unlike theater and other live performance, museum exhibitions and cinema exhibition are two distinct very distinct “media,” visually, temporally, and spatially. This chapter argues that this intermedial incompatibility is evidenced in the broadcasts’ use of cinematography and liveness and they are also a response to questions surrounding curatorial intent in museum exhibitions.Download Free PDFView PDFThe British monarchy on screenThe Queen on the big screen(s): outdoor screens and public congregations2016 • Ruth AdamsDownload Free PDFView PDFThe British monarchy on screenThe Queen on the big screen(s)2016 • Ruth AdamsDownload Free PDFView PDF‘You sure that’s a film, man?’: Audience anticipation, expectation and engagement in Lost in London LIVE2017 • Sarah  AtkinsonLost in London LIVE (Dir. Woody Harrelson, 2017) claimed to be ‘a first-of-its-kind film event.’ Shot in one take, in real time, with one camera, entirely on location in London in the early hours of Friday 20 January 2017, it was simultaneously broadcast live to 604 cinemas in America (and to one cinema in the UK). As a stand-alone experience, with a short lead-in, temporally and spatially bound, this event presented a unique opportunity in audience studies research. This article presents and consolidates the findings of three branches of methodological enquiry into Lost in London. These include the authors’ own observations at the screening in London, retrospective audience questionnaires, and analysis of the social media activity before, during and after the screening. A number of themes emerged which I have identified as: Liveness, Novelty, Proximity, Definitional and Audience Expectations. As well as revealing the new ways in which live cinema formats impact upon audience motiva...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Popular Culture Studies JournalWatch, Go, Now: "TV Everywhere" and the Promotion of Liveness2019 • Carter MoultonDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
