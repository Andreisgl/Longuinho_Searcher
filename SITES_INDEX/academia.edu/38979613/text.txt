It relates not only to much of the existing work in evolutionary and institutional economics, but also to work in cultural science and cultural semiotics domains as well as in media convergence and transmedia studies. The central concept it first deploys is ‘innovation systems’ as applied in national, regional, international and sectoral contexts. It then builds on the general theory of economic evolution by Kurt Dopfer and Jason Potts and reviews the tools this theory provides to carry out a meso-level analysis of industries co-innovating and converging. It then proposes a new concept  ‘cross-innovation’  to refer to the emergence of new structures and ‘rules’ at the boundaries of existing industries.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEmergence of Cross-innovation Systems: Audiovisual Industries Co-innovating with Education, Health Care and Tourism2019 • Indrek IbrusThis book combines economic studies of innovation systems with studies of mediatisation, media convergence, trans- and cross-media and with other approaches within media and culture studies. It elaborates on a new concept, cross-innovation, referring to co-innovation and convergence processes taking place between different sectors of digital service economies. The proposition is that digitisation and mediatisation processes are conditioning new inter-sector dialogues and the emergence of new cross-innovation systems at the borderlines of formerly distinct industries. The case study industries presented are, on the one hand, audiovisual media (film, television, videogames, etc.) and health care, education or tourism, on the other hand. The book builds on 2 years of empirical work across Nordic and Baltic countries, putting a special emphasis on the opportunities and challenges for small countries as they build the cross-innovation systems in the era of media globalisation and platformisation of services. The empirical research of 144 interviews with stakeholders (policy makers, entrepreneurs, managers, professionals) from all four sectors and of secondary data and documentary analysis. The findings tell of complex stories how global platformisation of tourism undermines the emergence of related cross-innovation systems in small countries; how fragmentation of local education and health care markets does not enable the scalability of innovations, but protects local innovation systems for being overtaken by global platform giants. The book has stories of successful facilitation of cross-innovation as well as failures to do so.Download Free PDFView PDFEmergence of Cross-innovation SystemsCross-innovation, Is It a Thing?2019 • Indrek IbrusThis chapter concludes the book on cross-innovation between audiovisual media industries and three other sectors  education, health care and tourism. It emphasises, first, the importance of platformisation as a socioeconomic and technological process in framing all cross-innovation processes. It highlights how the rather full platformisation of tourism has negatively affected the interest of the tourism industry small and mediumsized enterprises to cooperate with local media and gaming industries in search of new solutions. Relatedly it proposes a generic conflict between platformisation of specific fields and the health of thematic local crossinnovation systems involving media and creative sectors. It then discusses that the inherent fragmentation of the health and education sectors has not allowed their international platformisation, but constitutes challenges to innovators interested in international scalability. It also discusses the reasons why two publicly coordinated cross-innovation processes one involving the use of virtual reality in health care and another using augmented reality  have given different results  one a relative success and the other not as of yet. At the end of the chapter final definitions of crossinnovation are offered and the operationalisation of the term and the associated conceptual approach are assessed.Download Free PDFView PDFEmergence of Cross-innovation SystemsConclusions: Cross-innovations between Audiovisual and Tourism Sectors2019 • Indrek IbrusThis chapter summarises all the results of the section that studied crossinnovation processes between audiovisual media and tourism sectors. It relies first on the review of existing forms of cooperation and cross-innovation between sectors. Second, on the meso-level analysis of structural aspects that shape innovation processes in these sectors. Third, on a micro-level ethnography of a start-up company innovating at the intersections between the film and tourism industries. We learn that there are two core ‘rules’ that motivate sectoral cooperation  first, the broader platformisation of tourism and second, the emergence of augmented reality as a technique to augment experiences at locations. Regarding the second rule especially, we learned that the main innovator and innovation motivator in this area is currently the public sector, driven also by cultural policy goals. But local tourism sector small and medium-sized enterprises appear to not be particularly driven by innovation-orientated cooperation with other sectors.Download Free PDFView PDFEmergence of Cross-innovation SystemsConclusions: Cross-innovations between Audiovisual and Health Sectors2019 • Indrek Ibrus, Külliki Tafel-ViiaThis chapter concludes the section on cross-innovation practices between audiovisual (AV) media industries and the health care sector. It suggests that the main case studies discussed in this section  Estonia in general and Aarhus Region in Denmark  tell of two different trajectories on how the emergence of cross-innovation systems can be facilitated by policies. Local policymakers in Aarhus have worked systematically to raise awareness and facilitate contacts between AV media and other sectors and this has resulted in an active start-up scene at the intersection between the media and the health care industries. Estonia, which is focusing on traditional cultural policymaking, has not recognised similar dynamics. Yet, Estonia may be still better prepared for the (global) platformisation of e-health services with its national e-governance systems, while Denmark’s health-related e-services remain fragmented and ripe for platformisation by multinationals, potentially undermining local cross-innovation systems.Download Free PDFView PDFEmergence of Cross-innovation SystemsThe Study, Its Design and Its Social Pre-conditions2019 • Indrek IbrusThis chapter presents the many premises of this book. It first discusses the book’s central questions and lays out the design of the large multi-national and multi-method study, carried out across Northern Europe. It also places the book at the interdisciplinary space between contemporary innovation economics and cultural and social theory. It then discusses the complex set of social processes that have conditioned the phenomena that the book studies  how and why are the contemporary audiovisual media industries co-innovating and converging with other sectors including education, tourism and health care? Within this framework, it discusses the effects of the broader individualisation and mediatisation processes, of media con- vergence, of the emergence of cross-media or transmedia strategies, of the evolution of the service and experience economies and of the emergence of creative industries policy frameworks.Download Free PDFView PDFEmergence of Cross-innovation SystemsSmall Size Matters: Audiovisual Media Industries around the Baltic Sea2019 • Indrek IbrusThe chapter discusses the characteristics of audiovisual (AV) media sectors in the Baltic Sea region. Therein it focuses on the specifics of media indus- tries in small countries in the region as they are challenged in ways notably different from large countries with large domestic markets for media con- tent. It discusses the differences between the AV media industries in the Nordic and Baltic countries and suggests that while in the first case long- term welfare society policies and conscious policy-driven system building have conditioned growth and international success then also in the second case innovation policy rationales have facilitated recent growth and dynam- ics. It then discusses the specific challenges, especially platformisation to small media industries in contemporary globalising media markets, and suggests that opportunities to resist these challenges may be in local inter- sectoral cooperation, that is, in building cross-innovation systems.Download Free PDFView PDFIndustry & InnovationConsumer Co‐creation and Situated Creativity2008 • Stuart CunninghamDownload Free PDFView PDFEmergence of Cross-innovation SystemsEducation on Screens: Histories of Co-innovation and Convergence between Audiovisual Media and Education Sectors2019 • Indrek Ibrus, Mikhail FiadotauThis chapter introduces the topic of cooperation and co-innovation between the audiovisual media and education sectors. It first discusses the emergence of educational film approximately a hundred years go  together with a new institutional framework, industry media, rulebooks, etc. It then discusses the ways public service media have addressed educa- tional programming over the decades, including developing complex cross- media strategies and educational content databases more recently. The second half of the chapter is dedicated to the emergence of educational digital games, with their own institutional setups, production cultures, and training programmes. The chapter points, however, to a relative lack of cooperation between commercial game producers and educational institu- tions to date.Download Free PDFView PDFClick for updates How the Social Economy Produces Innovationjason potts, John HartleySocial economics has long been concerned with the effects on human societies of market-coordinated processes of economic innovation. But the social economy also causes invention and innovation, an aspect that has received less attention. This article reviews three new approaches to the study of the growth of knowledge in economic systems as driven expressly by sociocultural mechanisms and dynamics. The first are so-called “social network markets” and “novelty bundling markets”. The second extends from “knowledge commons” to “innovation commons”. The third is a sociocultural semiotic process of group dynamics. These models represent different ways the social economy generates newness and produces innovation.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Cultural StudiesSearching for public value in innovation coordination: How the Eurovision Song Contest was used to innovate the public service media model in Estonia2018 • Indrek Ibrus, Ulrike RohnThis article addresses the 'wicked' problems met by contemporary public service media institutions: to address the fragmentation of audiences across platforms; to have a positive impact on civil society and societal coherence; to facilitate cultural diversity; and to work with private creative industries and facilitate their growth. These objectives can be reduced to a conflict in producing both public and private value. In this article, we build on the combination of innovation systems theory and public value theory to investigate the interrelationships between the production of these different forms of value. Our case study is Estonia's national pre-selection competition for the Eurovision Song Contest, which is innovative in terms of its cross-media framing and its approach to working with private partners to facilitate the development of the Estonian popular music system. Value creation as a contemporary 'wicked' problem for PSM Much in Western thought starts with Aristotle. If we study how media generate value and what this 'value' is like, we could start again with Aristotle and his distinction between 'use value' and 'exchange value' (laid out in Politics). While later theorists updated the analysis of value generation with the evolution of market capitalism, this basic original distinction may have value of its own for distinguishing the functions of public and private media. Public service is aimed at generating 'use value' for a variety of societal agents. In contrast, private enterprises that operate in markets aim at generating exchange value for the commodities they produce. These concepts are not mutually exclusive: media markets and information goods are classically characterised by complex ways in which surplus value (Marx, 1951) is generated out of the publically available use value or 'symbolic value' (Bolin, 2011) by private media industries. Yet, the challenge of network era media markets is the further blurring of boundaries between the generation of 'public value' (see further articulations below) and ways to obtain private assets ('private value'). The operations of contemporary 'value networks' (Bovet and Martha, 2000) of media markets are complicated by some activities conducted in these networks being effectively non-market activities, such as fan labour where participants contribute work without motivation to turn the results into exchange value (e.g. Von Hippel, 2005). This relates to the observation by Hardt and Negri (2004) that value is increasingly created in collaborativeDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
