Moreover, it shows that the symbolism of these birds helps explain the seasonal patterns of ancient Mesopotamian life.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Metaphor and Meaning in Psalm 23: Provisions for “a Table in the Presence of my Enemies” (2020)Psalm 23 is a short, if much-discussed poem that is as vivid as it is well-known. It is packed with complex figurative language, yet the poem’s familiarity can make it difficult to read without predetermination regarding its meaning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It also briefly reflects on the larger issue of persuasion and its relationship to authority during the period documented by the archives from Mari.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It begins by overviewing Mesopotamian practices for enlivening and animating weapons and thereafter treats similar vocabulary and imagery that are used in Ezek 21:33–34a to describe a quasi-hypostatized sword. Particular attention is paid to the presentation of the sword as »opened« (פתוחה) ) and as affected by »visions« ( חזות ) and »divination« ( קסם ).It is argued that these descriptions constitute instances of polysemy that conveyed the idea that the weapon had been readied and brandished for battle and, at the same time, evoked a ritual practice that allegedly empowered weapons for combat through divination.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Review of Niek Veldhuis, History of the Cuneiform Mesopotamian Lexical Tradition. Guides to the Mesopotamian Textual Records, Volume 6 (Ugarit Verlag, Münster: 2014).  Review of Biblical Literature 2019: 03/41Niek Veldhuis’ History of the Cuneiform Mesopotamian Lexical Tradition is the sixth volume in the... more Niek Veldhuis’ History of the Cuneiform Mesopotamian Lexical Tradition is the sixth volume in the series “Guides to the Mesopotamian Textual Records.”  In keeping with the series as a whole, the volume under review is an expert presentation of the sources it treats.  Veldhuis ably introduces the particulars of Mesopotamian lexicographic traditions in a user-friendly form and lucidly demonstrates what these traditions teach us about the cultures that produced these scholarly texts.  The Mesopotamia lexical traditions are not widely read and studied, even among many cuneiformists, and so this volume is a welcome contribution for those interested in this important topic.  At the same time, the volume is comprehensible to more than specialists in cuneiform studies and would be worth the effort for others whose research might intersect with the intellectual traditions from the first half of civilization.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
