Perforation-mediated modified atmosphere packaging (PM-MAP) for sweetcorn utilizing impermeable containers with a diffusion window was designed to establish 15, 20 or 25% CO₂ atmospheres at 1 and 10⁰C. The desired CO₂ concentrations were obtained at 1⁰C, but were about 3-5% lower than expected at 10 degreeC. It took about 5 days to reach the equilibrium atmospheres at 1⁰C, and about 2 days at 10⁰C. Sweetcorn cobs in CA tolerated 2% O₂ and up to 25% CO₂ alone for 2 weeks at 5⁰C, but elevated respiration suggested that they may be damaged by the two gas levels in combination, although no significant ethanol or acetaldehyde production was detected in any CA or PM-MAP treatment. The best atmosphere composition test...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLwt - Food Science and TechnologyOptimum controlled atmospheres minimise respiration rate and quality losses while increase phenolic compounds of baby carrots2011 • adriano simoesDownload Free PDFView PDFFactors Affecting Sensory Quality of Fresh-Cut ProduceJohn C BeaulieuDownload Free PDFView PDFFresh-cut Fruits. In: The Commercial Storage of Fruits, Vegetables, and Florist and Nursery Stocks. USDA, ARS, Agriculture Handbook 66John C BeaulieuFresh-cut fruit products for both retail and food service applications have increasingly appeared in the market place recently. In the coming years, it is commonly perceived that the fresh-cut fruit industry will have unprecedented growth. For this reason, many leading fresh-cut salad manufacturers have targeted development of fresh-cut fruit products as part of their long-term business plans. However, processors of fresh-cut fruit products will face numerous challenges not commonly encountered during fresh-cut vegetable processing. The difficulties encountered with fresh-cut fruit, while not insurmountable, require a new and higher level of technical and operational sophistication.Download Free PDFView PDFEffect of Minimal Processing on Physiology and Quality of Fresh-Cut Potatoes: a ReviewGlobal Science BooksFresh-cut fruit and vegetable are minimally processed products that have to maintain their quality (appearance, texture, flavour and nutritive value) similar to those of the fresh product. The fundamental principle underlying the quality of these commodities is that they are metabolic active tissues and, as a consequence, show physiological response to preparation procedures as well as to the environment created in the package in which they are enclosed. Minimal processing for fresh-cut potato production includes raw material selection, washing, peeling and cutting, pre-treatments, drying, weighing and packaging. The purpose of this review is to analyse the effects of the different minimal processing steps on the physiology and related quality of fresh-cut potatoes. Particular attention is given to the newest studies on processing innovation and innovative scientific approaches for a better understanding of fresh-cut products as biological systems. In this direction the use of ozone sanitization, natural dipping pre-treatments and/or coatings (e.g. edible film enriched in ascorbic and citric acid), and modified atmosphere packaging at high O 2 levels result the most promising and non-invasive techniques for the preservation of fresh-cut potatoes. As far as physiological studies of the product are concerned, fundamental metabolic research for process optimisation and quality assurance is needed. For this aim isothermal calorimetry may provide a versatile tool to conduct fundamental metabolic studies of the effect of different processing steps on the quality and shelf-life of fresh-cut potatoes.Download Free PDFView PDFHurdle Technology for Shelf Stable Minimally Processed Potato cv. Agria aChristian NugrohoChemical treatments in combination with modified atmosphere packaging and cold storage was employed as hurdles for control of microorganisms and extending shelf life of minimally processed potatoes in this study. Washed and hand-peeled potatoes were treated with NaCl (1%) + Na-metabisulphite (1500 ppm), chlorinated (150 ppm, pH: 6.8, 5 min) and rinsed with water. They were divided into two lots and subjected to the following treatments: dip in solutions containing 1.5% citric acid and 0.5% L-cysteine + 1% citric acid. The samples were packaged at two different gas combinations and stored at 4 to 6 ºC for 14 days. The weight loss of samples packaged under N 2 was lower than the samples packaged under N 2 and CO 2. Also L-cysteine was more effective than citric acid for limiting weight loss by repressing metabolic activity. L-cysteine treatment with packaging under N 2 and CO 2 atmosphere had positive effects for protecting overall quality. Browning inhibited up to two weeks with the help of chemical inhibitors. Rapid increase of total coliform bacteria count after 8 th day (especially in control samples) made inconsumable of these samples. However, citric acid treatment prolonged the shelf life up to two weeks. As sensorial, L-cysteine treated samples were rejected in terms of odour, but preferred in terms of colour and appearence.Download Free PDFView PDFsoft drinks and fruit juicesAvni KrasniqiDownload Free PDFView PDFPostharvest Biology and TechnologyModified atmosphere preservation of freshly prepared diced yellow onion1996 • Francois  Castaigne, Joseph MakhloufDownload Free PDFView PDFHandbook of Food Preservationdian  putriDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Scientific  …Advances in minimal processing of fruits and vegetables: a review2011 • Mohammed Wasim  SiddiquiDownload Free PDFView PDFModified Atmosphere Packaging of Pomegranate Fruit and Arils: A ReviewDipu KumarOngoing global drive for a healthier diet has led to a rise in demand for convenient and fresh food produce, with high nutritional value and free of additives. Minimally fresh processed fruits and vegetables, satisfies the consumers' perception of a high nutritional quality and convenience produce. Minimally processed fruit and vegetables are susceptible to increased deterioration in quality and microbial infestation due to increase in endogenous enzymatic processes and respiration rate. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) technology offers the possibility to retard produce respiration rate and extend the shelf life of fresh produce. However, it is important to correlate the permeability properties of the packing films with the respiration rate of the produce, in order to avoid anaerobic conditions which could lead into fermentation of produce and accumulation of ethanol. Hence, mathematical prediction modelling is now widely applied in the design and development of effective MAP technology in both whole and minimally processed fresh produce. With increasing global interest in postharvest handling and nutrition value of pomegranate, MAP of minimally processed pomegranate arils offers additional innovative tool for optimal use and value addition, including the utilization of lower-grade fruit with superficial peel defects such as; cracks, splits, and sunburnt. This review paper highlights the current status and applications of modified atmosphere packaging in whole fruit and minimally processed pomegranate arils and identifies future prospects.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
