I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.20.4 and 1.19.5.
These releases fix 3 security related bugs that could affect users of
MediaWiki. Download links are given at the end of this email.
* An internal review discovered that specially crafted Lua function
names could lead to XSS.
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46084>
* Daniel Franke reported that during SVG parsing, MediaWiki failed to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) processing. This could lead to local
file disclosure, or potentially remote command execution in
environments that have enabled expect:// handling.
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46859>
* Internal review also discovered that Special:Import, and
Extension:RSS failed to prevent XML external entity (XXE) processing.
