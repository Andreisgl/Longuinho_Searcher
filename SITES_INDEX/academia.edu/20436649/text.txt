Global demand for gas has risen steadily over the last decade and forecast demand growth now outstrips all other major energy sources. These two factors should dictate that gas will remain the energy source of choice until renewable alternative energy sources become readily and economically available.The UK is set to face a shortage of proven indigenous gas reserves. However, the known conventional global resources of natural gas are very significant, with reserves projected to last for 60 years at current production levels, and expected un-discovered resources predicted to exceed this figure. In addition, huge volumes of ‘unconventional’ gas resources are trapped in hydrates on the seafloor, in coal beds, in low-permeability sandstone reservoirs (so-called ‘tight gas sands’) or in shale deposits. Whilst the global resource base i...Download Free PDFView PDFAnnals of the New York Academy of SciencesWelcoming Address to the International Conference on Natural Gas Hydrates1994 • Howard MeyerDownload Free PDFView PDFNature and Importance of Technology Progress for Unconventional Gas2007 • George KopernaIntroduction. At the core of every successful unconventional gas play are two common themes - - the continuous search for improvements in technology and the relentless pursuit of cost and operating efficiencies. It is these two themes that have transformed these previously overlooked uneconomic resources - - tight gas sands, coalbed methane and gas shales - - into today’s largest single source of domestic natural gas production. The basic process, repeated over and over again, is that one or more new technology “concepts” lead to breakthroughs that transform the play from a technical curiosity to economic feasibility; subsequent cost and operating efficiencies then permit aggressive commercial development and the extension of the play to lessfavorable reservoir environments. This cycle of initial technology “breakthroughs” followed by aggressive cost reductions can be seen in the evolution of per-well recoveries for unconventional gas plays. At first, the per-well recoveries are rel...Download Free PDFView PDFApplied EnergyReview of natural gas hydrates as an energy resource: Prospects and challenges2015 • Praveen LingaDownload Free PDFView PDFCanadian Unconventional Resources ConferenceGlobal Unconventional Gas Resource Assessments2011 • Walter AyersMost estimates of the resource endowment (original gas in place) reported for world unconventional gas start with Rogner’s 1997 &quot;top-down&quot; study. That global estimate is most likely quite conservative, since the oil and gas industry has discovered enormous volumes of shale gas around the world since the 1990’s. The data from these new reservoirs add substantially to our understanding of the unconventional resource base. Furthermore, the uncertainty of Rogner’s assessment was not quantified. Thus, a new assessment of original unconventional gas in place worldwide with considering the uncertainty is needed. The objective of this project was to estimate the probabilistic distributions of original volumes of gas trapped in coalbed, tight sand and shale reservoirs, worldwide. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed published assessments of coal, conventional and unconventional resources and established the quantitative relationship between unconventional gas (coalbed methane,...Download Free PDFView PDFTHE FUTURE OF NATURAL GASAgata Łoskot-StrachotaDownload Free PDFView PDFCommercialization of Marginal Gas Fields1999 • Masami KojimaNatural gas reservoirs are plentiful around the world, but many of them currently seem too small, or too remote from sizable population centers, to be developed economically. Furthermore, gas associated with liquid hydrocarbons is often flared for the same reason. According to the United States Department of Energy, a total of 14.8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas was flared or reinjected worldwide in 1995, 4.4 tcf of this amount was in Africa, and 1.2 tcf in Latin America and the Caribbean. In western and southern Africa (excluding Nigeria), there are eight gas fields with reserves ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 tcf, another eight between 0.25 and 0.5 tcf, and over 85 fields with reserves of less than 0.25 tcf. A key challenge, and the subject of this Note, is identifying commercial processes that make marginal gas reservoirs viable. Apart from the economic advantages, such use of gas brings local and global environmental benefits.Download Free PDFView PDFStrategic Perspectives for Unconventional Gas in the EUHazar Strateji Enstitüsü  HASENDownload Free PDFView PDFCambridge Scholars Publishing (C.S.P.)Shale Gas: An Unconventional Gas Reservoir2014 • Nikhil JainDownload Free PDFView PDFTurkStream Overview & The Gas Age: Global Prospects Panel by  Cigdem Yorgancioglu  29 Dec 2017Cigdem  YorganciogluDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
