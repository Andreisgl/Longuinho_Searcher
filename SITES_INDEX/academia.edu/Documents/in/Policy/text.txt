How does the form of discursive environment, which sees immigration as a social epidemic, impact on an immigrant worker’s experience of their cultural (dis)localities and subjectivity? In this article, I draw on my personal, psychoanalytically informed voice to explore these questions, by foregrounding the materiality of the hosting environment as the place in which the present relational matrix takes place, in which the internal dynamics of object relations are lived in the present sense, and the idiosyncratic expression of selfhood assumes forms.The materialised reality of the place matters not least because it is drenched in power relations but also as it is where an immigrant worker seeks to live. The hostile host, in this sense, sees immigrants not simply as its guests (Derrida and Dufourmantelle, 2000), but as unwelcome yet persistent guests to be yoked to their place of otherness and inferiority. ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Nini Fang•  3  Psychology, Policy, Psychosocial StudiesChildren’s online reports about educational and informationalSave to LibraryDownloadby Jennifer Kotler•  5  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Policy, Applied Developmental PsychologyNew drugs, new directions?

A major issue is the inequitable distribution of research efforts and funds directed towards populations suffering the world&#39;s greatest health problems. This imbalance is fostering major attempts at redirecting research to the health problems of low and middle income countries. Following the creation of the Coalition for Global Health Research - Canada (CGHRC) in 2001, the Canadian Society for International Health (CSIH) decided to review the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in global health research. This paper highlights some of the prevalent thinking and is intended to encourage new thinking on how NGOs can further this role. APPROACH: This paper was prepared by members of the Research Committee of the CSIH, with input from other members of the Society.

The distribution of Universal Basic Telecommunications and Social Services will minimize the gap in communication and technology access which will improve the quality of life of the people in remote areas and bring about the equality and fairness in standard of living for all citizens both in the city and the remote areas. This will finally affects the national competitiveness level. In The goal is to promote and improve knowledge and skill which will benefit to the public for the appropriated and efficient access to the basic telecommunications services. This paper aims to describe how the NBTC develop policy and strategy to achieve the objective of the NBTC's Notification Regarding Plan on Universal Basic Telecommunications Services and Social Services (B.E. 2555-2559) on research and development. The paper also demonstrates the organization structure and key management issues.Save to LibraryDownloadby IAEME Publication•  6  Telecommunications, Policy, Thailand, ResearchTowards systematic reviews that inform health care management and policy-makingSave to LibraryDownloadby Ewan Ferlie•  10  Research Design, Evidence Based Medicine, Policy, Health Care ManagementReconsidering the consequences of selective fisheriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Adriaan Rijnsdorp•  14  Fisheries, Biomass, Policy, Science‘Impact’ in the proposals for the UK's Research Excellence Framework: Shifting the boundaries of academic autonomySave to LibraryDownloadby Vicky Ward and +1Allan House•  6  Policy, Knowledge Translation, Research evaluation, Business and ManagementA paedophile scan to prevent child sexual abuse in child care?

This thought experiment problematizes this particular notion: ethically acceptable and societally desirable outcomes are not necessarily achieved when alignment is a consequence of early closure. To argue this point, we took the example of the potential development of scanning technology for the detection of paedophilia among job applicants, for which indicators of broad societal support were found in an RRI project on neuroimaging. We analysed this case by looking through several lenses, obtained by structured and non-structured literature searches. We explored how facts and values are masked when a taboo topic is considered. This results in the black boxing of the problem definition, potential solutions and development trajectories.

To improve diagnostic accuracy in adults with Down syndrome, the authors examined conditions often associated with dementia, as well as tests useful for documentation of decline. Specific aims were to identify psychiatric disorders or medical conditions that increased the odds of a dementia diagnosis; to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of widely used dementia scales; and to determine which tests, used singly or in combination, most accurately supported the presence of dementia. Participants were 78 adults with Down syndrome. Two methods based on a large test battery and one method based on clinical judgment were used to diagnose dementia. It was found that combinations of tests lead to increased levels of diagnostic sensitivity compared with single tests. When taken in combination with other investigations, our results suggest that assessment for psychiatric disorders, delayed memory decline, adaptive behavior decline, and the presence of seizures would be useful for the diagnosis of dementia and that dementia scales would provide additional useful information. The authors conclude that combinations of tests and scales will be most useful for diagnosing dementia in adults with intellectual disabilities. The authors suggest that further research is needed to promote rapid progress, with studies that focus on common diagnostic methodology, identification of screening instruments, and amounts of decline indicative of dementia.Save to LibraryDownloadby kays lewis•  8  Psychology, Psychiatry, Social Work, PolicyAssessing Material and Symbolic Variations in Punctuated Equilibrium and Public Policy Output PatternsSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Givel•  11  Social Policy, Policy, Tobacco, Forest PolicyInvention in the city: Increasing returns to patenting as a scaling function of metropolitan sizeSave to LibraryDownloadby Deborah A Strumsky•  6  Policy, Business and Management, United States, Power LawРОЛЯТА НА СЕКТОРНА ПРОГРАМА " ЛЕОНАРДО ДА ВИНЧИ " ЗА РАЗВИТИЕТО НА СИСТЕМАТА НА ПРОФЕСИОНАЛНОТО ОБРАЗОВАНИЕ И ОБУЧЕНИЕ В БЪЛГАРИЯ, 2007 – 2010 ГSave to LibraryDownloadby Dimitar Asenov and +1Димитър Асенов•  6  Education, Policy, Evaluation, TrainingHow much should society fuel the greed of innovators?Save to LibraryDownloadby Giovanni Dosi•  10  Policy, Intellectual Property Rights, Business and Management, ProfitabilityA taxonomy of multi-industry labour force skillsSave to LibraryDownloadby Davide Consoli•  2  Policy, Business and ManagementHigher growth through the Blue Ocean Strategy: Implications for economic policySave to LibraryDownloadby Mojca Bavdaž•  4  Policy, Economic policy, Business and Management, strategic directionTechnology and economic development: the dynamics of local, regional, and national changeSave to LibraryDownloadby Francisco Rosário•  10  Human Geography, Economics, Economic Geography, TechnologyNextLast »Related TopicsUniversity reformFollowFollowingSoutheast European EducationFollowFollowingForesightFollowFollowingKnowledge ExchangeFollowFollowingPolitical ActorFollowFollowingHigher EducationFollowFollowingBologna ProcessFollowFollowingSocioeconomicsFollowFollowingWestern BalkansFollowFollowingHigher Education StudiesFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
