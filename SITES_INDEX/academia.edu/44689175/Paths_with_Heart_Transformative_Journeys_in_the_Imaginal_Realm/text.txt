Through the lens of an extended epistemology, my inquiry challenges assumptions that critical-thinking and conceptual-rational knowing should be central to the process of perspective change. We experience, interpret, and know the world through the body, imagination and intellect, and yet the intellect is often privileged in the process of transformative learning. This inquiry seeks a more expansive understanding of the multiple ways in which perspective change might be achieved. It explores the notion that our affective and imaginal capabilities play a significant role in development because they are central to meaning-making. My inquiry investigates the proposal that specific creative methods and methodologies can be employed intentionally to facilitate self-knowing and insights that can lead to change. It explores development as a creative process and through creative processes. An empathic approach of ‘methodological believing’ is employed to explore the roles of multiple modes of presence and ways of knowing in developmental learning. Through my inquiry, we gain a more nuanced understanding about what it might mean to transform. My findings support the argument that critical self-reflection is not always necessary for transformative experience, and that symbolic and performative acts, when guided by intent, can result in the embodied integration of insights and realisations. However, often transformative experience marks the beginning of a much longer process of change, which cannot be guaranteed. The contributions of the inquiry include development of the concept of the rite-of-passage as a useful metaphor for the process of development. Experiences of transformative journeys are synthesised into a rite-of-passage process network that illustrates the interpersonal and intrapersonal processes of transformative learning in affective and imaginal modes of presence.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEuropean Journal of PhilosophyExpanding Transformative Experience2019 • Havi Carel, Ian James KiddWe develop a broader, more fine-grained taxonomy of forms of transformative experience, inspired by the work of L.A. Paul. Our vulnerability to such experiences arises, we argue, due to the vulnerability, dependence, and affliction intrinsic to the human condition. We use this trio to distinguish a variety of positively, negatively, and ambivalently valenced forms of epistemically and/or personally transformative experiences. Moreover, we argue that many transformative experiences can arise gradually and cumulatively, unfolding over the course of longer periods of time.Download Free PDFView PDFA Creative Approach to Learning from a Transformative ExperienceBeatrice C Ungard (Benne)The combined theoretical lenses of the two authors form the foundation for a workshop design on creative approaches to learning from a transformative experience. Perspectives on emergent creative process, living systems and complexity theories, post-Cartesian views of the human being, as well as the roles of community, play, trauma, and resilience are explored in their implications for designing transformative learning approaches.Download Free PDFView PDFPapastamatis, A., Panitsides, E. & Boutskou, E. (2014). Transformative learning: Towards a holistic approach. Interrogating transformative processes in learning and education. In D. Andritsakou & L. West, L. (Eds) What’s the point of Transformative Learning? Proceedings (pp. 351-358). Athens: ESREAEugenie PanitsidesThe present paper lays the foundations for an integrated theory of transformative learning. In the essence of transformative learning is found the assumption that a sudden or dramatic event, or even incremental with smaller transformation, may induce changes in individuals, in ways that both themselves and others can recognize. Adult education and learning are inherently intertwined with change, change in knowledge, understanding, attitudes, beliefs, skills and/or behaviors. It is grounded on constructivist - developmental theory, drawing on rationality and cognitive processes as a means of effective perspective transformation. Traditionally, theory and research in adult education have examined learning as a purely cognitive process, while influential transformative learning theories, have been proposed by Freire (1972), Kolb (1984), and more recently by Mezirow (1991). However, recent studies, such as by Clark (2005), Dirkx (2001), Dixon and Baltes (1996), Heshusious and Ballard (1996), Meyer (2012), Michelon ( 1998), and Mulvihill (2003), have shifted emphasis towards more holistic approaches, perceiving the individual as a whole, consisting of mind, body and spirit. More specifically, they assume that rational thinking is basically a Western concept, since researchers in the West tend to ignore the body, emotions, and spirit as valid learning agents, limiting thus learning to a cognitive process that takes place in the mind. In this regard, in the present study we argue that in order a holistic transformation to take place, it requires the involvement of the whole person, entailing mind, body and spirit. Through thorough review of relevant studies, the present paper seeks to point out that transformative theories of learning have traditionally over-relied on rational and cognitive processes in describing perspective transformation, while it makes the assumption that for effective transformative learning to take place, cognitive, somatic, emotional, and spiritual dimensions are closely interrelated. When we come to knowing and learning, linear and fragmented approaches cannot account for the perplexity of the human being, consisting of mind, body and spirit, and therefore all three of them should be taken into account.Download Free PDFView PDFTransformative learning meets Bildung.Repetion and Transformation. A hermeneutic and phenomenological view on transformative learning experiences2016 • Malte BrinkmannThe article argues that reflection within transformation (Mezirow, 1991) can only take place through repetition. Within this repetition, learning from experience is enabled. Seen from a hermeneutic and phenomenological perspective, transformation in learning is based on previously acquired knowing-how and knowing-that.Download Free PDFView PDFEducational TechnologyTransformative Learning Experience: Aim Higher, Gain More.2011 • Patrick E ParrishDownload Free PDFView PDFTransformative Learning: A Passage through the Liminal ZoneLarry GreenDownload Free PDFView PDFGrant Project: Transformative Experience and Testimony (funded by the Experience Project http://the-experience-project.org/)Yuri  CathCan you know what it is like to go to war, or fall in love, if you have not had those experiences yourself? Can you gain such knowledge by reading books? A powerful intuition, found everywhere from philosophy to pop music, says that you cannot know what is like to have experiences that you have never had yourself. However, people routinely consult stories, testimony, and theories in the hope of acquiring insights into what it is like to have experiences they are very different from any of their experiences. Drawing on recent developments in epistemology, this project explores various ways of resolving this puzzling tension in our attitudes towards ‘what it is like’-knowledge. These solutions are then used to illuminate a range of different issues (in e.g. aesthetics, philosophy of religion, and the empathy literature) concerning the limits of what we can know about the inner lives of other people.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal for the Theory of Social BehaviourTransforming Everyday Experience: Transformative Learning, Disorienting Dilemmas and Honneth’s Theory of Recognition.2022 • Ted FlemingAxel Honneth's theory of recognition outlines the personal and social contexts of family, law and community solidarities in which recognition – and misrecognitions – are experienced. His work has implications for Mezirow's theory of transformative learning. Transformative learning is critiqued for an over dependence on the Dewey/Habermas foundations that demand high levels of rationality and for an over reliance on individual learning to the exclusion of social learning. Honneth's ideas are explored in order to further develop the understanding of how experience is central to transformative learning. Disorienting dilemmas and the perplexities that lead to transformative learning are reinterpreted as experiences that have personal and social dimensions. Experience – often seen as individual and unique - cannot be disconnected from social contexts. Honneth helps us resolve these issues and allows us to re-interpret transformative learning as the transformation of experience. Finally, two further concepts are introduced: a) the dialectic nature of experience (Negt); and b) the importance of completeness (Negt). These further enhance the experiential grounding for emancipation and the emancipatory project of transformative learning.Download Free PDFView PDFTheory and Research in EducationTransformative Experience and Epiphany in Education2020 • Douglas Yacek, Kevin GaryThis paper argues for the thesis that epiphanies are a central means for transformative moral and intellectual growth. Drawing on recent work on this concept in moral education, the paper develops a conception of epiphany as a genre of transformative experience with three distinct phenomenological dimensions: a disruption of our everyday activity, a realization of an ethical good or value, and an aspiration to integrate this value more fully into our lives. After presenting this conception of epiphany, the paper turns to some of its educational implications. We argue that transformative educational aims are best advanced when an ethos of epiphany is created in the classroom.Download Free PDFView PDFFollowing Contemplative Education Students' Transformation Through Their ''Ground-of-Being'' ExperiencesPatricia MorganDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
