The goal is to highlight some aspects of the Organic Law of the Municipality of Rio Grande (LOM/RG) regarding environmental matters, as disposed of under the Chapter IV – “On the Environment”, inserted in the Title IV – “On the Defense of Citizen, Health and Environment”, in the perspective of the process of globalization and its effects on the local sphere. Data and documents obtained from public agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) and the internet were collected and analyzed, and a bibliographical revision was conducted, aiming to confront the environmental devices of the LOM/RG with constitutional commandments, considering the production of local environmental law, in order to evaluate the compatibility and effectiveness of the law.

El objetivo de esta investigación fue tener un diagnóstico exploratorio de su condición actual y de los factores que inciden en su pérdida territorial y deterioro ecológico. Estas áreas no están funcionando como estrategias de conservación debido a que carecen de una delimitación espacial precisa y de un plan de manejo, son desconocidas por la mayoría de los habitantes del área, carecen de un presupuesto para su gestión, hay venta de tierras y persisten las actividades productivas y extractivas.Save to LibraryDownloadby Benito Ramírez Valverde•  2  Geography, HumanitiesTér és társadalom a térbeli igazságosság koncepciójának perspektívájából : Szerkesztői előszóA jelen tematikus folyóiratszámban közölt tanulmányok a térbeli és egyben társadalmi igazságosság koncepciója köré szerveződnek.

A szerzők és szerkesztők közös célja, hogy ösztönözzék a további hazai kutatásokat, s egyben kapcsolódjanak a nemzetközi tudományos diskurzusok három nagy vonulatához. Ezek közül az első a térbeli igazságosság társadalomelméleti értelmezése, amelynek három markáns irányzata azonosítható. A Rawls nevével fémjelzett liberális megközelítés alapvetően egy elosztáson alapuló igazságosságfelfogást közvetít, míg a Soja nevéhez kapcsolódó kritikai térszemlélet a kapitalista piacgazdaság meghatározó szerepét hangsúlyozza a társadalmi igazságtalanságok kialakulásában. A posztstrukturalista megközelítés, továbblépve a kizárólag a gazdasági rendszerekhez és osztályviszonyokhoz kötött igazságtalanság gondolatán, arra hívja fel a figyelmet, hogy a különböző társadalmi csoportok a társadalmi igazságtalanságokat eltérően élik meg.

At the time of writing, one half of the world’s population has been asked to stay home and avoid many public places. What will be the long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public space once the restrictions have been lifted? The depth and extent of transformation is unclear, especially as it relates to the future design, use and perceptions of public space. This article aims to highlight emerging questions at the interface of COVID-19 and city design. It is possible that the COVID-19 crisis may fundamentally change our relationship with public space. In the ensuing months and years, it will be critical to study and measure these changes in order to inform urban planning and design in a post-COVID-19 world.Save to LibraryDownloadby Erick Villagomez•  16  Political Science, Urban Planning, Public Health, Public SpaceHabitação e Habitabilidade RuraisA habitação instiga uma reflexão sobre seu conceito, podendo ser interpretada apenas como a ação de habitar, bem como uma estrutura física caracterizada pela habitabilidade.

Com o intuito de discutir e definir conceitos de habitação e habitabilidade a serem utilizados em comunidades rurais brasileiras, foi desenvolvida uma revisão sistemática de literatura, tomando por base o Portal de Periódicos da CAPES, e aplicaram-se critérios de elegibilidade, resultando em 37 artigos para análise e discussão. Os artigos analisados apresentaram pontos de vista sociológico, ambiental e sanitário para o conceito de habitação, denotando a necessidade de um olhar diferenciado a partir dos modos de vida de seus residentes. Isso conferiu à definição de habitação rural uma estrutura física multifuncional, com espaços internos e externos para moradia e apoio laboral.

In an academic sphere today modernity theory relies on the key idea of rationalization to give explanation on the distinctiveness of the modern societies. The rationales for creating fresh federal and state capital cities in the third world especially Nigeria is to accomplish national ambition of a modern capital as a sign of state identity. As a consequence states aspire to be seen as coming of age in terms of development or “catching up with the west”. Improvement in quality of urban life in the course of provision of housing and basic services, and healthier environment is very important aspect of being modern and that is why this paper examined the degree of modernity of residential areas in Bauchi Metropolis to see how areas have improved and modernised in order to keep phase with modernity.

The paradigm of Local Development, through the logic of territorial milieu, becomes an innovative way of building integrated strategies and, at the same time an expression of a diversified, characterizing identity of the territorial systems. The theoretical basis of the territorial milieu, perceived as integration between local identity and innovation, stems from the GREMI model, which introduces the concept of milieu innovateur. The territorial milieu, with integrated urban/territorial management tools, distributes competitive advantages through the network while avoiding the risk of creating disparities between winning and losing areas in a competitive territorial system.

Urban areas are affected by the side effects of rapid urbanisation processes which need to be tackled quickly. The European Union placed the nature-based urban regeneration topic on the top of EU research areas&#39; priorities in order to improve the well-being in urban areas, increase the sustainable use of energy and boost carbon sequestration. The aim of the paper is to understand how the introduction of nature-based solutions in innovation-led urban regeneration can contribute to the realisation of a green district in a central neighbourhood of the Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria (IT). The proposal will be framed into an urban regeneration model in order to propose a replicable model to apply in other distressed urban areas impacting on the social, economic and environmental dimension.

The “Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics” (MONUM) in Boston, Massachusetts (USA) proves a representative case of innovation in the public sector. As a new type of government agency, it is essentially an open innovation lab dedicated to innovative evidence-based policymaking. Following a new dynamic organizational pattern in urban governance, MONUM is conducive to project-oriented social innovation practices and horizontal multi-sectoral collaboration among the three societal sectors: public, private, and civil. Its results suggest that first, the peculiarity of MONUM lies in its hybrid and boundary-blurring nature. Second, new institutional forms that experiment with urban governance can rely on multi-sectoral collaboration. Third, MONUM has experimented with a systemic approach to social innovation following the “design thinking theory.” The MON...Save to LibraryDownloadby Carmelina Bevilacqua•  13  Public Administration, Philosophy of Agency, Corporate Governance, Political ScienceFrom Deinstitutionalization to Community-Based Urban Development: Investigating Accessibility of Urban Systems in Calabria through Network AnalyticsCommunity-based urban development is an inclusive approach for local service provision and management centered on the proactive partnerships between urban communities and local governments.

Rooted in the deinstitutionalization of public services, the European Union and national policy effort is pushing towards the organization of community-based alternatives in response to the evolving needs of local communities. As the pandemic has shown, service accessibility has proven to be a key concern element that needs to be addressed to increase communities’ and cities’ resilience. In this direction, the paper aims to propose data-driven alternative approaches to assess urban systems’ accessibility and connectivity as an element of leveraging the resilience-oriented planning process and facilitating community-based development.

Eleven thermochromic coatings were developed by using thermochromic pigments into an appropriate binder system. The colorchanging temperature was 30 o C. The same binder system was used for the production of highly reflective (cool) and common coatings, in order to investigate and compare the thermal and optical characteristics of color-matched thermochromic, cool and common coatings. The results demonstrated that during the experimental period, surface temperatures of thermochromic samples were lower than the temperatures of color-matched cool and common. Mean daily surface temperatures ranged from 23.8 o C to 38.4 o C for the thermochromic samples, from 28.1 o C to 44.6 o C for the cool and from 29.8 o C to 48.5 o C for the common samples.

The authors’ researches on developmental issues disclose information and communication technologies as the driving force for the institutional change, enhancing public participation in the local management of development. The nature of the local development vehicle consists in participatory governance. The revitalization of dysfunctional areas or districts can be an important element of such a process. During the year 2015, the Polish State adopted important regulations strengthening the social dimension of revitalization. However, the desk research and the consulting work conducted by the authors discloses that managerial instruments implemented under those regulations are not sufficient for stimulating the broader way of the development, limiting themselves to finding funds for local social policy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aleksander Noworol•  4  Local Development, Poland, Revitalization, Public PolicyGesundheit in der RaumplanungÜber die gemeinsamen Wurzeln von Gesundheit und räumlicher Planung hinausgehend werden Aspekte des Wohlbefindens einbezogen und salutogenetisch-ressourcenorientierte Strategien entwickelt.

Static lines and unclear schedules create a confusing and unappealing user experience which pushes more of the population to cars for their transportation needs. This clearly leads to more congested streets which result in a net loss of productivity as well as an increase in stress, unnecessary fuel consumption, and harmful emissions. An intelligent bus solution is multi-faceted. It consists of (1) connected buses which are capable of providing their geo-location data, feedback about driving behavior, and health data to detect failures before they occur; (2) cashless payment through RFID cards to ensure much tighter control over pricing; (3) a processing server or cloud, in which all of the incoming data would be handled; (4) knowledge systems which dynamically optimize bus schedules and routes through learning algorithms; (5) and a mobile application to capture demand and inform passengers of bus arrival times. The main functions and algorithms of the proposed system are achieved based on machine learning algorithms and web technologies, whilst the hardware component is implemented based on System-on-Chip technology with custom hardware to interface with the vehicle. This paper will focus on the software component of the proposed solution. It is shown that by applying the proposed system to a previously static bus system that fuel consumption, maintenance costs, and carbon emissions can be reduced by 10-20% while overall passenger satisfaction is increased.Save to LibraryDownloadby Prof. Samer Ibrahim•Urban PlanningForestry and pork’s industry: Sustainable development in southern BrazilSave to LibraryDownloadby Accounting Department•  4  Business, Economics, Sustainable Development, IOSR Journal of Economics and FinanceThe Africa Problem of Global Urban Theory: Re-conceptualising Planetary UrbanisationSave to LibraryDownloadby Garth Myers•  10  African Studies, Economics, Globalization, Urban PlanningSeven Themes in African Urban DynamicsSave to LibraryDownloadby Garth Myers•  11  Sociology, Social Theory, Geography, Political ScienceIntellectual of Empire: Eric Dutton and Hegemony in British AfricaSave to LibraryDownloadby Garth Myers•  8  Sociology, Human Geography, Urban Planning, ColonialismO Fenômeno Granjeiro e Os Condomínios Em Aldeia: Uma Nova Periferia Em ConformaçãoSave to LibraryDownloadby ailson silva•  2  Physics, ArtResolusi Konflik Tapal Batas Kabupaten Rokan Hulu Dan Kabupaten Kampar, Propinsi RiauSave to LibraryDownloadby Surya Ningsih•  3  Political Science, Ilmu Politik dan Ilmu Pemerintahan, Social ScienceEl territorio y la orientación comercial.

By 2025, Lagos is supposed to be the 11th most populous city in the world (United Nations, 2016). One of the major effects of urbanisation in Lagos is inadequate and affordable housing. Lagos state is spatially the smallest state in Nigeria with approximately 3, 577 square kilometers out of which 39% are wetlands (Dekolo & Oduwaye, 2011)and which constitutes 0.4% of Nigeria’s total land mass (Opoko & Oluwatayo, 2014). An estimate of 2.55 million new homes is required for the next 5 years to meet housing needs of Lagos State. The state currently records approximately 20,000 people per square kilometer (LASG Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), 2012).
