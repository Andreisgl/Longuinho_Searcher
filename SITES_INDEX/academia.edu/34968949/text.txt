This book also addresses several fundamental issues, for instance the presence of various forms of monasticism (hermitages, laurae and coenobitic monasteries) in Nubia and their spatial organisation. The source base for reconstructing the monastic movement in Nubia, or rather life in individual monasteries, is largely archaeological and epigraphic. In order to analyse sources regarding Nubian monasteries, it is necessary to place them in the wider perspective of the Christian monastic movement – a new social phenomenon never before or after repeated in the history of humankind. Looking beyond Nubia is motivated not only by the desire to find reference points in centres that influenced the formation of the Nubian civilisation, but also because such parallels are indispensable for the interpretation of archaeological finds. One of the fundamental questions posed repeatedly in this book concerns the models that inspired the creators of monastic communities in Nubia. The geographic arguments point primarily to Egypt, but other regions of the Late Antique East should not be ruled out prematurely. We have, for instance, sound evidence for Syrian influence on the culture of Christian Nubia, especially liturgy. Also Constantinople, a core region of the Eastern Mediterranean and the imperial capital, must be considered as a possible source of inspiration. This book also addresses several fundamental issues, for instance the presence of various forms of monasticism (hermitages, laurae and coenobitic monasteries) in Nubia and their spatial organisation. Thus far, attempts to characterise Nubian monasticism in a synthetic manner have taken the form of short articles (Godlewski 2013; 2015) limited mostly to discussion of architectural features. In addition, with the notable exception of Adam Łajtar’s ad-hoc publications spurred by the emergence of new evidence, no study published to date collects and discusses the various titles associated with the monastic milieu, investigating who stood at the head of coenobitic communities, what their internal organisation was like, and how the monastic, ecclesiastical and spiritual hierarchies were intertwined. Another area in need of investigation is the relationship between Nubian monks and society, including the roles they played in lay communities and whether they really ‘abandoned’ the world at large. The book seeks to determine whether the Nubian elites perceived monastics as a threat to their dominant position in the social hierarchy, or rather collaborated with monks, taking advantage of the fact that monasteries offered human resources with highly esteemed and useful skills that proved helpful, if not indispensable, in managing non-monastic communities ranging from individual settlements to the state.Download Free PDFView PDFChronological Systems of Christian Nubia [= JJP Supplement Series 16], Warsaw2011 • Grzegorz OchałaIt has long been known that Christian Nubia used several dating methods, yet only one of them, the lunar calendar, drew scholars’ more detailed attention. The present book is the first comprehensive analysis of all attestations of counting time in medieval Nubia known to date. It discusses nine different aspects of keeping track of time, divided into two parts: ‘Annual dating methods’ and ‘Calendars’. The author on the one hand concentrates on indicating possible directions of influence that governed the use of particular dating methods in Nubia and on the other tries to prove the Nubians’ own inventiveness in this field. Each chapter is supplied with a set of tables and maps facilitating the comprehension of the collected material. The book should be used together with an on-line resource for textual sources from Christian Nubia, ‘The Database of Medieval Nubian Texts’, available at www.dbmnt.uw.edu.pl.Download Free PDFView PDFChristian Inscriptions from Egypt and Nubia 5 (2017)Jitse Dijkstra, Alain DelattreFifth installment of an annual overview of published inscriptions in Greek and Coptic from Christian Egypt and Nubia.Download Free PDFView PDFAegyptus and Nubia Christiana.

According to the new interpretation, the text includes an annual date, a fact that is extremely important for the dating of not only the text itself, but also of the wall painting (mounted St Phoibammon) it accompanies. In more general terms, the inscription has helped verify methods for the stylistic dating of Nubian murals.Download Free PDFView PDFNubian Voices II: New Texts and Studies on Christian Nubian Culture [= The Journal of Juristic Papyrology Supplement Series 27]Inscriptions from Saint Menas' church in Selib2015 • Agata DeptulaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
