They sit at the centre of a web of domestic accountability that links them to the executive and other branches of government, to constituents and the wider public, and to political parties. Expectations about what parliaments should deliver have increased tremendously over the past two decades. Yet in many countries parliaments are weak and ineffective and remain among the least trusted and legitimate institutions in the eyes of the population. As such, parliaments are both a cause of poor democratic governance – and an integral element in improving it. How to help parliaments become more effective and responsive is therefore a crucial question for international development actors who are committed to democratic strengthening.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

How to promote the role of women in peace and security, and how to address violence against women and girls, are now two of the top priorities for the international community. The challenge gender advocates face is to transform international commitments into real gains for women at national level. This briefing draws on recent ODI research and evaluation (Domingo et al., 2012; 2013; 2014) to review opportunities to promote women’s political participation and leadership in transitional and post-conflict settings, assess current international efforts to do so, and provide recommendations for policy and programming in this area.

The concept of legal empowerment emerged within the development community in the early 2000s from a critique of the ‘rule of law orthodoxy’ and its perceived top-down technical assistance approach to justice sector reform. By contrast, legal empowerment approaches are explicitly interested in the agency and priorities of marginalised people, and understanding how they can use the law to advance their interests. As a concept, it was important in reorienting the attention of the international community towards the experience of the ‘end-users’ of law and justice programmes. At the same time, the use of the law and legal systems by disadvantaged people to contest the unfair distribution of power and resources is a real-world phenomenon that predates and exists independently of international law and justice assistance. These activities are rooted in context-specific histories of how law, politics and development intersect to shape the distribution of resources and power. To date, understanding of legal empowerment has remained confined to a relatively small group of legal experts and within a narrow silo of justice support as part of international assistance efforts. But, as this wider legal activism continues in countries around the world, its relevance to development outcomes is becoming much clearer; this includes use of the law and justice mechanisms to expand access to public goods and services or to reduce marginalisation and inequality. This overview summarises recent evidence on legal empowerment and highlights political economy perspectives on what it will take to realise greater empowerment for those who need it most.&quot;Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a case study of successful pro-poor legal mobilisation in Bangladesh, it contributes to the effort to document approaches and ways of working that make a difference in terms of achieving development results. In many countries, marginalised groups and their allies use the law and justice systems to contest and improve their access to rights, goods and services. This is the essence of legal empowerment. Taking a claim to a dispute resolution mechanism, such as a court or community mediation forum, is one way poor people can use the law. Yet there is no automatic link between litigation, or other forms of legal action, and improved outcomes for poor people.

CARE’s ... more CARE International’s mission is to save lives, defeat poverty and achieve social justice. CARE’s Vision 2030 puts gender equality – including women’s and girls’ voice and leadership and eliminating gender-based violence – at the heart of all our programming and advocacy. Why? Gender inequality is a key driver of poverty and one of the most widespread forms of injustice and rights violations in the world. Participation in public and political life and decision-making is a human right, and the over representation of men in decision-making and leadership at all levels of society and government perpetuates gender injustice.This position paper provides guidance and resources for CARE leadership and staff to enable us to respond to women and marginalised groups’ aspirations for equal voice and social transformation. The position paper supports CARE achievement of Vision 2030 and it contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal on Gender Equality – and specifically Goal 5.5 on ‘women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life’.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A critical step is to close financing gaps in key sectors through both dedicated funding and gender mainstreaming. Donors can also do more to improve quality of programming, notably through supporting women as active agents in reducing conflict and fragility; paying more attention to transforming root causes of inequality and fragility, such as gender norms and relations; adopting more politically smart and adaptive approaches; and strengthening donor co-ordination on gender. Donors should ask not only how fragility shapes or impacts on gender inequality, but also how gender ideologies and practices can contribute to fuelling fragility. Top-level leadership, matched by dedicated expertise and robust accountability systems, was found to be key in improving how gender is integrated into donor programmes in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
