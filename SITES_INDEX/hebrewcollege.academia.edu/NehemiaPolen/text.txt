This monograph is an... more This chapter presents a monograph entitled The Holy Fire, by Nehemiah Polen. This monograph is an analysis of the manuscript ‘Esh kodesh’ by the Piaseczner rebbe of the Warsaw ghetto, Kalonymous Kalman Shapira. For Shapira, the detachment of Jewish traditions from worldliness made Judaism an instrument of defiance. He also viewed the goal of hasidic thought as the transformation of suffering to joy. Polen&#39;s analysis provides insight into the mindset of hasidic theorists and practitioners during the Holocaust. After a brief discussion on Shapira&#39;s life and work — especially his contributions to Jewish mysticism — the chapter illustrates how Polen provides a powerful and moving exposition of Shapira&#39;s spiritual world.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

<i>The Besht: Magician, Mystic and Leader</i> (review)Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies,  2009The Besht: Magician, Mystic and Leader, by Immanuel Etkes.

R. Israel b. Eliezer, c. 1700-1760, better known as the Baal Shem Tov or Besht, is one of the most intriguing, yet enigmatic figures in early modern Jewish history. The life and accomplishments of the Besht have been widely discussed among Jewish historians, with very little consensus. Throughout this fascinating monograph, Immanuel Etkes methodically presents the views of previous scholars on central issues, such as magic in Jewish society and the baalei shem, i.e., the practitioners of the magical arts. Etkes then presents his own position, which he effectively supports with wide ranging evidence, both textual and historical. This results in a very edifying presentation that is quite convincing. Etkes divides the book into an Introduction, six chapters and a Conclusion, as well as three Appendices. The Introduction serves its purpose as a succinct overview of the book&#39;s goals and objectives. Chapter One constitutes a major essay on the phenomenon of the baalei shem in Eastern European Jewish society. This provides important background material for an appreciation of the Besht&#39;s primary occupation in his latter years. In contradistinction to the Enlightenment&#39;s denigration of magic as appealing to the lower and uneducated classes, Etkes effectively substantiates his contention that &quot;demonological beliefs and the application of magic were common to all classes of society-including the scholarly elite.&quot; He continues by noting that&quot;[i]t was the scholarly elite, furthermore, that conserved and transmitted the knowledge of magic from generation to generation&quot; (p. 43). Moreover, in Appendix One Etkes presents extensive quotes from 19th century Haskalah writers on magic and magicians. Starting with Chapter Two and continuing through Chapter Five, Etkes examines the life and accomplishments of the Besht. In so doing he examines all of the historical data pertaining to the Besht&#39;s biography that has been gathered by his predecessors. Etkes also focuses on the Besht&#39;s teachings, as preserved in his literary legacy, as well as comments made by disciples and others. This material is vividly collected in Chapter Four, &quot;The Besht as Mystic and Pioneer in Divine Worship.&quot; Although Etkes regularly refers to the seminal contribution of Gershom Scholem on the Besht and early Hasidism, his primary foil is the more recent monograph by Moshe Rosman, Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba&#39;al Skem Tov (1996). Both Etkes and Rosman concur that in his capacity as a baal shem, the Besht was not an anti-establishment figure. Rosman offered a groundbreaking analysis of the Polish archives of Miedzyboz, where the Besht lived for the last twenty years of his life. He demonstrated that the Besht, who was listed as &quot;Balszam Doktor,&quot; lived in a tax-free manse and was financially supported by the Jewish community (Founder, p. xii). In general Rosman adopted a minimalist approach to the Besht. &quot;[The] Besht did not inaugurate new, fully developed forms that became the hallmark of the movement. …Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Repelled by what they see as a cult of personality, they deconstruct the cult but lose sight of the personality. Their effort displays the limits of a journalistic portrayal of a person of spirit that observes externals but vacates considerations of interiority. The Rebbe provides a vivid portrait of Rabbi Schneerson’s early days, beginning with his childhood in Russia, noting that he was sent to a relatively modern school, where the curriculum included grammar and poetry, including Bialik. Later we find the future leade...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Some who set sail identified with the burgeoning Hasidic movement. Others seem to have come along just for the ride, perhaps excited by the vibrant energy of the Hasidic masters or tempted by messianic expectations. Historians debate the motives that led to this minor aliyah [immigration] to the small Yishuv in the Land of Israel. But what is clear is that, notwithstanding the considerable socioeconomic and geographic challenges, some members of this emigrating group sought to establish a new center for a burgeoning Hasidic ethos. Nothing found in the sources produced by this community suggests any sort of national or pan-diasporic aim, and in this way their group should be differentiated from later modern movements of political renewal. But the Hasidic émigrés maintained a close link with their communities in Eastern Europe, stretching the intimate relationship between master and disciple across thousands of miles. Their letters reveal a hope that the impact of this small mystical fellowship and its rich devotional life would radiate outward from its renewed center in the Holy Land in Palestine.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
