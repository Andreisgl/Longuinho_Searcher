Some of them are the rise of Hindu Nationalism, the marginalization and stigmatization of Muslims, the change of Kashmir’s status, adaptation of the religiously discriminatory citizenship law and protests against it. The Islamophobic discourse used by political leaders and misleading and anti-Muslim content spread through traditional and social media by the fanatical Hindu supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also establish the ground on which these kinds of events take place. On the other hand, although the anti-Muslim rhetoric and events in the country seem to have being triggered after the BJP government which came to power in 2014, its origin dates back to earlier times. In this regard, in the first part of the report, the political and ideological background of the CAA has been discussed. In the second part, the compatibility of CAA has been discussed within the framework of the boundaries drawn by international law.Download Free PDFView PDFReligionsEmerging Hindu Rashtra and Its Impact on Indian MuslimsRifat Binte LutfulThis article examines the impact of the gradual Hindutvaization of Indian culture and politics on Indian Muslims. The article contrasts the status of Muslims in the still secular, pluralistic, and democratic constitution of India with the rather marginalized reality of Muslims since the rise of Hindu nationalism. The article argues that successive electoral victories by Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has precipitated political events, generated policies, and passed new laws that are eroding the democratic nature of India and undermining its religious freedoms. The article documents recent changes that are expediting the emergence of the Hindu state in India and consequently exposes the world’s largest religious minority to an intolerant form of majoritarian governance.Download Free PDFView PDFDigital Hatred, Real Violence: majoritarian Radicalisation and Social Media in India2019 • Maya MirchandaniSocial media&#39;s impact on mainstream media, and the way people communicate with one another and disseminate information, has become a subject of serious study for journalists, academics and policymakers alike. While it has been a significant equaliser as a vehicle by which the fundamental right to freedom of expression is guaranteed everyone irrespective of class, creed or geography, these very same platforms are also becoming spaces where—in the garb of free speech—misinformation and hate are able to flourish. In India, these spaces provide both tacit and overt sanction for rising incidents of majoritarian violence as identity-based, populist politics dominate the country&#39;s landscape. This paper analyses the intersections between free speech and hate speech and the impact of majoritarian hate speech in the Indian context. It asks whether government agencies and individuals working to counter terrorism and violent extremism in India can bring majoritarian violence of this nat...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Nanyang Technology UniversityKey Drivers of Female Radicalisation in Bangladesh2020 • Mostofa ShafiThough women’s radicalisation is not a new area of research in Bangladesh, the country has witnessed an escalation of female participation in jihadism since the 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack. Women have even acted as suicide bombers in Bangladesh, which some scholars observe as a new trend of militancy in the country. Against this backdrop, this article uncovers some key drivers of female radicalisation in Bangladesh. It argues that the so-called Islamist model of obedience to one’s husband, ideological conviction, Muslim victimhood narratives and crises in life, among others, drive women towards radicalisation in Bangladesh.Download Free PDFView PDFIslamophobia Studies CenterCOVID-19, and India's Islamophobia2020 • Hatem BazianDownload Free PDFView PDFRoutledge Handbook on Autocratization in South Asia HINDU NATIONALIST STATECRAFT AND MODI'S AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM2022 • Alf NilsenIn this chapter, we analyze how a majoritarian Hindu nationalism has been inscribed into law in unprecedented ways under Narendra Modi. In doing so, we start from Hindu nationalist attempts at redefining the Indian nation through grassroots mobilization and violence from the 1990s. The chapter then analyzes the more recent attempts by the Modi regime at mobilizing law in order to align the nation with the core tenets of Hindu nationalism. This, we argue, is in effect an attempt at legally locking in Hindu nationalist claims to the nation in ways that make it exceedingly difficult to reverse such claims in the future, and which erodes democratic rights in dramatic ways.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Nanyang Technology UniversityKey Drivers of Female Radicalization in Bangladesh2020 • Shafi Md MostofaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Migration AffairsCommunalising the Socio-Political Space and/ amidst the Pandemic2020 • Mohammad  SajjadThis essay centres around treatment meted out to the Muslim citizens by the Indian state and society during the COVID-19 pandemic in India in & after April 2020. This had followed the protests against India’s new citizenship laws, and communal violence in eastern parts of the capital city of Delhi, in February. By late March 2020, the COVID-19 spread came to be blamed mainly by the media, generally pro-establishment ones, upon a sub-sect of Sunni Muslims called Tablighi Jama’at with its headquarters (Markaz) in Delhi.The blame put on the Tablighi Jama’at should be contrasted with the state’s facilitative efforts towards the hindu pilgrimage Kumbh in Haridwar in 2021, which resulted in massive COVID infections, as reported by many national and international newspapers. Though the judiciary subsequently exonerated the Tablighi people, the prejudice of the Indian state, in sections of its popular media, and society is evident. In this series of events, the states’s approach towards a section of its own citizens has come under serious scrutiny. The issue of justice has a new, growing religious dimension along with old caste, class, gender, and others dimensions. This goes against the constitutional values of equal treatment to all citizens irrespective of faith, caste, creed, gender and ethnicity. This has its own short-term and long-term implications; hence, worth discussing.Download Free PDFView PDFPakistan Horizon Secularism in India: Myth or Reality2019 • Wajeeha NajamFrequent incidents of religious intolerance are quite surprising for many of us, as India is better known for its secular and democratic ideals. However, the recent wave of violence motivated (instigated) by Hindutva politics has raised many questions about the authenticity of the Indian claim of being a secular state. A secular state refers to the concept that there must be a clear separation of religion from state affairs and a secular state must refrain itself from indulging with any religious affiliation. In contrast to the provisions guaranteed in the Indian constitution regarding the protection of rights of minorities, freedom of religion and non-discrimination of people irrespective of their caste, race, gender and religion appears mainly theoretical which still needs to be implemented in its original spirit aspired by its architect, B. R. Ambedker.1 However, the constant rise and influence of Hindutva based political actors upon policy matters and government affairs seems to obliterate the existing face of Indian secularism rather than to physically implement its theoretical ideals. To support my argument this paper provides a historical background of emerging religious extremism in India and causes of frequent violence on communal grounds whereas the qualitative method of research has been adopted to explore the topic under discussion.Download Free PDFView PDFLawsProtecting the Rights of Minorities under International Law and Implications of COVID-19: An Overview of the Indian Context2021 • Nehaluddin AhmadThe concept of majority rule and respect for minority rights is demonstrated in several constitutions of the world. Oppression by the majority of the minority is barred by articles of these respective constitutions. Today, democracy is mostly a method of government of the people that is ruled by the people. The issue of minority rights is at the center of the concept of civic rights. Minority protection, thus, operates on the hypothesis that religious, cultural, and linguistic affiliations are essential features of the very notion of a civic, just society. This paper offers an alternative account of why minority rights have international significance and more information on the value of an international, socially just process for the allocation of resources by states. By this approach, international minority rights speak to the wrongs that international law itself produces by organizing international political reality into a legal order. This article focuses on the uncertain effect ...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
