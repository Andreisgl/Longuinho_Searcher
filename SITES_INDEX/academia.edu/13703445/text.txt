During the early stages of site investigation planning for Luva, various deepwater site investigation options were considered: surface mounted drilling, seabed based drilling, combined seabed PCPT and deep gravity / piston core option and acoustic coring. An extensive market survey was performed which in particular researched the currently available seabed drilling technology concepts, variations in their design and operation and their limitations. This Paper highlights the main issues raised during the market survey and technical evaluation, discusses the various site investigation systems available for deepwater geotechnical site investigations and identifies the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. The Paper is the first in a series of 4 which together describe the Project in detail. The Paper should be read in conjunction with the others which follow during this conference session.Download Free PDFView PDFDrilling Specifications: Well Installations in the 300 Area to Support PNNL?s Integrated Field-Scale Subsurface Research Challenge (IFC) Project2008 • Bruce BjornstadDownload Free PDFView PDFIntroduction to U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Workshop Report: Exciting Science through DrillingJohn ShervaisDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings (USB), paper 26810, DOI: 10.3997/2214-4609.201414195 (ISBN 978-94-6282-166-8, ISSN 2214-4609)Drilling Technology Influence on Boreholes Quality with Geophysical Measurements Implications2015 • Ciuperca Constantin, Bogdan NICULESCUThe drilling techniques and operations performed during drilling can affect the borehole's shape and quality, with direct repercussions on the quality of geophysical records, both LWD and wireline. However, wireline measurements are more affected than LWD, due to the operations that occur after drilling the well (e.g., reaming trips etc.) and the "aging borehole" phenomena (breakouts and fractures become larger, invasion becomes deeper). The most affected by borehole's quality and shape are the pad-type geophysical tools: Imaging, Litho-Density or Microresistivity, which require a good contact with the formations. Also, the sonic logging readings can be affected by the occurence of quasi-horizontal or inclined fracture systems, due to a strong attenuation of the signal, causing the "time stretch" or even "cycle skipping" phenomena (abnormally long transit time readings). Different types of fractures induced by drilling operations can create a false invasion appearance, since the resistivity tools with short investigation radii are influenced by the drilling fluid penetrating in these fractures.Download Free PDFView PDFScientific DrillingScientific Results of Conduit Drilling in the Unzen Scientific Drilling Project (USDP2005 • John UtoDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific DrillingFault Zone Drilling in the Backstop to the Mediterranean Ridge Accretionary Complex off Crete, Greece2007 • Marco BohnhoffDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Scientific Drilling Database (SDDB) - Data from Deep Earth Monitoring and SoundingKlump, JensDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geography (Chigaku Zasshi)An Overview: Special Issue on ^|^ldquo;Current Status of On-land Scientific Drilling in Japan and Its Prospects^|^rdquo2013 • Yasufumi IryuDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
