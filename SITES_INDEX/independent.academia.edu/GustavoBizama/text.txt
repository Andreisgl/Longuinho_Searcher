Spatio temporal population dynamics of the invasive diatom Didymosphenia geminata in central-southern Chilean riversThe Science of the total environment,  Jan 3, 2016We document the distribution of Didymosphenia geminata in central-southern Chilean rivers and ide... more We document the distribution of Didymosphenia geminata in central-southern Chilean rivers and identify the chemical and physical factors associated with its presence/absence (p/a). Repeated surveys in five successive years provided evidence that D. geminata could be nearing a biogeographic equilibrium in the region. D. geminata databases from extensive biological and environmental surveys in 187 rivers, within ten catchments, south of 38°S commenced in November 2010 and ran through May 2013. In addition, data from two other field surveys were used. The sites evenly distributed latitudinally were climatically characterized. The recent sampling program, following a published species distribution model, was designed to explore D. geminata distribution within thirteen catchments (34°S-48°S). An extensive river survey in 2014 (spring-summer) and in 2015 (autumn) included the p/a, and relative abundance of D. geminata cells in phytobenthos and in the drift.

Meteorological data encompassed 293 weather stations, and were extracted from three databases: Dirección Meteorológica de Chile (DMC); Dirección General de Aguas de Chile (DGA); and the FAOClim-NET Agroclimatic database management system (FAO 2001), recording monthly records of mean daily minimum temperature, mean daily maximum temperature and total rainfall for 5-year periods (1965-1969 for 1970 climatic conditions; 1985-1989 for 1990 climatic conditions; and 2005-2009 for 2010 climatic conditions).

It is often assumed that the niche requirements for invasive plants are conserved during invasion, especially when the invaded regions share similar climate conditions. California and central Chile have a remarkable degree of convergence in their vegetation structure, and a similar Mediterranean climate. Such similarities make these geographic areas an interesting natural experiment for testing climatic niche dynamics and the equilibrium of invasive species in a new environment. We tested to see if the climatic niche of Eschscholzia californica is conserved in the invaded range (central Chile), and we assessed whether the invasion process has reached a biogeographical equilibrium, i.e., occupy all the suitable geographic locations that have suitable conditions under native niche requirements. We compared the climatic niche in the native and invaded ranges as well as the projected potential geograph...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We analyze sediment cores from two lakes (Thompson and Burgos), located in Aysen Region, Southern Chile. The samples were obtained using a gravity corer and sampled at intervals of 1 cm to 30 cm depth and every 5 cm until the end of the core. Thompson lake sediment core was sampled every 5 cm. Age model is based on radiocarbon datings on bulk sediments and macroremains.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One method employed for determining the effects of climate change on the distribution of these organisms is species distribution modeling. Methods We generated a model to evaluate the potential geographic distribution and breeding distribution of the Peruvian pelican (Pelecanus thagus). Based on maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt), we identified the environmental factors that currently affect its geographic distribution and breeding. Then we predicted its future distribution range under two climate change scenarios: moderate (rcp 2.6) and severe (rcp 8.5). Results The mean daytime temperature range and marine primary productivity explain the current potential distribution and breeding of the pelican. Under the future climate change scenarios, the spatial distribution of the pelican is predicted...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This tree has been introduced and widely planted for ornamental and forestry purposes in several semiarid regions of the world because its seedlings are easily established and have a high survival rate; it also grows quickly, and it is tolerant of dry climates. We compared the global and regional niches of naturalized and planted populations of S. molle in order to examine the invasive stages and potential distribution of this species in four regions of the world. This work provides a novel approach for understanding the invasion dynamics of S. molle in these areas and elucidates the ecological processes that bring about such invasions. Most naturalized and planted populations were found to be in equilibrium with the environment.

Even so, today, most of Antarctica remains in the grip of continental ice sheets, with only about 0.2% of its overall area being ice-free. The continent’s terrestrial fauna consists only of invertebrates, with just two native species of insects, the chironomid midges Parochlus steinenii and Belgica antarctica. We integrate ecophysiological information with the development of new high-resolution climatic layers for Antarctica, to better understand how the distribution of P. steinenii may respond to change over the next century under different IPCC climate change scenarios. We conclude that the species has the potential to expand its distribution to include parts of the west and east coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula and even coastal ice-free areas in parts of continental Antarctica. We propose P. steinenii as an effective native sentinel and indicator spec...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Using Global and Regional Species Distribution Models (SDM) to Infer the Invasive Stage ofLatrodectus geometricus(Araneae: Theridiidae) in the AmericasEnvironmental Entomology,  2016The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus C.

Koch, 1841, is a large spider of the family Theridiidae that belongs to a genus of medical interest owing to its potent neurotoxic venom, which causes severe pain in humans. In America, this alien spider has been found in virtually all countries in the region, mainly associated with human dwellings, but also in agricultural sectors. However, the invasive process and potential distribution of this invasive species across the American continent are completely unknown. In this context, using a combination of both global and regional niche models, it is possible to hypothesize the invasive phase of the species as well as the geographic space where these different phases occur. By comparing the global and regional niches of L. geometricus, we examined its invasive process and potential distribution across the American continent. This work is an innovative approach to understanding the invasion of the brown widow spider in this area and the ecological processes that underlie this invasion. In this context, the global and regional niche comparison constitutes an appropriate tool to account for the complexities of the invasive process, generating different hypotheses amenable to being tested in future studies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
