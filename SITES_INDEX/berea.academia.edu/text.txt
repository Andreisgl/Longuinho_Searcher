The site, part of the Berea College Farm, had been under organic crop management for two decades. The GWP was calculated as 0.57 kg CO2-eq per kg of strawberries with the combined impact of the aluminum and plastic manufacturing accounting for 44% of the total and the direct production activities, including labor, accounting for another 28%. The average yields of 18,990 kg/ha of fresh fruit over the two years (2020–2021) were comparable to those typically reported in the southeastern USA for conventional production, but opportunities to increase strawberry yields in high tunnels without increasing inputs should be explored to reduce the GWP.

Composts may be able to serve as effective substitutes for peat and offer potential environmental advantages. The suitability of compost as potting media depends upon the raw materials as well as processing methods used. This study includes two related experiments—one with beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and the other with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.)—aimed at assessing the potential viability of farm-produced, food-residuals compost as a replacement for peat-based potting media in the production of organic vegetable transplants. The experiments were conducted in 2021 on the Berea College Farm in Kentucky, USA, a USDA certified organic farm. The results indicated that potting media composed of 75% to 100% compost performed as well as fertilized, peat-based growing media for plant growth.

Research has shown that relative to conventional agriculture, organic farming is more efficient in its use of non-renewable energy, maintains or improves soil quality, and has less of a detrimental effect on water quality and biodiversity. Studies have had more mixed findings, however, when examining the impact of organic farming on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) in particular have indicated that organic farming can often result in higher GHG emissions per unit product as a result of lower yields. The organic movement has the opportunity to embrace the science of LCA and use this information in developing tools for site-specific assessments that can point toward strategies for improvements.

This case study uses partial budgeting to examine the performance of an on-farm store in Kentucky (USA) over a six-year period (2014–2019), intended for adding value to raw farm ingredients through processing and direct sales to consumers. Three primary product supply chains were aggregated, stored, processed, and sold through the farm store: livestock (meats), grains (flours and meals), and fresh produce (fruits, vegetables, and herbs). In addition, prepared foods were made largely from the farm’s ingredients and sold as ready-to-eat meals. Whole-farm income increased substantially as a result of the farm-store enterprise but the costs of operation exceeded the added income in every year of the study, illustrating the challenges to small farms in achieving a sufficient economy of scale in value-added enterprises.

The results show that the crops consuming the most energy per hectare are tomato, sugarcane, cucumber and alfalfa, while sunflower consumed the least. The average total energy input for all crops in Iran during the study period was 48,029 MJ ha−1. Our analysis revealed that potato has the highest potential to reduce energy consumption and that electricity and fertilizer inputs have the most potential for energy savings in cropping systems. Not all studies reviewed addressed the factors that create energy consumption patterns and environmental emissions. Therefore, eight indicators were modeled in this meta-analysis, which include Total Energy Input, Energy Productivity, Energy Use Efficiency, Net Energy, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Technical Efficiency, Pure Technical Efficiency and ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The joint use of life cycle assessment (LCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA), known as LCA + DEA methodology, is an expanding area of research in this quest. LCA estimates the environmental impacts of the products or services, while DEA evaluates their efficiency, providing targets and benchmarks for the inefficient ones. Because energy consumption and environmental quality are highly interdependent, we carried out a study to examine energy efficiency and environmental emissions associated with rain-fed barley farms in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Fifty-four rain-fed barley farms were randomly selected, and production data were collected using questionnaires and interviews. DEA and LCA were used to quantify and compare environmental indicators before and after efficiency improvements were applied to the farms.

In this study a cradle-to-farm-gate approach using data from greenhouse operators and two distinct functional units, one mass-based and the other land-based, were selected to analyze the impact categories. Data for production of inputs were taken from EcoInvent®2.0 database, and SimaPro software was employed for analysis. Ten impact categories including Abiotic Depletion potential (AD), Acidification potential (AC), Eutrophication potential (EU), Global Warming potential for time horizon 100 years (GW), Ozone Depletion potential (OD), Human Toxicity potential (HT), Freshwater and Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity potential (FAET and MAET), Terrestrial Ecotoxicity potential (TE), and Photochemical Oxidation potential (PhO) were selected based on the CML 2 baseline 2000 V2/world, 1990/characterization method. In addition, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was employed to predict the environmental impact of both crops on the basis of input materials. The results indicated that greenhouse tomato production had a lower environmental impact than cucumber due to less total energy input and correspondingly lower environmental burdens in all impact categories. Almost all impact categories were dominated by natural gas, electricity and nylon (as cover of greenhouses). Furthermore, the results revealed that ANFIS was capable of forecasting the environmental indices of greenhouse production with a high degree of accuracy and minimal error.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We examine the relevant methodologies and research trends from 2008 to 2019, a particularly active and productive period. Initially, we find researchers using energy audits and regression modeling to estimate energy-use patterns. Then economic and environmental-emissions audits are more commonly incorporated into analyses. Finally, the application of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are observed in papers. The main focus of this study is on energy-use patterns, economic modelling, and environmental emissions. We then address critical issues, including sample size, energy equivalents, and additional practical energy-saving recommendations which can be considered by researchers in future analyses. The application of AI in the analysis of agricultural systems, and how it can be used to achieve sustainable agriculture, is discussed with the aim of providing guidelines for researchers interested in energy flow in agricultural systems, especially in Iran. To achieve sustainable agriculture systems, we recommend more attention be given toward considering the impact of social factors in addition to energy, environmental and economic factors. Finally, this review should guide other researchers in choosing appropriate crop types and regions in need study to avoid repetitive studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From one-acre gardens to five-hundred-acre crop and livestock farms, student farms foster hands-on food-system literacy in a world where the shortcomings of input-intensive conventional agriculture have become increasingly apparent. They provide a context in which disciplinary boundaries are bridged, intellectual and manual skills are cultivated together, and abstract ideas about sustainability are put to the test.

Agroecology in Central Appalachia: Framing problems and facilitating solutionsAgroecology, Ecosystems and Sustainability, Publisher: CRC Press, Editor: N.

In this chapter, I examine from the perspective of agroecology the situation in central Appalachia, an area of the United States characterized in part by small, resource-limited farms and a history of economic hardship and underdevelopment. In particular, I identify constraints and opportunities for improving the sustainability of the region’s farming and food systems and share notable examples that demonstrate the inherent trade-offs and challenges in applying agroecology to address the region’s problems and build its agricultural economy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sustainable Agriculture - Beyond Organic FarmingThe current conception of organic farming—as an agricultural production system based on ecologica... more The current conception of organic farming—as an agricultural production system based on ecological understanding and management with third-party certification, in contrast to one reliant upon external inputs, particularly synthetic agrichemicals and fertilizer—is the result of nearly a century of intellectual thought and dialogue, field observations and experiences, systematic experimentation, and codification of rules. Debates on the current and future viability of organic farming often focus on its capacity to produce sufficient food to meet the demands of a growing human population. And yet any thorough examination of the pros and cons of alternative farming approaches should consider much more – like the side effects on soil, water and air; energy and land-use efficiency; global warming potential; conservation of biodiversity; waste generation and recycling in the food system; farmer and community well-being; animal welfare; and the capacity to function and meet demands long into the future.Today, organic farming is widely acknowledged as a viable alternative to conventional production under many conditions and certified organic foods are increasingly sought out by consumers concerned about environmental issues and human health. Considerable research supports the validity of such consumer choices. Organic products typically contain lower levels of pesticides and antibiotics, soil quality is generally improved and water pollution reduced on organic farms, and biodiversity is often greater in organic production systems compared to their conventional counterparts. And crops once thought to be impossible to raise organically are now widely found on grocery store shelves.There is also research, however, that shows some of the trade-offs in productivity and efficiency that accompany the adoption of organic farming. Such systems often do not match conventional agriculture in measures such as in yield per unit of land or per unit of labor as well as in costs of production (not including externalities). As a consequence, prices premiums are often needed to make production economically viable for farmers. Higher prices, of course, put some products out of reach for lower income families and communities, prompting criticism by some that organic farming is elitist. Organic standards today also may not explicitly or sufficiently address important public concerns about climate change, animal welfare and the quality of life provided to farmers, farm workers and others in the supply chain. It’s important to recognize that organic agriculture is evolving. Rather than a static set of rules, the requirements, technologies, inputs and management practices comprising organic farming change as our understanding improves, new technologies become available, and the stakeholders involved with the political process that governs certification amend the rules. Research and debate today will help to shape organic farming in the future.The chapters in this book represent perspectives on organic farming and food systems from widely different academic disciplines and different regions of the world. They include replicated field experiments, modelling, systems analysis, case studies and literature reviews. They address issues from the field-plot scale, like resource-use efficiency in crop production, to the resilience of entire national food systems. Some chapters tackle controversial topics in organic farming, like aquaculture and the use of genetically modified organisms. And some authors focus on the challenges to producers, while others examine consumer behavior and the education of the next generation of decision-makers in the food system – children.This book is comprised of three sections. Authors in the first section – Performance of Organic Farming – examine how well organic production systems meet environmental, economic and social objectives and how performance might be improved. In the second section – Farming to Food Systems – the focus expands beyond crop and livestock production to consider other players forming food supply chains. The last section – Beyond Organic: Shaping Future Farming and Food Systems – delves into some vigorously debated topics that have the potential to shape future farming and food systems.Two decades ago, few would have envisioned the expansion of organic farming and the dramatic growth in organic food sales that has occurred since then. Likewise, predictions about the state organic food and farming decades from now would be fraught with uncertainty. Still, the improved understanding we gain from the contributions of researchers today influence production practices and shape food-system policies tomorrow. The findings, interpretations, and ideas shared in this book will likely generate as many questions as answers, but asking the relevant and difficult questions is as critical as finding the right answers. This diverse group of authors makes interesting and useful contributions to our ongoing conversations about food, agriculture and the evolution of organic farming.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
