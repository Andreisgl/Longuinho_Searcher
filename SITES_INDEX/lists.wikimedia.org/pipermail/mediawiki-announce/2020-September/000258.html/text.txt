[MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki 1.35.0-rc.3 is ready for testing

I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of MediaWiki
1.35.0-rc.3, the fourth (and hopefully final; only minor documentation and
packaging changes are expected) release candidate for 1.35.x, the next LTS
version to replace 1.31 which is due to go end of life in June 2021.
Download links at the end of the e-mail. The tag has been signed and pushed
to Git.
Please note that the PHP version requirement has been raised from 7.2.9 in
MediaWiki 1.34 (and 7.0 in MediaWiki 1.31), to 7.3.19.
This is not a final release and should not be used for production websites.
Known issues are tracked in Phabricator on the release workboard [1]. As
always please do try out the release candidate in a test environment and
report any issues that you discover. Please use the #MW-1.35-Release [2]
tag in Phabricator when reporting issues specific to this release.
It is expected that MediaWiki 1.35 will become final in mid September 2020
(apologies for the delay), and will be supported for 3 years after that.
Known/outstanding issues/things to test:
* The PHP requirement for MediaWiki 1.35 has been raised to 7.3.19.
* Both the Vector skin and the underlying skin infrastructure are
undergoing numerous changes, so there might be things broken that are
already fixed in master and as such need backporting.
* VisualEditor and Parsoid are now bundled in the tarball and no longer
need a separate nodejs service. The documentation for this still may still
require some updates.
* Watchlist expiry (behind the $wgWatchlistExpiry flag) is currently
experimental. It should be finished for the 1.35.0 final release.
* If you're on Windows and use 7zip and had issues in the previous release
candidates (and the last round of security releases) extracting the
tarball, this should be fixed for this release.
Changes since 1.35.0-rc.2:
* (T258662) mediawiki.visibleTimeout: Update the nextVisibleTimeoutId value.
* Ensure Parsoid doesn't throw when <ref> is used w/o Cite installed.
* Remove maintenance/createCommonPasswordCdb.php.
* (T260468) Increase "sites.site_global_key" to varbinary(64).
* (T183759) Fix shell edge-cases in Windows.
* (T257879) Drop PHP 7.2 support; require 7.3.19.
* (T251661) User::pingLimiter: add user-global rate limit type.
* (T246991) User: enforce pingLimiter() expiry time.
* (T256831) Rest: Handle Uri constructor exception.
* (T259094) Fix RequestFromGlobalsTest failing in Travis CI.
* (T256831, T261344) Rest: Use try/catch to handle URIs with embedded colon.
