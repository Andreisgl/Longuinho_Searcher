Representative of agency, the voice gets defined as what is being said rather than how one is saying it. My thesis addresses this gap through an earoriented analysis of women’s voice within the Canadian radio and podcasting industry. Centred on the experiences of individual women in Toronto’s broadcast soundscape, I bring a feminist phenomenological approach to my work to explore the intersection of voice as both material sound -an extension of the body and thus individual identities- and the weight of the women’s voice as politically and historically coded. I aim to expand my work beyond the individual experiences of the women within the broadcast industry and into the broader discourse surrounding gendered representation for the future of our Canadian media soundscape.Save to Libraryby Stacey Copeland•청년주체들의 ‘자기소개서’ 작성을 중심으로 한 구직 경험의 문화적인 분석Save to LibraryDownloadby Dongwook Song•Eudaemonism, Repressive Tolerance & Social MediaThe adoption of social media as a primary mean for intercommunitarian communication by the Millenials has reinvented many traditional models of identity, relationships and human wants and needs.

The prioritization of  form, instantaneity and quantity, rather than the sought of one after meaningfulness, longevity and sensuous reenactment of the Self, led to a contemporary stir of what Marcuse described as ‘eudaemonism’. This principle can be traced back from as far as the Antiquity and is meant to prescribe pathways to happiness for members of a given community. The concept of eudaemonism carries in itself moral impingements that are necessary to abide , in order to live ‘the Good Life’, in accordance with society’s norms. Hegemonously fixated pleasures, and culturally educated sensory organs incorporate into individuals’ sense of rational subjectivity, in such of a way that they ‘cannot be judges of their own happiness. They have been prevented from knowing their own interest’ ( Marcuse, On Hedonism, pp.121).On Facebook for instance, topics such as melancholy, desperation, and radical revolt are rapidly attenuated through the contribution of other users. The instantenous actualization of content, and its ill-demonstrated concern for truth, further supplement the totalised concepts of harmony and happiness. Experienced users may know that it is virtually impossible to disclose one’s complex web of emotions and viewpoints on Facebook. Authenticity and truth will always be dissatisfied if undergoing the dissociating processes that ultimatly come to create digital form and content. Using Marcusian terms, the development of a liberated human being presupposes  ‘ prospects for a new relationship between sensibility and reason; namely, the harmony between sensibility and a radical consciousness : rational faculties capable of projecting and defining the objective ( material) conditions of freedom, its real limits and chances). (Marcuse, Essay On Liberation, pp. 26). Another phenomenon is confirmed into the realm of pyschoanalytic observations. Social media have permeate mass culture namely because of their contractual relationships to one’s private life. In fact, they are fulfilling a ‘libinal’ function in the case of most users, as they facilitate the synthesis and accomplishment of love, friendship and companionship in postmodernity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Philippe Gravel•  6  Critical Theory, Psychoanalysis, Aristotle, Herbert MarcusePhilippe Gravel.

It undertakes an historical comparison of radio broadcasting under former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, more specifically the influential radio program Sawt al-Arab (&quot;Voice of the Arabs&quot;), and satellite television broadcasting under current Qatari Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, particularly the renowned Al Jazeera News Channel. While Nasser and Al Thani may have employed their nations&#39; broadcasting apparatuses as means by which to achieve their own ends, contemporary comparisons which imply that these authoritarian leaders have encoded their broadcasting content with similar pan-Arab rhetoric are unfounded. Rather, legitimate points of comparison are found in audience decoding responses, for both Sawt al-Arab and Al Jazeera have demonstrated the ability to transform the interactions of domestic, international and expatriate Arabs throu...Save to LibraryDownloadby Nawal Musleh-Motut•Willing the impossible: Reconciling the Holocaust and the Nakba through photograph-based storytellingSave to LibraryDownloadby Nawal Musleh-Motut•ArtComics Images and the Art of Witnessing: A Visual Analysis of Joe Sacco's Footnotes in GazaIn November 1956, two large-scale killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli soldiers took place in the towns of Khan Younis and Rafah, both located in the Gaza Strip.

Although more than 275 Palestinians in Khan Younis and approximately 111 Palestinians in Rafah were killed, details of these massacres remained absent from Western media and public debate, and instead were left buried and forgotten in a United Nations report that gave them scant treatment.1 That was until 2009—fifty-three years after the fact— when these violent events, their lingering repercussions, and the haunting memories of their survivors were brought to life in Joe Sacco’s aptly titled comic Footnotes in Gaza. Not only does Sacco bring the Gaza massacres into visual presence, but he also gives their victims and survivors names, faces, and voices, thus reviving them from the annals of forgotten history to confront his readers with their harrowing testimonies. In Footnotes in Gaza Sacco returns to the distinct ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Nawal Musleh-Motut•  2  Art, Arab studiesFrom Palestine to the Canadian Diaspora TheMultiple Social Biographies of theMusleh Family’s Photographic ArchiveIn this paper I trace the various social biographies of selected family photographs that traveled from Palestine to Canada and depict my parents’ lives in pre-1948 Palestine, theWest Bank and Jordan, and covermultiple generations from the... moreIn this paper I trace the various social biographies of selected family photographs that traveled from Palestine to Canada and depict my parents’ lives in pre-1948 Palestine, theWest Bank and Jordan, and covermultiple generations from the 1930s to the present day.

Working through the “World Heritage Order” and its changing definition of “outstanding universal value,” this article develops a bridge between seemingly disconnected rural sites in France and the People’s Republic of China to move beyond the confines of “imagined communities” and their potential for displacing “concrete inequalities.” The article extends a critical approach of communication to heritage and contextualizes present rural heritage communication within larger political economic and cultural processes of urban–rural and capital–capillary dynamics that enables, in the cases examined, their current heritage identity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joseph Nicolai•  12  Cultural Studies, Political Economy, Cultural Heritage, Rural DevelopmentA Global Communication M.A.  Double Degree Program: Conceptualizing and working through diversityAt a time when diversity and de-westernization are current buzz words for injecting social justice into the future of communication studies, we must address how we conceptualize and confront these concepts in practice.

Academic Cosmopolitanism has been proposed as one way forward, but it remains in the trenches of cosmopolitan theory's difficulty of dealing with diversity in political systems. Simon Fraser University and the Communication University of China's Global Communication MA Double Degree Program embodies many of the core values of academic cosmopolitanism. Grounded in a transcultural political economy framework however, it embraces some of the kinds of conflicts that cosmopolitanism sets up as barriers. Via autoethnographic accounts from the program's first teaching assistant and an alumnae from its first cohort, we explore how the conflicts involved in conceptualizing and confronting diversity are experienced on the ground. We conclude by highlighting the ways in which transcultural political economy enriches discussions on diversity and inform efforts to de-colonize communication studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joseph Nicolai•  5  Higher Education, Cosmopolitanism, Equality and Diversity, ChinaComment moderation strategies in Canadian news media and their principlesThis paper examines Canadian news guidelines on user-generated content (UGC) In terms of moderation, different forms of comment strategies, real name registration and anonymity, pre-moderation and post-moderation policy, and the choice of... moreThis paper examines Canadian news guidelines on user-generated content (UGC) In terms of moderation, different forms of comment strategies, real name registration and anonymity, pre-moderation and post-moderation policy, and the choice of platform and selection of automated moderation, are discussed. In terms of values, democratic ideals, entertainment and legal requirements ideals in guiding UGC are highlighted. Finally, the paper outlines how news-related UGC is moderated within Canadian news. This is achieved by looking at the online comment policies available on the websites of the CBC, CityNews (Halifax), CTV News, Glacier Media, Global News, The Globe and Mail, Narcity Media, Postmedia, QUB (Québecor), and Torstar. The policies highlight how Canadian news organizations have practical strategies to manage news-related UGC but also call upon positive social principles, flag ill practices, foster democracy, and fight against online hate speech and libel. The analysis shows how guidelines reflect many of the key principles highlighted in the literature review but make no reference to economic principles that are emphasized as important in academic and journalist concerns with moderating news-related UGC.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joseph Nicolai•  3  Canadian Studies, User-Generated News-like Content, Moderation[Review of the book Trump, Trudeau, Tweets, Truth: A Conversation]Bill Fox's new book draws from Canadian and U.S. political, legal, and journalism contexts to provide a compelling account of today's decentralized and disaggregated news in the social media age.

Following Fox's previous Spinwars (1999), this new title showcases his first-hand experience in Canada's political news and industry scenes. While the title of the book may give the impression that the work is primarily on social media or Donald Trump, the book is essentially a work on Canada and the state of news in the country. Paying special attention to the relationship between traditional news and social media, Fox examines changes in political and commercial communications and examines its implications for public discourse.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joseph Nicolai and +1Stephen Li•  5  Media Studies, Journalism, Mass Communication, Disinformation
