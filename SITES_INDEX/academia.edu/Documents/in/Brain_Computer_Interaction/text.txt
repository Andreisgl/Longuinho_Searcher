Anticipating impacts of emerging technologies is a challenging undertaking, once a great deal of uncertainties and emerging development paths not always lead to a significant future. The dynamics of technological trajectories arise from actions and interactions amongst various actors and stakeholders involved; when understanding these dynamics they can act more reflexively and better shape future development directions. The participatory approach of Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA) offers a comprehensive and active process in evaluating potential social impacts and perspectives for emerging technologies. Through the engaging of different actors and a mutual sharing of information, a broadening of perspectives is achieved, widening their view of the innovation process and the possible consequences of new and existing applications. Adjustments and corrections of paths could then take place, offering feedback into ongoing choices and strategies. A Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system which measures central nervous system (CNS) activity and converts it into artificial output without using the normal pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles, thereby changing the ongoing interactions between the CNS and its external or internal environment. Although BCI is still in its early stages of development, current research and applications show increasing possibilities for even further improvements. BCIs are present in many areas, but specifically its medical applications allow for the replacement, restoration, enhancement, improvement and supplementation of human functions. This clearly raises many questions about ethics, morals and responsibility. This article aims to reflect upon how the BCI community has been assessing the ethical, moral and philosophical issues as well as to investigate if a CTA approach is being put in place, even if not in a conscious way. Moreover, an explicit integration of the ethical dimension into the TA approach and in Science, Technology and Society (STS) studies is expected from the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) perspective. Thus this article also seeks to highlight the importance of assessing and prioritizing possible ethical, moral and philosophical impacts as well as related risks and opportunities for the present and future.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gabriel  T.

The brainwaves are also displayed in live-time as the performer interacts with audience members within the confines of a 360-degree immersive theatre, and a dramatic story is narrated between the performer and me. Noor had its world premiere at ISEA 2016 Hong Kong (International Society for Electronic Art) on May 18, 2016. As I conceived and directed the work, its theme was loosely framed around the following metaphorical question: Is there a place in human consciousness where surveillance cannot go? Through images, sonic environment, pre-recorded libretto, and spoken narrative, the opera presented the true story of the life of Noor Inayat Khan, a Sufi Muslim Princess and covert British operative inside Nazi-occupied France, who was murdered at Dachau. It touched upon issues of memory, faith, and the locus of self in light of increasingly invasive and sophisticated surveillance technologies. The performance also worked with the bodies of both the performer and participants by creating a responsive feedback loop in which the performer's interactions with the audience—through movement, gaze, touch, and speech—visibly changed the performer's brainwaves. Noor: A Brain Opera explores the life of a young woman, Noor Inayat Khan, whose father Hazarat Inayat Khan brought Sufism to the West early in the twentieth century. Noor, born in Moscow of an American mother and Indian father, grew up in a peaceful household outside of Paris. When she was thirteen her father suddenly passed away while on a pilgrimage in India, leaving Noor and her mother in charge of her younger siblings. World War II broke out and the family moved to England for safety. Unable to stand idly by as the war unfolded, Noor as a young adult entered British secret intelligence training as a covert wirelessSave to LibraryDownloadby Ellen Pearlman, PhD•  13  Sensors and Sensing, Brain-computer interfaces, Surveillance Studies, Interactive Digital StorytellingEssential Motor Cortex Signal Processing: an ERP and functional connectivity MATLAB toolbox -User Guide Version 1.0The purpose of this document is to help individuals use the "Essential Motor Cortex Signal Processing MATLAB Toolbox".

The toolbox implements various methods for three major aspects of investigating human motor cortex from Neuroscience view point: (1) ERP estimation and quantication, (2) Cortical Functional Connectivity analysis and (3) EMG quantication. The toolbox { which is distributed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE as a set of MATLAB routines { can be downloaded directly at the address:http://oset.ir/category.php?dir=Toolsor from the public repository on GitHub, at address below:https://github.com/EsiSeraj/ERP Connectivity EMG AnalysisThe purpose of this toolbox is threefold: 1. Extract the event-related-potential (ERP) from preprocessed cerebral signals (i.e. EEG, MEG, etc.), identify and then quantify the event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) events. Both time-course dynamics and time-frequency (TF) analyzes are included. 2. Measure, quantify and demonstrate the cortical functional connectivity (CFC) across scalp electrodes. These set of functions can also be applied to various types of cerebral signals (i.e. electric and magnetic). 3. Quantify electromyogram (EMG) recorded from active muscles during performing motor tasks.Save to LibraryDownloadby Esmaeil  Seraj and +1Karthiga Mahalingam•  17  Brain-computer interfaces, Matlab, Time-Frequency Analysis, Brain Computer InteractionA P300-based brain computer interface system for words typingP300 is an event related potential of the brain in response to oddball events.

Brain Computer Interface(BCI) utilizing P300 is known as a P300 BCI system. A conventional P300 BCI system for character spellingis composed of a paradigm that displays flashing characters and a classification scheme which identifiestarget characters. To type a word a user has to spell each character of the word: this spelling process isslow and it can take several minutes to type a word. In this study, we propose a new word typing schemeby integrating a word suggestion mechanism with a dictionary search into the conventional P300-basedspeller. Our new P300-based word typing system consists of an initial character spelling paradigm,a dictionary unit to give suggestions of possible words and the second word selection paradigm to selecta word out of the suggestions. Our proposed methodology reduces typing time significantly and makesword typing easy via a P300 BCI system. We have tested our system with ten subjects and our resultsdemonstrate an average word typing time of 1.91min whereas the conventional took 3.36 min for thesame words.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Faraz  Akram•  20  Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Brain-computer interfacesAdaptive training using an artificial neural network and EEG metrics for within- and cross-task workload classificationSave to LibraryDownloadby Carryl Baldwin•  9  Real-time Systems, Training, Neural Networks, Brain Computer InterfaceIn Vivo Electrochemical Analysis of a PEDOT/MWCNT Neural Electrode CoatingNeural electrodes hold tremendous potential for improving understanding of brain function and restoring lost neurological functions.

Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and dexamethasone (Dex)-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coatings have shown promise to improve chronic neural electrode performance. Here, we employ electrochemical techniques to characterize the coating in vivo. Coated and uncoated electrode arrays were implanted into rat visual cortex and subjected to daily cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for 11 days. Coated electrodes experienced a significant decrease in 1 kHz impedance within the first two days of implantation followed by an increase between days 4 and 7. Equivalent circuit analysis showed that the impedance increase is the result of surface capacitance reduction, likely due to protein and cellular processes encapsulating the porous coating. Coating’s charge storage capacity remained consistently higher than uncoated electrodes, demonstrating its in vivo electrochemical stability. To decouple the PEDOT/MWCNT material property changes from the tissue response, in vitro characterization was conducted by soaking the coated electrodes in PBS for 11 days. Some coated electrodes exhibited steady impedance while others exhibiting large increases associated with large decreases in charge storage capacity suggesting delamination in PBS. This was not observed in vivo, as scanning electron microscopy of explants verified the integrity of the coating with no sign of delamination or cracking. Despite the impedance increase, coated electrodes successfully recorded neural activity throughout the implantation period.Save to LibraryDownloadby Takashi D Y Kozai•  30  Microelectronics And Semiconductor Engineering, Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering, MicroelectronicsNeuromuscular electrical stimulation induced brain patterns to decode motor imageryRegardless of the paradigm used to implement a brain-computer interface (BCI), all systems suffer from BCI-inefficiency.

In the case of patients the inefficiency can be high. Some solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem, however they have not been completely successful yet. EEG from 10 healthy users was recorded during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of hands and feet and during motor imagery (MI) of the same limbs. Features and classifiers were computed using part of these data to decode MI. Offline analyses showed that it was possible to decode MI using a classifier based on afferent patterns induced by NMES and even infer a better model than with MI data. Afferent NMES motor patterns can support the calibration of BCI systems and be used to decode MI. This finding might be a new way to train sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based BCI systems for healthy users having difficulties to attain BCI control. It might also be an alternative to train MI-based BCIs for users who cannot perform real movements but have remaining afferents (ALS, stroke patients).Save to LibraryDownloadby Ranu Jung•  13  Engineering, Electroencephalography, Brain Computer Interface, ImaginationUnchartable territories?

Yet it will try to address some fundamental elements which I think are to be taken into account if we are going to pursue the digital music dream Max Mathews, Jean-Claude Risset and John Chowning had back at Bell Labs in the 1960s.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Dahan•  10  Psychology, Music, Musicology, Computer MusicEffect of Extensive Training Load on the Classification Accuracy for a Three Class Motor Imagery Based Brain-Computer Interface—In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), a subject's thoughts are read to provide an appropriate way of communication where only brain signals are used.

The information of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals differentiate between subjects depending on their thoughts according to research. In this paper, a combined feature extraction methods are proposed to test the effect of the extensive training load on the classification accuracy of discrimination between three motor imagery (MI) movements which are Left Hand (LH), Right Hand (RH) and both Feet (F) through an offline analysis for one subject. Several classifiers and feature extraction techniques were used. Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) combined with Band Power (BP) and classified by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were found to outperform all other combinations with an average classification accuracy equal 90% over three consecutive sessions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohamed H .

A neuroheadset device can play an important role in measuringa subject’s attention and inform the subject of his/her attention levels. For few people, it would be better to measurethe attention levels before doing an activity that could end up in bad results due to lack of attention which is a commonproblem in everything ranging from medical errors during operation to driving errors. In the research the attention levelof the brain activity is measured to capture the mood of subjects more specifically which is based on two test cases thefirst test is carried out with a set of questions which includes logic puzzles and mathematical problems and the secondtest is with a game to measure subject’s attention. The system is organized with a set of assessment measures adoptedby the covariance matrix and cosine similarity metric. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach provides highlycorrelation among similar attributes under subjects with an identical background.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shakeel Ahmed, PhD and +1Mohammed al-Hoshani•  5  Electroencephalography, Brain Computer Interaction, Cognitive Workload, Covariance MatrixThe Last Wedding Party of Eva von BraunSave to Libraryby Ellen Pearlman, PhD•  4  Brain-computer interfaces, Consciousness, Brain Computer Interaction, Mind Reading Sensor That Streams Information from the Brain to a ComputerTowards adaptive ex ante circuit breakers in financial markets using human-algorithmic market studiesPosition paper introducing an AI research methodology for investigating dynamics and stability of financial markets.

Controlled experiments using an experimental financial marketplace containing humans and adap- tive trading agents are performed; with brain activity of hu- man participants captured using an EEG headset. Machine learning is applied to brain and trading data to develop an adaptive multi-agent model of markets that can be optimised for stability using a co-evolutionary GA framework. Specif- ically, financial market circuit breakers—mechanisms for limiting or halting trading on an exchange—are addressed; a pertinent real-world problem of trans-national importance. Ex post circuit breakers that halt a market after a sudden price swing will be analysed and optimised. Further, ex ante circuit breakers, which are triggered before problems emerge, will be investigated and explored. The development of reliable “anti-crash” trading technology would have globally significant economic, social, and political impact.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Cartlidge•  5  Coevolution, Agent-Based Computational Economics, Financial Markets, Agent-based modelingArchitecting the Future of TechnologyThe human brain is the final frontier and is being explored and accessed in startling ways.
