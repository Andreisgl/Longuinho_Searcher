Arabic is the official language of this country but most of them also use English mostly when carrying out business. This is used as a second language.

These include Urdu, Balochi, Malayalam, Pashto, Hindi, Telugu, Tagalog, Tamil, Sinhalese, Nelapi, and Bengali.
The Education System in Mexico
Education in Mexico is strongly linked to the country’s tumultuous history and the various ethnic and class divisions present in the country; divisions that include the Amerindians, Spanish aristocrats, criollos (a social class comprising the locally born people of pure Spanish ancestry), peons, and mestizos (those of mixed Amerindian and European—mostly Spanish—blood).
