In these Mediterranean regions, a reduction in water availability is expected for the near future as a result of decreases of precipitation and increases of temperatures, and the consequent increases of evapotranspiration rates , which are predicted to be greater than those that already occurred in the twentieth century by most General Circulation Models . Lower water availability is also projected for this region by ecophysiological models such as GOTILWA .See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersTreesComparative study of diurnal and nocturnal sap flow of Quercus ilex and Phillyrea latifolia in a Mediterranean holm oak forest in Prades (Catalonia, NE Spain)2012 • Josep  PenuelasDownload Free PDFView PDFBiogeosciences DiscussionsA whole plant approach to evaluate the water use of mediterranean maquis species in a coastal dune ecosystem2009 • Bart MuysDownload Free PDFView PDFBiogeosciencesAn integrated approach shows different use of water resources from Mediterranean maquis species in a coastal dune ecosystem2009 • Bart MuysDownload Free PDFView PDFActa OecologicaChanges in leaf δ13C and δ15N for three Mediterranean tree species in relation to soil water availability2008 • Josep  PenuelasDownload Free PDFView PDFPlant SciencePhysiological adjustments of a Mediterranean shrub to long-term experimental warming and drought treatments2016 • daijun liuDownload Free PDFView PDFRussian Journal of Plant PhysiologySpecies-specific, seasonal, inter-annual, and historically-accumulated changes in foliar terpene emission rates in Phillyrea latifolia and Quercus ilex submitted to rain exclusion in the Prades Mountains (Catalonia)2011 • J.

Background and Objectives: Many forest ecosystems are increasingly challenged by stress conditions under climate change. These new environmental constraints may drive changes in species distribution and ecosystem function. Materials and Methods: An evergreen Mediterranean holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) forest was subjected to 21 consecutive years of experimental drought (performing 30% of rainfall exclusion resulted in a 15% decrease in soil moisture). The effects of the annual climatic conditions and the experimental drought on a tree and shrub basal area increment were studied, with a focus on the two most dominant species (Q. ilex and the tall shrub Phillyrea latifolia L.). Results: Stem growth decreased and tree mortality incr...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
