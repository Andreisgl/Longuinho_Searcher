Adam J. GoldwynThis paper analyzes Ivan Kotliarevs’kyi’s Eneïda (1798, 1842), a travesty of Virgil’s Aeneid, and its two contemporary adaptations released in 1991: Serhiy Bedusenko’s rock opera and Volodymyr Dakhno’s animation film of the same title. It demonstrates how these three works localize the Roman epic both by translating Virgil’s Latin into Ukrainian and by transforming the Aeneid into a recognizably Ukrainian literary artifact. This imaginative appropriation is done through stylistic, linguistic, and generic mixing that is original and grounded in an established tradition of classical reception in the vernacular, thus making the Eneïda at once “national” and “European.” The paper also demonstrates how these works draw on and contribute to the mythology of the Ukrainian Cossacks, which is linked to the reawakening of Ukraine’s national consciousness and cultural identity.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAustralian Slavonic and East European StudiesWriting in Ukraine and European identity before 17982008 • Marko PavlyshynDownload Free PDFView PDF“‘That Men to Come Shall Know of It’: Theorizing Aesthetic Innovation, Heroic Ideology, and Political Legitimacy in Trojan War Reception.” The Trojan Wars and the Making of the Modern World.

These texts helped to formulate new narratives, articulate attitudes, and build relationships, create a sense of community within the protestors’ side, which had its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices. Facebook served as an important platform for the initial appeal, for coordination between the participants, for reflections, and for identification of the opposing sides during the protests. It was a key space for sharing emotions, personal stories, humor and expressive forms of protest, making allusions to known literary works, historical events and world public figures. Exploring the types of narratives and their contribution in identifying the opposing sides, the work is focused on digital stories that illuminate elements not covered by the professional media coverage and official reports. It traces the diverse forms, topics and expressive devices in the narratives, and identifies the categories of lore (eyewitness narratives, (re)telling of stories, jokes, poetry, songs, etc.). It provides juxtaposition of the patterns found in the text with the main events of each specific day. The thesis provides several chapters that focus on: (1) a review of the historical context of the events; (2) an analysis of the data with reference to all categories and topics, and the main findings; (3) the role of humor and expressive devices in releasing the tension of the conflict and in helping to formulate the attitudes within the protestors’ side; (4) evidence of the functions of personal stories as they build relationships, create a sense of community, and validate the participants’ experiences and the significance of the events from the protestors’ perspectives; (5) interpretation within this protest lore, and its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices as in the example of the Nebesna Sotnia (Heavenly Hundred) narrative formation and its correlation to the repertoire of motifs and terms of the selected historical periods: the Cossack, the Ukrainian National Republic and World War II. The study underlines the relevance of time and several patterns related to historical events, as Facebook posts immediately responded to the events occurring on the square and streets occupied by protestors, simultaneously with professional media outlets, and sometimes prior to them. These findings have important implications that go beyond the Ukrainian context in that they contribute to the further exploration of social networks functioning in relation to factual events.Download Free PDFView PDFRussian LinguisticsLinguistic russification in Russian Ukraine: languages, imperial models, and policies Языковая руcсификация в подроссийской Украине: языки, имперские модели и законодательная практика2019 • Andrii DanylenkoThe paper deals with the vagaries of linguistic russification among the Ukraini-ans from the mid-seventeenth century to 1914. The authors explore the major stages in the implementation of the policies of russification in Russian Ukraine, starting with first bans on books printed in Church Slavonic of the Ukrainian recension via the decrees and edicts issued by Peter I together with the Holy Synod to the punitive measures taken by the tsarist regime against new literary Ukrainian in the second half of the nineteenth century. The authors distinguish three languages (Church Slavonic of the Ukrainian recension, Ruthenian, and new literary Ukrainian) which were consecutively exposed to various forms of hostile language management by the tsarist administration. Based on these three languages and the classification into different models of imperial policy, a new periodization of linguistic rus-sification and denationalization is substantiated. The material analyzed with the help of this new periodization proves that Russia's rulers had special reasons for treating Ukraine more severely than other non-Russian areas, resulting in a constant, consistent, and long-lasting policy of linguistic russification in Russian Ukraine. Аннотация Статья посвящена особенностям языковой руссификации среди украин-цев с середины семнадцатого столетия до 1914 г. Авторы рассматривают основные этапы реализации политики руссификации в подроссийской Украине со времен пер-вых запретов книг, составленных на церковнославянском языке украинского извода, указами Петра I и Священного Синода до притеснений современного украинского литературного языка царским режимом во второй половине девятнадцатого века. По мнению авторов, объектом враждебной политики со стороны царской администрации были три языка украинцев, а именно: украинский церковнославянский язык, простая мова и новый украинский литературный язык. Основываясь на указанных трех языках и классификации имперских моделей, авторы предлагают новый тип периодизации, B A. Danylenko A. Danylenko, H. Naienko применение которого доказывает, что у правителей России были всегда веские осно-вания для того, чтобы относиться к Украине жестче, чем к иным не-русским землям. Все это позволяет утверждать, что языковая руссификация в подроссийской Украине была постоянной, последовательной и долговременной.Download Free PDFView PDFNakonechnyi, Evgen. “The Moskovites, ” in _Stolen Name: Why Rusyns Turned into Ukrainians._Translated from Ukrainian.2015 • Anastasia LakhtikovaTranslated from Ukrainian.

Nakonechnyi Stolen Name. Why Rusyns Turned into UkrainiansNatalia PavliukTranslation from Ukrainian. Stolen Name, Why Rusyns Turned into Ukrainians is one of his publications where history studies are combined with linguistic research, which made it possible to provide a complete picture of the Ukrainian history through the life of the name of our nation, starting from the earliest years to the present-day. The books reveals precise facts from the history of Ukraine and Russia which make it clear, how easily imperial historians falsely interpreted the facts and even rewrote them deliberately for political purposes of the ruling regime.Y. Nakonechnyi's Stolen Name is a book of great power of persuasion, all statements supported by references to authentic materials and scientific research. Being a profound study, it is nonetheless read as an adventure story, full of exciting events and discoveries. Written in 2001, it seems to contain answers to a great number of questions of today, not only for Ukraine and Russia but also for the whole world.Download Free PDFView PDFNew Standard Ukrainian in the 19th c.Andrii DanylenkoDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
