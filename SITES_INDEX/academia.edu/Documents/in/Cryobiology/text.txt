Shoot cultures were cold-hardened at 5 degree C on MS medium containing 0.5 M sucrose over a period of 20 to 40 days. Shoot tips with basal plate (1.0-1.5 x 1.0 mm) were dissected from shoot cultures and precultured at 5 degree C for 2 days on MS medium containing 0.5 M sucrose. Precultured shoot tips were placed on aluminium cryo-plates (7 mm x 37 mm x 0.5 mm) with 10 wells (diameter 1.5 mm, depth 0.75 mm) and embedded in alginate gel. Osmoprotection was performed by immersing the cryo-plates for 30 or 60 min in 25 ml pipetting reservoirs filled with loading solution (2 M glycerol + 1.4 M sucrose). For dehydration, the loading solution was replaced with PVS 7M vitrification solution (30 percent glycerol, 19.5 percent ethylene glycol and 0.6 M sucrose in liquid MS basal medium), which was applied for 40 min.

A completely randomized design (CRD) was used with 6 treatments and 3 replications. The Seurukan fish sperm was diluted in extender with a ratio of 1:20 (sperm: extender), then glutathione was added at a concentration of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg L À1. Next, the sperm thawed at 39e40 C for 3 min and mixed with 100 eggs which were randomly selected. The success of the fertilized egg was observed 6 h after fertilization, while the hatching rate was examined 60 h after fertilization. The ANOVA test showed that the addition of glutathione significant affected the sperms motility, fertility and hatching rate of seurukan fish Osteo-chilus vittatus eggs (P < 0.05). By segregation the fresh sperm, a higher sperm motility rate was recorded with an addition of 30 mgL À1 of glutathione (63.00 ± 5.89), however, this value was not significantly different from using concentration of 10 and 20 mg L À1. A higher fertilization rate was produced using glutathione concentration of 50 mg L À1 (51.33 ± 17.01); however, it was also not significantly different from the concentration of 20, 30 and 40 mgL À1. In addition, a higher hatching rate was also recorded using glutathione concentration of 50 mg L À1 (40.33 ± 12.89), this value was not significantly different from using 40 mgL À1 glutathione. Hence, a conclusion was drawn that the optimum concentration of glutathione is 40 mg L À1 of diluent.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zainal A .

All three stimuli act at different sites and in different ways to activate the T cell receptor pathway and are widely used in different concentrations, stimulation durations and read-out systems. This study was designed to establish the most suitable polyclonal stimulus in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) experiments by assessing the kinetics of cell viability, present immunophenotypes, proliferation, and cytokine production of the PBMC. In addition, changes in these read-out parameters due to cryopreservation have been investigated by comparing fresh and cryopreserved PBMC cultures at days 1, 3, 5, and 7. This study showed a reduction in the cytokine levels after cryopreservation of PMA/Ca-I stimulated PBMC, whereas no significant differences due to the cryopreservation were observed in ConA or alphaCD3/alphaCD28 stimulated PBMC. Cryopreservation did not alter the maximal proliferation capacity of ConA or alphaCD3/alphaCD28 stimulated PBMC, whereas it did delay the proliferation. Although cryopreservation had no effect on the CD3+CD4+ or CD3+CD8+ T cell subsets, PMA/Ca-I significantly reduced the amount of both T cell subsets over time. In conclusion, PMA/Ca-I is suitable as a positive control in experiments where high cytokine production is expected and only fresh PBMC are used. Proliferation and effects on the T cell subsets in long-term PBMC cultures should use ConA or alphaCD3/alphaCD28 as positive control.Save to LibraryDownloadby Prescilla Jeurink•  15  Cryobiology, Kinetics, Cytokines, CryopreservationUltra rapid warming of cryo samples using an IR laser pulse.Save to LibraryDownloadby Estefania Paredes Rosendo and +1Peter Mazur•  4  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Reproductive Biology, Cryopreservation of gametes and embryosDrinking water hardness and cardiovascular diseaseSave to LibraryDownloadby Frantisek Kozisek•  16  Cryobiology, Water Purification, Biology, CalciumReptile freeze tolerance: Metabolism and gene expressionSave to LibraryDownloadby Kenneth Storey•  20  Cryobiology, Gene expression, Signal Transduction, HibernationFreezability of water buffalo bull (Bubalus bubalis) spermatozoa is improved with the addition of curcumin (diferuoyl methane) in semen extenderEffects of curcumin as antioxidant in extender were evaluated on freezability of buffalo spermatozoa.

Semen from each of the five bulls (n = 3 replicates, six ejaculates/bull, a total of 30 ejaculates) was diluted in Tris-citric acid extender containing curcumin (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 mM) or control. At pre-freezing and post-thawing, total antioxidant contents (μM/L) and lipid peroxidation levels (μM/ml) were higher (p < .05) and lower (p < .05) respectively, with 1.5 and 2.0 mM compared to 0.5 and 1.0 mM curcumin and control. At post-thawing, progressive motility (PM, %) and rapid velocity (RV, %) were higher (p < .05) with 1.5 mM compared to other doses of curcumin and control (except in case of RV, 1.5 was similar with 1.0 mM). Kinematics (average path velocity, μm/s; straight-line velocity, μm/s; curved-line velocity, μm/s; straightness, %; linearity, %), in vitro longevity (%, PM and RV) and DNA integrity (%) at post-thawing were higher (p < .05) with 1.5 mM compared to control. At post-thawing, supravital plasma membrane integrity (%) and viable spermatozoa with intact acrosome (%) were higher with 1.5 compared to 2.0 mM curcumin and control. We concluded that freezability of water buffalo spermatozoa is improved with the addition of 1.5 mM curcumin in extender.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Syed Aftab Hussain  Shah and +1Murtaza  Andrabi•  4  Cryobiology, Antioxidant, Buffalo reproduction, Sperm CryopreservationA case study on stress preconditioning of a Lactobacillus strain prior to freeze-dryingSave to LibraryDownloadby Sebastian  Hakansson•  15  Cryobiology, Probiotics, Lactobacillus, SucroseApplications and optimization of cryopreservation technologies to cellular therapeuticsDelivery of cell therapies often requires the ability to hold products in readiness whilst logistical, regulatory and potency considerations are dealt with and recorded.

This requires reversibly stopping biological time, a process which is often achieved by cryopreservation. However, cryo-preservation itself poses many biological and biophysical challenges to living cells that need to be understood in order to apply the low temperature technologies to their best advantage. This review sets out the history of applied cryopreservation, our current understanding of the various processes involved in storage at cryogenic temperatures, and challenges for robust and reliable uses of cryopreservation within the cell therapy arena.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jordi González Molina•  3  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Cell therapyInfluence of Domestic Violence on Mental HealthWorld Health organization has identified the domestic violence as a matter directly related to public health, the most of such cases reaches to the severity during the period of pregnancy.

Domestic violence may originate in the home; it can spill over into the world of work. All females, males and children might be its victims. It includes a combination of violence i.e., wife battering, psychology torture, sexual violence and both simultaneous physical and sexual violence. Other type of violence may lead to anxiety and depression in the females. Studies show that living with domestic violence can cause physical and emotional harm to fry and young people in the way of life like ongoing anxiety and impression, emotional suffering etc. Male casualties of abusive behavior at home once in a while report their episodes of misuse. Domestic violence directly affects the behavior health and emotions of victim and violator that will ultimately affect relations with relatives, their workplace, their neighbors and their fellows.Save to LibraryDownloadby Umer Ali•  4  Cryobiology, Conservation Biology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Microbiology and BiotechnologyThe cryoprotective effect of antifreeze glycopeptides from antarctic fishesSave to LibraryDownloadby Boris Rubinsky•  13  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Mice, FemaleGalacto-oligosaccharides as protective molecules in the preservation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricusSave to LibraryDownloadby Andrea Gomez-Zavaglia•  16  Cryobiology, Probiotics, Food Microbiology, TemperatureEffects of antioxidants on post-thawed bovine sperm and oxidative stress parameters: Antioxidants protect DNA integrity against cryodamageSave to LibraryDownloadby Mustafa Başpınar•  21  Cryobiology, Oxidative Stress, Cryopreservation, DNA damageEffects of trehalose co-incubation on in vitro matured prepubertal ovine oocyte vitrificationSave to LibraryDownloadby Salvatore Naitana•  16  Cryobiology, Kinetics, Cryopreservation, SheepCryopreservation of cartilage cell and tissue for biobankingSave to LibraryDownloadby Sezen Arat and +1Gaye Cetinkaya•  21  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Endangered Species, Tissue BanksCryoprotectant toxicity neutralizationSave to LibraryDownloadby Gregory Fahy•  17  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Soft Tissue Preservation, HumansApplication of the Kwei equation to model the Tg behavior of binary blends of sugars and saltsSave to LibraryDownloadby Vijayaraghavan Ranganathan and +1Gloria Elliott•  13  Cryobiology, Kinetics, Cryopreservation, HumansOn the sealing of gas-filled glass ampoulesSave to LibraryDownloadby Hewlett Melton•  7  Cryobiology, Glass, Lasers, Medical PhysiologyThe thermodynamic principles of isochoric cryopreservationSave to LibraryDownloadby pedro perez•  14  Cryobiology, Thermodynamics, Cryopreservation, Phase transitionThe network paradigm in organizational research: A review and typologySave to LibraryDownloadby Steve Borgatti•  80  Management, Marketing, Biochemistry, CryobiologyBodies of Lenin: The Hidden Science of Communist Sovereignty"Representations", N. 129, Winter 2015.

Twenty-four ejaculates were collected from four rams and diluted with extenders (1.5% soybean lecithin, 7% glycerol) containing no supplements (control) and cysteamine or ergothioneine (2, 4, 6 or 8mM). Motility by CASA, viability, plasma membrane functionality (HOS test), total abnormality, lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and capacitation status (CTC staining) were assessed after thawing. Using 6mM of either antioxidant improved total motility. Cysteamine at 6mM and ergothioneine at 4 and 6mM improved viability and reduced lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde concentration).

The results indicated that types of sugar significantly influenced motility, motility duration, and viability rates (P<0.05). Glucose, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose provided higher motility compared to the sugar-free control in post-thaw samples. Trehalose provided highest progressive motility duration, and higher viable sperm rates were obtained with all sugar types except xylose. Xylose exhibited the lowest post-thaw progressive motility duration (35.2±1.4s). The mean highest fertilization (78.2±1.4%) and eyed egg rates (94.3±1.5%) were determined using trehalose in the extender, and differences between the treatments in the fertilization and eyeing rates were significant (P<0.05). Finally, the present study showed that sugars, especially maltose and trehalose (disaccharide), improved post-thaw spermatozoa motility and fertility in common carp semen.

Si les pratiques de conservation du vivant à des fins de connaissance sont très anciennes, le développement actuel de la médecine des données massives, personnalisée et de précision, rend indispensable la mise à disposition des chercheur.e.s d’échantillons biologiques standardisés et de haute qualité. Les biobanques ont ainsi acquis au cours des vingt dernières années une importance stratégique considérable.Ce livre propose d’étudier les biobanques en croisant trois perspectives : celle de l’histoire des sciences, afin de comprendre comment les biobanques, tout en s’inscrivant dans l’histoire longue des collections du vivant, s’en démarquent pourtant ; celle de l’épistémologie, afin d’analyser la fabrique des connaissances biomédicales à partir des collections biologiques ; celle enfin de la philosophie des techniques, assumant que les échantillons gagnent à être étudiés comme de véritables objets techniques. Au carrefour de ces trois perspectives, il s’agit d’examiner les enjeux éthiques du biobanking ainsi que les relations inédites qui se nouent entre le vivant et la technique dans la biomédecine contemporaine. Pour cela, les études réunies ici font la part belle aux enquêtes de terrain ainsi qu’aux analyses des professionnels des biobanques.Save to LibraryDownloadby Emanuele Clarizio and +1Céline Cherici•  18  Cryobiology, Epistemology, Philosophy of Technology, History of MedicineEffects of various cryoprotectants on bull sperm quality, DNA integrity and oxidative stress parametersSave to LibraryDownloadby Erdem Coskun•  14  Cryobiology, Oxidative Stress, Cryopreservation, DNACryopreservation of a marine microalga, Nannochloropsis oculata (Eustigmatophyceae)Save to LibraryDownloadby Chin-cheng  Chou and +1Hsien-yu Cheng•  10  Cryobiology, Marine Biology, Cryopreservation, AnimalsTowards new protocols of ovarian tissue cryopreservation assissted by x-ray computed tomographySave to Libraryby Christiani A .

These samples were believed to embody potentially invaluable biological information about genetic ancestry, evolution, microbes, and much more. Today, they persist in freezers as part of a global tissue-based infrastructure. In Life on Ice, Joanna Radin examines how and why these frozen blood samples shaped the practice known as biobanking. The Cold War projects Radin tracks were meant to form an enduring total archive of indigenous blood before it was altered by the polluting forces of modernity. Freezing allowed that blood to act as a time-traveling resource. Radin explores the unique cultural and technical circumstances that created and gave momentum to the phenomenon of life on ice and shows how these preserved blood samples served as the building blocks for biomedicine at the dawn of the genomic age. In an era of vigorous ethical, legal, and cultural debates about genetic privacy and identity, Life on Ice reveals the larger picture—how we got here and the promises and problems involved with finding new uses for cold human blood samples.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joanna Radin•  14  History of Science and Technology, Cryobiology, Evolutionary Biology, Medical AnthropologyWinter is coming: the future of cryopreservationThe preservative effects of low temperature on biological materials have been long recognised, and cryopreservation is now widely used in biomedicine, including in organ transplantation, regenerative medicine and drug discovery.

The lack of organs for transplantation constitutes a major medical challenge, stemming largely from the inability to preserve donated organs until a suitable recipient is found. Here, we review the latest cryopreservation methods and applications. We describe the main challenges-scaling up to large volumes and complex tissues, preventing ice formation and mitigating cryoprotectant toxicity-discuss advantages and disadvantages of current methods and outline prospects for the future of the field.Save to LibraryDownloadby Barry Bentley and +1Alex Murray•  6  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Vitrification, FreezingInfluence of fetuin and hyaluronan on the post-thaw quality and fertilizing ability of Holstein bull semenSave to LibraryDownloadby Pürhan Barbaros Tuncer•  3  Cryobiology, Medical Physiology, Biochemistry and cell biologySurvival of mint shoot tips after exposure to cryoprotectant solution componentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jackie Harris•  8  Cryobiology, Cryopreservation, Medical Physiology, Plant species43.

Cryoprotective agents (CPAs) invariably play key roles in allowing cells to be processed for storage at deep cryogenic Temperatures and to be recovered with high levels of appropriate functionality. As such, these CPA solutes possess a wide range of metabolic and biophysical effects that are both necessary for their modes of action, and potentially complicating for cell biological function. Early successes with cryopreservation were achieved by empirical methodology for choosing and applying CPAs. In recent decades, it has been possible to assemble objective information about CPA modes of action and to optimize their application to living systems, but there still remain significant gaps in our understanding.
