The mafic volcanics are sub-alkaline showing compositional variation from picrobasalt to basalt. They are LREE enriched with (La/Yb)N ratio ranging from 4.67–6.19 (avg.5.27) and exhibit slightly concave REE patterns relative to chondrite. The multi-element patterns of these mafic volcanic rocks display relative enrichment in Th and LREE and negative anomalies of Nb and P. These geochemical characteristics are consistent with a subduction related origin. Various variation diagrams, involving immobile trace elements, distinguish the Hindoli lavas as arc basalt. However, their Ti and Nb contents are higher than those of subduction related magmas. Probably the wedge melting, along with mixing of rising asthenosphere might have produced these characteristics. It is suggested that the Hindoli basin originated by rifting of island- arc lithosphere, caused by rising plume in an extensional back arc region. Based on the results of the present geochemical study, it is proposed that in the early Proterozoic the Mewar block had an active-type continental margin on its present eastern side. The continental magmatic arcs and intra-arc basins developed on this margin were subsequently incorporated into the Mewar protocontinent. Possibly, the plate carrying the Bundelkhand block subducted beneath the eastern margin of the Mewar block, resulting in the final amalgamation of the two blocks along Great Boundary Fault zone or Banas Dislocation Zone. The arc related volcanism of north Indian shield at about 1850–1832 Ma, appears to represent the global subduction event, which resulted in the amalgamation and formation of Columbia supercontinent.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Various chemical characteristics suggest that they are differentiated along the trend similar to that of orogenic suites and have a strong affinity with island arc tholeiites. The field relationships as well as other geological information also support this conclusion and indicate their eruption on a thin continental margin. It is inferred that the Dhanjori volcanics were probably erupted as a result of plate convergence in northern Singhbhum with subduction of oceanic crust below the Singhbhum craton.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Geochemistry of Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of upper Vindhyan Group, southeastern Rajasthan and implications for weathering history, composition and tectonic setting of continental crust in the northern part of Indian shieldJournal of Asian Earth Sciences,  2012Abstract The upper Vindhyan succession of southeastern Rajasthan is divisible into Kaimur, Rewa a... more Abstract The upper Vindhyan succession of southeastern Rajasthan is divisible into Kaimur, Rewa and Bhander Groups. The major and trace element (including rare earth elements) data of the upper Vindhyan shales and sandstones are investigated to determine the weathering history, composition, and tectonic setting of Mesoproterozoic continental crust. CIA (chemical index of alteration) values, A–CN–K plot (A = Al2O3, CN = CaO* + Na2O, K = K2O) and depletion in U, Na2O, CaO, Sr and Ba suggest that the source area experienced moderate to high degree of chemical weathering under warm and humid conditions. Provenance modeling indicates that the Kaimur sandstones are best modeled with a mixture having 40% granitic gneiss, 20% Tonalite–Trondhjemite–Granodiorite (TTG), 20% mafic enclaves and 20% Berach Granite of the Banded Gneissic Complex (BGC). A mixture of 60% granitic gneiss, 20% mafic enclaves and 20% Berach Granite of the BGC can model the Rewa and Bhander Groups. It is suggested that the upper Vindhyan sedimentation commenced at the time of Delhi–Sausar orogeny at about 1100–1000 Ma. The orogenic movements uplifted the parts of old continental crust in the BGC terrain creating positive areas, which exposed older crustal blocks containing TTG as important component. The debris of Kaimur sandstone probably derived from these uplifted blocks. As indicated by Palaeocurrent data, the Rewa and Bhander formations were derived from Bundelkhand Granitic Gneiss Complex (BGGC) occurring to the north of the basin and/or the Chotanagpur Granitic Gneiss Complex (CGGC) of eastern Indian shield. The derivation of Lower and upper groups of Vindhyan succession from different source terrains of identical composition suggests that at the time of Vindhyan sedimentation, the BGC of Rajasthan, the BGGC of Central India and the CGGC of eastern India had similar lithological composition. This implies that well before the origin of the Vindhyan basin these discrete terrains evolved as a single unit that existed as a Mesoarchaean nucleus in the northern part of the Indian shield.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Geochemistry and detrital modes of Proterozoic sedimentary rocks, Bayana Basin, north Delhi fold belt: implications for provenance and source-area weatheringInternational Geology Review,  2012Bayana Basin, sited along the eastern margin of the north Delhi fold belt of the Aravalli Craton,... more Bayana Basin, sited along the eastern margin of the north Delhi fold belt of the Aravalli Craton, contains an ∼3000 m-thick sequence comprising one volcanic and seven sedimentary formations of the Delhi Supergroup. The sedimentary units are the Nithar, Jogipura, Badalgarh, Bayana, Damdama, Kushalgarh, and Weir formations in order of decreasing age. Petrographic study of the sandstones as well as major and trace elements (including rare earth elements) and bulk-rock analyses of the shales and sandstones allow the determination of their provenance, source-rock weathering, and basinal tectonic setting. The sandstones are quartz rich and were derived mainly from exhumed granitoids typical of a craton interior. Geochemical patterns of the sandstones and shales are similar. However, trace element abundances are low in sandstones, probably due to quartz dilution. The coarser clastic Damdama and Weir sandstones, which occur at higher stratigraphic levels, have strikingly low trace element concentrations compared with the underlying Bayana and Badalgarh sandstones. All samples show uniform LREE-enriched patterns with negative Eu-anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.16–0.23) and are similar to those of post-Archaean Australian shales (PAAS). However, the (La/Yb) n ratios (averages 11–18) of all the sedimentary units are higher than those of PAAS, except for the Bayana Sandstone, which has low values (average 6.77). The chemical index of alteration (70–78) and the plagioclase index of alteration (87–97) values and the A–CN–K diagram suggest moderate to intense weathering of the source area.The provenance analyses indicate that basin sedimentation was discontinuous. It received input from a terrain comprising granitoids, mafic rocks, sedimentary sequences, and tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suites. The Nithar and Badalgarh sandstones received input from a source consisting predominantly of granitoids. The succeeding Damdama and Weir sandstones received debris from granitoids and TTG in different proportions. The Kushalgarh shale was possibly derived from a source consisting granites and mafic rocks with a TTG component. The pre-existing sedimentary formations also contributed intermittently during the different phases of sedimentation.Bulk-rock geochemical data suggest Mesoarchaean gneisses and late Archaean granites of BGC/BGGC (Banded Gneissic Complex/Bundelkhand Granitic Gneiss Complex) basement as possible source terrains. These data indicate deposition in a continental rift setting. The coeval formation of many rift-related Proterozoic sedimentary basins in the BGC/BGGC terrain suggests that the North Indian Craton underwent major intracratonic extension during Proterozoic time, probably triggering the break up of Earth's first supercontinent.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
