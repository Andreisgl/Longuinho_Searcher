Louis traces the British Empire from the scramble for Africa, the turbulent imperial history of the Second World War in Asia, and the mid-20th century rush to independence to the Suez crisis, the icon of empire's end. It forms the ideal platform from which to examine the aims and outcome of empire. This authoritative and highly engaging history appears at a time when interest in the history of the British Empire has, ironically, never been stronger, making Ends of British Imperialism a must-read item for both scholar and general reader.  Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewWe haven't found any reviews in the usual places.Selected pagesTitle PageTable of ContentsIndexContentsScrambling out of Africa 1 The Colonial Empires in the Late Nineteenth 35 Sir Percy Andersons Grand 51 The Berlin Congo Conference and the Non 75 Partition of Africa 188485 85 Roger Casement and the Congo 127 E D Morel and the Triumph of the Congo Reform 153 Australia and the German Colonies in the Pacific 185 The Creation of a Client State 503 The Coming of Independence in the Sudan 529 Taxing Transfers of Power in Africa 553 American AntiColonialism Suez and the Special 589 Churchill and Egypt 609 Eden and Suez 627 John Foster 639 British 665 MoreThe Repartition of Africa during the First World War 205 The United States and the Colonial Settlement of 1919 225 The Beginning of the Mandates System of the League 251 British 293 The Critical Phase 194549 339 L S Amery the British 381 The Partitions of India and Palestine 391 Taking the Plunge into Indian Independence 411 The End of the Palestine Mandate 419 DECOLONIZATION 451 Britain and the United 689 Musaddiq Oil and the Dilemmas of British Imperialism 727 The Middle East Crisis of 1958 789 The Origins of the Iraqi Revolution 849 The Withdrawal from the Gulf 877 Robinson and Gallagher and Their Critics 907 The Historiography of the British Empire 955 Sir Keith Hancock the British 999 Index 1029 Copyright LessOther editions - View allEnds of British imperialism: the scramble for empire, Suez and ...William Roger LouisSnippet view - 2006Common terms and phrasesAden administration American Amery Anglo-American Arab Asia Attlee Australia Belgian believed Berlin Bevin Brit Britain British Empire British government Cabinet Casement China Chinese Churchill Colonial Office Commonwealth Communist Conference Confidential Congo Reform Congo Reform Association December decolonization defence diary Dulles E.
