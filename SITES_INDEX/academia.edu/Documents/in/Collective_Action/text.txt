Digital vigilantism involves public denunciations online prompted by intense outrage, which sometimes take a punitive turn. It hinges on two important characteristics of digital media: as a regime of visibility and as a culture of self-regulation. Drawing on both digital ethnography and political sociology, I first provide a more precise definition of what is meant by digital vigilantism, and how it relates to other (non-digital) contexts. I then present a typology based on a number of case studies both in the US and in France, which distinguishes between 4 main forms and identifies the related ‘action repertoires’. Finally, I show how digital vigilantism questions the boundaries of (legitimate) political engagement and provides useful insights concerning the interaction between moral sentiments and political action.Save to LibraryDownloadby Benjamin  Loveluck•  5  Political Participation, Collective Action, Vigilantism, Digital ActivismLa jeunesse casablancaise et les nouvelles formes d’engagementDepuis l’ère coloniale, la jeunesse casablancaise s’est profondément impliquée dans les émeutes à répétition qui ont marqué l’histoire de la ville.

Les jeunes casablancais ont été souvent sur le devant de la scène politique et sociale marocaine. En partant de ce constat, cet article vise à tracer les contours de cette catégorie d’âge dans cette ville métropolitaine et disparate qu’est Casablanca. Nous allons également examiner les différentes formes de modes d’expression, de styles musicaux, de langages, d’actions collectives créées par cette jeunesse comme étant l’histoire d’une « génération » qui a cherché à braver les interdits.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aziz Mechouat•  6  Collective Action, Maroc, Mouvements Sociaux, JeunesseMethodological Individualism, The We-mode, and Team ReasoningSave to LibraryDownloadby Kirk Ludwig•  7  Collective Action, Social Ontology, Collective Intentionality, Methodological Individualism"Stillness, Collaboration and Assisted Movements" M EdwardsIn this essay, I read Puerto Rican pop star Luis Fonsi’s 2017 chart-topping single, “Despacito” (Slowly), as emblematic of dominant global trajectories.

While “slowness” is here equated to maximising the pleasures of heterosexual male desire, it becomes in the remixed version with English-language pop star Justin Bieber a symbol of resistance to colonial endeavours. I identify the objectified female in the original version as a “slow mover” in the remixed track, whose stationary positioning can be read as having revolutionary potential for thinking globalisation anew. I continue to read slowness through the social gatherings and collaborations represented in recent tracks by Gente de Zona and Calle 13 and observe that such examples of restricted movement lead to the formation of global networks of empathy, solidarity, and shared struggle. I argue that the work of Franco-Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux and, in particular, her anthem “Somos sur” (We are South), featuring British-Palestine hip-hopper Shadia Mansour, elaborates on notions of collaboration as it derives a poetics of assisted movement as a strategy for resistance and revolution. The stationary positioning of Fonsi’s female object of desire here becomes a stand against global mobility as she is an imagined part of Tijoux’s support system.Keywords: Pop music, cultural mobility, global circuits, marginal trajectories, disability, assisted movement, collaboration, feminist resistance, Luis Fonsi, Justin Bieber, Gente de Zona, Calle 13, Ana Tijoux, Somos sur, DespacitoSave to LibraryDownloadby Matthew Edwards•  4  Critical Disability Studies, Collective Action, Global South, Cultural CirculationThe many meanings of collective action: lessons on enhancing gender inclusion and equity in watershed managementCollective action in agriculture and natural resource management is all too often perceived of in terms of the mere number of participants, with little consideration given to who participates, why, and the outcomes of inequitable... moreCollective action in agriculture and natural resource management is all too often perceived of in terms of the mere number of participants, with little consideration given to who participates, why, and the outcomes of inequitable participation. The literature is replete with cases of how uncritical approaches to participation structure positions of privilege vis-a-vis project benefits and the natural resource base (Munk Ravnborg and Ashby, 1996; Rocheleau and Edmunds, 1997; Schroeder, 1993). Yet lessons on how to engage with local communities in ways that promote equitable participation of women, the poor and other stakeholders are only now coming to light.

The result is a tentative typology presented roughly historically, which cuts through the many labels typical of current action research. Different approaches are useful, each for different purposes. Still, most circle consciously or subconsciously around some form of "practice" which works as a standard of measurement or quality criterion. The conclusion is that there is a certain sine qua non in the field of action research, i.e. a form "toward which, ways of doing things tend to evolve from a wide variety of starting points".Save to LibraryDownloadby Olav Eikeland•  16  Participatory Action Research, Action Research, Action Research (Indigenous Health), Collective Action125WORKING TOGETHER: FOREST-LINKED SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE ASSOCIATIONS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION DuncanMacqueen,SharmisthaBoseSave to LibraryDownloadby Horst Weyerhaeuser•  2  Collective Action, Small and Medium EnterpriseCommunication, Coherence, and Collective Action The Impact of Hurricane Katrina on Communications InfrastructureSave to LibraryDownloadby Thomas  Haase and +1L.

It describes three generations of researchers; first, the conservative ideas of Garret Hardin, Mancur Olson and Albert W. Tucker, referring to the application of state regulation and privatization of property rights as the only solutions for the management of common pool resources; second, the liberal proposal of Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues, which call for the strengthening of local capacities and self-management, to reach successful models of common pool resources use; and finally, as a research agenda of third generation, the article presents the questioning of Eduardo Araral to the generalization of the policy prescriptions proposed by both currents. The usefulness of these theoretical approaches is visible for regions like the Colombian Amazon, where collective (public and private) property rights prevail, and there is a current debate about the way as common pool resources should be administrated to guarantee the welfare of present and future generations. The analysis of these theoretical approaches is important, because it allows to improve the understanding of the dilemmas faced by local citizens and policy makers. In this sense, the comprehension of these approaches contributes to the regional debate about the models of natural resource management that should be adopted, in order to achieve their sustainable, efficient and equitable use.Save to LibraryDownloadby Revista Mundo Amazónico•  5  Collective Action, Natural Resource Management, Cooperation, Social ControlDo humans possess an autonomous system justification motivation?

Using a novel pupil dilation paradigm to tap cognitive effort, we exposed an ethnic minority group (Ntotal = 263) to depictions of their ingroup as disadvantaged or advantaged after they had stated four things they liked about their ethnic group (strong group identity salience) or grandmother (weak group identity salience). We then measured fluctuations in their pupil diameter as they contemplated support for societal systems that were either relevant (high dependency) or irrelevant (low dependency) to their ethnic group. Results revealed that pupil sizes were larger in the group disadvantage condition than in the group advantage condition—indicating greater cognitive effort—but only when group identity was salient (Experiment 1) or when group identification was strong (Experiment 2). These effects occurred only for high dependency systems. Combined, this evidence contradicts the system-justification thesis, and questions the existence of an autonomous system justification motivation in humans.Save to LibraryDownloadby Chuma Owuamalam•  11  Sociology, Collective Behavior, Social Psychology, Political PsychologyForging a 'new'organizational infrastructure for Los Angeles' progressive communitySave to LibraryDownloadby Walter  Nicholls•  6  Economics, Collective Action, Urban And Regional Planning, Political SystemEvil Matters: A Philosophical InquiryThis book is an inquiry into particular matters concerning the nature, normativity, and aftermath of evil action.

It combines philosophical conceptual analysis with empirical studies in psychology and discussions of historical events to provide an innovative analysis of evil action.The book considers unresolved questions belonging to metaethical, normative, and practical characteristics of evil action. It begins by asking whether Kant’s historical account of evil is still relevant for contemporary thinkers. Then it addresses features of evil action that distinguish it from mundane wrongdoing, thereby placing it as a proper category of philosophical inquiry. Next, the author inquires into how evil acts affect moral relationships and challenge Strawsonian accounts of moral responsibility. He then draws conceptual and empirical connections between evil acts such as genocide, torture, and slavery and collective agency, and asks why evil acts are often collective acts. Finally, the author questions both the possibility and propriety of forgiveness and vengeance in the aftermath of evil and discusses how individuals ought to cope with the pervasiveness of evil in human interaction.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zachary Goldberg•  4  Collective Action, Vulnerability, Philosophy of Evil, Moral ResponsibilityWriting work, technology, and pedagogy in the era of late capitalismSave to LibraryDownloadby Tony Scott•  5  Critical Theory, Collective Action, Technical Writing, Emerging TechnologyThe antiabortion movement and symbolic crusades: Reappraisal of a popular theorySave to LibraryDownloadby D.

These threats are very likely to have substantial impacts on marine ecosystems and on terrestrial species that depend on the oceans (e.g. human beings). To prevent the most dramatic consequences of such changes to the climate, citizens need to take collective actions. In that respect, education is a key factor to increase our awareness and understanding of climate change. Within the educational project Inquiry-to-Insight (I2I) we have developed, implemented, and tested Information Communication Technology (ICT) tools addressing the climate change issue with high school students. One such tool that we have developed is an open access virtual animation and laboratory on ocean acidification (OA). This tool allows students to improve their background knowledge of OA and to become virtual scientists, conducting and analysing research on the effect of ocean acidity on a key and well known marine organism: sea urchin. Our results from a pilot study in two high schools in Sweden and California indicate that the OA I2I activities in particular, and other I2I tools in general, increase students’ awareness and understanding of OA.Save to LibraryDownloadby geraldine fauville•  15  Climate Change, Open Access, Carbon Dioxide, Collective Action"The Empirical Case for Streamlining the NLRB Certification Process: The Role of Date of Unfair Labor Practice Occurrence"The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has long advocated reducing the time period between the filing of a petition to form a union and union certification elections.

This ISERP Working Paper shows that despite this objective there have been virtually no elections in the first 20 days after a petition is filed, while in the past two years there has been a slight increase in the number of elections held within 21 to 30 days of the petition. The study demonstrates the relationship between the petition date, election date and when the most serious employer opposition and intimidation occurs and concludes that the NLRB should streamline the certification process to reduce the number of days between petition and election.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kate Bronfenbrenner•  11  Industrial And Labor Relations, Collective Bargaining (Industrial And Labor Relations), Collective Action, Labor PoliticsNatural Resource Rights and Biodiversity Protection: Guidelines for Policy and Strategies to strengthen Local Governance SystemsIt has long been recognised that the ownership of a resource largely influences the way that the resource is used and managed for future use.

The definition of property rights as &quot;the capacity to call upon the collective to stand behind one&apos;s claim to a benefit stream ” emphasizes quality of the relationship between the right holder and the institution that backs the claim. Regardless of legal and institutional form for decentralization, a primary trend at present in natural resource management is to reconcile legality provided by the state with the legitimacy provided by local institutions for the administration of resource tenure – as a yardstick for genuine subsidiarity. Whereas collective action (or at least organizations) for resource management have been recognized as important in many devolution programs, the role of “property rights ” per se has often not been given the same attention, yet ownership (tenure) is a common avenue to authority over resources. 2 1.Save to Libraryby Margaret A Rugadya•  6  Property Rights, Collective Action, Land tenure, Natural Resource ManagementThe iCASS Platform: Nine principles for landscape conservation designThe Anthropocene presents society with a super wicked problem comprised of multiple contingent and conflicting issues driven by a complex array of change agents.

Super wicked problems cannot be adequately addressed using siloed decision-making approaches developed by hierarchical institutions using science that is compartmentalized by discipline. Adaptive solutions will rest on human ingenuity that fosters transformation towards sustainability. To successfully achieve these objectives, conservation and natural resource practitioners need a paradigm that transcends single-institution interests and decision-making processes. We propose a platform for an emerging and evolutionary step change in sustainability planning: landscape conservation design (LCD). We use existing governance and adaptation planning principles to develop an iterative, flexible innovation systems framework—the " iCASS Platform. " It consists of nine principles and five attributes—innovation, convening stakeholders, assessing current and plausible future landscape conditions, spatial design, and strategy design. The principles are organized around four cornerstones of innovation: people, purpose, process, and product. The iCASS Platform can facilitate LCD via processes that aim to create and empower social networks , foster stakeholder involvement, engender co-production and cross-pollination of knowledge, and provide multiple opportunities for deliberation, transparency, and collaborative decision-making. Our intention is to pivot from single-institution, siloed assessment and planning to stakeholder-driven, participatory design, leading to collaborative decision-making and extensive landscape conservation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rob  Campellone and +1Daniel Shively•  9  Landscape Ecology, Conservation Biology, Collective Action, Strategic PlanningAdvocacy for the Protection of Women and Children against Domestic Violence through a Community Constituent GroupStudi kasus di desa penelitian yang terletak di Kabupaten Lombok Timur ini berfokus kepada advokasi perlindungan perempuan dan anak terkait isu kekerasan dalam rumah tangga.

Kelompok ini beranggotakan laki-laki dan perempuan, serta terbentuk untuk mendukung proses advokasi di desa dalam beberapa isu, khususnya bagi perempuan. Salah satunya adalah dengan menanggapi norma sosial yang menyebabkan adanya pemakluman kekerasan yang terjadi terhadap perempuan di desa, baik kekerasan fisik, ekonomi, maupun psikologis.

Nevertheless, several difficulties can arise to sustain these small businesses. The conversion of organic material into compost requires labor, tools and infrastructure. Many poor and rural microenterprises cannot afford all of these inputs to sustain operations. Literature suggests that social capital and collective action can address challenges related to limited resources for communities and small businesses. Little research, however, has explored how coworker characteristics and their cooperative efforts affect the financial sustainability of compost micro-enterprises. The objective of this study was to unveil whether rural compost microenterprises use social capital and/or collective action to address various challenges related to natural and financial capital, and if so, in what manner. A multisite case study framework was implemented using participant observation to identify common challenges faced by compost microenterprises in Chimaltenanago, Guatemala. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine if coworker characteristics (related to social capital) addressed these challenges, and if so, how. Four characteristics related to social capital emerged from a thematic analysis, including 1) raw material access based on coworker occupation, 2) overhead savings from human capital, 3) credit/market-entry granted from social networks, and 4) consumer trust gained from social capital/gender. It appears the investigation and development of compost microenterprises should be more cognizant of opportunities related to coworker characteristics, especially those related to social capital and collective action. As a result, management training can be integrated within entrepreneurship development to sustain urban and rural economies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Timothy Silberg and +1Leonardo Lombardini•  6  Collective Action, Social Capital, Institutions, GuatemalaHIGH- AND LOW-RISK ACTIVISM: DIFFERENTIAL PARTICIPATION IN A REFUGEE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENTThis article presents a quantitative study of differential participation in low- and high-risk activism in the Danish refugee solidarity movement.

Distinguishing between low- and high-risk activism, it shows the fruitfulness of combining what are often considered competing theoretical explanations related to (1) values, (2) microstructures, and (3) emotions. We analyze data from a unique survey of 1,856 respondents recruited via Facebook. The results show that low- and high-risk participation strongly correlate but are influenced by different factors. For low-risk activities, the most important factors are emotional reactions, structural availability, and predispositions in the form of basic human values. For high-risk activity, the important factors are prior history of activism and emotional reaction. Values, microstructures, and emotions interact in relation to participation in both kinds of activism, which points to promising avenues for integrating and developing the theoretical framework of differential participation and recruitment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jonas Toubøl•  15  Sociology, Political Sociology, Values, ImmigrationNew Movements and Transnational actorsBACHELOR'S DEGREE IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Course 2018-2019.

What motivates people to become solidary with groups to which they do not belong originally? Here, we demonstrate that such distant solidarity can occur when the perceived treatment of an out-group clashes with one's political beliefs (e.g., for Leftists, oppressive occupation of the out-group) and that it is driven by fusion (or a feeling of oneness) with distant others with whom one does not share any common social category such as nationality, ethnicity or religion. In Study 1, being politically Left-ist predicted European-Americans' willingness to engage in extreme protest on behalf of Palestinians, which was mediated by fusion with the out-group. Next, in Study 2, we examined whether this pattern was moderated by out-group type. Here, Norwegian Leftists fused more with Palestinians (i.e., a group that, in the Norwegian context, is perceived to be occupied in an asymmetrical conflict) rather than Kurds (i.e., a group for which this perception is less salient). In Study 3, we experimentally tested the underlying mechanism by framing the Kurdish conflict in terms of an asymmetrical occupation (vs. symmetrical war or control conditions) and found that this increased Leftist European-Americans' fusion with Kurds. Finally, in Study 4, we used a unique sample of non-Kurdish aspiring foreign fighters who were in the process of joining the Kurdish militia YPG. Here, fusion with the out-group predicted a greater likelihood to join and support the Kurdish forces in their fight against ISIS, insofar as respondents experienced that their political orientation morally compelled them to do so (Study 4). Together, our findings suggest that politically motivated fusion with out-groups underpins the extreme solidary action people may take on behalf of distant out-groups. Implications for future theory and research are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lotte Thomsen and +2Jonas KunstMaor  Shani•  6  Social Psychology, Political Psychology, Collective Action, Political Violence and TerrorismClimate Change Opportunity and Corporate ResponsesClimate change challenges also present opportunities for influencing related regulations and Government intervention and creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in individual corporate and collaborative responses to break free of... moreClimate change challenges also present opportunities for influencing related regulations and Government intervention and creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in individual corporate and collaborative responses to break free of constraints, help people to benefit and cope and achieve sustainable growth.

The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of social stigma experiences reported by patients with schizophrenia and by people with other health problems. Method. The stigma subscale of the Consumer Experiences of Stigma Questionnaire (CESQ) was administered to patients with schizophrenia (n=153), recurrent depression (n=31), drug dependence (n=30), alcohol dependence (n=39), hematological malignancies (n=31), or cardiovascular disorders (n=33). Results. Multiple regression analysis showed that schizophrenia patients experienced stigmatization signifi cantly more often than did respondents diagnosed with hematological malignancies or cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia were found to experience stigma at a level similar to that in patients with depression or alcohol dependence, but lower than that experienced by drug addicts. Conclusions. The study fi ndings confi rm that the stigma of schizophrenia is stronger than that associated with physical illnesses. However, people with schizophrenia were not found to experience stigmatization more often than people with other severe mental disorders.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paweł Grygiel•  20  Social Change, Health Promotion, Social epidemiology, StigmaFrom prejudice reduction to collective action: Two psychological models of social change (and how to reconcile themIn order to understand when and why social change occurs, we must first understand the psychological processes that lead people to act in ways that sustain or challenge the status quo.

This chapter discusses two psychological models ofsocial change: a prejudice reduction model, focused on getting people to like oneanother more, and a collective action model, focused on political mobilization.Recent research on these models has highlighted some fundamental – and somewould say irreconcilable - points of tension between them. Our chapter not onlyexplores this emerging debate, but also proposes a resolution that seeks totranscend a simple ‘prejudice reduction versus collective action’ formulation. Weargue that the efficacy of any psychological model of change is contextuallycontingent. This means that generic frameworks for understanding change must becomplemented by historical and sociological analysis of local patterns ofdiscrimination. In certain contexts, prejudice reduction may improve intergrouprelations, notably by encouraging the historically advantaged to treat others better.In other contexts, the project of getting us to like one another more may distractfrom, or even impede, the more important project of mobilizing the disadvantagedto challenge the status quo.Save to LibraryDownloadby Huseyin Cakal•  5  Social Change, Collective Action, Intergroup Relations, Intergroup ContactDE L'ALTERMONDIALISME AUX INDIGNÉSLes altermondialistes et les indignés ont déployé une culture militante « alteractiviste » dans laquelle la démocratie est une revendication centrale mais aussi - et avant tout - un ensemble de pratiques et une exigence personnelle.

Tous combinent une grande sensibilité aux défis globaux avec une forte dimension subjective de l’engagement et une volonté de l’ancrer au niveau local. Sensibles aux enjeux globaux (inégalités, migrations, environnement…), ils développent la plupart de leurs initiatives au niveau local, notamment à travers les multiples initiatives « pour une transition écologique », marquant de leur empreinte le renouveau des mouvements écologistes et conviviaux (réseaux alimentaires alternatifs, simplicité volontaire, consommation critique, justice climatique…).

It is argued that such intense rituals enhance social cohesion and promote cooperative behaviors (Atran & Henrich, 2010; Durkheim, 1912). However, direct evidence for the relation between ritual intensity and prosociality is lacking.

The following comments aim to highlight the existence of a specific mode of regulation of collective action, strategic territorial management. One of its main characteristics is precisely to rely on the articulation of a series of cognitive processes in the design and implementation of territorial development projects. The framework of this approach is the elaboration of strategic projects which are both the melting pot of the synergy of regional players and the result of this collective dynamic. This elaboration is an essentially cognitive and transactional process, the effectiveness of which is directly dependent on the degree of collective intelligence of the territory. RésuméAujourd'hui, le développement des territoires repose largement sur l'intelligence collective. Les propos qui suivent s'attachent à mettre en lumière l'existence d'un mode spécifique de régulation de l'action collective, le management territorial stratégique. Une de ses principales caractéristiques est précisément de s'appuyer sur l'articulation d'une série de processus cognitifs dans la conception et la mise en œuvre de projets territoriaux de développement. Ce processus a pour cadre la démarche de projet qui est à la fois le creuset de la mise en synergie des acteurs du territoire, dans leur diversité, et le résultat de cette dynamique collective. Son élaboration est un processus essentiellement cognitif et transactionnel, dont l’efficacité est directement fonction du degré d'intelligence collective du territoire.Save to LibraryDownloadby michel casteigts•  9  Development Studies, Collective Intelligence, Collective Action, Local Government and Local DevelopmentSocial Norms and Behavior in the Local Commons as Seen Through the Lens of Field ExperimentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Henk  Folmer and +1Juan-Camilo  Cardenas•  9  Collective Action, Applied Economics, Field Experiment, Social NormStudents in Revolt:  The Pedagogical Potential of Student Collective Action in the Age of the Corporate UniversityThis article examines how contemporary student movements are disrupting, opposing and displacing entrenched oppressive and dehumanizing reforms, practices and frames in today’s corporate academia.

This work is divided in four sections. The first is an introduction to student movements and an overview of how student political action has been approached and researched. The second and third sections take a closer look at the repertoires of contention used by contemporary student movements and proposes a framework based on radical praxis, which allows us to better understand the pedagogical potential of student disruptive action. The last section contains a series of examples of students’ repertoires or tactics of contention that exemplify the pedagogical potential of student social and political action.Save to LibraryDownloadby E.
