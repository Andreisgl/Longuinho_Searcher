Permo-Triassic stratigraphy of the pelagonian zone in central Evia Island (Greece)Eclogae Geologicae Helvetiae,  2001A new subdivision of the pre-Jurassic Pelagonian Units in central Evia island is proposed: these ... more A new subdivision of the pre-Jurassic Pelagonian Units in central Evia island is proposed: these units are represented by syn- and post rift sequences, separated by a volcano-sedimentary episode. The syn-rift sequences comprise Permian siliciclastic sediments in Verrucano tectofacies. (Ano Mavropoulon Formation) and a small carbonate platform (Zigos Limestones) developed from the Permian to the Middle Anisian. The Ano Mavropoulon Fm. is subdivided into three members: - the lower member (Permian s.l. lying on the basement and characterised by medium-coarse clastic terrigenous sedimentation; - the middle member (Late Permian) Koprises limestones, made up of shallow-water limestones: - the upper member (Latest Permian-Early Triassic) comprising clastic terrigenous and minor reworked carbonate sediments. A regional unconformity (earliest Triassic) separates the Zigos Lm. from the top of the Ano Mavropoulon Fm.

The sedimentary sequences occurring in northern Evia are overlaying the Variscan metaplutonic and metasedimentary rocks of Edipsos, Aghios and Rovies regions attributed to the Pelagonian basement (Vavassis et al. 2001). They are of Late Permian to Middle Triassic age and, in many cases, younger rocks underlay older lithologies, so that all formations are folded together or imbricated. The sedimentological characters and age of northern Evia carbonates display strong similarities with Upper Paleozoic formations from other places in Greece (i.e. Hydra, Skyros, Othrys, Attica, Salamine, Cyclades, Peloponnesus, Crete, Lesbos, Chios). There, Carboniferous and mainly Permian carbonates, crop out within the siliciclastic beds occurring at the base of the Mesozoic neritic platform of the internal Pelagonian domain.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

T... more A new tectonic and stratigraphie subdivision of the pre-Jurassic Pelagonian Units is presented. Two key areas are investigated in the northern and central Evia island. The northern part is characterized by rather large outcrops of Variscan basement forming severa! tectonic units. The sedimentary caver consists of detritic beds of Verrucano type, with sorne late Permian marine incursions, followed by early to middle Triassic platform carbonates. The middle Triassic is also represented by a volcano-clastic sequence. In one tectonic unit, the metamorphic basement is directly overlain by a turbiditic sequence comprising on! y la te Permian carbonate olistoliths. In the central Evia three main units have been distinguished on the base of new paleontological data and field observations: (1) the Seta Unit, (2) the volcano sedimentary sequence and (3) the Liri Unit. The Seta Unit presents small outcrops of granitic basement followed by a sedimentary caver of Permian to middle Triassic in ag...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
