What do people do at Wikimania?

Wikimania attracts Wikimedia project participants from around the world, including writers, editors, programmers, and photographers; Wikimedia Foundation staff; and members of the 40+ country-based Wikimedia chapters. Many  researchers also attend and present. Attendance has ranged from 380 to 2,000 people, with representation from more than 80 countries. The conference is typically held on a different continent each year, and has taken place in thirteen countries on five continents to date.
Wikimania is organized by local volunteer teams, with support from international volunteers, the Wikimedia Foundation and other sponsors. The conference's location is determined by an international jury of community members, who review location bids submitted by teams from different locations. Guidelines for interested communities who wish to host Wikimania, and information about past bids, can be found below.
The conference program consists of presentations and workshops from community members, speakers from related projects, and wiki researchers, as well as social activities and informal discussions. Some formal research is presented, in addition to "best practice" knowledge sharing and presentations of ongoing work. Wikimania also features formal reports from Wikimedia Foundation board members and staff, renowned keynote speakers, and opportunities to interact with dedicated Wikimedia contributors from all around the world.

Future Wikimanias
Most generally, the decision in where to hold the conference is based proposals that are vetted by the WMF and Wikimania Committee. The WMF Event Manager works closely with interested people and groups in exploring that possibilities and drafting a proposal. There has also been a strong effort in the past to ensure that conference locations are distributed fairly evenly around the globe from year to year.
The Wikimania Steering Committee runs the selection of venue several years in advance. The location is rotated around areas of the world.
Historically the selection of the venue was done using bids and a jury; this was scrapped in 2015.[1]
