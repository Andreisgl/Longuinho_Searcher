In this sense, one has to face the problem of identifying the origin and distribution of spatial variability patterns (Brouder et al., 2001; Millán et al., 2012). The objective of the present work was to quantify the spatial structure of soil penetrometer resistance (PR) collected from a transect data consisted of 221 points equidistant. In each sampling, readings were obtained from 0 cm till 70 cm of depth, with an interval of 5 cm (Pérez, 2012). The study was conducted on a Vertisol (Typic Hapludert) dedicated to sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) production during the last sixty years (Pérez et al., 2010).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Para evitarlo, una vez descartada la posible contaminación por metales pesados, debemos conocer el nivel de nitrógeno asimilable del suelo antes de la siembra y, sobre esta base, establecer la dosis óptima de purín. En este trabajo se hace una revisión de los métodos seguidos para determinar las dosis óptimas de fertilizantes nitrogenados y, en consecuencia, de purín. Mediante el procedimiento de electroultrafiltración (EUF), y basándonos en experimentos de campo con diversos cultivos, se presentan algunas alternativas para estimar el nitrógeno asimilable del suelo, con objeto de optimizar la dosificación de purines de cerdo en orden a minimizar las pérdidas de nitrato por lixiviación.

Weather extremes resulting from climate change are projected to increase, making crop production more vulnerable and ultimately threatening food security. A continuing effort to develop scientific knowledge in climate and agriculture will help to manage risks and opportunities in these fields. This special issue of Climate Research represents a collection of studies that contribute to the general understanding of weather-related risks and climate impacts on agricultural systems.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Assessment of soil nitrogen variability related to N doses applied through fertirrigation systemThe knowledge of water and nitrogen dynamics in soils under drip irrigation and fertilizer applic... more The knowledge of water and nitrogen dynamics in soils under drip irrigation and fertilizer application is essential to optimizing water and nitrogen management. Recent studies of water and nitrogen distribution in the soil under drip irrigation focus on water and inorganic nitrogen distribution around the drip emitters. Results of the studies are not verified with field experimental data. Reasons might include difficulties in obtaining field experimental data under irrigation and nitrogen fertilization [1]. N is an element which produces a stronger crop response, accelerates vegetative growth, plant development and yield increase. Accumulation and redistribution of N within the soil varies depending on management practices, soil characteristics, and growing season precipitation. Soil N high content at post-harvest is usually provided as evidence that N fertilizer had been applied in excess. The aim of this study is to characterize mineral N distribution in the soil profile measured ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Discussion about decision support systems using continuous multi-criteria methods for planning in areas with hydro-basins, agriculture and forests, from examples in ArgentineABSTRACT The authors were involved last years in projects considering diverse decision problems o... more ABSTRACT The authors were involved last years in projects considering diverse decision problems on the use of some regions in Argentine, and also related to rivers or rural services in them. They used sets of multi-criteria decision methods, first discrete when the problem included few distinct alternatives, such as e.g. forestry, traditional or intensive agriculture. For attributes they were different effects, classified then in environmental, economic and social criteria. Extending to other gentler areas, such as at South of the Province of Córdoba, Arg., they have balanced more delicately effects of continuous levels of actions, with a combination of Goal Programming linked methods, and they adopted compromises to have precise solutions. That has shown, and in part open, a line of research, as the setting of such models require various kinds of definitions and valuations, including optimizations, goals with penalties in deviations and restrictions. That can be in diverse detail level and horizon, in presence of various technical and human horizons, and that can influence politics of use of terrain and production that will require public and private agents. The research will consider consideration of use and conservation of soils, human systems and agro productions, and hence models for optimization, preferably in such Goal Programming ways. That will require considering various systems of models, first in theory to be reliable, and then in different areas to evaluate the quality of conclusions, and maybe that successively if results are found advantageous. The Bayesian ways will be considered, but they would require a prospective of sets of precise future states of nature or markets with elicited probabilities, which are neither evident nor decisive for the moment, as changes may occur in years but will be very unexpected or uncertain. The results will be lines of models to aid to establish policies of use of territories, by public agencies setting frames for private agents of different size and kinds, with different horizons of climatic and human changes. The usable models will depend somehow on the type of areas, which have different climates and soils, population, markets and maybe civilizations, starting with Argentine examples, if possible compared in cases with Spain.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Prediction in cases with superposition of different hydrological phenomena, such as from weatherABSTRACT The authors have been involved in Model Codes for Construction prior to Eurocodes now Eu... more ABSTRACT The authors have been involved in Model Codes for Construction prior to Eurocodes now Euronorms, and in a Drainage Instruction for Roads for Spain that adopted a prediction model from BPR (Bureau of Public Roads) of USA to take account of evident regional differences in Iberian Peninsula and Spanish Isles, and in some related studies. They used Extreme Value Type I (Gumbell law) models, with independent actions in superposition; this law was also adopted then to obtain maps of extreme rains by CEDEX. These methods could be extrapolated somehow with other extreme values distributions, but the first step was useful to set valid superposition schemas for actions in norms. As real case, in East of Spain rain comes usually extensively from normal weather perturbations, but in other cases from &amp;amp;quot;cold drop&amp;amp;quot; local high rains of about 400mm in a day occur, causing inundations and in cases local disasters. The city of Valencia in East of Spain was inundated at 1,5m high from a cold drop in 1957, and the river Turia formerly through that city was just later diverted some kilometers to South in a wider canal. With Gumbell law the expected intensity grows with time for occurrence, indicating a value for each given &amp;amp;quot;return period&amp;amp;quot;, but the increasing speed grows with the &amp;amp;quot;annual dispersion&amp;amp;quot; of the Gumbell law, and some rare dangerous events may become really very possible in periods of many years. That can be proved with relatively simple models, e.g. with Extreme Law type I, and they could be made more precise or discussed. Such effects were used for superposition of actions on a structure for Model Codes, and may be combined with hydraulic effects, e.g. for bridges on rivers. These different Gumbell laws, or other extreme laws, with different dispersion may occur for marine actions of waves, earthquakes, tsunamis, and maybe for human perturbations, that could include industrial catastrophes, or civilization wars if considering historical periods.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Monitoring the soil degradation by Metastatistical AnalysisThe effectiveness of fractal toolbox to capture the critical behavior of soil structural patterns... more The effectiveness of fractal toolbox to capture the critical behavior of soil structural patterns during the chemical and physical degradation was documented by our numerous experiments (Oleschko et al., 2008 a; 2008 b). The spatio-temporal dynamics of these patterns was measured and mapped with high precision in terms of fractal descriptors. All tested fractal techniques were able to detect the statistically significant differences in structure between the perfect spongy and massive patterns of uncultivated and sodium-saline agricultural soils, respectively. For instance, the Hurst exponent, extracted from the Chernozem ´ micromorphological images and from the time series of its physical and mechanical properties measured in situ, detected the roughness decrease (and therefore the increase in H- from 0.17 to 0.30 for images) derived from the loss of original structure complexity. The combined use of different fractal descriptors brings statistical precision into the quantification ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The increasing of agricultural activities in new areas previously with forestry or pasture could produce irreversible environmental impacts. It is necessary to prepare a spatial plan taking into consideration, economic development, social cohesion, environmental quality and progressive desertification. Multicriteria decision models contribute to the elaboration of that plan and provide an inestimable aid to decision makers. The objective of this paper is to elaborate a multicriteria model applied to the La Colacha Basin (Cordoba-Argentine).
