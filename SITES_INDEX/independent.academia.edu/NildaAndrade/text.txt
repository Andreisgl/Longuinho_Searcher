Fresh lasagna pasta was produced with and without potassium sorbate and acondicionated in high O 2 barrier bags containing a O2 - absorber sachet in the head-space. Three treatments were obtained: pasta with potassium sorbate, pasta without potassium sorbate packed with sachet and pasta without potassium sorbate packed without sachet. In all treatments, the pasta were vacuum packed, randomly distributed at temperature of 10±2ºC and microbiologically evaluated for molds and yeast, Staphylococcus spp, total coliforms and Escherichia coli countings. All the treatments were effective in inhibiting the growth of the microorganisms evaluated during 30 storage days. The treatment using O2-absorber in the pasta without preservative, inhibition of 1 and 1.5 logarithmic cycles was observed for the molds and yeasts and Staphylococcus spp, respectively. No differences were observed among treatments for coliforms countings.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Increased presevation of sliced mozzarella cheese by antimibrobial sachet incorporated with allyl isothiocyanateBrazilian Journal of Microbiology,  2009There is an increasing tendency to add natural antimicrobials of plant origin into food. The obje... more There is an increasing tendency to add natural antimicrobials of plant origin into food. The objective of this work was to develop a microbial sachet incorporated with allyl isothiocyanate (AIT), a volatile compound of plant origin, and to test its efficiency against growth of yeasts and molds, Staphylococcus sp. and psychrotrophic bacteria on sliced mozzarella cheese. Another objective was to quantify the concentration of AIT in the headspace of cheese packaging. A reduction of 3.6 log cycles was observed in yeasts and molds counts in the mozzarella packed with the antimicrobial sachet over 15-day storage time. The sachet also showed an antibacterial effect on Staphylococcus sp., reducing 2.4 log cycles after 12-day storage. Psychrotrophic bacteria species were the most resistant to the antimicrobial action. The highest concentration of AIT (0.08µg.mL-1) inside the active packaging system was observed at the 6-day of storage at 12 ºC ± 2 ºC. At the end of the storage time, AIT concentration decreased to only 10% of the initial concentration. Active packaging containing antimicrobial sachet has a potential use for sliced mozzarella, with molds and yeasts being the most sensitive to the antimicrobial effects.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Polydiacetylene (PDA) is an ideal choice for use as a sensor due to its unique optical properties. PDA molecules can form thin films or vesicles that change color from deep blue to red in response to different stimuli, like temperature, pH, and the presence of biological molecules. PDA films and vesicles have been proven to be promising devices for the detection of bacteria and bacterial toxins. Langmuir troughs (for films) and microcalorimetry (for vesicles) are among the many techniques used to characterize PDA films and vesicles. In order to enable more applications of PDA films, it is imperative to elucidate and gain a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions associated with their color change. In addition, it is necessary to transfer the PDA film onto a solid support like plastic in order to incorporate PDA biosensors into an intelligent packaging system. Through the use of such a system, consumers can monitor food quality, thereby preventing foodborne outbreaks. In this review, we discuss the formation of PDA films and vesicles, their characteristics, and their potential applications as biosensors. The possibility to incorporate PDA biosensors into an intelligent packaging system to be used in the food industry is also explored.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The antimicrobial efficacy, the hydrophobicity, microscopic and the mechanical characteristics of the films, as well free energy of adhesion between bacteria and antimicrobial films were evaluated. It was observed that both polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with the antimicrobial were homogeneous. Furthermore, the addition of triclosan did not affect mechanical characteristics of the films (P > 0.05). However, triclosan incorporated into polyethylene films reduced its hydrophobicity while antimicrobial cellulose based films became more hydrophobic. The adhesion was thermodynamically favorable between tested bacteria and polyethylene films. On the other hand, the adhesion to triclosan cellulose based film was thermodynamically unfavorable to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and favorable to Listeria innocua and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polyethylene and cellulose based films showed inhibitory effect against S. aureus and E. coli, being the inhibition halo higher for polyethylene films.

The number of manufactured foods has widely increased to meet the increasing number of consumers and sometimes the hygiene procedures in the food industry are poor or overlooked. It is essential that those responsible for producing food be knowledgeable about the characteristics of the material surfaces used to make the equipment, utensils and conveyors to help in the control of foodborne diseases. The viable alternatives to avoid or minimize food contamination are (1) improving surface quality related to microtopography by improving surface production process; (2) choosing surfaces with better characteristics concerning microtopography to control the adherence process and biofilm formation; and (3) implementing effective controls of cleaning and sanitizing procedures.This research shows important information for people dealing with food quality control, quality management, risk assessment, risk management hazard analysis by critical point control and good manufacturing practices, which are well-recognized food safety tools.

Film efficacies were evaluated in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 15313, Penicillium sp. and Geotrichum sp. The films were also evaluated on sliced mozzarella cheese against moulds and yeasts, Staphylococcus sp. and psychrotrophic bacteria. Mechanical and microscopic properties of the films and the diffusion of the antimicrobial agents from the film to the cheese were also evaluated. Films containing NI showed an antimicrobial effect in vitro against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, while films containing NA were effective in vitro against Penicillium sp. and Geotrichum sp. By the ninth day of storage at 12 ± 2°C, the count of yeasts and moulds on cheese covered with films containing NA decreased 2 log10 units compared with the count on cheese with control films. NI film did not show an effect against Staphylococcus sp., but it was effective against psychrotrophic bacteria for 6 days of storage of the cheese. The incorporation of antimicrobial compounds decreased the resistance and elongation of the films and caused changes in their molecular conformation. NI diffusion from the films to the cheese was not detected; however, time-dependent diffusion of NA from the film containing NI + NA was measured. The incorporation of NI and NA together in the films did not show an effect. The film containing NA showed potential for application as active food packaging for sliced mozzarella cheese.

The surfaces include marble, granite, stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, and silicone-coated cloth, which have been used only in a few studies concerning bacterial adherence. The number of cells adhered to the surfaces increased with contact time reaching 5.0-6.1 log CDM.cm-2 after 10 hours, which can be considered a well established adherence process. The number of adhered cells doubled in 29.5 minutes and 23.5 minutes on stainless steel and thin polyvinyl chloride-coated cloth, respectively. For the other surfaces, this value was 9.8 minutes on average. Marble, granite, thick polyvinyl-coated cloth, double-faced rugous polyurethane, and silicone-coated cloth were not different (p < 0.05) in their ability to adhere cells (CFU/cm2) after 2 and 10 hours. The surfaces that had higher percentage of similarity in the adhesion level and higher log CFU/cm2 of adhered cells were double-faced rugous polyurethane, silicone-coated cloth, and granite. The surfaces showed very different microtopography characteristics when viewed using scanning electron microscopy. This experiment showed the importance of using appropriate materials for food contact during processing, which will affect the cleaning and sanitation procedures.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Surfaces of a raw milk transportation tank, a raw milk cooling storage tank, an equalization pasteurizing tank, a pasteurized milk storage tank and a pasteurized milk packaging tank, as well as a milk centrifuge were evaluated. The Relative Light Unit (RLU) using a commercial luminometer and mesophilic aerobic counts (CFU.cm-2) on surfaces were determined. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in RLU on the assessed surfaces before and after the cleaning and sanitizing procedures. Also, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) in CFU.cm-2 on the surfaces before the cleaning and sanitizing procedures, whereas different bacterial numbers were found on surfaces after the hygiene procedures. The surfaces of the milk centrifuge, raw milk cooling tank and milk packaging tank showed the largest mesophilic aerobic numbers after the hygiene, reaching 2.21, 2.18, and 1.21 log10, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is no agreement among the techniques for classification of hygienic conditions of the evaluated surfaces, showing a non-direct relation between RLU and CFU.cm-2. The ATP-bioluminescence method showed that 100% of the surfaces were under inadequate hygiene conditions, while the plate count method detected only 50%, based on the APHA's recommendation, and 33%, based on the WHO's recommendation. High variations in RLU measurements were observed, suggesting the need for more than only one surface analysis. The ATP-bioluminescence is not a direct replacement for microbiological testing, but provides complementary information and should be used as part of an integrated strategy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The EP results showed a significant difference (p<0.05) among the microorganism species interactions, the surfaces and the contact time. The number of adhered cells on the chip surfaces increased as contact time increased and the number of L. innocua or S. aureus on the surface of SS, PC and PP chips reached 1.0x105 CFU/cm2 after 12 h of contact, in both methods. The CP method showed a better sensitivity to detect low number of adhered cells. The EP was better when the average number of adhered cells was between 10 and 100 per microscopy field.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The experiment consisted in determining the O2 absorption under these conditions. A sachet was placed in desiccators with an internal air homogenization system. Aliquots of air were removed at pre-established time intervals and analyzed for oxygen content. The results showed that oxygen absorption by the sachet increased as the relative humidity increased for both temperature. Therefore the oxygen - absorbing sachets were most active under 25±2ºC and 85% relative humidity. At ambient condition (25±2ºC/75%RH) the rate of oxygen absorbed was 50 mL/day and 18,5 mL/day for 10±2ºC. It was used a totally casualized design with three replicates.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Pastry dough containing potassium sorbate layered with low-density polyethylene films (LDPE) was used as a control. The films/pastry sandwiches were stored in LDPE bags at 8 ± 1°C. After 40 days of storage, the dough layered with 25¯m/7% films showed a reduction of 2log cycles in the aerobic mesophilic count; however, there were no significant differences (p ≥ 0.05) for the psychotropic and Staphylococcus spp. counts. For the dough layered with 70¯m/3% films there were reductions of 2 and 1.5log cycles in the mesophilic and psychotropic counts, respectively. In the control dough, the aerobic mesophilic, psychotropic and Staphylococcus spp. counts increased by 1.5, 1 and 2log cycles, respectively. Regardless of the film, the counts of filamentous fungi, yeasts and coagulase-positive staphylococcus were <1.0 ¥ 102CFU/g, whereas the coliform counts at 35 and 45°C, and Escherichia coli were <3.0 ¥ 100NMP/g. The diffusion coefficients of the sorbic acid from the films into the dough had values in the order of 10-18m2/s. There were no differences (p ≥ 0.05) between migration values among the films. The maximum additive release from the 25¯m/7% film into the dough after 20 days was 0.07%, and from the 70¯m/3% film after 9 days was 0.09%. Both values are below the maximum limit allowed by current legislation.

T... more Edible antimicrobial films are an innovation within the biodegradable active packaging concept. They have been developed in order to reduce and/or inhibit the growth of microorganisms on the surface of foods. This study developed an edible antimicrobial film based on yam starch (Dioscorea alata) and chitosan and investigated its antimicrobial efficiency on Salmonella enteritidis. A solution of yam starch (4%) and glycerol (2%) was gelatinized in a viscoamilograph and chitosan added at concentrations of 1%, 3% and 5%. Films with and without chitosan were produced by the cast method. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the films, two suspensions of S. enteritidis were used in BHI medium, corresponding to counts of 2 × 108 and 1.1 × 106 CFU/ml. The suspensions (50 ml) were poured into flasks. The films were cut into 5 × 5 and 5 × 10 cm rectangles to be used at ratios of 1 : 1 (1 cm2/ml microorganism suspension) and 2 : 1 (2 cm2/ml). The film 30 µm thick on average. As a control, pure chitosan at an amount corresponding to that contained in the 3% and 5% films (5 × 10 cm) was added to flasks containing the microorganism suspension. Also, flasks containing only a suspension of S. enteritidis were used as control. The suspensions, in flasks, were kept at 37°C in a waterbath with agitation. Suspension aliquots were removed every hour for reading the optic density (OD595) and plating onto PCA medium. The results showed that chitosan has a bactericidal effect upon S. enteritidis. Films treated with chitosan at different concentrations showed similar antimicrobial efficiency, in addition to being dependent on diffusion. The chitosan-treated films caused a reduction of one to two log cycles in the number of microorganisms, whereas the pure chitosan presented a reduction of four to six log cycles compared with the control and starch film. The films showed good flexibility. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Increased presevation of sliced mozzarella cheese by antimibrobial sachet incorporated with allyl isothiocyanateBrazilian Journal of Microbiology,  2009There is an increasing tendency to add natural antimicrobials of plant origin into food. The obje... more There is an increasing tendency to add natural antimicrobials of plant origin into food. The objective of this work was to develop a microbial sachet incorporated with allyl isothiocyanate (AIT), a volatile compound of plant origin, and to test its efficiency against growth of yeasts and molds, Staphylococcus sp. and psychrotrophic bacteria on sliced mozzarella cheese. Another objective was to quantify the concentration of AIT in the headspace of cheese packaging. A reduction of 3.6 log cycles was observed in yeasts and molds counts in the mozzarella packed with the antimicrobial sachet over 15-day storage time. The sachet also showed an antibacterial effect on Staphylococcus sp., reducing 2.4 log cycles after 12-day storage. Psychrotrophic bacteria species were the most resistant to the antimicrobial action. The highest concentration of AIT (0.08µg.mL-1) inside the active packaging system was observed at the 6-day of storage at 12 ºC ± 2 ºC. At the end of the storage time, AIT concentration decreased to only 10% of the initial concentration. Active packaging containing antimicrobial sachet has a potential use for sliced mozzarella, with molds and yeasts being the most sensitive to the antimicrobial effects.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Polydiacetylene (PDA) is an ideal choice for use as a sensor due to its unique optical properties. PDA molecules can form thin films or vesicles that change color from deep blue to red in response to different stimuli, like temperature, pH, and the presence of biological molecules. PDA films and vesicles have been proven to be promising devices for the detection of bacteria and bacterial toxins. Langmuir troughs (for films) and microcalorimetry (for vesicles) are among the many techniques used to characterize PDA films and vesicles. In order to enable more applications of PDA films, it is imperative to elucidate and gain a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions associated with their color change. In addition, it is necessary to transfer the PDA film onto a solid support like plastic in order to incorporate PDA biosensors into an intelligent packaging system. Through the use of such a system, consumers can monitor food quality, thereby preventing foodborne outbreaks. In this review, we discuss the formation of PDA films and vesicles, their characteristics, and their potential applications as biosensors. The possibility to incorporate PDA biosensors into an intelligent packaging system to be used in the food industry is also explored.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Effect of Active Packaging Incorporated with Triclosan on Bacteria AdhesionJournal of Food Science,  2010ABSTRACT:  Antimicrobial polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with triclosan were ... more ABSTRACT:  Antimicrobial polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with triclosan were studied. The antimicrobial efficacy, the hydrophobicity, microscopic and the mechanical characteristics of the films, as well free energy of adhesion between bacteria and antimicrobial films were evaluated. It was observed that both polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with the antimicrobial were homogeneous. Furthermore, the addition of triclosan did not affect mechanical characteristics of the films (P > 0.05). However, triclosan incorporated into polyethylene films reduced its hydrophobicity while antimicrobial cellulose based films became more hydrophobic. The adhesion was thermodynamically favorable between tested bacteria and polyethylene films. On the other hand, the adhesion to triclosan cellulose based film was thermodynamically unfavorable to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and favorable to Listeria innocua and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polyethylene and cellulose based films showed inhibitory effect against S. aureus and E. coli, being the inhibition halo higher for polyethylene films. This study improves the knowledge about antimicrobial films.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The number of manufactured foods has widely increased to meet the increasing number of consumers and sometimes the hygiene procedures in the food industry are poor or overlooked. It is essential that those responsible for producing food be knowledgeable about the characteristics of the material surfaces used to make the equipment, utensils and conveyors to help in the control of foodborne diseases. The viable alternatives to avoid or minimize food contamination are (1) improving surface quality related to microtopography by improving surface production process; (2) choosing surfaces with better characteristics concerning microtopography to control the adherence process and biofilm formation; and (3) implementing effective controls of cleaning and sanitizing procedures.This research shows important information for people dealing with food quality control, quality management, risk assessment, risk management hazard analysis by critical point control and good manufacturing practices, which are well-recognized food safety tools.

Film efficacies were evaluated in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 15313, Penicillium sp. and Geotrichum sp. The films were also evaluated on sliced mozzarella cheese against moulds and yeasts, Staphylococcus sp. and psychrotrophic bacteria. Mechanical and microscopic properties of the films and the diffusion of the antimicrobial agents from the film to the cheese were also evaluated. Films containing NI showed an antimicrobial effect in vitro against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, while films containing NA were effective in vitro against Penicillium sp. and Geotrichum sp. By the ninth day of storage at 12 ± 2°C, the count of yeasts and moulds on cheese covered with films containing NA decreased 2 log10 units compared with the count on cheese with control films. NI film did not show an effect against Staphylococcus sp., but it was effective against psychrotrophic bacteria for 6 days of storage of the cheese. The incorporation of antimicrobial compounds decreased the resistance and elongation of the films and caused changes in their molecular conformation. NI diffusion from the films to the cheese was not detected; however, time-dependent diffusion of NA from the film containing NI + NA was measured. The incorporation of NI and NA together in the films did not show an effect. The film containing NA showed potential for application as active food packaging for sliced mozzarella cheese.

The surfaces include marble, granite, stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, and silicone-coated cloth, which have been used only in a few studies concerning bacterial adherence. The number of cells adhered to the surfaces increased with contact time reaching 5.0-6.1 log CDM.cm-2 after 10 hours, which can be considered a well established adherence process. The number of adhered cells doubled in 29.5 minutes and 23.5 minutes on stainless steel and thin polyvinyl chloride-coated cloth, respectively. For the other surfaces, this value was 9.8 minutes on average. Marble, granite, thick polyvinyl-coated cloth, double-faced rugous polyurethane, and silicone-coated cloth were not different (p < 0.05) in their ability to adhere cells (CFU/cm2) after 2 and 10 hours. The surfaces that had higher percentage of similarity in the adhesion level and higher log CFU/cm2 of adhered cells were double-faced rugous polyurethane, silicone-coated cloth, and granite. The surfaces showed very different microtopography characteristics when viewed using scanning electron microscopy. This experiment showed the importance of using appropriate materials for food contact during processing, which will affect the cleaning and sanitation procedures.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

ATP-bioluminescence assay as an alternative for hygiene-monitoring procedures of stainless steel milk contact surfacesBrazilian Journal of Microbiology,  2006ATP-bioluminescence assay was used to evaluate the cleaning and sanitizing procedures of stainles... more ATP-bioluminescence assay was used to evaluate the cleaning and sanitizing procedures of stainless steel milk contact surfaces. Surfaces of a raw milk transportation tank, a raw milk cooling storage tank, an equalization pasteurizing tank, a pasteurized milk storage tank and a pasteurized milk packaging tank, as well as a milk centrifuge were evaluated. The Relative Light Unit (RLU) using a commercial luminometer and mesophilic aerobic counts (CFU.cm-2) on surfaces were determined. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in RLU on the assessed surfaces before and after the cleaning and sanitizing procedures. Also, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) in CFU.cm-2 on the surfaces before the cleaning and sanitizing procedures, whereas different bacterial numbers were found on surfaces after the hygiene procedures. The surfaces of the milk centrifuge, raw milk cooling tank and milk packaging tank showed the largest mesophilic aerobic numbers after the hygiene, reaching 2.21, 2.18, and 1.21 log10, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is no agreement among the techniques for classification of hygienic conditions of the evaluated surfaces, showing a non-direct relation between RLU and CFU.cm-2. The ATP-bioluminescence method showed that 100% of the surfaces were under inadequate hygiene conditions, while the plate count method detected only 50%, based on the APHA's recommendation, and 33%, based on the WHO's recommendation. High variations in RLU measurements were observed, suggesting the need for more than only one surface analysis. The ATP-bioluminescence is not a direct replacement for microbiological testing, but provides complementary information and should be used as part of an integrated strategy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Bacterial adherence to different inert surfaces evaluated by epifluorescence microscopy and plate count methodBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology,  2004The adherence of Listeria inoccua L6a and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538 was evaluated on stainle... more The adherence of Listeria inoccua L6a and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538 was evaluated on stainless steel (SS), polycarbonate (PC) and polypropylene (PP) chips. The EP results showed a significant difference (p<0.05) among the microorganism species interactions, the surfaces and the contact time. The number of adhered cells on the chip surfaces increased as contact time increased and the number of L. innocua or S. aureus on the surface of SS, PC and PP chips reached 1.0x105 CFU/cm2 after 12 h of contact, in both methods. The CP method showed a better sensitivity to detect low number of adhered cells. The EP was better when the average number of adhered cells was between 10 and 100 per microscopy field.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The experiment consisted in determining the O2 absorption under these conditions. A sachet was placed in desiccators with an internal air homogenization system. Aliquots of air were removed at pre-established time intervals and analyzed for oxygen content. The results showed that oxygen absorption by the sachet increased as the relative humidity increased for both temperature. Therefore the oxygen - absorbing sachets were most active under 25±2ºC and 85% relative humidity. At ambient condition (25±2ºC/75%RH) the rate of oxygen absorbed was 50 mL/day and 18,5 mL/day for 10±2ºC. It was used a totally casualized design with three replicates.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Antimicrobial efficiency and sorbic acid migration from active films into pastry doughPackaging Technology and Science,  2007Antimicrobial films of 25 and 70¯m thickness, incorporated with 7 and 3% sorbic acid, respectivel... more Antimicrobial films of 25 and 70¯m thickness, incorporated with 7 and 3% sorbic acid, respectively, were layered with pastry dough without additive and evaluated for sorbic acid migration and antimicrobial efficiency. Pastry dough containing potassium sorbate layered with low-density polyethylene films (LDPE) was used as a control. The films/pastry sandwiches were stored in LDPE bags at 8 ± 1°C. After 40 days of storage, the dough layered with 25¯m/7% films showed a reduction of 2log cycles in the aerobic mesophilic count; however, there were no significant differences (p ≥ 0.05) for the psychotropic and Staphylococcus spp. counts. For the dough layered with 70¯m/3% films there were reductions of 2 and 1.5log cycles in the mesophilic and psychotropic counts, respectively. In the control dough, the aerobic mesophilic, psychotropic and Staphylococcus spp. counts increased by 1.5, 1 and 2log cycles, respectively. Regardless of the film, the counts of filamentous fungi, yeasts and coagulase-positive staphylococcus were <1.0 ¥ 102CFU/g, whereas the coliform counts at 35 and 45°C, and Escherichia coli were <3.0 ¥ 100NMP/g. The diffusion coefficients of the sorbic acid from the films into the dough had values in the order of 10-18m2/s. There were no differences (p ≥ 0.05) between migration values among the films. The maximum additive release from the 25¯m/7% film into the dough after 20 days was 0.07%, and from the 70¯m/3% film after 9 days was 0.09%. Both values are below the maximum limit allowed by current legislation.

Development and evaluation of an edible antimicrobial film based on yam starch and chitosanPackaging Technology and Science,  2006Edible antimicrobial films are an innovation within the biodegradable active packaging concept. T... more Edible antimicrobial films are an innovation within the biodegradable active packaging concept. They have been developed in order to reduce and/or inhibit the growth of microorganisms on the surface of foods. This study developed an edible antimicrobial film based on yam starch (Dioscorea alata) and chitosan and investigated its antimicrobial efficiency on Salmonella enteritidis. A solution of yam starch (4%) and glycerol (2%) was gelatinized in a viscoamilograph and chitosan added at concentrations of 1%, 3% and 5%. Films with and without chitosan were produced by the cast method. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the films, two suspensions of S. enteritidis were used in BHI medium, corresponding to counts of 2 × 108 and 1.1 × 106 CFU/ml. The suspensions (50 ml) were poured into flasks. The films were cut into 5 × 5 and 5 × 10 cm rectangles to be used at ratios of 1 : 1 (1 cm2/ml microorganism suspension) and 2 : 1 (2 cm2/ml). The film 30 µm thick on average. As a control, pure chitosan at an amount corresponding to that contained in the 3% and 5% films (5 × 10 cm) was added to flasks containing the microorganism suspension. Also, flasks containing only a suspension of S. enteritidis were used as control. The suspensions, in flasks, were kept at 37°C in a waterbath with agitation. Suspension aliquots were removed every hour for reading the optic density (OD595) and plating onto PCA medium. The results showed that chitosan has a bactericidal effect upon S. enteritidis. Films treated with chitosan at different concentrations showed similar antimicrobial efficiency, in addition to being dependent on diffusion. The chitosan-treated films caused a reduction of one to two log cycles in the number of microorganisms, whereas the pure chitosan presented a reduction of four to six log cycles compared with the control and starch film. The films showed good flexibility. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
