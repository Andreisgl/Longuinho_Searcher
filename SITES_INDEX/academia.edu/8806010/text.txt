ISPM 15, the first international standard for treating WPM, was adopted in 2002 and first implemented in the United States in 2006. ISPM 15 allows bark to remain on WPM after treatment, raising concerns that insects could infest after treatment, especially if bark were present. We conducted field studies to evaluate insect infestation of green logs and lumber with varying amounts of bark after heat treatment. In a log study, Cerambycidae and Scolytinae (ambrosia beetles and bark beetles) readily infested and developed in logs with bark after heat treatment. In a lumber study, Cerambycidae and bark beetles laid eggs in all sizes of bark patches tested (approximately 25, 100, 250, and 1,000 cm2) after heat treatment but did not infest control or heat-treated lumber without bark. Cerambycidae completed development only in boards with bark patches of 1,000 cm2, whereas bark beetles completed development on patches of 100, 250, and 1,000 cm2. Survival of bark beetles was greater in square patches (10 by 10 cm) versus rectangular patches (2.5 by 40 cm) of the same surface area (100 cm2). In surveys at six U.S. ports in 2006, 9.4% of 5,945 ISPM 15-marked WPM items contained bark, and 1.2% of 564 ISPM 15-marked WPM items with bark contained live insects of quarantine significance under the bark. It was not possible to determine whether the presence of live insects represented treatment failure or infestation after treatment.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Economic EntomologyAppropriateness of Probit-9 in the Development of Quarantine Treatments for Timber and Timber Commodities2011 • Robert Haack, A.

EAB was discovered in an adjacent woodlot in 2005. Students established monitoring plots in 2006. In December 2007, one ash tree from each plot (selected as the ash tree closest to plot center in the 3-18 cm DBH size range, for a total of 35 trees) was felled and the trunk was cut into 1 m segments.

Much of EAB&#39;s range expansion has been attributed to human-assisted movement of infested items such as ash logs and firewood. It is unclear the amount of time that logs cut from live EAB-infested ash trees should be restricted from movement until they are no longer capable of producing viable EAB adults. In March and April 2004, we cut log sections from EAB-infested green ash (F. pennsylvanica Marsh) trees in Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, Michigan. Log sections (mean length = 24.8 cm; diam. = 11.6 cm) were stood upright on one cut end and stored beneath a hardwood forest canopy. Adult EAB were allowed to freely emerge from log sections during summer 2004. When logs were dissected in November 2004 to January 2005, approximately one half of the total EAB life stages that were present in the logs were dead, while the other half e...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
