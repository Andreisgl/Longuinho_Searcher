FEED DIGESTIBILITY, SOME BLOOD CONSTITUENTS AND MILK PRODUCTION AND ITS COMPOSITIONMagdy  IsmailTwenty four lactating Zaraibi goats in mid lactation were used in a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design to evaluate two different sources of ruminally degradable non structural carbohydrates (high and low RDNSC) and two different sources of ruminally degradable protein (high and low RDP). Four experimental diets were formulated to study their effects on digestion coefficients, some blood constituents and milk production and its composition. The obtained results indicated that digestibility coefficients for DM, OM, CP and NFE and the nutritive value in terms of TDN and DCP% were significantly (P<0.05) higher for goats received low RDP and high RDNSC diets than those received high RDP and low RDNSC diets. The concentration of plasma urea-N was decreased (P<0.05) when goats were fed low RDP diets than those fed high RDP ones, whereas the concentrations of total protein, albumin and globulin were increased indicating once more better utilization of low RDP. Regardless the RDP, plasma urea-N was significantly (P<0.05) lower in goats fed high RDNSC diets than in those fed low RDNSC diets. Yields of milk, 4% fat-corrected milk (4%-FCM) and milk components were higher (P<0.05) when goats fed low RDP diets than those fed high RDP ones. Milk non-protein-nitrogen (NPN) was lower (P<0.05) with low RDP diets. On the other hand, yield of true protein nitrogen, casein nitrogen, whey nitrogen and unsaturated fatty acids in milk were higher (P<0.05) with goats fed low RDP than those fed high RDP. Regardless the RDP content of the tested diets, a slight improvement in milk yield and 4%-FCM detected for goats given high RDNSC diets compared to those given low RDNSC ones without significant differences. Goats received low RDP with high RDNSC (diet 4) were higher and more persistent for milk yield during the experimental period. On the other hand goats received diets contained high RDP with high RDNSC produced the lowest milk yield.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of dairy scienceEfficacy of liquid feeds varying in concentration and composition of fat, nonprotein nitrogen, and nonfiber carbohydrates for lactating dairy cows2008 • José PantojaIn trial 1, we evaluated the efficacy of a liquid feed (LF) containing cane molasses and corn steep liquor as carriers of suspended white grease (WG) without or with urea (U) or with soybean lipid (SL; a byproduct of soybean processing) compared with roasted soybeans plus tallow blended into respective concentrates in a 16-wk lactation study. The dry matter intake (DMI) and milk production for LF diets were either similar to or greater than respective controls, although SL decreased milk fat percentage. In trial 2, we compared LF without fat to LF plus WG or SL and also evaluated the dose response to increasing amount of LF + WG in a 16-wk lactation trial in which the LF products were added to respective total mixed rations. The DMI was increased and then decreased (quadratic response) with increasing LF + WG without a linear response. However, production of milk, protein, and fat increased linearly with corresponding quadratic responses, which we interpret to be a result of a limit...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Dairy ScienceExpeller Soybean Meal and Corn By-Products Versus Solvent Soybean Meal for Lactating Dairy Cows Fed Alfalfa Silage as Sole Forage11990 • Glen BroderickDownload Free PDFView PDFDale E.

Related areas for the dairy industry are productive efficiency, environmental issues, and dairy products as food.• Remarkable gains in productivity efficiency (milk output per resource input) have occurred with the annual milk/cow increasing over 400% since 1944.Download Free PDFView PDFNitrogen utilization, nutrient digestibility, and excretion of purine derivatives in dairy cattle consuming rations containing corn milling co-products2010 • Paul KononoffDownload Free PDFView PDFMilk production of dairy cows fed sugar cane silage based diets2014 • Marcos I MarcondesDownload Free PDFView PDFUtilization of co-products of the biofuel industry as livestock feeds – a synthesis2012 • Harinder MakkarDownload Free PDFView PDFItalian Journal of Animal ScienceThe effect of dry corn gluten feed on chewing activities and rumen parameters in lactating dairy cows2010 • Hidir GencogluDownload Free PDFView PDFItalian Journal of Animal  …Raw, extruded and expanded pea (Pisum sativum) in dairy cows diets2010 • giorgio fusconiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
