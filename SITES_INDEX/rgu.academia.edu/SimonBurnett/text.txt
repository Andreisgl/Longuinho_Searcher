Aims to ascertain whether the size of the organisation and the level of Internet use determines the perceptions and beliefs of non‐profit organisations within the environmental sector in Scotland and whether these factors also determines the costs and benefits experienced by Internet users. Finds that regardless of size or the level of use, organisations believe the Internet is a cost‐effective way to market their organisations and promote awareness. However, attitudinal factors affect the level of use by small organisations. Overall the organisations within the sample have indicated that the Internet is a low cost, high benefit marketing solution.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Saying the unsayable: The online expression of mothers’ anger during a pandemicFeminism & Psychology,  2022This article investigates key triggers for mothers’ anger during the COVID-19 pandemic and some o... more This article investigates key triggers for mothers’ anger during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the positive and negative consequences of its expression online. It uses the UK online parenting forum Mumsnet as a research context and source of data. Our findings support previous research into mothers’ anger during COVID-19 that suggests that the pandemic has both exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict and created new ones within their homes. This anger is frequently repressed because women need to continue to work and cohabit with the colleagues and family members who have caused this anger. However, we also identify a further trigger for mothers’ anger – their frustration at the government&#39;s perceived inaction and mis- or even dis-information about the pandemic. This anger can be exacerbated by mainstream media reports and also the sharing of suspicions and complaints on online forums such as Mumsnet. Mumsnet therefore offers a safe space for the venting of women&#39;s ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper problematises the existence of desire lines in relation to research which has been conducted with various refugee groups. Method. - The concept of desire lines is expanded and linked to the library and information science field by drawing from the authors empirical research projects and from the scant literature from geography, urban planning and from a social theory. Conclusion. - The concept of desire lines contributes to the nascent research area of fractured information landscapes and offers a way of understanding how information landscapes are shaped when people are resettling into a new setting. While the work presented in an emerging conceptualisation, the authors also believe there is potential to conceptualise the rebuilding of landscapes as an occurrence within any transitionary environment (e.g. starting a job, moving to a new country, o...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on the archive of the School of Scottish Studies at Edinburgh University, the model was applied to five historical phases defined by changes in the use of media in song acquisition and transmission: oral tradition; externalization in print; dependence on literacy; audio media; and digitization. The findings show that the model offers a valuable analytical framework that can be widely applied in cultural as well as organizational contexts. In addition, the model may be used in a longitudinal analysis to describe non-static relationships between knowledge processes and changing contexts of media and society over time. In addition, the SECI model also emphasises the critical roles played by the community (or communities) in the transmission process, and the physical and virtual spaces in which those transm...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The objectives were: 1) To explore Syrian new Scots&#39; &#39;ways of knowing&#39; for addressing critical social inclusion needs (e.g. housing, welfare, education, benefits, employability, rights and entitlements). This may involve interaction with people, tools and processes within their new socio-cultural setting. 2) To examine the barriers (e.g. English language, socio-cultural differences) and enablers (local community support, new technologies and media) they encounter in the process of addressing their key information needs. 3) To investigate how Syrian new Scots could be supported to adapt to their local communites, feel a sense of belongingness and successfully establish their identity into the Scottish society.

Syrian participants were also involved in a drawing exercise that helped to map visually their information worlds. The main information needs expressed by participants revolved around the learning of the English language, travelling freely and gaining confidence to navigate around the city/town and reuniting with family members. There was a series of interesting findings related to the Syrian families&#39; use of technology and a few new ideas around information provision.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the days before the Internet, conversation about television programmes was limited to those sitting on the sofa with you and people you met the next morning – so-called ‘water-cooler conversation’. Now, however, it is possible to discuss events on the screen in real time with people all over the country – three out of five UK twitter users tweet while watching television (Nielsen, 2013). Thus it is not surprising to find that the General Election’s television events generated debate and discussion on twitter.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The scope of the research encompassed three groups of actors within the innovation process: technology providers, enablers and end users. The research employed a qualitative approach using narrative and semi-structured interviews as a method for data collection, and employed an analytical template to analyse the data which was developed by integrating elements of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) with narrative schema. A hypertextual system was also developed to determine how the explicit knowledge of the actors within the innovation process could be codified and transferred.

However, surveys show dissatisfaction with enterprise search is commonplace. No prior study has investigated unsolicited user feedback from an enterprise search user interface to understand the underlying reasons for dissatisfaction. A mixed-methods longitudinal study was undertaken analysing feedback from over 1000 users and interviewing search service staff in a multinational corporation. Results show that 62% of dissatisfaction events were due to human (information and search literacy) rather than technology factors. Cognitive biases and the ‘Google Habitus’ influence expectations and information behaviour and are postulated as deep underlying generative mechanisms. The current literature focuses on ‘structure’ (technology and information quality) as the reason for enterprise search satisfaction, agency (search literacy) appears downplayed.
