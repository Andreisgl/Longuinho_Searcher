This page is about requesting the creation of a new code repository.
All new code repositories are Git repositories in Gerrit .
If you want to be a project owner (to be able to review a patch as +2 and merge it) of an existing code repository in Gerrit, see Gerrit/Privilege policy .
Step 0: Evaluation[edit]
You may check if you are interested in Gerrit or if you may prefer GitLab  (available since 2021).
Note that GitLab allows to create personal repositories without a formal request process.
Step 1: Get Git access[edit]
To commit and review Git commits, we use Gerrit. You can login to Gerrit using your Wikimedia developer account.
Anybody can create a Wikimedia developer account if you don't have one yet.
Step 2: Request a Git repository[edit]
Main page: Gerrit/New repositories/Requests
You'll need the following:
Wikimedia developer account,
Decide on an appropiate repository name (and by implication, its parent namespace in Gerrit), e.g. mediawiki/extensions/Example).
Phabricator project, or see  creating new project to request a new one.
Request new repository
Step 3: Commit your files[edit]
Main page: Gerrit/Tutorial#How to submit a patch
Once you have some files, you can commit them and continue your work utilizing Git.
Step 4: Publish an extension page[edit]
Main page: Manual:Developing extensions#Publishing
To autocategorize and standardize the documentation of your existing extension, please see Template:Extension .
To add your new extension to this Wiki:
Templates to use[edit]
{{Extension}}
{{WikimediaDownload}}
{{ExtensionInstall}}
{{Gitweb}}
{{MW file}} - used in the Manual
...
Step 5: Continue development and enjoy![edit]
You could also try to find a couple of established MediaWiki developers to look over your code and point out any flaws in it, for example by asking on the wikitech-l  mailing list.
Getting notified of changes in your repository[edit]
Other people may submit patches to your repository which you should review. 
You can have new changes in your repository emailed to you by Gerrit.
See Gerrit/watched projects .
If you want to be automatically added as a reviewer to each new patchset (or a subset by regex), add yourself to the Gerrit reviewer bot.
