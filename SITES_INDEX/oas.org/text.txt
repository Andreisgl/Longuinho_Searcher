Calendar of Conferences in Headquarters
 
 
Each year the OAS Secretary General 
publishes a proposed Program-Budget for the coming calendar year. The OAS 
General Assembly meets in a Special Session to approve the Program-Budget. 
Find these documents from 1998-2013 here.
Each year in April, the OAS Board of 
External Auditors publishes a report covering the previous calendar year’s 
financial results. Reports covering 1996-2013 may be found here.
About six weeks after the end of each 
quarter of each year, the OAS publishes a Quarterly Management and 
Performance Report, which since 2013 includes reporting on programmatic 
results. The full texts may be found here.
Here you will find data on the Human 
Resources of the OAS, including its organizational structure, each 
organizational unit’s staffing, vacant posts, and performance contracts.
The OAS executes a variety of projects 
funded by donors. Evaluation reports are commissioned by donors. Reports of 
these evaluations may be found here.
The Inspector General provides the 
Secretary General with reports on the audits, investigations, and 
inspections conducted. These reports are made available to the Permanent 
Council. More information may be found here.
The OAS has discussed for several years 
the real estate issue, the funding required for maintenance and repairs, as 
well as the deferred maintenance of its historic buildings. The General 
Secretariat has provided a series of options for funding it. The most recent 
document, reflecting the current status of the Strategy, is CP/CAAP-3211/13 
rev. 4.
Here you will find information related 
to the GS/OAS Procurement Operations, including a list of procurement 
notices for formal bids, links to the performance contract and travel 
control measure reports, the applicable procurement rules and regulations, 
and the training and qualifications of its staff.
The OAS Treasurer certifies the 
financial statements of all funds managed or administered by the GS/OAS. 
Here you will find the latest general purpose financial reports for the main 
OAS funds, as well as OAS Quarterly Financial Reports (QFRs).
