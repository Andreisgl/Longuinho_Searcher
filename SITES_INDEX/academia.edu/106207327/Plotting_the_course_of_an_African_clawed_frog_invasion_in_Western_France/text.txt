John Measey2006, Animal BiologyThe African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is an invasive species with considerable impact in mediterranean climates, similar to its native South African Cape. A population has been established in western France since the early 1980s with a single, known, original release point. This study attempts to determine the limits of the invasion by trapping in 169 ponds in 2001 and 2002. Subsequent trapping of 192 ponds in 2003 and 2004 was undertaken in order to chart the progress of invasion, and to test the hypothesis that ponds were mostly colonised using rivers and streams as corridors. Of ponds without X. laevis in 2001/2002, 36% were found to have been colonised by 2003/2004. The findings clearly show that, while lotic corridors are used by this principally aquatic species, most ponds are colonised through overland migration. The consequences of this finding for invasions in France and other European countries are briefly discussed.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLe régime alimentaire de Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802) (Anura: Pipidae) introduit en France2014 • Jean-marc ThirionLes especes exotiques envahissantes, comme le Xenope lisse, Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802), presentent generalement un regime alimentaire susceptible d&#39;impacter les communautes aquatiques qu&#39;elles cotoient. La composition du regime alimentaire du Xenope lisse a deja ete etudiee sur son aire de repartition d&#39;origine et dans plusieurs zones envahies par l&#39;espece. En France, cet aspect de l&#39;ecologie de Xenopus laevis n&#39;a pour le moment jamais fait l&#39;objet d&#39;une etude. Le present article rapporte les resultats obtenus a partir de dissections realisees sur des individus provenant de mares des Deux-Sevres, a quelques kilometres du point d&#39;introduction de l&#39;espece sur le territoire francais. Le regime alimentaire comporte une importante variete de proies, avec une preference marquee pour les proies d&#39;origine aquatique. Une analyse par calcul de frequences d&#39;occurrence a permis de mettre en evidence d&#39;autres groupes, comme les adultes de Le...Download Free PDFView PDFMeasey_et_al_2012_BiolInvFrancesco LilloDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological InvasionsCan the introduction of Xenopus laevis affect native amphibian populations?

The African Clawed Frog, Xenopus laevis, shows a strong ability to establish populations and invade various geographic regions. In 2004 X. laevis was found in Sicily for the first time. The Sicilian population is probably the largest in Europe with a range of about 225 km2 in an area characterized by numerous agricultural ponds. This high density of ponds has potentially facilitated the dispersal of X. laevis. The frogs can move far from rivers or watercourses by utilizing the ponds as suitable &quot;islands&quot;. The analysis of their diet shows that the aquatic larvae of nektonic insects comprise the major portion in terms of mass while small planktonic crustaceans are the most numerous component. There is a significant difference between the diet of adults and juveniles.Download Free PDFView PDFManagement of Biological InvasionsHigh abundance of invasive African clawed frog Xenopus laevis in Chile: challenges for their control and updated invasive distribution2019 • MARTA ARAUZ MORADownload Free PDFView PDFPeerJUnequal contribution of native South African phylogeographic lineages to the invasion of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis , in Europe2016 • Thierry BackeljauDue to both deliberate and accidental introductions, invasive African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis) populations have become established worldwide. In this study, we investigate the geographic origins of invasiveX. laevispopulations in France and Portugal using the phylogeographic structure ofX. laevisin its native South African range. In total, 80 individuals from the whole area known to be invaded in France and Portugal were analysed for two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, allowing a comparison with 185 specimens from the native range. Our results show that native phylogeographic lineages have contributed differently to invasive EuropeanX. laevispopulations. In Portugal, genetic and historical data suggest a single colonization event involving a small number of individuals from the south-western Cape region in South Africa. In contrast, French invasiveX. laevisencompass two distinct native phylogeographic lineages, i.e., one from the south-western Cape region and one from the...Download Free PDFView PDFFood WebsChanges in the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities throughout the expanding range of an invasive anuran2018 • Julien  CourantDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological Journal of the Linnean SocietyConserved growth rate and age structure of Xenopus laevis in the edge and core of an expanding population2019 • Layla AdilInvasive species represent a unique opportunity to study the evolutionary mechanisms driving range expansions. Although range expansion is expected to be associated with increased reproduction and dispersal at the range edge, Xenopus laevis seems to decrease its reproductive investment and to enhance dispersal at the range edge. Evidence of increased dispersal at the edge of expanding populations occurring simultaneously with a faster growth rate has been reported for other organisms. Here, we focused on the growth rate and age structure at the range edge vs. the range core in an expanding population of X. laevis. We used skeletochronology to characterize the age of 250 individuals captured at the range core and edge of this expanding population. Using the Von Bertalanffy equation, we then compared individual growth rates between locations. We found no significant changes in growth rate or age structure between edge and core samples. This result suggests that the reduced investment ...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
