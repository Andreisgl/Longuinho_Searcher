Systemic racism has to do with systems (political, economic, legal, judicial, and educational). It includes the policies, procedures, rules, laws, regulations, traditions, institutions, and the paradigms that disadvantage people of color while providing advantage to the white privileged majority in terms of opportunities and resources. Systemic racism, whether implicit or explicit, intentional or unintentional, is so emmeshed in the fiber of our society, that it often seems normal and goes unnoticed. As such, systemic racism calls for a systemic response.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersReview of Research in EducationThe “New Racism” of K–12 Schools: Centering Critical Research on Racism2017 • Rita KohliDownload Free PDFView PDFKohli, R., Pizarro, M., & Nevárez, A. (2017). The “New Racism” of K–12 Schools: Centering Critical Research on Racism. Review of Research in Education, 41(1), 182-202.Rita Kohli, Arturo NevárezWhile organizing efforts by movements such as Black Lives Matter and responses to the hate-filled policies and rhetoric of President Donald Trump are heightening public discourse of racism, much less attention is paid to mechanisms of racial oppression in the field of education. Instead, conceptualizations that allude to racial difference but are disconnected from structural analyses continue to prevail in K–12 education research. In this chapter, our goal is to challenge racism-neutral and racism-evasive approaches to studying racial disparities by centering current research that makes visible the normalized facets of racism in K–12 schools. After narrowing over 4,000 articles that study racial inequity in education research, we reviewed a total of 186 U.S.-focused research studies in a K–12 school context that examine racism. As we categorized the literature, we built on a theory of the " new racism " —a more covert and hidden racism than that of the past—and grouped the articles into two main sections: (1) research that brings to light racism's permanence and significance in the lives of students of Color through manifestations of what we conceptualize as (a) evaded racism, (b) " antiracist " racism, and (c) everyday racism and (2) research focused on confronting racism through racial literacy and the resistance of communities of Color. In our conclusion, we articulate suggestions for future directions in education research that include a more direct acknowledgement of racism as we attend to the experiences and needs of K–12 students of Color.Download Free PDFView PDFAffirming Race, Diversity, and Equity Through Black and Latinx Students' Lived ExperiencesRican VueImmediately after President Obama's successful campaign, many hypothesized that the United States had entered a post-racial era. This study uses critical race theory to examine how high-achieving Black and Latinx college students make meaning of and navigate affirmative action policy discourses in an era of colorblind racial politics. Semi-structured interviews with 46 alumni of two race-conscious college access programs illustrate how participants employ a race-conscious framework that affirms the reality of race-conscious policies. Their discourse addressing race, intersectionality, and equity disrupts colorblind ideology. Connecting our analysis to the current social landscape, we argue intersectionality offers a framework for engaging politics of accountability. In the conclusion, we conceptually distinguish between post-racial era conditions and post-race (or post-racist) aspirations.. Her research focuses on the role of race and its intersections with ethnicity, class, and gender in the social, political, symbolic, and structural dynamics of U.S. education with an emphasis on equity and inclusion in higher education.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Educational ReformThe Influence of Teachers’ Colorblind Expectations on the Political, Normative, and Technical Dimensions of Educational ReformDaniel LiouThis ethnographic case study examined the experiences of African American students within an urban school detracking reform initiative, which was intended to replace tracking practices through the institution of small schools. Over the course of a year, the researchers interviewed administrators, teachers, and students while gathering observational data from classrooms to explore the political nature of the reform and its impact on how students were viewed and treated by their teachers. Although this school reorganization aimed to expand opportunities for African American students, ultimately the data illustrated that restructuring efforts failed to change teachers’ attitudes and academic expectations, thereby denying students equitable educations. We found colorblindness to be a key factor that informed teachers’ persistent low expectations for students of color that reproduced tracking practices and inequitable opportunity structures in the smaller schools, thereby reinforcing the...Download Free PDFView PDFCountering the "Strong School" Narrative: Community Response to Racial Inequity in a High-Performing District2017 • Katie LazdowskiDownload Free PDFView PDFGenealogyWhat’s Your Street Race? The Urgency of Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality as Lenses for Revising the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Guidelines, Census and Administrative Data in Latinx Communities and BeyondHoward HoganWhat’s your street race? If you were walking down the street what race do you think strangers would automatically assume you are based on what you look like? What is the universe of data and conceptual gaps that complicate or prevent rigorous data collection and analysis for advancing racial justice? Using Latinx communities in the U.S. as an example, we argue that scholars, researchers, practitioners and communities across traditional academic, sectoral and disciplinary boundaries can advance liberation by engaging the ontologies, epistemologies and conceptual guideposts of critical race theory and intersectionality in knowledge production for equity-use. This means not flattening the difference between race (master social status and relational positionality in a racially stratified society based on the social meanings ascribed to a conglomeration of one’s physical characteristics, including skin color, facial features and hair texture) and origin (ethnicity, cultural background, n...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Language, Identity, & EducationOrchestrating Critical Race Talk towards Institutional ChangeJosephine H . PhamAlthough race discourse has become increasingly encouraged to address educational inequities, racialized speakers are often expected to accommodate white listening subjects in institutional settings. Building upon multidisciplinary scholarship of race and language, I develop place-based raciolinguistics as an explanatory theory and linguistic ethnographic lens through which to analyze how racialized speakers discursively transform locally specific meanings of race and racism while being marked by prevailing ideologies, practices, and structures embedded in whiteness and other systems of power. I apply this framework by investigating the race discourse of justice-oriented K-12 teachers in Los Angeles, California. Through my analysis, I challenge reductive and essentialized views of social transformation by highlighting the multidimensional conditions of orchestrating critical race talk toward institutional change. Acknowledging the institutional vulnerability and harm that racialized speakers experience, I argue that efforts to sustain critical race action must include refusal of cultural practices that normalize race-evasive listening.Download Free PDFView PDFDonald Trump’s “Political Incorrectness”: Neoliberalism as Frontstage Racism on Social MediaJessica Gantt-ShaferPresident Donald Trump’s popularized “political incorrectness” has become a signifier allowing for backstage, or overt, racist sentiments to become steadily normalized as logical in the public frontstage of political discourse and social media. This normalization is possible under the guise of neoliberal truth telling. In the current context of neoliberalism, touting postracial “colorblindness” and achieved equalities, there is subsequent Trump-backed whitelash against “political correctness,” or an acknowledgement of inequality, in US public discourse. Highly racialized public issues such as immigration and relations between the US and Mexico lead to conversations in which “politically incorrect” white-centric racialized language is used, which has roots in the narratives of neoliberal postracialism and white superiority. Thematic analyses of popular media examples of Trump’s anti-political correctness (PC) rhetoric alongside qualitatively gathered positive social media responses to his “incorrectness” on Twitter exemplify how neoliberal “postracial” ideology can be used inversely to solidify feelings of white superiority and overt racist beliefs.The continued normalization of Trump’s version of “politically incorrect” ideology and language both on and offline can lead to increased racial violence and the continued creation of neoliberal policy with racially disparate impacts.Download Free PDFView PDFExploring the racial beliefs and instructional leadership behaviors of culturally responsive urban public school principals2021 • LIANA SUMMEYDownload Free PDFView PDF''In Real Life, You Have to Speak Up'': Civic Implications of No-Excuses Classroom Management PracticesEliot GrahamDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
