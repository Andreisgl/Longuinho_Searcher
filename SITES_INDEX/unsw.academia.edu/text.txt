While site-specific art practices abound, site-responsive art, with its inevitable and complex relationship to nostalgic or idealistic perceptions of local identity, is harder to pin down. Yet art made in response to place can provide the means to determine levels of meaning in art and exhibitions that can otherwise look the same from place to place.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the hyper-real utopia of planet Pandora, the sustainability of the Indigenous humanoid race centres on its instinctual network of communications with every level of the natural world. When invading earthlings arrive to extract valuable resources, the entire lifecycle is threatened with collapse.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Without clearly documented roles of ownership and responsibility, public artworks are unshielded from inevitable changes in taste, personnel and municipal priorities. Public art commissioned by biennales is especially prone to neglect, as its artist and curator "parents" unsurprisingly move on to make way for the next biennale's exhibition team. The Joseph Beuys tree commissioned for the 1984 Biennale of Sydney is a case in point.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
