A Long COVID/PASC Registry was subsequently established as an online platform where patients can report Long COVID/PASC symptoms and previous comorbidities. Methods: In this study, we report on the comorbidities and persistent symptoms, using data obtained from 845 South African Long COVID/PASC patients. By using a previously published scoring system for fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology, we also analysed blood samples from 80 patients, and report the presence of significant fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology in all cases.

Based on the quality of service requirements of the different network slices case, a Profit-Aware Resource Allocation (PARAA) is proposed. The Power-Bandwidth rule is employed in the cost estimation, while the optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP) and the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BIPSO) is used to solve the profit resource allocation problem. In respect to this, the performance of the algorithm is investigated via intensive Monte-Carlo based simulations taking into consideration the effect of coverage radius, number of users per slice and the allocated transmit power of each user.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

First, the problem is conceptualized, modelled, and formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is further decomposed into sub-problems for ease and tractability. More importantly, we explore the benefits of utilizing the social ties formed by network users to improve energy efficiency and examine its overall impact on network performance. As such, a classical mathematical method is applied to solve the problem, and the results are compared to others obtained from several meta-heuristic algorithms. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is a better candidate to significantly improve the overall energy efficiency of the network.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

RF EMF Radiation Exposure Assessment of 5G Networks: Analysis, Computation and Mitigation Methods2021 IEEE AFRICON,  2021This paper presents the impact of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation expo... more This paper presents the impact of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation exposure induced by wireless networks, most importantly 5G cellular networks for both the uplink and downlink radio emissions using exposure index-based power control algorithm (EIPCA), a novel simulation method that quantifies the realistic electromagnetic exposure of the human user. The exposure index (EI) is used to characterize the EMF exposure taking in account the power density, specific absorption rate (SAR); using both the electric field strength and magnetic field strength as well as considering the variability of other factors such as environment, the conductivity and the mass density of tissue. This work aims at simulating the radiations emitted from access points (APs) and mobile devices, analyzing and comparing them with the threshold set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) for the understanding of radiation impact. The numerical results reveal that the maximum radiation exposure emitted is far lower than the ICNIRP standard. It is shown that the exposure from mobile devices (uplink) has more EI compared with the ones due with the transmitting stations (downlink) radio emissions, and both can be minimized when there is an optimal power control scheme in the network as revealed in the power density received from the APs. Moreover, it compares the exposure level in both the fourth-generation (4G) and the fifth-generation (5G) networks, this will increase the health awareness concerning radiation exposure of 5G networks to the general public.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Multi-Tier Multi-Domain Network Slicing: A Resource Allocation Perspective2021 IEEE AFRICON,  2021This paper addresses the dynamic resource allocation in a multi-slice multi-tier multi-domain bas... more This paper addresses the dynamic resource allocation in a multi-slice multi-tier multi-domain based network with different network players. The dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem from multi-player multi-domain perspective. Furthermore, a 3-level hierarchical business model comprising infrastructure providers (InPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), service providers (SP) and slice users is investigated. We propose a multi-tier multi-domain slice user matching game and a distributed backtracking multi-player multi-domain game schemes in solving the transformed maximum utility optimisation problem. We compare the multi-tier multi-tenant multi-domain game scheme with a genetic algorithm (GA) intelligent latency- aware resource allocation scheme (GI-LARE) and, a static slicing resource allocation scheme via Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms these other schemes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We explore the social-awareness of the network operators to efficiently match users during any form of peer-to-peer communication. Thus, we proposed a peer-selection scheme to improve the overall utility of the network amid limited spectral resources while exploiting the social-ties of network users’. Consequently, we formulate a utility maximization problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem to be solved using genetic algorithm. We perform extensive Monte-Carlo simulations alongside several meta-heuristic algorithms for comparison. The results reveal that our proposed scheme is a good candidate to appreciably and significantly improve the expected utility and network performance.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The gender balance (70% female) and the most commonly reported Long COVID/PASC symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, loss of concentration and forgetfulness, shortness of breath, as well as joint and muscle pains) were comparable to those reported elsewhere.
