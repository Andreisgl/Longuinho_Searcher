This study addresses this gap by empirically examining how SF investors select potential investees and the principles they judge important in SF. Our findings show that SF investors apply a combination of criteria to select investment projects where entrepreneurial motivations, environmental, social and governance commitments, and the nature of the impacts being generated align with their portfolio's mission. Though not all SF investors in our sample had knowledge about the concept of responsibility, they nonetheless mobilized a broad set of principles that are closely aligned with the aims and practices of RI. More research is needed to clarify the type of resources SF use to support RI and the conditions under which these resources are provided.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Entre os anos de 2002 a 2011, foram aprovados 487 projetos de municípios localizados em 22 estados brasileiros, com recursos de mais de R$ 900 milhões. Passados mais de 15 anos de criação do PMAT, a questão que se coloca é se os resultados dos projetos financiados justificam sua continuidade. O objetivo do artigo é apresentar evidências que auxiliem na resposta a essa questão, por meio da identificação de uma relação entre a implementação do PMAT e a arrecadação tributária em municípios selecionados. Os resultados sugerem que essa relação é positiva e que esse tipo de programa possui grande potencial para fortalecimento da administração pública municipal.

Drawing on secondary sources of data, the aim of this article is to generate a better understanding of the historical Research & Development dynamics that have contributed to shape today’s medical innovation ecosystem. We describe key technological achievements along three historical periods – the 1950s, the 1980s and the 2000s – and situate them within their broader political, social, cultural and economic contexts. Our analyses bring forward self-reinforcing dynamics between technology, medical specialization, individualization of disease and the concentration of resources in academic teaching centres. We argue that the way medical innovation has been financed, designed and commercialized since the 1950s has engendered path dependency, which exacerbates the sustainability challenges healthcare systems are now facing.

Is there a fit between incubators and ventures producing responsible innovations in health?by Hudson P Silva and Pascale LehouxHealth Policy and Technology,  2022Objectives: While Incubators and Accelerators (I/As) may help startups grow and survive, the bene... more Objectives: While Incubators and Accelerators (I/As) may help startups grow and survive, the benefits incubatees derive from I/As remains under debate. This is especially true for ventures in the health sector that face specific challenges and responsibility issues. The aim of this study is to explore when and how I/As supported 16 Canadian and Brazilian organizations producing responsible health innovations.Method: Nested within a broader case study, our mixed method strategy combines data from: (1) semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs (n = 37); (2) their answers to a survey; and (3) the websites of the I/As that supported their entrepreneurial journey. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analyses are performed.Results: Among the 30 I/As that supported 14 of our cases, only 7% focus on health. They mostly offer training (97%), followed by financial resources (47%) and infrastructure (27%). For-profit organizations more frequently obtained support from traditional I/As (75%) and not-for-profits from socially-oriented I/As (65%). While for-profits were supported at earlier stages, not-for-profits obtained support after reaching a late-stage venture maturity. Entrepreneurs described many distinct contributions from I/As, but finding the right kind of support was challenging.Conclusions: Our study provides empirical insights on the fit that should be sought between I/As and incubatees. Innovators seeking to address health inequalities, deliver affordable solutions and reduce their environmental impacts are well aligned with socially-oriented I/As. Support at early stages from I/As that are well positioned within a resourceful innovation system may have cumulative effects. Further research should examine whether not-for-profits receive too little support too late.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As of June 10, 2020, about 7.3 million cases and 413,000 deaths had been reported officially in the world 1. Although many countries have succeeded in flattening the SARS-CoV-2 transmission curve, the situation is particularly serious in Latin America, the region that has recently been considered the pandemic’s new epicenter according to the World Health Organization. Given this scenario, aggravated by the lack of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, various solutions have been proposed to combat the disease. Such solutions include tests for screening and diagnostic confirmation 2, nonpharmacological interventions at the individual, environmental and community levels to reduce the speed of the virus’ transmission 3, and technologies for patient treatment 4.

The goal of this paper is thus to document what is known about health systems’ demand for innovations. Methods: We searched 8 databases to perform a scoping review of the scientific literature on health system challenges published between January 2000 and April 2016. The challenges reported in the articles were classified using the dynamic health system framework. The countries where the studies had been conducted were grouped using the human development index (HDI). Frequency distributions and qualitative content analysis were performed.

Since few studies have conceptualized the relationships between RIH and the SDGs, our goal was to inductively develop a framework to identify knowledge gaps and areas for further reflections. Our exploratory study involved: (1) performing a web-based horizon scanning to identify health innovations with responsibility features; and (2) illustrating through empirical examples how RIH addresses the SDGs. A total of 105 innovations were identified: up to 43% were developed by non-profit organizations, universities or volunteers; 46.7% originated from the United States; and 64.5% targeted countries in Africa, Central and South America and South Asia. These innovations addressed health problems such as newborn care (15.5%), reduced mobility and limb amputation (14...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Neoliberal meritocracy and financial capitalism: consequences for social protection and healthCiencia & saude coletiva,  2018There is inherent tension between the idea of health as a social right and of health as a private... more There is inherent tension between the idea of health as a social right and of health as a private good. From the latter perspective, healthcare provision is brought closer to the logic of ownership, where access depends on ability to pay. The prioritization of markets (over governments), economic incentives (over social or cultural norms), and entrepreneurship (over collective or community action), one of the hallmarks of neoliberalism, constitutes a project to dismantle the welfare state, defined as a set of policy mechanisms designed to meet collective needs. This article examines the above process and its consequences for social protection and health by reflecting upon two phenomena that threaten the principle of health as a social right: neoliberal ideas and policies; and financial capitalism. We argue that the common good must be defended or insulated from the negative effects of financial capitalism and from the erosion and fragmentation of public institutions and social prote...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Though this scholarship offers a new lens to consider the challenges new health technologies raise for health systems around the world, there is a need to define the dimensions that specifically characterise responsible innovation in health (RIH). The present article aims to introduce an integrative RIH framework drawing on the RRI literature, the international literature on health systems as well as specific bodies of knowledge that shed light on key dimensions of health innovations. Combining inductive and deductive theory-building strategies and concomitant with the development of a formal tool to assess the responsibility of innovations, we developed a framework that is comprised of nine dimensions organised within five value domains, namely population health, health system, ec...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The challenges reported in the articles were classified using the dynamic health system framework. The countries where the studies had been conducted were grouped using the human development index (HDI). Frequency distributions and qualitative content analysis were performed. Results: Up to 1391 challenges were extracted from 254 articles examining health systems in 99 countries. Across countries, the most frequently reported challenges pertained to: service delivery (25%), human resources (23%)...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Unexplored Contribution of Responsible Innovation in Health to Sustainable Development GoalsSustainability,  2018Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH) represents an emerging Science, Technology and Innovation ... more Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH) represents an emerging Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) approach that could support not only the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) “Good health and well-being” but also other SDGs. Since few studies have conceptualized the relationships between RIH and the SDGs, our goal was to inductively develop a framework to identify knowledge gaps and areas for further reflections. Our exploratory study involved: (1) performing a web-based horizon scanning to identify health innovations with responsibility features; and (2) illustrating through empirical examples how RIH addresses the SDGs. A total of 105 innovations were identified: up to 43% were developed by non-profit organizations, universities or volunteers; 46.7% originated from the United States; and 64.5% targeted countries in Africa, Central and South America and South Asia. These innovations addressed health problems such as newborn care (15.5%), reduced mobility and limb amputation (14...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Neoliberal meritocracy and financial capitalism: consequences for social protection and healthCiencia & saude coletiva,  2018There is inherent tension between the idea of health as a social right and of health as a private... more There is inherent tension between the idea of health as a social right and of health as a private good. From the latter perspective, healthcare provision is brought closer to the logic of ownership, where access depends on ability to pay. The prioritization of markets (over governments), economic incentives (over social or cultural norms), and entrepreneurship (over collective or community action), one of the hallmarks of neoliberalism, constitutes a project to dismantle the welfare state, defined as a set of policy mechanisms designed to meet collective needs. This article examines the above process and its consequences for social protection and health by reflecting upon two phenomena that threaten the principle of health as a social right: neoliberal ideas and policies; and financial capitalism. We argue that the common good must be defended or insulated from the negative effects of financial capitalism and from the erosion and fragmentation of public institutions and social prote...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Introducing responsible innovation in health: a policy-oriented frameworkHealth research policy and systems,  Jan 10, 2018The scholarship on responsible research and innovation (RRI) aims to align the processes and outc... more The scholarship on responsible research and innovation (RRI) aims to align the processes and outcomes of innovation with societal values by involving a broad range of stakeholders from a very early stage. Though this scholarship offers a new lens to consider the challenges new health technologies raise for health systems around the world, there is a need to define the dimensions that specifically characterise responsible innovation in health (RIH). The present article aims to introduce an integrative RIH framework drawing on the RRI literature, the international literature on health systems as well as specific bodies of knowledge that shed light on key dimensions of health innovations. Combining inductive and deductive theory-building strategies and concomitant with the development of a formal tool to assess the responsibility of innovations, we developed a framework that is comprised of nine dimensions organised within five value domains, namely population health, health system, ec...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
