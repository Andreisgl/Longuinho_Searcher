Efundula: Wo men's Initiation, Gender and Sexual Identities in Colonial and Post-Colonial Northern NamibiaHeike A Becker2004, Re-thinking sexualities in AfricaThe time has come for re-thinking sexualities in Africa: The thinking beyond the conceptual structure of colonial and even post-colonial European imaginations, which have oscillated between notions of the exotic, the noble and the depraved savage, consistently however constructing Africans and African sexuality as something 'other'. This 'other' thing is constructed to be not only different from European/Western sexualities and self, but also functions to co-construct that which is European/Western as modern, rational and civilized.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIn: Rachel Spronk and Thomas Hendriks (Eds.).

Historically, both in academic and popular thinking, the term ‘sexuality’ most frequently elicited responses that have to do with biology. That is, whether as an area of study or as a set of ideas people have about their intimate lives, sexuality was too easily detached from the social contexts where it belongs and presented as something of itself. There is a strong tendency to view our sexual lives as dictated by their own peculiar rules that ( a ) are biologically derived, ( b ) have been historically stable (that is, the same since the ‘dawn of time’), ( c ) are ‘essentially’ about our ‘private’ lives, and ( d ) are ‘basically’ the same across different cultures. Ironically, while, on the one hand, we think of sexuality as a world-untoitself – such that it is regard...Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Historical ReviewSexuality, Africa, History2009 • Marc EpprechtDownload Free PDFView PDFHi St0ries 0f Desire: Sexuaities and cuIture in M0dern IndiaOf Identities and Other Desires 23 2 Of Identities and Other Desires Thinking about Sexualities2020 • Anirban DasDownload Free PDFView PDFHistory CompassThe Making of ‘African Sexuality’: Early Sources, Current Debates2010 • Marc EpprechtDownload Free PDFView PDF6.The making of ‘African sexuality’: early sources, current debatesMarc EpprechtThe notion that Africans share a common sexual culture distinct from people elsewhere in the world has for many years been a staple of popular culture, health, academic, and political discourse in the West as well as in Africa. Sometimes overtly racist (Black Peril) but sometimes intended to combat patronizing or colonialist stereotypes, the idea of a singular African sexuality remains an obstacle to the development of sexual rights and effective sexual health interventions. Where did the idea come from, and how has it become so embedded in our imaginations right across the political spectrum? This article traces the idea back in time to its earliest articulations by explorers, ethnographers, and psychiatrists, as well as to contestations of the idea in scholarship, fiction, and film influenced by Africa’s emerging gay rights movement. It asks, what can we learn about the making of ‘African sexuality’ as an idea in the past that may suggest ways to challenge its enduring,harmful impacts in the present?Download Free PDFView PDFIntroduction.
