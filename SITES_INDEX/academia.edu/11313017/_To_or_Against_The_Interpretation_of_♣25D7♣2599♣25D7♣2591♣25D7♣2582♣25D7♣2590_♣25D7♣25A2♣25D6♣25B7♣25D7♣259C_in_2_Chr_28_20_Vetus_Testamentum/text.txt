Isaiah 7-10 sees four children's names which through a play on words become signs of what happened to Judah and Israel through the provincialization policies of Assyria under Assyrian rulers Tiglath Pil-eser III, Shalmen-eser, Sargon, Sennacherib and Esar-haddon. The names of the children, Shaer Jashub, Immanuel, Maher Shalal hash Baz and Pele Yoetz El Gibbor Avi Ad Sar Shalom each signify aspects of the coming of the Kings of Assyria into Samaria from 734 BCE onwards. For example Israel is accused of Spoiling (shalal) the widows and preying (baz) on the orphans, so the child is named Quick To The Spoil (shalal), Hasten The Robbery (baz), and Assyria is described as carrying out these two actions, spoiling and robbing, to Israel, both in Isaiah's prophecy and in Assyrian inscriptions. The same method of naming children is used by Hosea in this period. Many of the plays on words are lost in the translation of the LXX and the fact that the child's names have multiple significance is used by the author of Matthew in the story of the name of Jesus. The two approaches of the LXX and the New Testament to the names is contrasted as reflecting seeds of Jewish Rabbinic and Jewish Christian approaches to Isaiah complex naming methods. This is a study of the meanings and prophetic significance of some of the most important of these children. One result of the research is that neither the Hebrew words almah or betulah mean exclusively virgin or exclusively young women, nor does the Greek translation parthenos mean exclusively virgin. Thus the debate between the Rabbis and the Saints of the Church appears to be unnecessary, because all words carry more than one meaning and application and this was Isaiah's intention. Thus this should impact the way scholars look at the Isaiah 7-10.Download Free PDFView PDFProphecy Influencing History: Dialogism in the Chronicler’s Ahaz NarrativePaul S EvansDownload Free PDFView PDFVetus Testamentum 64.4 (2014) 519-538Historicising Interpolations in the Isaiah-Memoir2014 • Csaba BaloghIn studies on the composition of prophetic literature, the larger textual layers reinterpreting earlier texts, the so-called Fortschreibungen, received much attention. It is well-known that beside these larger literary elaborations prophetic books also contain shorter explanatory interpolations, often called glosses, which intend to clarify a particular imagery of the prophecy (e.g., Isa 9:14). A systematic reading of these short annotations has been neglected, however, in studying the formation of prophetic books. The present article reconsiders the Isaiah-Memoir from this perspective. It identifies editorial interpolations in three distinct pericopes, Isa 8:2, 8:6-7a and 8:23b. It is argued here that the identification of such explanatory additions is the key to understanding notorious textual complexities. Moreover, it points out that these interpolations tend to expose recognisable patterns and common hermeneutical principles. Unlike Fortschreibungen, however, these interpolations are not concerned with the reapplication of the prophecy to the era of the editor, but they intend to guide the reader in understanding the prophecies in their original historical setting.Download Free PDFView PDFVetus TestamentumJudah’s Covenant with Assyria in Isaiah 282014 • Nathan MastnjakDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Book of Chronicles and colophonic chronography2018 • Patricia JelbertThis thesis examines the repeating citation formulae in the biblical book of Chronicles to discover their nature, purpose and function. The principle focus of this study will be on the repeating formulae, especially the citation references: “And the rest of the acts of King X, first and last, are found in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel,” or other such references. These usually appear at the end of each king’s reign. In addition, the ending of Chronicles which is repeated at the start of Ezra will be reviewed. Variously designated by different scholars as “titles,” “conclusion formulae” and even “Stichzeile” (catchlines), there is no scholarly consensus about these formulaic citations or their role within Chronicles. An overview of the history of scholarly views on authorship, dating and genre in the book of Chronicles is conducted here, where it may be seen that today there is no settled view on these isagogic elements, which would seem to justify not assuming the isagogi...Download Free PDFView PDFJonah 1.1-3.docBill WenstromDownload Free PDFView PDFVetus Testamentum2011.

II Kings 16:5-9 (and Isaiah 7) states that Tiglath-pileser helped Ahaz by repelling the attacks of the Syro-Ephraimite coalition, while II Chronicles 28:5-21 proclaims that Tiglath-pileser failed to help the Judean king. Previous studies have attempted to resolve the textual conflict by way of literary analysis or textual emendation. By undertaking an historical methodology of the biblical text and an examination of the Assyrian sources, the case is made that while the biblical accounts contradict each other in specific areas, there are key elements that are historically accurate in both accounts which are in complete accord with the Assyrian sources, and in turn clarify the biblical accounts.Download Free PDFView PDFNahumSalaam Hall ElReligious studies.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
