Shares of local revenues in terms of GDP are low compared to other Europeans countries, even those who like Slovenia did not entrust to municipalities the responsibility for paying teacher salaries. • Decentralization is institutional, not functional (subsection 3.2). Back in 2005, Macedonia transferred to municipalities a large selection of public institutions, but the laws, and the financing instruments, indicate that the functions were not in fact transferred. • Ineffective central control over employment levels (subsection 3.3). Macedonia maintains a strict and costly system of control over local employment, even in cases when an existing employee retires. The system hampers proper functioning of some of the decentralized institutions but allows employment expansion in other sectors. • Very low local financial involvement in the financing of decentralized sectors (subsection 3.4). Most decentralized institutions, even preschools, are financed almost exclusively from grants from the national budget, with very little local contribution from own revenues. They are not seen as own institutions by most municipalities. • Debts related to obligatory transport of students of secondary schools (subsection 3.5). For too long has Macedonia accepted without any intervention growing problem of blocked accounts of many secondary schools. The paper formulates three strategies and several specific recommendations how to overcome weaknesses of Macedonia system of local government finance and make it more transparent, predictable, and fair.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPublic Money for Public SchoolsThe First Careful Step: Education Decentralization and Finance in the Republic of Macedonia2009 • Jan  HerczyńskiDownload Free PDFView PDFPublic Money for Public SchoolsFinancing Education in Romania: A Legacy of Incomplete Reforms2009 • Jan  HerczyńskiDownload Free PDFView PDFFive European Systems of Local Government Finance2018 • Jan  HerczyńskiLocal government finance, especially the systems of grants from the national to local budgets, and other revenues streams of municipalities, counties, and regions, are highly specific for each country, as they depend crucially on legislation in force, on recent history, on the political process that takes place between different levels of governance. The five case studies presented in the report identify some of these country-specific characteristics of financing of local governments, tailored to the different needs and serving different allocation of managerial and expenditure responsibilities. In order to provide a consistent and useful perspective, the present report presents systems of local government finance in England, Denmark, Slovenia, Poland and Sweden, focusing on the revenues and expenditures. The core sections of five case studies are explanatory notes on simple tables of revenues and expenditures of local budgets. However, in order for these tables to intelligible, it was necessary to provide the context and detailed explanations of the legal and financial regulations. None of the reviewed systems can be transposed, in toto or in part, to Republic of Macedonia without a thorough review of required adaptations. At the same time, however, they provide some lessons which may be usefully considered by Macedonian reformers.Download Free PDFView PDFAnalyzing factors influencing intergovernmental grants distribution in Western Balkans–the case of Albania and MacedoniaDrini Imami, Elvina Merkaj, Mirjana  Sejdini, PhDDownload Free PDFView PDFNALAS Fiscal Decentralization Indicators Report for South-East Europe, 2006-2013, Fourth EditionNALAS Fiscal Decentralization Indicators Report for South-East Europe, 2006-2013, Fourth Edition2015 • Tony  Levitas, Elton Stafa, NALAS SECRETARIAT, NALAS - Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South-East EuropeThis is the fourth edition of the Report prepared by the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force, as an ongoing effort to provide national and local policy-makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South-East Europe. As before, we present a comparative picture of what has been happening in the region as a whole, but with increasing focus on monitoring the intergovernmental finances of individual countries. The report provides a reasonably clear picture of the structure, functions, and financing of local governments in South-East Europe today, as well as an overview of how intergovernmental financial relations have evolved over the economically turbulent period 2006-2013. The report has been used by member associations to argue for policy changes at home. It has also provided input for the design of the monitoring system of the regional strategy South East Europe 2020. The report is divided into three sections. The first discusses the data used in the report and some basic methodological issues. The second begins with a review of the structure and functions of municipal governments in South-East Europe, as well as a few important macro-economic indicators. It then presents comparative indicators of fiscal decentralization for the region as whole. The third section focuses on the changes in intergovernmental fiscal relations that have occurred within individual NALAS’ member countries/entities.Download Free PDFView PDFFinancing Decentralized Education in Macedonia2011 • Jan  HerczyńskiDownload Free PDFView PDFFISCAL DECENTRALIZATION IN MACEDONIA: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND CHALLENGES1Marjan NikolovThe public, donor community and the political subjects in Macedonia are occupied with the issues of decentralization. The bills package on territorial division, financing LSG and the status of the capital Skopje have passed the government/parliament procedure. In this paper some recent developments and challenges on the newly enacted law on financing LSG will be presented. We will use the main pillars of fiscal decentralization approach. Also, an attempt is made to estimate the fiscal capacity of LSG by using three techniques: the own revenue collection, GDP per LSG and the representative tax system with regression analyses. The deficiency here is the availability of data. Namely the revenue data are available for the NUTS 4 level that is the 34 LSG from the before 1996 territorial organization. Estimation is conducted for the unconditional horizontal equalization formula in accordance with the new law on financing LSG. In the end some administrative implication from the law are ill...Download Free PDFView PDFAn assessment of fiscal decentralization in MacedoniaJorge Martinez-vazquezDownload Free PDFView PDFFiscal Decentralisation Indicators for South-East Europe, Seventh Edition, 2018Fiscal Decentralisation Indicators for South-East Europe, Seventh Edition, 20182018 • NALAS - Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South-East Europe, Elton Stafa2018 NALAS’ Fiscal Decentralisation Report: Local services are exacerbated by the deterioration of local finance arrangements - There is an ongoing tendency of concentration of people in capital and metropolitan cities, despite the region’s diversity in terms of territorial organization. In Albania, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro over 20% of the population lives in the capital cities, which creates significant pressures and challenges for improved service delivery and intergovernmental finance systems. - Local government challenges to provide better services and improve the quality of life of citizens are exacerbated by a general stagnation or deterioration of local finance arrangements that are not able to keep up or quickly respond to local government needs and developments. - While it is difficult to judge the adequacy of local government revenues relative to their expenditure needs, there seems little question that in many places in the region municipalities are underfunded, and central governments are not giving them a fair share of the overall fiscal pie. On average, in 2017, SEE local government revenue as a share of GDP stood at 5.9%, almost half of their counterparts in the EU that benefit from an average of 10.7%. - The level of local fiscal autonomy is decreasing in many SEE countries. On average local government revenues in SEE decreased by 0.5% between 2015 and 2017, both as a percent of the GDP and Total Public Revenues. Further, compared to 2006, NALAS’s baseline year, the share of revenues over which local governments can exercise independent decision-making has decreased, while the share of conditional block grants and specific-purpose investment grants has increased by 50% and 30% respectively. - Local government powers to set and collect taxes, fees and charges are in continuous change – sometimes without a due process of consultation and/or compensation, under the general expectations of improved business climate and relieved fiscal burdens to taxpayers that would result in more job-creation. Unfortunately, this depresses local governments efforts too. -- Regardless of level of development and membership to the EU, SEE local governments continue to face similar challenges as regards to own revenue generation, including the frequent and continuous amendment of the legal framework; outdated fiscal registers; weak tax compliance and enforcement, while commitment of policymakers to make local taxation effective is critical everywhere in the region. Additionally, there seems to be an inverse relationship between the level of decentralisation measured by the scope of the social functions devolved to the local governments and the size of the public sector. The data suggests that surprisingly decentralisation has gone furthest in places where the overall public sector is relatively small, and to minor extent where potentially national governments face significant trouble collecting taxes. - The functional allocation of expenditures shows that SEE local governments spend most of their budgets on Education and Housing and Community Amenities: Education takes 40-60% of municipal budgets in Moldova, Slovenia, Kosovo and Bulgaria - which is 2-3 times more than the EU28 average. In Albania, Croatia and Turkey, local governments spend one quarter to one third of all expenditures on housing and community amenities. Environmental protection is the function where almost all SEE countries spend the least. - SEE local governments spend, on average, a third of their budgets on personnel wages/salaries costs which is almost equal to the EU and, while the share of spending for capital investments is, on average, twice as much as their counterparts in the EU. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the spending patterns of SEE as a region and individual countries, including historic data from 2006, both as a percent of the total, in million Euro or in Euro per capita.Download Free PDFView PDFNALAS Report: Fiscal Decentralisation Indicators for South-East Europe, 2006-2015, Sixth EditionNALAS Report: Fiscal Decentralisation Indicators for South-East Europe, 2006-2015, Sixth Edition2017 • Elton Stafa, Tony  Levitas, Zana Djukic, NALAS - Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South-East EuropeThis is the sixth edition of the Report, as an ongoing effort to provide policy–makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South–East Europe.
