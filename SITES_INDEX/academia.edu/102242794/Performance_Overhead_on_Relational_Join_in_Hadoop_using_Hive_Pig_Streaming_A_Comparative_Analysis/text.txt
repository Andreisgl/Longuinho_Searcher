This is unlike the way the relational mapping happens in traditional databases, where data structure is predefined. However, though big data has its own merits and demerits, and its strength lies in working on handling huge volume of data but it is worthwhile to understand how big data solves problems with varieties of data.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersA Multi-Nodal Implementation of Apriori Algorithm for Big Data Analytics using MapReduce Framework2020 • Hettie SoriyanThis paper developed a distributed algorithm for Big Data Analytics to address the delay in the processing of big data. In order to achieve the aim of this research, an inspection of organizational documents, direct observation and collection of existing data from the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Nigeria. The algorithm was formulated using Apriori Association Rule Mining and was specified using the enterprise application diagram. The implementation of the prototype for the algorithm was using MongoDB as the big data storage mechanism for the input. Comma Separated Values (CSV) files was used as the storage facility for the intermediate results generated during processing, and MySQL was used as the storage mechanism for the final output. Finally, Apache MapReduce as the big data multi-nodal processing platform and Java programming language as the implementation technology. This prototype was able to analyze different formats of data (i.e., pdf, excel, csv and images) wi...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Applied Information SystemsAn Empirical Exploration of the Yarn in Big Data2017 • Dr. Yusuf PerwejDownload Free PDFView PDFSurvey on Big dataIJSRD - International Journal for Scientific Research and DevelopmentBig data is the term for any collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data processing applications. The challenges include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and privacy violations. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on." Big data is difficult to work with using most relational database management systems and desktop statistics and visualization packages, requiring instead "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers". Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time. Big data "size" is a constantly moving target, as of its ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Computer ApplicationsComparative Study Load Balance Algorithms for Map Reduce Environment2014 • Hesham A.

Many challenges are posed to the traditional platforms due to the ever increasing data. In this paper, we have proposed a system which overcomes the challenges and is also beneficial to the business organizations. The proposed system mainly focuses on OLAP on Hadoop platform using Apache Kylin. Kylin is an OLAP engine which builds OLAP cubes from the data present in hive and stores the cubes in HBase for further analysis. The cubes stored in HBase are analyzed by firing SQL-like analytics queries. Also, reports and dashboards are further generated on the underlying cubes that provides powerful insights of the company data. This helps the business users to take decisions that are profitable to the organization. The proposed system is a boon to small as well as large scale business organizations. The aim of the paper is to present a system which builds OLAP ...Download Free PDFView PDFWeb Log Data Analysis: Converting Unstructured Web Log Data into Structured Data Using Apache Pig2017 • Neeta NiraulaData extraction and analysis have recently received significant attention due to the evolution of social media and large volume of data available in an unstructured form. Hadoop and MapReduce have been continuously implementing and analyzing large amount of data. In this paper Apache Pig, which is one of the high-level platform for analyzing large volume of data and runs on the top of Hadoop is used to analyze unstructured log files and extract information. In this paper, weblog server files are used to analyze and extract meaningful information in an unstructured form to a structured form in Apache Pig framework The main purpose of this paper is to extract, transform and load unstructured data in an Apache Pig framework and analyze the data and its performance on local mode as well as MapReduce mode. This paper further explains in brief about the different steps required to analyze unstructured web server log files in Apache Pig. This paper also compares the efficiency when a large...Download Free PDFView PDFAnalysis of Optional Architecture for Big Data ProcessingRan LYUThis report will cover the topic on Big Data Processing and requirements which need to be satis ed in order to achieve good performance in accessing information.
