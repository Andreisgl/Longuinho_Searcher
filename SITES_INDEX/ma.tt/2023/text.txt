WordPress.com just announced its hundred year plan. This was very fun to create and plan for, and I hope it gets people and other companies thinking about the long term. Very inspired by The Long Now Foundation and The Internet Archive. See also: Derek Siver’s Hundred Year Host.

Matt,  I’m interested.  Requires some thought to redesign my site and incorporate things that would make it worthwhile.  Go early, and think about 100 years…  I’m on it and welcome any site design tips.  Also need to know size or any other limitations.
