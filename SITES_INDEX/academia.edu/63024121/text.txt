Section 2 is a summary of Bourdieu's use of the concept of habitus against intellectualism and structuralism. Schatzki's criticism of Bourdieu from a purportedly Wittgensteinian perspective is also examined. Section 3 relates Bourdieu's use of habitus to a debate between Hubert Dreyfus and John McDowell about the role of concepts in action. Section 4 shows how McDowell's rejection of foundationalist elements in Dreyfus's account of action also raises problems for Bourdieu's account of action. Diamond's recent criticism of Winch is shown to have an interesting connection to this debate.Download Free PDFView PDFAsimaki, A., & Koustourakis, G. (2014). Habitus: An Attempt at a Thorough Analysis of a Controversial Concept in Pierre Bourdieu’s Theory of Practice. Social Sciences, 3(4), 121-131.Gerasimos KoustourakisThis work focuses on the approach to and analysis of the concept of habitus, and on tracing its relationship to the concept of practice within the framework of Pierre Bourdieu’s ‘theory of practice’. Based on these determinants, we attempted a thorough approach to the concept of habitus. Within the context of epistemological clarification we considered it essential to draw attention to its genealogy and the course of its development. Bearing in mind too the large number of discussions the controversial concept of habitus has provoked in the field of social sciences, we attempted to make reference to the most important relevant critical approaches. In the article’s concluding observations, the concept’s indisputable contribution to and influence on the field of social sciences is demonstrated, as is the notion that Pierre Bourdieu’s constructed concept of habitus attempts to put an end to fundamental divisions in sociology such as: objectivism-subjectivism, individual-society, conscious-unconscious.Download Free PDFView PDFBody & SocietyHabit and Affect: Revitalizing a Forgotten History2013 • Lisa BlackmanHabit is an integral concept for body studies, a hybrid concept and one that has provided the bedrock across the humanities for considering the interrelationships between movement and stasis, being and becoming, and process and fixity. Habits are seen to provide relay points between what is taken to be inside and outside, disrupting any clear and distinct boundary between nature and culture, self and other, the psychological and social, and even mind and matter. Habit thus discloses a paradox. It takes up a unique position in affect modulation, which encompasses both regulation (in the form of discipline) and also extends the body’s potential for engaging the new, change and creativity. In order to understand the basis of the ambivalent duality governing understandings of habit it is argued that a genealogical approach to this question is necessary. This will be located within the recent ‘turn to affect’ and histories of conation within the psychological sciences, particularly takin...Download Free PDFView PDFHabit and Affect: Revitalising a Forgotten History, Body & Society, Habit special issueLisa BlackmanDownload Free PDFView PDFUbuntu: Journal of Conflict and Social TransformationEmbodiment of particular ways of being: Habitus as an autobiographical narrative2020 • Nontsikelelo 'Ntsiki' O MapukataThis paper seeks to define my positionality as a researcher with a fixed cultural identity. The reflexive process is a critical undertaking for the research I'm embarking on that explores the making of a rural workforce. It is a means to an end as it channels me to examine my habitus in relation to Bourdieu's framework. In this paper, I situate the reader by relating events and experiences in my life that informed the attainment of my habitus. As a child, I learnt the nuances of the Xhosa language through story-telling. As I started my journey, I was endowed with cultural, symbolic and social capital. In a rural setting where I was raised, I became a learner in a community where books and stones as disposable objects became fixed assets that facilitated my transition to a higher education institution. As an adult, it was through the sustained efforts of others that I became a health care professional.Download Free PDFView PDF2009, « Habitus, Freedom and Reflexivity », in Theory and Psychology Volume 19, no. 6, pp. 728-755.Mathieu HilgersThe question of freedom is recurrent in the theory of habitus. In this paper I propose that the notion of freedom is an essential and necessary component for the coherence of the analyses which mobilize habitus both in terms of their theoretical articulation and in terms of their grounding in empirical reality. This argument can seem surprising considering that the theory of habitus has often been accused of being deterministic. Yet I show that, from an epistemological point of view, habitus theory is not deterministic. Bourdieu’s treatment of this concept implies at least three principles that exclude determinism: (1) the production of an infinite number of behaviors from a limited number of principles, (2) permanent mutation, and (3) the intensive and extensive limits of sociological understanding. After identifying and describing these principles, I show the reason for their incompatibility with a deterministic perspective and consider their implications for the corresponding model of action. I illustrate this analysis by a discussion of Loïc Wacquant’s carnal sociology of the pugilistic universe which reveals why it is essential to understand and explain the relation between habitus and freedom.Download Free PDFView PDFA History of Habit: From Aristode to BourdieuAlan RosenbergAccordingly, I take the volume at hand as a landmark achievement in its field. If it is taken as such, it deserves to be evaluated by stringent criteria. If such criteria are applied, a few observations should be made. All fifteen contributions in the book, bar two, explicitly mention the pragmatist tradition of philosophy and Mead's membership in it. However, not one of the contributions makes any analytic use of the following pragmatist principles that are central in Mead's thought as well: (l) A fallibilistic basic conception of human action, resulting in (2) a replacement of theory of knowledge by a theory ofinquiry. Further consequences of the above suppositions are more indirect, but just as important: (3) a new conception of meaning, by which meaning is understood (3a) from the logical point of view as constituted by triadic relations and (3b) from an empirically descriptive point of view as a phenomenon that widely transcends the human mind and human language , a phenomenon "almost coextensive with life" as Mead once put it. Accordingly, there is still some further work to be done in showing how timeless a thinker Mead really was (and is) and how his thought has firm roots in a unique tradition. This task has become much easier thanks to the contribution of the present volume. Lanham, Lexington, 2013, xi + 315, incl. index. The collection by Sparrow and Hutchinson gathers together (mostly) philosophers and (a few) sociologists to discuss the ever fascinating yet surprisingly underplayed theme of habit: its history and place in the western philosophical tradition, from the ancients to the contemporary scene. A collection such as this has been long overdue, and surprisingly so, given the centrality of habits in our understanding and organization of ourselves and of the world. We human beings are in fact complex bundles of habits embodied in practices. Hence, our limits and possibilities are at least partially governed by the way in which we habitu-ate, dishabituate, and re-habituate ourselves. Although their presence is widely acknowledged, what such bundles of habits are and even more interestingly what we can make of them (and of ourselves through them)Download Free PDFView PDF"The habitus and the critique of the present. A Wittgensteinian reading of Bourdieu's social theory", Sociological Theory 33(4), 2015: 327-346Mariano CroceI tackle some major criticisms addressed to Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus by foregrounding its affinities with Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion of rule-following. To this end, I first clarify the character of the habitus as a theoretical device, and then elucidate what features of Wittgenstein's analysis Bourdieu found of interest from a methodological viewpoint. To vindicate this reading, I contend that Wittgenstein's discussion of rule-following was meant to unearth the internal connection between rules and the performative activities whereby rules are brought into life. By portraying rules as tools that allow agents to stabilize and renegotiate practices, I illustrate the active role social agents play in the production of shared accounts of practices. I conclude by showing that, if viewed through this prism, the habitus proves to be meant to provide guidance on how social theory helps historicize and denaturalize the social world. Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the habitus, which an interpreter has plausibly defined as his " signature theoretical concept " (Emirbayer 2010: 41), is a highly debated intellectual tool. It emerged as " a creative blend of concepts " (Lizardo 2004: 376) originating from the legacy of proto-structural anthropology, post-Sausserian structural anthropology, phenomenology, and genetic structuralism (see e.g. Bourdieu 1990a: 12). It denotes a generative dynamic structure that disposes social agents to move within constrains that are set by the socio-historical conditions of its own production. Bourdieu's (1990b: 53) much-quoted definition depicts the habitus as a set of " durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations. " Put otherwise, the habitus is meant to account for the relationship between what the agents do in a given field and the multiple limits that constrain their actions within that field. As I will explain in more detail later on, this notion was intended to replace two opposite but equally flawed visions of social action: the idea that people's conduct is determined by invisible mechanisms that they are unaware of and the idea that people are guided by conscious rules and are the makers of free and autonomous decisions. According to Bourdieu, the habitus puts due emphasis on the continuous interplay between the limitation of possibilities imposed by the agents' past experience and the vast number of actions that are possible within those limits. However, the multiple formulations of this notion he provided in his many books and articles leave room for ambiguity. For example, in The State Nobility he avers that " practices are founded in habitus, which, in the most widely different domains of practice, tends to reproduce the conditions of its own production by producing the objectively coherent and systematically characteristic strategies of a particular mode of reproduction " (Bourdieu 1996: 272-73). In this picture, Bourdieu seems to fall prey of the fallacy that he himself calls " the abolition of the subject " (Bourdieu 1990a: 10), to the extent that it is the habitus that determines each of the steps taken by the agents, whose actions are doomed to reproduce the structures where they are performed. In other words, despite Bourdieu's stated objective to get rid of mechanisticDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
