Future progress in developing policy responses to “bad governance ” will depend on separately examining these heterogeneous elements – the security of property rights, the quality of bureaucratic performance, corruption, voice and accountability. Future progress will also depend on explicitly linking problems of governance to the overarching political environment and the incentives of governments to correct those problems.Save to LibraryDownloadby Philip Keefer•Literary Criticism in the 21st Century : Theory RenaissanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Kenneth Brewer•  9  Critical Theory, Art, Literature, Literary Theory「がん性痛のケアにおける麻酔科医の役割」によせてSave to LibraryDownloadby Takumi  Nagaro•River of Enterprise: The Commercial Origins of Regional Identity in the Ohio Valley, 1790–1850 .

Besides, recent advances in artificial intelligence-its accelerated development and significant impact on translation-open up a variety of pathways for reflection. In legal, financial or medical translation, preferences are gradually shifting from the human translator to machine translation, particularly with the advent of "neural" machine translation (NMT) systems. In a context where professional training, translation memories and software abound, human translators faced with many challenges, (re)consider the survival of their profession.

The official record, however, excludes the data that can explain the Aborigines&#39; stunning recovery. A painstaking investigation combining family histories; Victoria&#39;s birth, death, and marriage registrations; and census and archival records provides this information. One startling finding is that the surviving Aboriginal population is descended almost entirely from those who were under the protection of the colonial state.Save to LibraryDownloadby len smith•  12  Sociology, Genealogy, Politics, ColonialismThe Economy of the Greek Cities from the Archaic Period to the Early Roman Empire.

Of the fifteen operas presented by the Royal Academy of Music from 1724 to 1728, twelve, including seven by George Frideric Handel, featured settings in the Orient. Chosen by the directors of the Academy, who were also eic directors and investors, these Oriental settings kept the image of the East in front of aristocratic audiences, including important Members of Parliament, who had the power to assist the East India effort.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ellen T Harris•  9  Sociology, Politics, Applied Economics, Interdisciplinary HistoryA Most Magnificent Machine: America Adopts the Railroad, 1825-1862Save to LibraryDownloadby Keith Poole•  6  American History, United States History, Applied Economics, Interdisciplinary HistoryPatton and Rommel: Men of War in the Twentieth Century ?

A comprehensive treatise on international maritime law, trade practices, accounting methods, and above all an essay on financial instruments, Malynes' work constitutes an excellent case study for the way in which these relatively new phenomena were accounted for in the early seventeenth century, when many of the methods and practices that were originally conceived and developed many years before in the Italian Peninsula had already become global. My essay will focus on how Malynes built not just upon long-standing and well-established practices, but also upon a doctrinal tradition represented by authors such as Luca Pacioli, and how he turned to concepts from other disciplines and practices to make sense of paper-based semiotic artefacts like the bill of exchange, whose power to convey a significant amount of value on a "small peece of paper of some two fingers broad" he described as "the Spirit or Facultie of the Soule of Trafficke and Commerce". As he explained their nature and function, Malynes resorted to the vocabularies of disciplines like rhetoric, theology, and natural philosophy-including geometry, anatomy and what today we would call anthropology-to legitimise these financial semiotic artefacts and explain their performative power. The result was a combination of pre-existing discourse on money and finance with new ways of accounting for ever more sophisticated and innovative practices which situated them as part of a universal epistemology for the codification and administration of information and knowledge in finance and trade.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jose Maria Perez Fernandez•  6  Semiotics, Economic History, Early Modern economic and social history, History of knowledgeThe Colonial Spanish-American City.

Although the digitization of census data and other records now enables the tracking of nineteenth-century Americans far more accurately than in the past, scholars have not utilized such data to determine whether the Famine Irish were, in fact, trapped on the bottom rungs of the American socioeconomic ladder. The use of a longitudinal database of Famine immigrants who initially settled in New York and Brooklyn indicates that the Famine Irish had far more occupational mobility than previously recognized. Only 25 percent of men ended their working careers in low-wage, unskilled labor; 44 percent ended up in white-collar occupations of one kind or another—primarily running...Save to LibraryDownloadby Tyler Anbinder•  15  Poverty, Immigration, Migration, Applied EconomicsBlack Market Capital: Urban Politics and the Shadow Economy in Mexico City.

Lower temperatures meant less bacterial activity, a slower release of mineral nitrogen into cultivated soils, and a shorter growing season for crops—a combination that tended to diminish yields. The English farmers reacted by increasing the flow of organic matter and manure into the soil, thus mitigating the negative effect of the colder temperatures to some extent. When the temperatures rose again, the faster mineralization of soil organic matter led to bountiful yields that encouraged English farmers to continue with these innovative strategies. The upshot is that the English agricultural revolution was more a discovery than an invention, that the English agricultural revolution was more a discovery than an invention, induced by a combination of climate challenges, social and institutional settings, and market incentives.Save to LibraryDownloadby Verena Winiwarter•  9  Economics, Agronomy, Agriculture, Applied EconomicsAll Can Be Saved: Religious Tolerance and Salvation in the Iberian Atlantic WorldSave to LibraryDownloadby Karin Velez•  20  History, Art, Bibliography, Atlantic WorldThe Struggle for Power in Early Modern Europe: Religious Conflict, Dynastic Empires and International Change.

As those heavily depend on individual land use decisions, the agent-based model of regional structural change AgriPoliS is applied to assess carbon losses resulting from behaviors and interactions of individual farms. The extended model now considers nitrogen input and the development in soil&#39;s carbon content. Three scenarios are implemented where farms have either to use 7%, 15% or 25% of their land as ecological focus area (EFA). Results show that although carbon losses continue at a slower pace under the 7%-scenario, 25% of the land is to be set aside to stop them completely. However this implies short-term income losses for farmers but better plant resistance and improved soil productivity in the long-run if soil organic matter can be maintained.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christoph Sahrbacher•  7  Environmental Science, Agroforestry, Productivity, Soil organic matterThe Evolution of Models in Historical DemographyHistorical demography is in transition from a data-poor to a data-rich environment.

Previous generations relied on demographic models to squeeze as much information as possible from the small amounts of data available. In this new era of large data sets, researchers are creating both regional and international historical data sets of unprecedented size and depth. When examined closely, however, the regression methods used today make the same simplifying assumptions that generated the key advances of earlier generations. These new methods require demographic insight to inform analyses and enrich conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadby George Alter•  5  History, Geography, Applied Economics, Interdisciplinary HistoryDrugs and Narcotics in HistorySave to LibraryDownloadby Walter Sneader•  20  History, Economic History, Psychiatry, EconomicsNextLast »Related TopicsHistorical StudiesFollowFollowingInformaciónFollowFollowingInfografiaFollowFollowingApplied EconomicsFollowFollowingAustralian PoliticsFollowFollowingCritical sociology and politics of educationFollowFollowingTechnology of EducationFollowFollowingCultural_StudiesFollowFollowingPolitics of the BodyFollowFollowingInterdisciplinary StudiesFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
