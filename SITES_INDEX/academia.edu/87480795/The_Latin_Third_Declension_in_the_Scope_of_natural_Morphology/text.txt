We comment on potential system of Latin inflection and the classification of default and non default forms within the macroclass of the 3" declension nouns given by him. We add the model of the macroclass of the 3", declension adjectives. Some criteria of productivity of the consonantal, i-and mixed classes are dealt with. as well. (b) Referring to material in Grammatici Latini (Priscianus) we observc the functioning of extramorphological (phonological. semantic and morphosemantic) properties. Within Priscianus' model one extramorphological property or a simple combination of properties does not predict pamdigm structure conditions of only one and not some other class. Nor can we rely on Priscianus' implications among morphological properties.

It attributes essentially all of it to the influence of adjacent features of standard segmental phonology on morphemes expressing case assignment. Indeed, other languages lead linguists to expect that allomorphy at a stem-suffix border can depend on any feature of a final vowel: ±Low, ±High, ±Round, ±Back, ±Consonantal or ±Syllabic. Empirically, it turns out that no two Latin stem-final vowels induce identical allomorphy in case/number suffixes, nor the same allomorphy as final consonants. Moreover, some (not much) phonologi-cally conditioned allomorphy is phonetically opaque. These two factors have led traditional scholarship to conclude that each stem-final segment should define a separate classification of noun suffixation or “declension”. As there are basically six types of final segment (a, o, u, i, e and consonants), each then gives rise to a different declension (stems with final i are often put in some other group or considered irregular), thus creating five (or six) declensions. Tradition then goes on to analyze stem-final vowels not as part of stems but as some kind of separate morphemes called “thematic vowels” (with no role in either syntax or phonology). This essay argues rather that an unflinching modern and formal approach to inflectional allomorphy, exactly analogous to using phonology to reduce regular English plurals to a single lexical form, succeeds in sweeping away the sandcastle of Latin declensions and better captures the actual descriptive generalizations that account for Latin case inflection.Download Free PDFView PDFSome Remarks on the Genitive of the Latin Third Declension and its Faliscan Pendant 1Ludmila BuzassyovaDownload Free PDFView PDFIn Search of the Regional Diversification of Latin: Changes of the Declension System According to the InscriptionsBéla  AdamikDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Influence of Latin to the English Language: Morphological and Lexical FeaturesRafael Damas QuilesThis paper examines the enormous productivity of Latin in the English language throughout time. Influences, however, will be remarked on the lexical and morphological fields. Therefore, due to length restrictions, other aspects such as phonology will be overlooked. Firstly, the general linguistic, historical and social contextualization of Latin will be described. In other words, it will be analyzed how Latin came into contact with English. Afterwards, different periods of influence will be covered, as well as the morphological heritage that the English language took from Latin, ranging from derivation (i.e. prefixation and suffixation) to inflectional and compound processes. In all cases, the most illustrative examples will be offered. Finally, the etymological explanation will help to establish certain parallelisms between Latin and English. Thereby, it will be essential to state the idea, that English and Latin share numerous similar features, is still present, despite belonging to different language families, as well as their own peculiarities, which is to say, those properties that make both languages different in comparison to other ones.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Structure of the Italian Declension System2009 • Paolo AcquavivaDownload Free PDFView PDFThe nature of phonological conditioning in Latin inflectional allomorphy (Prepublication)András CserThis paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the inflectional morphology of Classical Latin in terms of allomorphic alternations and the phonological environments governing the distribution of allomorphs. It is demonstrated that all the attested cases of inflectional allomorphy (nominal as well as verbal) can be described as binary functions of a vocalic scale, practically the sonority scale of vowels plus the undifferentiated class of consonants as the least sonorous extreme. The distribution of allomorphs along the vocalic scale crucially displays the property of contiguity, i.e. the subsections of the scale that trigger one particular allomorph are uninterrupted.Download Free PDFView PDF Mechanisms of language change in Latin1979 • Tore JansonDownload Free PDFView PDFLinguisticae Dissertationes.

In particuar we show that two asymmetries in the formation of the perfect stem are deeply related, that is the analytic strategy with deponent verbs, and the 'affix-deletion' of -sc, -n, -j with verbs with marked present stem. We claim that, in both cases, the asymmetries are due to the impossibility of managing via normal affixation a complex syntactic constituent in which the Perfect layer interacts either with non active Voice or Action.Download Free PDFView PDFThe alleged "lengthened" grades in the roots of some Latin nounsLucie  PultrovaThe article is concerned with Latin primary deverbative nouns whose lengthened root vowel is non-standard, as follows from the analysis given in Pultrová (2011a). In all the studied cases, the lengthening concerns the words with the roots ending in a voiced occlusive. Building on the analysis carried out in this article, I propose the hypothesis that vowel lengthening is the result of the shift of the original accent from the final syllable to other positions in the word.Download Free PDFView PDFActa Linguistica HungaricaThe nature of phonological conditioning in Latin inflectional allomorphy2015 • András CserDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
