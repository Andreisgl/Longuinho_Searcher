For its noticeable effect on improving the fuel-air mixing process and reducing raw emissions, it has been accepted and applied widely. Double swirl combustion chamber, as one of the most important components of the DSCS, plays an important role to affect the fuel-air mixing processes and the fuel-air mixture quality which controls the combustion processes. Hence, make the further researches on the DS combustion chamber and design an optimized DS combustion chamber is very necessary and important. However, there has no reports about the researches on the configuration parameters of DS chamber have been published. Therefore, the authors make the research on parametric design of DS combustion chamber, to find out the main configuration parameters of DS chamber, and then explore how those configuration parameters affect the performance of DS chamber. In this paper, the authors make analysis on the configuration structure detailedly, and determine the crucial configuration parameters of DS chamber, and then, the authors make series of simulation researches on those parameters to reveal their effect rules, and indicate the design direction of DS chamber based on those results.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

New species of Saurichthys (Actinopterygii: Saurichthyidae) from Middle Triassic (Anisian) of Yunnan Province, ChinaActa Geologica Sinica-english Edition,  2009Saurichthys dawaziensis sp. nov., from the third member of the Gejiu Formation (Anisian of Middle... more Saurichthys dawaziensis sp. nov., from the third member of the Gejiu Formation (Anisian of Middle Triassic) in the vicinity of Luoping, Yunnan Province, is a small to medium- sized saurichthyid fish. It is characterized by the efferent pseudobranchial arteries penetrating on the parasphenoid and the mandible sensory canal with a branch in the angular. The new species is more derived than the Lower Triassic species in having a relatively narrow postorbital region, short preopercular, single ossification of the sclerotic ring, small haemal arches between the pelvic fins and the anal fin without ossified spines, and in the absence of quadratojugal. It is more primitive than the Middle and Upper Triassic Saurichthys in having fringing fulcra and numerous segments in the unpaired fins, and the presence of both prae- and post-zygapophyses in the neural arches. Some anatomic changes related to the vertebral column and unpaired fins of the genus are also discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A New Perleidiform (Actinopterygii, Osteichthyes) from the Middle Anisian (Middle Triassic) of Yunnan, South ChinaActa Geologica Sinica-english Edition,  2009Two complete specimens from the Pelsonian (Middle Anisian, Middle Triassic) of Luoping, Yunnan Pr... more Two complete specimens from the Pelsonian (Middle Anisian, Middle Triassic) of Luoping, Yunnan Province, South China are referred to a new actinopterygian genus, Luopingichthys gen. nov., and ascribed to the perleidiform family Polzbergidae based especially on a typical synapomorphy of a peculiar premaxillary-maxillary complex, i.e., the fusion between premaxillary and maxillary along the antero-dorsal margin of the maxillary. The new taxon differs from other deep-bodied representatives of the family, Felberia and Stoppania, in its fusiform or deep fusiform body shape; sickle-shaped preopercular with short infraorbital process; lack of modified scales at the base of the anal fin; the short-based dorsal fin; scarcely ornamented scales; and thin anterior teeth. Based on a redescription of the holotype of the taxon Ctenognathichthys hattichi from the Middle Triassic (Ladinian) Prosanto Formation, Canton Graubünden, eastern Switzerland, the only known specimen, which shows the same fusion between premaxillary and maxillary, the systematic position of the species is clarified and the taxon is proposed to be a further representative of the family Polzbergidae, and is transferred to the new genus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ten marine reptile taxa have been found from the 1.82–2.10 m-thick fossiliferous level in the Upper Member of the Guanling Formation, which can be subdivided into three marine reptile beds through the analysis on the stratigraphic distributions of fossil reptiles. The Lower Reptile Bed yields the sauropterygians Placodus inexpectatus Jiang et al., 2008 and Lariosaurus hongguoensis Jiang et al., 2006, the ichthyopterygians Xinminosaurus catactes Jiang et al., 2008 and Phalarodon cf. Phalarodon fraasi Merriam, 1910, associated with Mixosaurus panxianensis Jiang et al., 2006, representing a stage of predominance of durophagous taxa. In this bed, the large complete skeletons may reach up to 2.3 m in length, and lithofacies and chemostratigraphic analyses indicate a relatively deep carbonate platform with an oxic water environment near the bottom, as well as a rising sea level. The Middle Reptile Bed yields the sauropterygian Nothosaurus yangjuanensis Jiang et al., 2006 and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus Li et al., 2006, associated with Mixosaurus panxianensis Jiang et al., 2006. The fossils in this bed are characterized by its pincering dentition and large overall body size, with the largest possibly exceeding 3 m in length. This bed might represent a time of deepest basin with relatively anoxic condition near the bottom. The Upper Reptile Bed yields the sauropterygians Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis Jiang et al., 2008, Keichousaurus sp., the protorosaur Dinocephalosaurus orientalis Li, 2003, and the ichthyopterygian Mixosaurus panxianensis Jiang et al., 2006. In this bed, reptilian taxa characterized by suction feeding appeared, and most are less than 1 m long. This bed corresponds to a period of decreasing water depth.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
