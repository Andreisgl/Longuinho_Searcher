The multiple traffic-light label is one example of FOPL that indicates the content of target nutrients in products by displaying red (high), amber (medium), and/or green (low) color-coding. The red code may implicitly enhance sweetness perception and approach dispositions toward sweet UPP via cross-modal visual-taste interactions. We conducted two experiments to examine the possibility of contradictory influence of explicitly learned and implicit cross-modal associations on the emotional responses evoked by UPP pictures. In both experiments , we first explicitly associated the color codes with health-related meanings. In Experiment I (n = 78), a psychometric tool estimated the emotional responses (pleasantness and arousal ratings) evoked by UPP pictures when preceded by red, amber, or green color-codes. In Experiment II (n = 24), we recorded participants' electrocortical brain activity to assess the early posterior negativity (EPN) component as an index of the emotional responses to UPP. The reported pleasantness (Experiment I) and the EPN amplitude (Experiment II) were greater for sweet UPP relative to salty UPP when primed with red codes but not when primed with green or amber. A red code increased positive emotions toward sweet UPP despite its explicit association with increased health-risks. Thus, the use of multiple traffic-lights might lead to an unintended implicit approach behavior toward sweet UPP. Designers, researchers, and policy makers may consider color-taste cross-modal associations when designing, testing, and applying FOPL.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNeuromarketing empirical approaches and food choice: A systematic reviewRinaldy NugrahaA B S T R A C T Consumers' food choices are often driven by reasons of which consumers are not fully aware. Decision-making about food is influenced by a complex set of emotions, feelings, attitudes, and values that are impossible to assess simply by asking consumers their opinions. Indeed, traditional techniques, such as self-reports or interviews, mainly allow the measurement of conscious and rational reactions to a product or advertising. Recently, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the multidisciplinary field of " neuromarketing, " which takes advantage of neuroscientific techniques to study consumer behavior. This discipline applies neuroscientific methods and tools that allow the measurement of consumers' emotional and spontaneous reactions in a more objective and observable way. The aim of this paper is (a) to describe neuromarketing's underlying assumptions, techniques, and the advantages of this perspective, examining the scientific literature on the use of neuromarketing in food studies; and (b) to suggest best practices to apply this novel approach in the food marketing domain, with a specific focus on non-invasive methods. Finally, although the perception of nutritional elements has already been explored, the health content of labels, the presence of additives, and the evaluation of the information conveyed by food packaging remain other possible elements of interest in future food neuromarketing research.Download Free PDFView PDFPlating manifesto (II): the art and science of platingCharles MichelDownload Free PDFView PDFFrontiers in PsychologyFood-pics: an image database for experimental research on eating and appetite2014 • Jens BlechertDownload Free PDFView PDFEating BehaviorsImplicit and explicit attitudes to high- and low-calorie food in females with different BMI status2008 • Reiko Graham, Maria CzyzewskaThe study compared implicit and explicit attitudes to three types of foods (high-calorie non-sweet HCNS, high-calorie sweet HCS and low-calorie LC) among females varying in BMI status. Eight three participants completed an affective priming task (implicit attitudes), followed by explicit rating of food images. The results of ANOVA showed a significant difference in implicit attitudes to different types of food, F(3,246) = 3.90, p < .01 and the difference among BMI groups (F(6, 213) = 2.15, p < .05). The implicit attitudes to HCS were positive in the healthy-weight and overweight groups but negative in obese; the reversed pattern was revealed in attitudes to HCNS. All groups showed negative implicit attitudes to LC foods. The ANOVA performed on explicit ratings revealed a significant effect of food type (F(3,213) = 22.54, p < 001) but no interaction between food type and BMI status. All participants rated HCNS significantly lower than HCS and LC foods. Our results indicate dissociation in implicit and explicit attitudes to foods among BMI groups, especially in attitudes to HCNS and HCS foods.Download Free PDFView PDFGrounding language in the neglected senses of touch, taste, and smell Grounding language in the neglected senses of touch, taste, and smellLaura SpeedDownload Free PDFView PDFInfluence of Taste Quality on Affective StateAlexander B.

In Experiment 1, the shape (rounded vs. angular) and visual appearance (greyscale, red-to-yellow and blue-to-green colour schemes) of the packaging were manipulated. Dependent measures were preference (willingness to purchase the product, how attention-capturing the packaging is, and the pleasantness of the de- sign) and any taste associations. In Experiment 2, shape (rounded vs. angular), colour (red-to-yellow vs. blue-to-green colour schemes), and product category (buttery vs. cereal cookies) were manipulated. In this case, the dependent measures were the perceived product healthiness and the preference of consumers. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that packaging colour influenced product preference. Red-to- yellow and blue-to-green colour schemes and angular packaging were preferred over greyscale and round packaging. Colour also influenced taste associations, while shape only influenced ratings of expected sweetness. In Experiment 2, packaging shape and product category influenced product preference. In particular, rounded packaging and the packaging of buttery cookies were preferred over angular packag- ing and the cereal cookies packaging. The healthiness of the product was rated higher for the rounded and red-to-yellow packaging containing a buttery product. Taken together, these results highlight the important role played by colour, shape, and cat- egory on the expectations and associations elicited by viewing product packaging.Download Free PDFView PDFAppetiteAlliesthesia is greater for odors of fatty foods than of non-fat foods2011 • Jane PlaillyDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Relation Between Valence and Arousal in Subjective Odor ExperienceAlexander ToetDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
