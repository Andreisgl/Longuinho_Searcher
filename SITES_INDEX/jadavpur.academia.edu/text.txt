In this study, a supervised classification was applied to five types of Landsat images collected over time (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015) that provided recent and historical LULC conditions for the area. Four LULC categories were identified and mapped. Post-classification comparisons of the classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren land changing into agricultural land. This analysis revealed that substantial growth of built-up areas in the south eastern part of Kolkata over the study period resulted in significant decrease in the area of water bodies, cultivated land, vegetation and wetlands. Urban land transformation has been largely driven by large number of population and high population growth rate with r...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cloud computing is a set of possessions and services that are on hand by the network or internet. Cloud computing extend a variety of computing techniques like grid compute, distributed computing. Today cloud computing is used in both industrial pasture and educational field. As the meadow of cloud computing is scattering the new technique are increasing. This amplifies in cloud computing location also increases security challenges for cloud developers. Users of confuse save their data in the shade hence the lack of security in cloud can lose the user’s trust. In this paper we will discuss some of the cloud security issue in a mixture of aspects like multi-tenancy, stretch, accessibility etc. the paper also argue existing security technique and approaches for a protected cloud.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Different metropolitan cities all over the world experienced city growth in different time period. Kolkata is one of the cities among them. At present, the population of Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) is growing at a faster rate than the city core. This is because Kolkata city is totally saturated, and as a result, demand for land within city core is increasing and it creates extreme pressure on land. The land price of the city core areas is beyond the affordable limit of the people so people are moving towards fringe areas. This paper attempts to show the temporal changes of the mean centre of population in and around Kolkata city. It also tries to analyse the changing nature of land use for which supervised classification techniques have been used. This study reveals that the shifting centre of population is from south to north-eastern side of Kolkata on the eastern side of the river Hooghly.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Land Cover Classification and Change Analysis in the Southern Fringe of Kolkata Metropolitan Area by Spatio Temporal Remote SensingANNALS of the National Association of Geographers India,  2019Understanding the change in land use and land cover pattern is very much crucial for the future p... more Understanding the change in land use and land cover pattern is very much crucial for the future planning and development of an area. In most of the metropolitan cities the rate of changes of land use and land cover in the peripheral areas is very rapid. Kolkata is one of the metropolitan cities in India which have experienced rapid changes of land use and land cover in recent decades. This study aims to find out the trends of land use and land cover change in the southern fringe of Kolkata Metropolitan Area in the last thirty five years. The objective of the study is to analyze the nature, trends and pattern of land use land cover changes between the years 1980 to 2015. Land cover types were classified through supervised classification using multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The land cover products were then validated and overlaid in post-classification comparison to detect the changes between the years 1980 to 2015. Four land use and land cover classes, namely built up area, vegetation, water body and fallow land has been identified. This study reveals that conversion of water bodies, vegetation and low lying areas to urban area has given birth to the unplanned growth of settlements and associated problems. These are the main negative outcomes associated with the rapid urban development of this region.

The rate of urban growth is more rapid in developing countries than the developed countries. India is one of the developed countries and Kolkata is one of the major cities in India, where this study has been carried out. Kolkata city has been developing very fast in recent decades because of huge infrastructural development from the end of the Nineteenth century. Peripheral areas of Kolkata city are more unplanned than the city core areas which are the main obstacles to transform Kolkata city into a smart city. The objective of this study is to identify the spatial determinants of urban growth in Kolkata city. This study introduces a model, namely, Urban Growth Deterministic Model to control the rate of urbanization and urban growth. For the analysis, both satellite images and statistical analysis have been done. Findings reveal that among the factors population density, male workforce, female workforce, secondary workers, waste land, built-up area, availability of bus service and railway service are the major determinants of urban growth in Kolkata city.This study will help the policy makers to formulate policies to minimize various problems of Kolkata city which will be helpful for future planning and management of the area.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

But the noticeable fact is that though it is a colonial city but it has no proper master plan like the other major cities of India. So Kolkata city has grown in a haphazard way besides of the river Hooghly. Kolkata city is now growing towards south direction as it can be seen from the analysis of the satellite images. Maheshtala Municipality plays a leading role in this southward growth of city. This paper attempts to scrutinize the nature of demographic change of Maheshtala Municipality from 2001-2011 present land use pattern of this area with its changing land price. To visualize and analyze the land use pattern of this municipality Erdas Imagine 14 software has been used. To scrutinize the evaluation of land price of 2000, 2005 and 2015 Price Index Techniques (PIT) have been used. This study reveals that accessibility from the other areas; lots of open space and relatively low price of land are the major causes behind the rapid growth and development of this municipality.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In case of a smart city, the uses of information technology are high than the old cities or any other newly developed cities. Govt. of India, has taken the decision to develop or redevelop those cities in a sustainable way. Kolkata is one of the largest cities in the eastern part of India. The demographic growth rate of Kolkata city is relatively higher than the other cities in India. The objective of this paper is to scrutinize the transport and communication scenarios of Kolkata city and what needs to be done to make Kolkata city more sustainable and smart in transport. This study reveals that most of the people prefer private taxi and bus services during their trips.
