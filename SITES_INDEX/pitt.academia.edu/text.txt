Not much is known about the relationship between Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and SJL; however, the sleep/wake cycle is very vulnerable to disruption by external factors. In a previous study in adolescents and young adults, self-reported chronotype was used to calculate SJL, and winter mood variation and SJL were found to be higher after the time change in fall and winter. Our study will directly compare SAD and non-depressed controls in the winter on SJL calculated with actigraphy in a sample of adults. Methods Participants (N=46) ages 21-64 were recruited during winter months and included individuals with SAD (n=21) and nonseasonal, never depressed controls (n=25). Midsleep timing was measured using actigraphy (average number nights = 7), and SJL was calculated by subtracting average week midsleep from average weekend midsleep corrected for numb...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
0648 Retinal responsivity is associated with light and season-related cognitions in older adults with seasonal depressionSLEEPIntroduction Maladaptive cognitions associated with lower light availability in winter and the ch... more Introduction Maladaptive cognitions associated with lower light availability in winter and the changing of the seasons are elevated in winter depression and are treatment targets in psychotherapy. Mechanisms underlying the development of SAD-specific cognitions may be related to seasonal variation in melanopsin-driven retinal responsivity to light. Prior work has shown reduced retinal responsivity to light during the winter in seasonal depression. We hypothesized maladaptive seasonal cognitions would be associated with reduced retinal responses to light. We also tested whether age moderated this relationship, hypothesizing that this learned association may only appear in older individuals who have experienced a greater number of seasonal depressive episodes. Methods Participants ages 19-65 (M=36.13, SD=12.81) with seasonal depression (n=37) and non-depressed controls (n=32) completed assessments in winter months (21st December to 21st March).

Understanding mechanisms of light therapy may help predict who will successfully respond to treatment. Individual differences in the retina’s responsivity to light may underlie differences in treatment response given prior work linking reduced retinal responsivity in seasonal depression. This study tested if retinal responsivity changed across a light therapy intervention and whether changes in retinal responsivity were associated with improved depression. Methods Participants diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, With Seasonal Pattern were randomized to 6 weeks of light therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy for seasonal affective disorder (CBT-SAD). Participants in the light therapy group (N=52) were on average 41.9 years (SD=14.8) and predominantly women (72%). Retinal responsivity was assessed using the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR), measured mid-day in ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Retinal responsivity is lower in SAD in the winter and may contribute to the seasonal pattern of mood disruption (Roecklein et al., 2021). Light exposure in the month prior has been shown to influence retinal responsivity (Kawasaki et al., 2018). No work to date has investigated how more proximal prior light history may influence retinal responsivity differently in individuals with SAD versus controls. This study sought to examine group differences in how environmental blue light exposure impacts retinal responsivity in the 2 hours prior. Methods Participants included 19 never depressed controls (Mean Age = 33, SD = 11), and 17 individuals diagnosed with SAD (Mean Age = 36, SD = 10). SAD episode criteria were assessed using the SCID-5 and SIGH-SAD.

Altered responsivity to light reflects ipRGC functioning and may be a physiological vulnerability for disrupted photoentrainment. Understanding how retinal responsivity relates to sleep and circadian timing may inform who might most benefit from sleep and circadian interventions. Methods 64 participants (85 observations) ages 20-66 years old were recruited during winter (n=35) and summer months (n=50), and included individuals with seasonal depression (n=33) and nonseasonal, never depressed controls (n=31). The post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to red and blue light was used to measure the responsivity of ipRGCs (average 1:30pm; 10am-7pm). Circadian phase was assessed using Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO), collected every 30-minutes on Friday evenings.

The Post-Illumination Pupil Response (PIPR) can assess melanopsin cell responsivity, with applications for sleep disorders, mood disorders, and circadian entrainment. Lighter pigmented irises allow more light to pass through the retina. The present study tested an association between the PIPR and iris pigmentation. Methods Participants (N=49) included seasonal depression (n=26) and never-depressed controls (n=23). Photos of participants’ irises were rated using both the Franssen (2008) scale, a set of 24 standardized iris photos, and the Mackey (2011) scale, a 9-category rating system. Red and blue stimuli 13.5 log photons/cm2/s were presented, and infrared pupillometry measured pupil diameter for 40 seconds. We used multilevel regression with a random intercept of participant to predict the PIPR from each iris rating system separately, controlling for ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
