Effects of amiodarone and posaconazole on the growth and ultrastructure of Trypanosoma cruziby Tecia Maria Ulisses Carvalho and Emile BarriasInternational Journal of Antimicrobial Agents,  2012The antifungal posaconazole (PCZ) is the most advanced candidate for the treatment of Chagas dise... more The antifungal posaconazole (PCZ) is the most advanced candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease, having potent anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity in vitro and in animal models of the disease as well as an excellent safety profile in humans. Amiodarone (AMD) is the antiarrhythmic drug most frequently used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic Chagas disease patients, but it also has specific anti-T. cruzi activity. When used in combination, these drugs exhibit potent synergistic activity against the parasite. In the present work, electron microscopy was used to analyse the effects of both compounds, acting individually or in combination, against T. cruzi. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) against epimastigote and amastigote forms was 25 nM and 1.0 nM for PCZ and 8 μM and 5.6 μM for AMD, respectively. The antiproliferative synergism of the drugs (fractional inhibitory concentration&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;0.5) was confirmed and the ultrastructural alterations in the parasite induced by them, leading to cell death, were characterised using electron microscopy. These alterations include intense wrinkling of the protozoan surface, swelling of the mitochondrion, shedding of plasma membrane vesicles, the appearance of vesicles in the flagellar pocket, alterations in the kinetoplast, disorganisation of the Golgi complex, accumulation of lipid inclusions in the cytoplasm, and the formation of autophagic vacuoles, the latter confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. These findings indicate that the association of PCZ and AMD may constitute an effective anti-T. cruzi therapy with low side effects.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Structures containing galectin-3 are recruited to the parasitophorous vacuole containing Trypanosoma cruzi in mouse peritoneal macrophagesby Lia Carolina Soares Medeiros, Emile Barrias, and Lissa ReignaultParasitology Research,  2014Trypanosoma cruzi has a complex life cycle where the infective forms for the vertebrate host are ... more Trypanosoma cruzi has a complex life cycle where the infective forms for the vertebrate host are trypomastigotes and amastigotes. Both forms invade and lyse their parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane, entering into the cytoplasm of its host cells. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a protein abundantly distributed in macrophages and epithelial cells. Previous studies demonstrated that Gal-3 binds to a 45KDa mucin of trypomastigotes surface, enhancing its adhesion to the extracellular matrix and even its entry into cells. Gal-3 has another novel cytoplasmic function recently described: a vacuole lyses marker in intracellular bacteria. Considering (1) the importance of Gal-3 during T. cruzi early infection and (2) the importance of T. cruzi PV lyses for parasite differentiation and replication, this study intended to explore a possible recruitment of structures containing Gal-3 (G3CSs) to T. cruzi PVs. Microscopy analyses showed these G3CSs around PVs after 30 and 90 min of amastigotes and trypomastigotes infection, respectively. This recruitment was specific for T. cruzi PVs since we did not observe the same distribution at macrophages vacuoles containing fluorescent microspheres (FM). Concomitantly, this study intended to analyze the participation of actin cytoskeleton in T. cruzi PV maturation. We observed that actin filaments form a &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;belt-like&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; structure around trypomastigotes and amastigotes PVs, also labeled for Gal-3. At the time proposed for PV lysis, we observed an actin disassembling while LAMP-1 was recruited to PVs membrane. However, this pattern was maintained in macrophages derived from Gal-3 knockout mice, revealing that the actin belt structure forms independently from Gal-3. Taken together, these data suggest that G3CSs are recruited to vicinity of T. cruzi PV and that actin filaments localize and remain around T. cruzi PVs until the time of its lysis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
