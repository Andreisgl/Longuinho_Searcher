The program STRUCTURE is commonly used to infer population structure using multi-locus genotype data. However, a tool with graphical-user interface is currently not available to visualize STRUCTURE bar plots. Results We introduce STRUCTURE PLOT, a program for drawing STRUCTURE bar plots. The program generates publication ready, aesthetic STRUCTURE bar plots by using individual Q matrix from STRUCTURE or CLUMPP output. The program is very simple to use and includes variety of options like sorting bar by original order or by K, and selection of colors from R colors or RColorBrewer palette. Individual or population labels can be printed below or above the plot in any angle. Size of the graph and label can be defined, and option is provided to save plot in variety of picture formats in user defined resolution.

However, management can be contentious and create conflicts, especially when stakeholders who benefit from alien species are different from those who incur costs. Such conflicts of interests mean that management strategies can often not be implemented. There is, therefore, increasing interest in engaging stakeholders affected by alien species or by their management. Through a facilitated workshop and consultation process including academics and managers working on a variety of organisms and in different areas (urban and rural) and ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic), we developed a framework for engaging stakeholders in the management of alien species. The proposed framework for stakeholder engagement consists of 12 steps: (1) identify stakeholders; (2) select key stakeholders for engagement; (3) explore key stakeholders&#39; perceptions and develo...Save to LibraryDownloadby G.

In order to investigate aspects of the interspecific competition between populations of X. laevis and X. gilli, an assessment of their niche differentiation was conducted through a comprehensive study on food composition and trophic niche structure at two study sites: the Cape of Good Hope (CoGH) and Kleinmond. A total of 399 stomach contents of X. laevis (n = 183) and X. gilli (n = 216) were obtained together with samples of available prey to determine food preferences using the Electivity index (E*), the Simpson&#39;s index of diversity (1 - D), the Shannon index (H&#39;), and the Pianka index (Ojk ). Xenopus gilli diet was more diverse than X. laevis, particularly in Kleimond where the Shannon index was nearly double.

A population has been established in western France since the early 1980s with a single, known, original release point. This study attempts to determine the limits of the invasion by trapping in 169 ponds in 2001 and 2002. Subsequent trapping of 192 ponds in 2003 and 2004 was undertaken in order to chart the progress of invasion, and to test the hypothesis that ponds were mostly colonised using rivers and streams as corridors. Of ponds without X. laevis in 2001/2002, 36% were found to have been colonised by 2003/2004. The findings clearly show that, while lotic corridors are used by this principally aquatic species, most ponds are colonised through overland migration. The consequences of this finding for invasions in France and other European countries are briefly discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby G.

In this study, we aim to identify the introduction pathway of bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata) into Australia and its biogeographical origin in southern Africa by combining multiple lines of evidence from genomic tools and historical documentation. Geographic structure of genomic diversity based on SNPs supported the previous analysis of the invasion pathway of bitou bush between the two countries and within Australia, namely that all Australian material originated from the southern part of the South African distribution. Our synthesis of historical records points to the introduction of this plant into eastern Australia in Newcastle, New South Wales, from its native range in South Africa, via dry shipping ballast in about 1900. Variation in the chloroplast genome was also informative as to the biogeographical origin of Australian material and the context of the...Save to LibraryDownloadby Anita Severn-Ellis•  6  Biology, Biological invasions, Biogeography, Biological SciencesFifty Years of Invasion Ecology: The Legacy of Charles Elton edited by David M.

I endeavoured to determine the effects of bird declines on seed dispersal and assess the current status of dispersal in New Zealand. My first aim was to determine whether decreased bird density can reduce competitive interactions between birds, leading to birds concentrating on higher-reward fruit species. I measured fruit removal rates and fruit preferences of birds in Canterbury forest remnants with high (Hay and Prices) and low (Lords and Kaituna) bird densities. Removal rates of Melicytus ramiflorus and Coprosma spp. were lower at low-bird sites, and the size of this effect was greater for low-reward plant species. Coprosma areolata (a low-sugar fruit) had limited dispersal at Kaituna (59% fruit removed by end of 2012 season), compared with 92% removal at Hay, whereas 99-100% of M. ramiflorus and C. robusta (higher-sugar) frui...Save to LibraryDownloadby Tarryn Wyman•  5  Seed Dispersal, Text, New Zealand, Seed PredationTracking Jellyfish Swarm Origins Using a Combined Oceanographic-Genetic-Citizen Science ApproachBiological invasions of jellyfish may critically affect ecosystems and ecosystem services, yet their complex life cycle makes tracking their origins and dispersal vectors a challenging task.

Here we combine citizen science observations, oceanographic modeling, and population genetics to track swarms of the invasive nomad jellyfish, Rhopilema nomadica , across the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Jellyfish observations were recorded by citizens from two Israeli beaches in two consecutive years. A Lagrangian model coupled with a high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic model (SINMOD) was then used to simulate drift of ephyrae from probable polyp bed locations. Finally, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence was constructed to examine swarm connectivity. Temporal (both seasonal and interannual) variation in observed swarms generally exceeded spatial differences between the two surveyed beaches. Early detection of swarms by citizens in offshore waters and the higher offshore particle distribution shown by the drift model, point to considerable offshore transport of the swarms. However, a higher probability was found for a nearshore location of the polyp beds, as nearshore origins were more closely correlated to hits on target beaches. R. nomadica released as ephyrae in early spring were likely to reach target beaches 200-300 km down current within two to three months as swarms of young adults in the early summer bathing season. R. nomadica populations exhibited little temporal or spatial genetic differentiation, a typical feature of a species that has recently undergone rapid population expansion. The offshore transport, the lack of genetic structure, and the interannual differences in both hydrodynamics and citizen scientist observations, all indicate decentralized swarm origins. This type of interdisciplinary approach can thus provide viable tools to track bloom formations. Understanding the complexity of jellyfish swarm dynamics supports future management strategies such as forecasting, preparedness and public education.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hila Dror•Developing a list of invasive alien species likely to threaten biodiversity and ecosystems in the European UnionThe European Union (EU) has recently published its first list of invasive alien species (IAS) of EU concern to which current legislation must apply.

The list comprises species known to pose great threats to biodiversity and needs to be maintained and updated. Horizon scanning is seen as critical to identify the most threatening potential IAS that do not yet occur in Europe to be subsequently risk assessed for future listing. Accordingly, we present a systematic consensus horizon scanning procedure to derive a ranked list of potential IAS likely to arrive, establish, spread and have an impact on biodiversity in the region over the next decade. The approach is unique in the continental scale examined, the breadth of taxonomic groups and environments considered, and the methods and data sources used. International experts were brought together to address five broad thematic groups of potential IAS. For each thematic group the experts first independently assembled lists of potential IAS...Save to LibraryDownloadby Piero Genovesi•  13  Geography, Ecology, European Union, Invasive SpeciesNo saturation in the accumulation of alien species worldwideAlthough research on human-mediated exchanges of species has substantially intensified during the last centuries, we know surprisingly little about temporal dynamics of alien species accumulations across regions and taxa.

Using a novel database of 45,813 first records of 16,926 established alien species, we show that the annual rate of first records worldwide has increased during the last 200 years, with 37% of all first records reported most recently (1970-2014). Inter-continental and inter-taxonomic variation can be largely attributed to the diaspora of European settlers in the nineteenth century and to the acceleration in trade in the twentieth century. For all taxonomic groups, the increase in numbers of alien species does not show any sign of saturation and most taxa even show increases in the rate of first records over time. This highlights that past efforts to mitigate invasions have not been effective enough to keep up with increasing globalization.Save to LibraryDownloadby Piero Genovesi•  20  Geography, Macroecology, Biology, EcologyThe application of the European strategy on invasive alien species: an example with introduced squirrelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Piero Genovesi•  6  Geography, Biology, Risk assessment, Alien speciesInvasive Alien Plants in Protected Areas: Threats, Opportunities, and the Way ForwardSave to LibraryDownloadby Piero Genovesi•  13  Engineering, Geography, Invasive Species, Biological invasionsTechnical support to EU strategy on invasive alien species (IAS)-Assessment of the impacts of IAS in Europe and the EUSave to LibraryDownloadby Piero Genovesi•  2  Business, AlienExplaining variability in the production of seed and allergenic pollen by invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia across EuropeSave to LibraryDownloadby Annamária Fenesi•  11  Biology, Invasive Species, Biological invasions, Biological SciencesHemlock health and hemlock woolly adelgid management in the urban forestA comprehensive management program for urban hemlock, Tsuga canadensis (Carriere) under pressure of Tsugae adelges (Annand) is presented.

The box tree moth, Cydalima perspectalis, is native to Asia and was recently accidentally introduced into Europe as a result of the ornamental plant trade. Over the last 15 years, it has spread across the continent and has reached the Caucasus and Iran. It is threatening Buxus trees in both urban areas and forests. To investigate the species’ invasion routes, native and invasive box tree moth populations were sampled, and moth’s genetic diversity and structure were compared using microsatellite markers. Our approximate Bayesian computation analyses strongly suggest that invasion pathways were complex. Primary introductions originating from eastern China probably occurred independently twice in Germany and once in the Netherlands.

However, the lack of knowledge for some areas, advances in plant systematics and human activities related to globalization, highlight the need for further studies aimed at improving floristic knowledge. In this paper, based on fieldwork and herbaria and literature surveys, we update the knowledge on the Italian vascular flora and analyze the floristic similarities between the administrative regions. Four taxa, all exotic, were recorded for the first time in Italy and Europe. In detail, Elaeodendron croceum, Kalanchoë blossfeldiana, and Sedum spathulifolium var. spathulifolium were found as casual aliens, while Oxalis brasiliensis was reported as historical record based on some herbarium specimens.
