It has been divided into two parts ( i ) A general,qualitative survey and discussion of various surface waves,their properties and practical applications, and a deeper analysis of a few selected surface wave phenomena in plasmas. In the second part emphasis is placed on the interaction of particles with plasmas via surface waves. In particular, critical angle phenomena are investigated for certain types of plasmas ( hitherto not considered in the literature) : Beam-plasma Systems are also studied,and the limitations of experiment and applications are brought out. The reasons for the format and length of the paper are:- ( a ) -the abundance and diversity of experimental and theoretical material which must be included for completeness but cannot be treated in depth for lack of space, (b) recent upsurge of interest is plasma-waveguide propagation prompted by space research reentry vehicle plasma studies and sub millimetre wave technology. The formidable background which must be included for familiarity with principles and notation (partly presented in appendices).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNumerical Study of Surface Waves in PlasmaLukas AlbertsDense plasma can be produced by microwave (2.45 GHz) exited surface waves in a Plasmaline ® plasma source. This configuration allows to generate large area plasmas (&gt;1 m 2) which are well suited for technological applications e.g. deposition of thin films, surface etching and cleaning in integrated circuit production, disinfection in medical applications or plasma treatment of waste gases. This work investigates the propagation and production of Argon (Ar) plasma in the aforementioned source numerically for cylindrical geometries. Self-consistent calculations are performed with COMSOL Multiphysics for the coupled electromagnetic field, plasma temperature and plasma density problem.Download Free PDFView PDFPlasma Physics ReportsHigh-frequency surface waves at a plasma-metal interface: I.

MateevDownload Free PDFView PDFSTUDIES ON PROPAGATION AND SOME DEVICE APPLICATIONS OF SURFACE PLASMA WAVES (SPWSIJRE  ORGThe interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter is an important area of research from past several decades. Surface plasmon or Surface Plasma Wave (SPW) is a guided electromagnetic mode that propagates along the interface between a conductor and a dielectric. One may use the attenuated total reflection (ATR) geometry in which a metal film is deposited over on a glass prism to excite a SPW . The laser is launched through the glass onto the glass-metal interface with a wave number, whose component along the surface matches the wave number of the SPW at the metal-free space boundary. Plasma processing of materials is one of the major tools in micro electronics industry. The unique property of plasma to modify the surface is exploited in plasma- aided manufacturing processes viz. ion implantation, sputtering, etching etc. Microwave created plasmas have advantages of no contamination & surface damages to substrates and less power requirements as compared to a rf power system. Due to small penetration depth of microwaves, creation of large volume homogenous plasma is difficult. In past few years, efforts have been made to create large-volume microwave created plasmas employing slow -wave structures where the surface plasma wave (SPW) couples with the slow wave of the conductor - dielectric structure to give a slow surface plasma wave. This slow surface plasma wave can sustain a large volume plasma for material processing.Download Free PDFView PDFPlasma PhysicsAlfven surface waves along cylindrical plasma columns1980 • Karuppanagounder SomasundaramDownload Free PDFView PDFCoupling of slow phase velocity surface waves of a planar plasma bounded by two dielectricsSami  MahmoodDownload Free PDFView PDFAXIAL STRUCTURE OF LOW-PRESSURE HIGH-FREQUENCY DISCHARGES SUSTAINED BY TRAVELLJNG ELECTROMAGNETIC SURFACE WAVESI.

This research is on "Effects of Magnetized Plasma on Electromagnetic Wave Propagating parallel to its magnetic field". Electromagnetic waves propagating parallel to magnetic field in magnetized plasma were analyzed. There are two modes parallel to the field, the L and R waves. Frequency values for the L-waves were obtained by substituting the values of wave number, k into its dispersion relation while the same frequency values were substituted to get the values of its refractive index (í µí± 2). The plasma frequency values obtained from Bohm-Gross' formulae for electron plasma waves were substituted into the dispersion relation to obtain the frequency values with cutoff at í µí¼ í µí°¿ and í µí¼ í µí±. These same frequency values were substituted into their related equations to obtain their respective refractive index. The results (tables & figures) show that properties of magnetized plasmas in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendiculars to it. The motion of plasma parallel to the magnetic field lines is associated with dynamics of sound waves.Download Free PDFView PDFJapanese Journal of Applied PhysicsTwo-Dimensional Modeling of Slot-Excited Surface Waves in Bounded Planar Plasmas2000 • Essam Abdel FattahDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
