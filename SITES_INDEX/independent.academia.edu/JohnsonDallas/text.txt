The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the “Food Safe Families” clean and separate messages on cross-contamination behaviors of consumers and to determine the impact of external safe food handling cues. Participants (n = 123) were randomly assigned to a control group or to one of two experimental groups (traditional food safety messages or Ad Council public service announcements). Experimental groups were given a defined educational intervention; then all three groups were videotaped preparing a meal with raw chicken or ground beef (inoculated with Lactobacillus casei) and a ready-to-eat fruit salad. About 90% of salads were contaminated and 24% were highly contaminated, although levels were lower for the food safety messages group. Handwashing scores were lower for the control group than for the other groups. Cloth towels were t...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In Trial 1, six wethers were fed wet corn gluten feed at maintenance and ad libitum for determination of nutrient digestibility by the conventional 7-d total collection technique. The sheep ate 1.32 times maintenance at ad libitum intake and no significant differences were found in digestibility due to intake. Digestibilities of DM, organic matter, energy, CP, ether extract, ADF, NDF, and hemicellulose averaged 70.3, 73.0, 73.7, 78.3, 72.8, 51.4, 58.1, and 60.4%, respectively. Mean total digestible nutrients for both treatments was 70.3. In Trial 2, 12 Holstein cows in mid to late lactation were allotted to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Cows were fed a total mixed ration twice daily. Wet corn gluten feed was fed at 0 (control), 10, 20, and 30% of the total ration DM. There were no significant treatment effects on DM intake, milk yield, or milk composition. Dry matter intake (kg/d), milk production (kg/d), and percent milk fat were 21.4, 22.9, and 3.71, respectively, for control; 21.4, 23.0, and 3.80 for the 10%; 21.0, 23.1, and 3.71 for the 20%; and 21.0, 23.2, and 3.89 for the 30% wet corn gluten feed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
