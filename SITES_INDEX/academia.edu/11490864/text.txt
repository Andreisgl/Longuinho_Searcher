Howard Hawks) stirred censorship controversies in the United States because of its gritty portrayal of criminality and violence. Debates over crime, race and immigration proliferated in the North-American press and finally led to Italian-American pressure groups to call out for the film’s boycott because it ‘offended the Italian nation and people’ and vilified immigrant communities. Archival historical research in AVT has revealed how film versions have frequently been cut and dialogues ideologically manipulated to suit political agendas, commercial interests and dominant sexual and religious moralities. Indeed the translation of films has often served too many masters, suffering direct or indirect censorship intervention whenever a film defied existing societal taboos. My contribution aims to offer a diachronic perspective on the reception of Scarface lo sfregiato in Italy. It will look at the film’s Italian-language translation and re-translations for cinema, television and DVD, prepared by different hands and re-voiced by different actors during a span of fifty years (1940-90s). From the textual and contextual analysis of the film’s different Italian editions, it will be possible to trace significant ideological shifts in the reception of Italian-American crime iconography and in the language used to communicate it.

However, although it occupies a great amount of time in our life, we can say that audiovisual translation has not attracted enough attention from translation scholars. Films are multichannel and multisemiotic. For this, one has to take these into account to perform a successful translation. Additionally, films bring about some constraints and challenges which will put a strain on the film translator. An example for constraints is lip-synchrony; another example for challenges is intercultural differences. The aim of this thesis is to identify and study these constraints and challenges systematically in the example of Shrek 2 animated movie and study the translator’s strategies in the framework of target-oriented approach and domestication approach.Download Free PDFView PDFPerspectives2018 - Film censorship in Franco's Spain: the transforming power of dubbing2018 • Jorge Díaz-CintasSince the invention of cinema, the prominence and significance of the moving image have never been underestimated by the powers-that-be, especially, though not exclusively, in totalitarian states, where foreign films and their translations are, and have been, ideologically controlled in order to avoid any conflict with the socio-cultural values predicated by the rulers of the hosting community. This paper focuses on the dubbing into Spanish of the classical film The Barefoot Contessa (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1954), in which glamorous Ava Gardner plays the role of a voluptuous Spanish flamenco dancer that becomes an international film star in the USA. Hollywood's appropriation and subsequent representation and internationalisation of Spanish mores and customs, embodied in the film by Ava Gardner and her Spanish family, was diametrically at odds with the values and virtues advocated by the Francoist regime (1939-1975), making this film a battleground for ideological manipulation and forcing the unleashing of a creative remediation process aimed at shrouding any criticism of Spanish interests or customs and cementing traditional values cherished by the regime.Download Free PDFView PDFSilencing Cinema: Film Censorship Around the World (edited by Daniel Biltereyst and Roel Vande Winkel)2013 • Roel Vande Winkel‘SILENCING CINEMA: FILM CENSORSHIP AROUND THE WORLD’ brings together the key issues and authors to examine instances of film censorship.

Without financial b􀀄acking and with little pub􀀄lic interest and an authoritarian censorship 􀀄board – curtailing individualistic and political forms of expression – 􀀀Turkish independent cinema developed, against all odds, in the 1960s. 􀀅Since that time independent filmmaking has evolved as a result of different movements led 􀀄by urb􀀄an and well- educated directors. Y􀀆et, many of these cinematic movements never made it past their fringe existence, 􀀄Because T􀀀urkey’s mainstream film industry has always relied on the commercial and entertainment aspects of film production. Consequently, these movements played a minor role in the country’s overall cinema history; nevertheless, their influence and importance with respect to inspiring new generations of filmmakers continues to this day.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
