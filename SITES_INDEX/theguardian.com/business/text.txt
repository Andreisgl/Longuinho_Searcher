There were 77,173 excess female deaths in England and Wales, and 6,564 in Scotland.Death rates among women living in the 20% most deprived areas of England increased by 3% after a 14% decline over the previous decade. In Scotland, premature deaths in the fifth most deprived areas increased by 6% to 7% among men and women, after previous decreases of 10% to 20%.Previous studies have linked austerity spending policies in health and social care to excess deaths in England, as well as a slowdown in life expectancy among the most deprived individuals.A UK government spokesperson said: “Our growth plan will deliver economic growth across the UK – which is the best way to raise living standards for everyone. We’re also supporting households with rising prices through our energy price guarantee, saving the average household around £1,000 a year for the next two years, and providing at least £1,200 of additional cost of living support for 8 million of the UK’s most vulnerable households.”The Scottish health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said: “This is a shocking finding which underlines the true human cost of austerity and reinforces the urgent need for the UK government to change course from its current budgetary proposals.”The general secretary of the trade union Unison, Christina McAnea, said: “Austerity can never be a solution. It was a failed experiment that’s had terrible repercussions for communities across the UK and cost many lives.”TopicsAusterityPublic sector cutsConservativesEnglandScotlandWalesPovertynewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
