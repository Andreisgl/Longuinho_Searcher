It draws on doctoral research of mental health care and treatment in two Hampshire asylums and contextualises this with respect to the national picture allowing diagnostic and aetiological comparisons to be made. Developments in identifying ‘forms’ of mental disorder in the early twentieth century are analysed in the context of theories of social and medical history. Data from early asylum medical records provide an illuminating insight into the development of the medical model and physician autonomy.Download Free PDFView PDFBritish journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)Lessons from history: asylum patients' Christmas experience.2011 • Diane  CarpenterDownload Free PDFView PDFinter-disciplinary.netRewriting the AsylumDiane  CarpenterDownload Free PDFView PDFAdvocacy or Folly: The Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society, 1845-63, Medical History, 1986, 30: 245-275.Nick HerveyDownload Free PDFView PDFMedical HistoryMadness, Suicide and the Victorian Asylum: Attempted Self-Murder in the Age of Non-Restraint2002 • Anna ShepherdDownload Free PDFView PDF“All his ways are those of an idiot”: The Admission, Treatment and Social Reaction to Two Idiot Children of Northampton Pauper Lunatic Asylum, 1877-1883Steven TaylorDownload Free PDFView PDFDepraved, Deprived, Dangerous and Deviant: Depicting the Insane Child in England's County Asylums, 1845–1907Steven TaylorThe representations and experiences of children inside pauper lunatic asylums embody a significant lacuna in the understanding of children and childhood during the nineteenth century. Considering the Victorian period as a time when the conceptual notion of a sheltered and romantic childhood emerged it is essential, both to studies of childhood and to the history of the asylum, to examine how children thought to be mentally abnormal were incorporated into a discourse of innocence. Families and medical professionals played important roles in the admissions process by providing testimonies that led to certifications of insanity. This article examines the concept of the insane child and how it related to ideas of childhood that emerged during the period. Furthermore, important issues are explored such as the fluid nature of describing mental illness during the period, the motives of both family and medical professionals in creating polarized narratives of the sick child, and the place of the child within the medical institution.Download Free PDFView PDFMedical historyThe politics and ideology of non-restraint: the case of the Hanwell Asylum1995 • Akihito SuzukiDownload Free PDFView PDFEpilepsy in the Lunatic Asylums of South Australia (1852-1913)2018 • Margaret BoultDownload Free PDFView PDFA Space of Their Own: Nineteenth Century Lunatic Asylums in England, South Australia and Tasmania.
