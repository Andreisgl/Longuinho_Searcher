Atti della giornata di studio dedicata a Sergio Ribichini ( a cura di Giuseppe Garbati)Collecting disiecta membra: What did the cult place of Kharayeb look like?2018 • Ida OggianoBetween 1946 and 1969, in an area close to the modern village of Kharayeb, the ruins of a building were excavated by M. Chéhab and dated to between the Persian and Hellenistic periods. Near the building, a favissa rich in clay figurines dating from between the 6th and 1st centuries BCE was also found. The resumption of archaeological works by the joint Italian–Lebanese mission has made it possible to identify a new part of the main rectangular building, to date the first phase of cultural activities in this area back to the Iron Age II, and to identify the Hellenistic decoration of the building with coloured mosaic tesserae, stucco and glass ornamentations. In this paper, a hypothetical reconstruction of the building of the Persian/Hellenistic period is presented, based on information collected from earlier publications and new excavations.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Phoenician Exhibition2015 • Helene SAder, Alessandra  AvanziniDownload Free PDFView PDF2016. Circulation of Early Iron Age Goods Phoenician and Egyptian Ceramics in the Early Iron Age ̶ An Optical Mineralogy Perspective (PhD, University of Haifa).Paula Waiman- BarakThis research deals with the economic and commercial Phoenician networks during the early Iron Age in the southern Levant. Optical Mineralogy (petrography) analysis was conducted on a large scale on three categories of early Iron Age ceramic vessels. The first category includes transport and storage vessels, mainly pithoi, jars, and small lentoid flasks; the second category comprises Phoenician decorated ware, namely Phoenician Monochrome and Phoenician Bichrome; and the third category are open vessels of various types selected as a control group in order to better understand local fabrics and technological aspects of productions in the different sites. Lastly a unique assemblage of Egyptian imports from Tel Dor offer an addition view of relation of Egypt and Phoenicia during this period. Vessels for analysis were collected from both Phoenician and non-Phoenician sites: the Phoenician sites include Tel Achziv, Tell Keisan and Tel Dor. Non-Phoenician sites include Tel Dan, Tel Rehov, Tel Megiddo ‛En-Haggit, Tell Qasile and Nahal Patish in the Negev; altogether, about 450 vessels. In general, three main petro-fabric groups were identified that represent ceramic production centers on the Phoenician coast: petro-fabric group A is produced in sites along the coast between Haifa and Achziv; petro-fabric group B originated on the southern Lebanese coast between Tyre and Sidon; and petro-fabric group C represents the Carmel Coast. Three main commercial circles of Phoenician involvement in trade were identified in the early Iron Age. The first one is the inner Phoenician circulation of ceramics between Phoenician sites along the sea routes of the Levantine coast. Movement of Phoenicians transport vessels of various types were identified up and down the coast: this includes mainly carinated jars and Phoenician decorated wares. The second commercial circle is characterized by overland trade between the Phoenician coastal centers and sites that fall within their immediate hinterland. Vessels made in Phoenicia, especially small lentoid flasks and Phoenician decorated ware found deep inland and southwards in the land of Philistia. The Phoenician Carmel Coast shows a particular connection with the Jezreel Valley and the southern Lebanese coast shows ties to Rehov and Dan. The realization of this close connection is solidified in the local production of Phoenician Bichrome ware in the Jezreel Valley and Dan in the northern Hula Valley. In reciprocity, transport vessels, mainly oval jars of inland production travel to the Phoenician coast. In addition to that, jars of various types (but not carinated) were found to travel from Philistia and the Sharon Coast to Phoenician sites especially during the 10th century BCE; this is the first time this phenomenon is identified. The third commercial circle is the traffic that existed between the Phoenician coastal cities and their old political master, now turned large consumer, Egypt. In the void left by retreating Egypt at the end of the 12th century, the Phoenician marinners step-in, building and negotiating a large multi-leveled commercial network, with themselves in the center. These networks in the so-called Dark Age of the 11th to early 9th centuries BCE mark the beginning of the Phoenician's market economy.Download Free PDFView PDFin Les Carnets de l’ACoSt 18Rediscovering Phoenicians in their Homeland from the Perspective of Iron Age Coroplastic Art2018 • Barbara BolognaniThe collective imagery of the Phoenicians is well known both within and outside of the academic world in large part because of the representations of daily life in their coroplastic art. Yet, there still is no comprehensive study of this genre of their material culture. In this brief communication, a new research project is presented that concerns a regional survey of Iron Age clay figurines from Phoenician sites in the eastern Mediterranean. The sites included in this research range beyond the borders traditionally ascribed to the Phoenicians, and cover the entire Syrian, Lebanese, and Israeli coasts. This research aims to illustrate the regional distribution of these figurines, including their production centers, as well as their types, uses, chronologies, and the meanings of this class of artefacts.Download Free PDFView PDFPhoenicia: Identity, and Geopolitics in the Iron I-IIA Period: An Examination of the Textual, Archaeological, and Biblical EvidenceTommy BeylDownload Free PDFView PDFFigurines féminines nues.

THE APPEARANCE OF DRESS IN IRON AGE PHOENICIAN FIGURINES: THE CASE OF KHARAYEB (LEBANON)2019 • Ida OggianoThe theme of nudity in the votive clay figurines is closely correlated with that of the meaning of the use of dress in the society that created them. In this paper, on the basis of the analysis of the votive coroplastic from the cult place of Kharayeb, dating from the 7th to the Hellenistic period, the phenomenon of the appearance in the Late Iron Age Levant repertoire of female figurines wearing a long, simple mantle or more sophisticated dress will be analyzed. In fact, even if naked female figurines presenting their breasts are still part of the local repertoire, it is evident that, from the Late Iron Age onwards, the Levantine communities feel the need to represent women with clothes probably to emphasize the gender, age and social position. The introduction of the Greek repertoire will be also considered. In particular, it is interesting that the population of the Phoenician agrarian hinterland in the Hellenistic period “delegates” to images of a distant and very different world the representation of their own physical appearance (body, dress, movement, etc.) The aim of this paper is to assess this act of delegation, which was performed not by an individual but by an entire community, considering that ritualization strategies are closely linked to the body (according to embodiment theories) and that wearing a special dress, hairstyle or jewellery, or emphasizing a certain part of the body, is a way of indicating status and identity.Download Free PDFView PDFASOR Meeting 2021(Dis)Comparison : How to Equal Unequals in Earlier Egyptian Mortuary Texts (ASOR Meeting 2021, Chicago / virtual, 10 December 2021)2021 • Carlos Gracia ZamaconaBy examining how a number of morphosyntactical and graphemic features are used in the earlier mortuary texts (Pyramid Texts , Coffin Texts , and other related texts ), we will narrow down three driving forces that anchor the communication participants within specific situations in which unequal participants are involved, and facework mechanisms are thereby triggered. The said three driving forces are as follows : • The ontological distinction of the participants . We will show how that distinction permeates these texts through the use a morphosyntactic mechanism (specific prepositions after verbs of diction) and a graphemic one (the subtle play of human / divinate / divine determinatives for the deceased and other participants) . • The hierarchical distinction between characters . We will tackle the issue by showing cases of equalizing unequals through morphs such as the adposition / ' sand the conjunction mi , which respectively equal entities (through the concept ‘ model’) and actions . We will also show how the so - called comparison structure (quality + Aperson + r + Bperson) may be seen as a resource to unequalize equals, and is related to another unequalizing structure (rdi + person + r + charge ‘ appoint someone in a superior charge’). We will also interpret the legitimation strategy second tense + subjunctive as an equalizing device in macrosyntax . • The readaptation of the communicative strategies by cause of the entextualization processes . While the edition process did certainly disrupt the original communicative structure of the texts (originally ritual), this process should throw some light on facework strategies through distancing — mainly through person and other deictic marks .Download Free PDFView PDFArcheologia 62-63, 2014Economy of Hellenistic, Roman and Early Byzantine Settlement in Jiyeh (Porphyreon), LebanonMariusz Gwiazda, The Joint Expedition to Chhim and Jiyeh, Lebanon.  Polish-Lebanese MissionRegular excavations of the ancient settlement in Jiyeh on the Phoenician coast, carried out by the Polish-Lebanese mission since 2008, as well as results of some earlier archaeological investigations there, allowed to discuss various aspects of economic activity of the local population in the Hellenistic, Roman and Early Byzantine times. The obtained materials justify putting forward several hypotheses concerning the agriculture, craffts and trade carried out by the inhabitants of the settlement. It seems that olive oil and wine, together with the locally manufactured coarse pottery vessels and other productts, sold within the territory of the neighbouring towns (Sidon and Berytus), could have been the main source of profit allowing the inhabitants to purchase imported goods, such as fine pottery and marble coming from different parts of the Mediterranean. Moreover, the settlement in Jiyeh, due to its favourable geographical location, may have played an important intermediary role in the trade exchange between the villages located to the east, on the slopes of Mount Lebanon, and urban centres along the Mediterranean coastline.Download Free PDFView PDFAbstracts Production and Consumption of Terracottas: A Case Study at Metaponto in Southern Italy2017 • Rebecca AmmermanProduction and Consumption of Terracottas: A Case Study at Metaponto in Southern Italy Rebecca Miller Ammerman Colgate University, USA rammerman@colgate.edu A terracotta figurine is usually recovered from a sanctuary, house, or burial – in other words, from a context that marks the statuette’s final consumption. In contrast, it is rare to find a terracotta figurine at the place of its own industrial production. One such instance is the site of Sant Angelo Vecchio at the Greek city-state of Metaponto in southern Italy. The site of Sant Angelo Vecchio is notable for two sets of kilns – distinguished by design of construction as well as date – that produced a wide range of fired clay objects, including terracotta figurines and relief plaques, decorative discs, and roof tiles, between the late 4 and 1 centuries BC. This industrial complex offers a rare opportunity to investigate the technology employed by coroplasts in their production of moulded terracottas at the beginning of the Hell...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
