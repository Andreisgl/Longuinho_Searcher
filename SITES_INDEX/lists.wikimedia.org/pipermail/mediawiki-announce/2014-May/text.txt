Hello everyone,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.19.16, 1.21.10 and 1.22.7. This is a
regular security and maintenance release. Download links are given at the end of this
email. 
== Security ==
* (bug 65501) SECURITY: Don't parse usernames as wikitext on
  Special:PasswordReset.
== Bugfixes in 1.22.7 ==
* (bug 36356) Add space between two feed links.
* (bug 63269) Email notifications were not correctly handling the
  [[MediaWiki:Helppage]] message being set to a full URL. This is a regression
  from the 1.22.5 point release, which made the default value for it a URL.
  If you customized [[MediaWiki:Enotif body]] (the text of email notifications),
  you'll need to edit it locally to include the URL via the new variable
  $HELPPAGE instead of the parser functions fullurl and canonicalurl; otherwise
  you don't have to do anything.
* Add missing uploadstash.us_props for PostgreSQL.
* (bug 56047) Fixed stream wrapper in PhpHttpRequest.
== Bugfixes in 1.21.10 ==
* (bug 36356) Add space between two feed links.
