This article outlines this theory of race and racism, drawing from the work of key scholars in and around the field. This consideration of the state of race theory in sociology leads to four contentions regarding what a critical and comprehensive theory of race and racism should do: 1) bring race and racism together into the same analytical framework; 2) articulate the connections between racist ideologies and racist structures; 3) lead us towards the elimination of racial oppression; and 4) include an intersectional analysis.Download Free PDFView PDFPerpetual Inferiority:  Whites' Racial Ideology toward LatinosCelia LacayoDownload Free PDFView PDFRay et al. Critical Race Theory, Afropessimism and Racial Progress Naratives.pdfAntonia  Randolph, Megan R Underhill, David J LukeMuch work in the sociology of race and ethnicity centers on an underlying narrative of racial progress. Progress narratives are typically conceptualized as a linear process of slow, yet inevitable, improvement. Drawing on Critical Race Theory and Afro-Pessimism, theoretical perspectives that emerged outside of the discipline of sociology, this paper urges a rethinking of linear progress narratives. First we elucidate the central tenets of these theoretical paradigms. We then apply them to diversity and labor market research, providing suggestions for how sociology can incorporate these perspectives.Download Free PDFView PDFCengage MacMillanRacial Formations: Brazil2013 • Bernd ReiterDownload Free PDFView PDFSocial Agency and White Supremacy in Immigration StudiesVilna Bashi  TreitlerAssimilation scholarship is rooted in the race relations framework that has been critiqued for providing legitimacy to the prevailing racial order, not least because it credits ethno-racial group agency as the mechanism that causes inequities among groups' socioeconomic outcomes and the degrees to which they are socially accepted. To explain socioeconomic inequities, alternative frames centering on racialization and structural racism look to white supremacy and the unequal ends it entergers, but the sociological theory developed in these alternatives is largely tangential to assimilation theory. That the assimilationist model still dominates leaves a key part of the discipline vulnerable to supporting white supremacist ideologies about societies falsely believed to be colorblindly meritocratic. For this reason I call upon sociologists to work together to dethrone assimilationism from its exalted status in the sociology of immigration and scholars of race knowledgeable in these alternative approaches to actively reenter the arena of immigration studies and take the ground that has been ceded to the assimilationist frame. I suggest these as next steps in a campaign to overturn the dominance of the race relations model in sociology as a whole.Download Free PDFView PDFBUILDING WALLS: Excluding Latin People in the United States2019 • Ernesto  CastanedaThe election of Donald Trump has called attention to the border wall and anti-Mexican discourses and policies, yet these issues are not new. Building Walls puts the recent calls to build a border wall along the US-Mexico border into a larger social and historical context. This book describes the building of walls, symbolic and physical, between Americans and Mexicans, as well as the consequences that these walls have in the lives of immigrants and Latin communities in the United States. The book is divided into three parts: categorical thinking, anti-immigrant speech, and immigration as an experience. The sections discuss how the idea of the nation-state itself constructs borders, how political strategy and racist ideologies reinforce the idea of irreconcilable differences between whites and Latinos, and how immigrants and their families overcome their struggles to continue living in America. They analyze historical precedents, normative frameworks, divisive discourses, and contemporary daily interactions between whites and Latin individuals. It discusses the debates on how to name people of Latin American origin and the framing of immigrants as a threat and contrasts them to the experiences of migrants and border residents. Building Walls makes a theoretical contribution by showing how different dimensions work together to create durable inequalities between US native whites, Latinos, and newcomers. It provides a sophisticated analysis and empirical description of racializing and exclusionary processes.Download Free PDFView PDFSocial Agency and White Supremacy in Immigration Studies.pdfVilna Bashi  TreitlerAssimilation scholarship is rooted in the race relations framework that has been critiqued for providing legitimacy to the prevailing racial order, not least because it credits ethno-racial group agency as the mechanism that causes inequities among groups’ socioeconomic outcomes and the degrees to which they are socially accepted.

Mexican, Spanish, Chicano, Hispanic, Latino, Latinx, Latin2019 • Ernesto  Castaneda, Maura FennellyFor some, the problem with the Spanish term Latino is that it favors an androcentric (male-centered) approach to name this collective (Vidal-Ortiz and Martínez 2018). There is no denying that LGBTQ and trans individuals of color face multiple simultaneous exclusions. So, there is a debate about whether to write Latino/a/x, Latino@, Latine, Latinex, or LatinX. I hereby propose the use of the term Latin people. It keeps the references to a series of people related to their current or former use of Spanish and/or Portuguese as Romance languages derived from the Latin language. But unlike the Spanish versions of the word, which attribute gender and number, in English Latin can be used to describe single, plural, and all genders. Therefore, it is not only less sexist and more inclusive than Latino, but it is also within the parameters of common English spellings, characters, and grammar. Furthermore, I use Latin as an adjective and not as a noun. This way, it does not carry a number or gender. This way a person is not “a Latin,” but rather “a Latin person” because someone is a person first and Latin second. Latin is used as a modifier rather than as a term denoting an all-encompassing ontology around a nebulous cultural categorization. Past geographical place of residence or family origin should not be used as the most important ontological characteristic of a person or group. There is no reason why origin or ethnicity should be characterized as more primordial than humanity or other traits. Thus, I talk about Latin people or peoples in order to be inclusive of different gender and sexual orientations of individuals as well as differences by physical appearance, disability, age, and national origin. The context makes it clear that we are not talking about the Latin language.Download Free PDFView PDFSociology of Race and EthnicityToward a Sociology of Race and Ethnicity2015 • Megan Nanney, David Brunsma, David G.
