Dafydd ap Gwilym Print 
Dafydd ap Gwilym is widely regarded as one of the greatest Welsh poets of all time, and amongst the leading European poets of the Middle Ages. He was born to a wealthy family from Cemais, Dyfed and was reputably born in Brogynin, Llanbadarn Fawr. Over 500 poems have been attributed to him, although he was primarily an orator of verse. An early composer in the cywydd metre, he also composed awdlau and englynion. Themes included religion, nature and love, and comedy often ran throughout.
    The tour, originally led by Dr Huw Meirion Edwards, visits Dafydd ap Gwilym's alleged birthplace Brogynin, Llanbadarn Chapel (where 'Merched Llanbadarn' was written) and engages with the breathtaking medieval magic of Ystrad Fflur / Strata Florida Abbey; one of two possible burial sites (the other is Talyllychau).
