Developing countries, however, which face serious limitations in infrastructure, have a considerable challenge ahead of them. What new actors are emerging in the countries of the South, outside of the powerful platforms already existing in the US, Europe and Japan? Is it conceivable that there may be an autonomous evolution of digital publications in developing countries, entirely independent of the richest nations? What support policies could be implemented to promote the growth of this new industry and accompany traditional actors in the process of adapting to the changes involved? The digital experiences undertaken in the South suggest that new technologies represent a great opportunity for developing countries – particularly in terms of diffusion –, but on the condition that local entrepreneurs seek out original models adapted to the concrete needs of their communities.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe African Book Publishing RecordPrint vs Electronic, and the 'Digital Revolution' in Africa2013 • Hans M Zell""There is a great deal of excitement nowadays about digital publishing on the African continent and, most recently, about e-book reading devices that may serve as a catalyst to foster a new culture of reading. The term ‘digital revolution‘ keeps popping up in dozens of articles and news stories; it is a term that has perhaps been used rather too liberally, sometimes for projects that are anything but revolutionary. This article takes a critical look at the print vs digital debate in Africa, taking stock of the current position as it relates to electronic publishing and the use of electronic reading devices in (English-speaking) sub-Saharan Africa, and the rapidly changing publishing environment on the continent. It describes and critically examines a number of projects and initiatives that are concerned with digital printing and publishing, and provision of e-book reading devices. The article also touches upon another topic that is closely associated with digital media, namely that of the somewhat contentious area of self-publishing, and the phenomenal rise in digital self-publishing in Africa in recent years. An Appendix reviews a selection of some of the now rapidly increasing amount of literature that has appeared about digital publishing in Africa over the last year or two.

Dans les pays en développement, qui connaissent à différentes échelles de graves contraintes en infrastructure, l’enjeu est de taille. Quels nouveaux acteurs apparaissent dans les pays du Sud, en marge des systèmes puissants déjà formés aux États-Unis, en Europe et au Japon ? Peut-on concevoir une évolution autonome des publications numériques dans les pays en développement par rapport à celle des pays riches ? Quelles politiques d’appui peuvent être mises en place pour encourager la croissance de cette nouvelle industrie et pour aider et accompagner les acteurs traditionnels à s’adapter aux changements ?Download Free PDFView PDFIn the Service of Power: Media Capture and the Threat to DemocracyAnya SchiffrinThe threats to independent journalism no longer come only from direct forms of state control. Where advocates of a vibrant public sphere once mobilized against the suppression and censorship of news, they now must also contend with the more complex challenge of media capture, the topic of a new book published by the Center for International Media Assistance and Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. In this volume of essays edited by Anya Schiffrin, media capture is shown to be a growing phenomenon linked both to the resurgence of authoritarian governments as well as to the structural weaknesses presently afflicting media markets. In this environment, political figures and economic elites are colluding to undermine the independence of privately-owned media, and efforts to stop this collusion by activists, regulators, and the international community have proven to be ineffective. CIMA is proud to present this collection and hopes it will inspire further research and thoughtful responses to this growing threat to democracies around the world.Download Free PDFView PDFWORLDREADER: CREATING A CULTURE OF E-READING AROUND THE GLOBE2016 • Christina KwaukDownload Free PDFView PDFThe paradoxes of piracyRamon LobatoPublished in: Postcolonial Piracy: Media distribution and cultural production in the global South Eds.

Lars Eckstein and Anja Schwarz'Justice With My Own Hands': The Serious Play of Piracy in Bolivian Indigenous Music Videos (published version in full book - see prepublication version for easy links to videos )2014 • Henry Stobart, Lars EcksteinSo-called ‘piracy’ is sometimes seen to be justified by the inequalities which deny economically disadvantaged populations access to cultural products, media and knowledge. Justification may also be related to the injustices that are seen to surround the mechanisms and power structures underlying authorship, ownership, rights protection and circulation. These kinds of justifications are frequently heard in Bolivia - the poorest and most indigenous county in South America – where, in turn, they are linked to the histories of foreign exploitation of the nation’s rich natural and cultural resources. Education, economics and the dynamism of cultural life in Bolivia today are highly dependent on the unlicensed reproduction and circulation of internationally produced books, software, music and video. Although copyright protection is enshrined in law and in the new constitution, no serious enforcement policy has emerged in recent administrations, including the current pro-indigenous government of Evo Morales, with its anti-capitalist and decolonising rhetoric. Based on ethnographic research in 2007-8, this paper examines some of the strategies adopted by Gregorio Mamani (1960-2011), an indigenous (originario) musician and music video producer, in the context of a market dominated by the unlicensed circulation of music videos. How did this low-income musician encourage (low income) vendors to sell and (low income) consumers to purchase ‘original’ rather than ‘pirated’ versions of his work? In short, how do justifications regarding access and fair recompense for artistic production play out in this kind of local, low income and unregulated context? It is shown how in his music videos Mamani exploited his indigenous identity to protect his interests, even strategically essentialising himself as a ‘noble savage’. His ludic warnings to those who might threaten his interests emerge as a kind of anti-piracy artform or entertainment – the ‘play of piracy’. Such play was nonetheless a deeply serious matter for Mamani who struggled intensely to survive economically as an artist, and recognised how piracy was able both to threaten and augment his celebrity and success as an artist.Download Free PDFView PDFAustral Comunicación - Vol 4 Nº 1 Junio de 2015Revista  Austral Comunicación, Ana  Bizberge, Enrique Guerrero Pérez, Ethel Diez, Castulus  Kolo, Gossel Britta Tu Ilmenau, Vivi Symeonidou, Katja Lehtisaari, George Tsourvakas, Andreas VeglisEl objetivo de este número especial de AUSTRAL COMUNICACIÓN es ayudar a integrar dos perspectivas de investigación que se han desarrollado en paralelo en los últimos ochenta años: la economía política y la economía neoclásica de la comunicación. Este último enfoque se aplica no solo al estudio de la economía de los medios sino también a la gestión y dirección de las empresas de medios (media management). La búsqueda de puntos de encuentro entre los intereses de ambas escuelas se presenta como una necesidad creciente no solo del campo académico sino —y fundamentalmente— de los profesionales que se desempeñan en la industria de los contenidos.Download Free PDFView PDFTable of Contents - German and Banerjee Migration BookMyna German, Myna German, Nina  Banerjee, reynaldo anderson, Magdalena Bielenia-Grajewska, Lidia K.C.
