Current specifications for RUTF permit a high n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and low n-3 PUFA, with no stipulated requirements for preformed long-chain n-3 PUFA. The objective of this study was to develop an RUTF with elevated short-chain n-3 PUFA and measure its impact, with and without fish oil supplementation, on children&#39;s PUFA status during treatment of severe acute malnutrition. This randomized controlled trial in children with severe acute malnutrition in rural Kenya included 60 children aged 6 to 50 months who were randomized to receive i) RUTF with standard composition; ii) RUTF with elevated short chain n-3 PUFA; or iii) RUTF with elevated short chain n-3 PUFA plus fish oil capsules.

Biopsies routinely taken from the ascending aorta of 107 patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery were analyzed for lipid and lipoprotein parameters, which were then correlated to serum values. A significant positive correlation was established between serum Lp(a) and arterial wall apolipoprotein (apo)(a) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High serum Lp(a) also led to a significant increase of apo B in the arterial wall. No significant correlation was found between apo B in serum and aortic tissue. Apo B was found to be partially linked to apo(a) in the aortic extract. Furthermore, apo(a) was found to be intact, as determined by its molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis.

However, their physiological effects depend on the way they resist digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that new type of RS4 preparations, of in vitro digestibility of about 50%, obtained by cross-linking and acetylation, acts as a prebiotic by increasing short chain fatty acids content in cecum digesta. The rats were fed with diet containing pregelatinized, cross-linked and acetylated starches as a main carbohydrate source. Pregelatinized, but not chemically modified, potato starch was used in the composition of the control diet. After two weeks of experiment the increase of short chain fatty acids contents in ceceum digesta was observed. The intake of starch A, cross-linked only with adipic acid, resulted in increase of about 40% of short chain fatty acids content, whereas starch PA cross-linked with sodium trimetaphosphate and adipic acid of about 50%.

Because large specimens of viable human vaginal mucosa are readily available and because vaginal and buccal epithelia are microscopically similar, vaginal mucosa has been used successfully to establish a human cyst model in experimental animals. The ultrastructure and distribution of keratin filaments in these epithelia are also similar, as is their permeability to water and a number of chemical substances. Therefore, if vaginal mucosa could be substituted for buccal mucosa it would expedite research on the epithelium of buccal mucosa. To strengthen further the concept that vaginal epithelium could replace buccal epithelium in certain experimental studies, the thickness of these epithelia, their patterns of surface keratinization, the presence or absence of intercellular lipid lamellae and their lipid contents were now compared. Thirty-three specimens of vaginal mucosa from postmenopausal women and 36 of buccal mucosa were investigated. To compare the thickness of the epithelial layers the number of cell layers in sections of 20 vaginal and 20 buccal mucosal specimens were counted in the three thickest and three thinnest regions of each specimen. Surface keratinization was evaluated on sections stained with the Picro-Mallory method. To demonstrate lipid lamellae two vaginal and two buccal mucosa specimens were examined electron microscopically after normal fixation and postfixation in ruthenium tetroxide. Following solvent extraction of 11 vaginal and 14 buccal epithelia, quantitative lipid analyses were performed using thin-layer chromatography. No statistically significant differences were found between the maximum and minimum number of epithelial cell layers. The patterns of surface keratinization and the distribution and appearance of the lipid lamellae in the intercellular spaces were similar. The lipid composition of the two epithelia corresponded, except for the cholesterol esters and glycosylceramides, which were higher in buccal epithelium. Ceramides for vaginal epithelium and triglycerides for buccal epithelium were not determined. Based on structural similarities, a similar lipid composition and earlier findings, it is concluded that vaginal epithelium can be used as a substitute for buccal epithelium in certain in vitro, and possibly for in vivo, studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Armorel van Eyk•  24  Zoology, Dentistry, Biomedical Engineering, Electron MicroscopyDietary Pectin Influences Fibrin Network Structure in Hypercholesterolaemic SubjectsSave to LibraryDownloadby Johann Jerling•  29  Lipids, Fibrinogen, Fibrin, HumansThe Buoyant Filter Bioreactor: a high-rate anaerobic reactor for complex wastewater—process dynamics with dairy effluentSave to LibraryDownloadby Ajit Haridas•  17  Water, Filtration, Multidisciplinary, LipidsEffects of cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training programs in women with depressionSave to LibraryDownloadby Richard V Milani and +1Alberto Porta•  64  Mental Health, Depression, Obesity, Quality of lifeOat ( Avena sativa L.) and amaranth ( Amaranthus hypochondriacus) meals positively affect plasma lipid profile in rats fed cholesterol-containing dietsSave to LibraryDownloadby Shela Gorinstein•  27  Nutrition and Dietetics, Kinetics, Diet, FlavonoidsA comparative analysis of serological parameters and oxidative stress in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritisProgression of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress.

Previous studies have shown that there was no difference between RA and OA patients regarding the percentages of the different lymphocytes subsets reflecting the abnormalities in T cells and its subsets that may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA as in RA. Therefore, the present study was aimed to analyze that whether disease activity of OA is able to affect a few serological and biochemical parameters in the same way as RA does or differently. The study was done on 36 asymptomatic controls (25 women), 28 patients with OA (20 women), 36 patients with RA (22 women). Patients with OA were screened according to radiological and clinical finding of Kellgren and Lawrence grade and ACR criteria and assessed by VAS and WOMAC score. Patients with RA were selected who were fulfilling 4/5 symptoms of ACR criteria, and their DAS28-CRP, VAS score, and RF positivity were evaluated. Participants of the groups were matched for sex, age, weight, and height (body mass index). The BMI of all three groups was also found to be the same (P > 0.05). The mean level of LDL, Cholesterol, MDA, CRP, and Triglyceride was significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) higher in both OA and RA as compared to control. The mean level of total lipid, cholesterol, MDA, CRP, and triglyceride was found to be significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) higher in RA as compared to OA. The pre-treatment CRP level of both groups of patients showed significant and direct relation with total lipid (r = 0.27, P < 0.05) and cholesterol (r = 0.66, P < 0.01). Inverse relation was observed between Uric acid and Creatinine (r = −0.26, P < 0.05) and cholesterol and HDL (r = −0.34, P < 0.01). Our study shows the similar trend in lipid profile and other parameters studied in both patients with OA and patients with RA with more pronounced changes in RA.Save to LibraryDownloadby aastha  singh•  27  Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Oxidative Stress, Cardiovascular diseaseWax Ester Production by the Marine Cryptomonad Chroomonas salina Grown Photoheterotrophically on GlycerolSYNOPSIS.

An age-autolyzed culture of Chroomonas salina, grown under cool-white light with glycerol, produced waxy lipid constituting about 44% of total matter harvested. This lipid was composed of 87% wax ester, 9% triglyceride, 3% polar lipid and 1% hydrocarbon. The major wax ester species were identified by total carbon number as C26(28%), C28(35%), C30(15%). The main fatty acid components of the wax esters were 12:0 (39%), 14:0 (30%), 16:0 (14%), while the main alcohols were 14:0 (53%) and 16:0 (40%). The hydrocarbon fraction showed saturated paraffins ranging from C17 to C33, with odd-numbered chain components predominating. No polyunsaturated components were detected in the wax ester or hydrocarbon fractions. This is the first record of wax ester production by a cryptomonad or a marine phytoplankter.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ester Salinas•  15  Microbiology, Zoology, Lipids, MethodsSynthesis and estimation of calorific value of a structured lipid-potential reduced calorie fatThe majority of reduced calorie fats and fat substitutes avaiable, today, though similar in texture and flavor to natural fats, contain fatty acids that are not usually present in edible oils and fats and thus do not fully match the... moreThe majority of reduced calorie fats and fat substitutes avaiable, today, though similar in texture and flavor to natural fats, contain fatty acids that are not usually present in edible oils and fats and thus do not fully match the chemistry and functions of natural fats. For example, such products do not provide nutritionally important essential fatty acids (EFA). In this investigation, we prepared and evaluated a reduced calorie fat, prepared entirely from natural fats, taking advantage of the fact that long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCSFA), such as behenic acid (22∶0), are poorly absorbed. Mustard oil (MO) and sunflower oil (SO) were used as substrates to yield a structured lipid (SL). The product, being derived from a natural vegetable oil, would thus provide EFA, as would a native fat, a feature not provided by the low-calorie fats available in the market. Erucic acid (22∶1) was isolated from MO by a lipase (EC 3.1.1.3)-catalyzed reaction. It was then hydrogenated to behenic acid, the ethyl ester of which was subsequently enzymatically transesterified with SO to yield a plastic fat containing about 30–35% behenic acid. Absorption of this fat was studied in Wistar rats. In a preliminary single oral dose experiment, rats were fed equal amounts (2 mL) of SO and the SL. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) levels were estimated after 1, 2, and 3 h of feeding. The significantly lower concentration of plasma TAG in the 2-h sample, observed in the SL-fed group compared to the SO-fed group (Pad libitum group the previous day. Body weights were recorded during the experiment. Calorific value of the SL was estimated by comparing the 21st-d mean body weight gain of the control group with that of the experimental group. Estimated calorific value of the SL was 5.36 kcal/g. Most of the behenic acid fed was excreted, as indicated by the analysis of the fatty acids of plasma and fecal total lipid. A second growth experiment on ad libitum diet was conducted over 21 d on weanling Wistar male rats to compare the absorption behavior of the SL with that of natural oil. SO (10%) was added to the diet of the control group, and SL (10%) was added to the diet of the experimental group. Feed consumption, as well as body weights, was recorded during the experiment. The growth pattern of the experimental group was identical to that of the control group during the period of study. The mean feed intake (9.8 g/d/rat for the control group vs. 9.9 g/d/rat for the experimental group) indicated good palatability of the product. In conclusion, the enzymatically synthesized SL containing EFA and natural antioxidants has nutritional properties almost identical to those of natural fats, and can be used as a reduced calorie fat.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sanjit  Kanjilal•  20  Engineering, Diet, Lipids, Food ConsumptionPerturbation of the Hydrophobic Core of Lipid Bilayers by the Human Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37 †Save to LibraryDownloadby Gary Martinez•  16  Biochemistry, Carbon, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, LipidsHypolipidaemic activity of methanol extract of Aleurites moluccanaSave to LibraryDownloadby Roberto  Pedrosa•  16  Biological Sciences, Phytotherapy, Lipids, CholesterolNanoparticulate lipid dispersions for bromocriptine delivery: Characterization and in vivo studySave to LibraryDownloadby Enea Menegatti•  20  Animal Behavior, Nanoparticles, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Flow Field Flow FractionationEffect of Apitherapy Formulations against Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Toxicity in Wistar Rats after Three Weeks of TreatmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Calin Andritoiu•  14  Organic Chemistry, Spleen, Lipids, HoneyThe Cancer Cell: Dynamic Aspects and Modifications in Cell-Surface OrganizationSave to LibraryDownloadby George Poste and +1Garth Nicolson•  8  Lipids, Humans, Microtubules, ProteinsThe relationship between lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction: the role of autonomic hyperactivityTo investigate whether autonomic nervous system (ANS) hyperactivity may be a potential cause for the relationship between lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED).

Twenty-four patients were recruited for this study. Complete physical examinations, urine analysis, uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume (PVRU) analysis were performed. The potential impact of some factors such as hyperglycemia, obesity, and hyperlipidemia were analyzed. These values were correlated with the various symptom scores. We performed an electromyographic and an electrocardiographic evaluation. The alterations after treatment with 2 different alpha-blockers were also analyzed. The electromyographic and electrocardiographic assessments revealed a minimal increase in ANS activity and it did not change significantly after treatment (P &gt; 0.05).

Despite the availability of a wide range of anticoagulants to help prevent thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients is a challenge due to its associated risk of haemorrhage. As a result, anticoagulation is only recommended in patients with a relatively high risk of VTE. Efforts have been made to develop predictive models for VTE risk assessment in cancer patients, but the availability of a reliable predictive model for ambulate patients with lung cancer is unclear. We have analysed the latest information on this topic, with a focus on the lung cancer-related risk factors for VTE, and risk prediction models developed and validated in this group of patients. The existing risk models, such as the Khorana score, the PROTECHT score and the CONKO score, have shown poor performance in external validations, failing to identify many high-risk individuals.

Results indicate that fish age is the main factor of variability among specimens in this population that is subjected to atmospheric inputs of the organochlorine compounds (OC). Increases of 2- and 20-fold between fish aged 1 year and 15 years old are found. The observed pattern cannot be explained in terms of fish size, condition factor, or muscle lipid content. Higher molecular weight compounds (higher lipophilicity) are better correlated with fish age than low molecular weight compounds. A transformation from 4,4′-DDT to 4,4′-DDE occurs in fish after ingestion; this results in amplified age-dependent signals, especially in male specimens. In contrast, PCB congener #180 has lower age dependence than the general OC group, which could be due to its high hydrophobicity (log Kow > 7). In any case, selective accumulation of hydrophobic compounds is already observed among younger fish (age, 1 year). Due to this effect, the relative OC composition does not reflect the main OC pollutants in the lake waters.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jordi  Catalan and +2B.

We tested for a potential association between common mitochondrial variants and a number of quantitative traits related to type 2 diabetes in a large sample of >2,000 healthy Australian adolescent twins and their siblings, many of whom were measured on more than one occasion. Methods To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mitochondrial association study of quantitative traits undertaken using family data. The maternal inheritance pattern of mitochondria means established association methodologies are unsuitable for analysis of mitochondrial data in families. We present a methodology, implemented in the freely available program Sib-Pair for performing such an analysis. Results Despite our study having the power to detect variants with modest effects on these phenotypes, only one significant association was found after correction for multiple testing in any of four age groups. This was for mt14365 with triacylglycerol levels (unadjusted p = 0.0006). This association was not replicated in other age groups. Conclusions/interpretation We find little evidence in our sample to suggest that common European mitochondrial variants contribute to variation in quantitative phenotypes related to diabetes. Only one variant showed a significant association in our sample, and this association will need to be replicated in a larger cohort. Such replication studies or future meta-analyses may reveal more subtle effects that could not be detected here because of limitations of sample size.Save to LibraryDownloadby David Zhen Zhen•  22  Geography, Family, Mitochondria, AdolescentEvaluation of differential cytotoxic effects of the oil spill dispersant Corexit 9500Save to LibraryDownloadby Manuj Ahuja•  10  Life Sciences, Mitochondria, Lipids, Cell lineGene delivery by cationic lipid vectors: overcoming cellular barriersNon-viral vectors such as cationic lipids are capable of delivering nucleic acids, including genes, siRNA or antisense RNA into cells, thus potentially resulting in their functional expression.

These vectors are considered as an attractive alternative for virus-based delivery systems, which may suffer from immunological and mutational hazards. However, the efficiency of cationic-mediated gene delivery, although often sufficient for cell biological purposes, runs seriously short from a therapeutics point of view, as realizing this objective requires a higher level of transfection than attained thus far. To develop strategies for improvement, there is not so much a need for novel delivery systems. Rather, better insight is needed into the mechanism of delivery, including lipoplex–cell surface interaction, route of internalization and concomitant escape of DNA/RNA into the cytosol, and transport into the nucleus. Current work indicates that a major obstacle involves the relative inefficient destabilization of membrane-bounded compartments in which lipoplexes reside after their internalization by the cell. Such an activity requires the capacity of lipoplexes of undergoing polymorphic transitions such as a membrane destabilizing hexagonal phase, while cellular components may aid in this process. A consequence of the latter notion is that for development of a novel generation of delivery devices, entry pathways have to be triggered by specific targeting to select delivery into intracellular compartments which are most susceptible to lipoplex-induced destabilization, thereby allowing the most efficient release of DNA, a minimal requirement for optimizing non-viral vector-mediated transfection.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jan B.

The objective of the study was to determine the effect on blood lipids of a daily intake of 0.7 g DHA as triacylglycerol in middle-aged men and women. Men and women aged 40-65 y (n = 38) underwent a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of treatment with 0.7 g DHA/d for 3 mo.
