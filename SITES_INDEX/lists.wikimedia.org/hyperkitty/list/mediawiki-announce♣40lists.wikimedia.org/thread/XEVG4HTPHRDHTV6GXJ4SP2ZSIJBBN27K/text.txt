I am happy to announce the availability of the general release of MediaWiki
1.37!

Tarballs have already been uploaded, and the git tag has been pushed.

Please note that MediaWiki 1.37 (as did 1.36) now requires the PHP
internationalization extension, commonly referred to as Intl, ext-intl, or
php-intl.

As a reminder, 1.31 (the old LTS) became end of life in September 2021.
1.35 (the new LTS) is supported until September 2023.

Note that the patches in comparison rc.2 are much larger than usual due to
the re-introduction of translation backports. This only includes updates
for MediaWiki core and bundled skins. Extension updates will follow in the
next point release (along with further updates for MediaWiki core and the
bundled skins).

MediaWiki 1.37 will be supported until November 2022.

MediaWiki 1.38 is due to be released in May 2022.

=== Changes since MediaWiki 1.37.0-rc.2 ===
* Remove justinrainbow/json-schema from vendor.
* Updated pear/mail_mime from 1.10.9 to 1.10.11.
* Update deprecated Guzzle Psr7 function calls.
* (T281972) UserIdentityValue: Correct @since tags.
* Updated wikimedia/parsoid from v0.14.0-a19 to v0.14.0.
* Localisation updates.
* Tweak error message for missing composer dependencies.
