The subject of the exchange was a number of goods, including Roman coins. Their influx is documented by numerous finds as well as by ancient authors. One of the territories where we register quite a large number of Roman coin finds is the area of early historical Andhra. The specimens discovered here are found in various contexts, indicating their various applications. The hoards of silver and gold coins allow the observation of successive waves of the influx of Roman money, which is also confirmed by the finds of other categories – stray and settlement. The internal differentiation of the latter also allowed to define their mutual relations and tendencies in circulation. Observations of numismatic material and analysis of sources indicate that Roman coins could have had the function of a medium of exchange or payment in Andhra or, more broadly, India, but also played a bullion and prestigious role. The time of the influx of Roman money indicates that it was associated primarily with the period of the Satavahana Empire in Andhra. The essentially small number of registered Roman coins in relation to the territory and its role in trade indicates that the coins were only one, perhaps not a key element of Indo-Roman trade. W pierwszych wiekach po Chrystusie, subkontynent indyjski wszedł w orbitę handlowych zainteresowań państwa rzymskiego. Przedmiotem wymiany był szereg towarów, wśród których znalazły się rzymskie monety. Ich napływ dokumentują liczne znaleziska, a także przekazy autorów antycznych. Jednym z terytoriów, na którym rejestrujemy dość licznie znaleziska monet rzymskich, jest teren wczesnohistorycznej Andhry. Odkryte tu egzemplarze, znajdowane są w różnych kontekstach, co wskazuje na ich różnorodne zastosowanie. Skarby monet srebrnych i złotych pozwalają na obserwację kolejnych fal napływu rzymskiego pieniądza, co potwierdzają także znaleziska innych kategorii – luźne i osadnicze. Wewnętrzne zróżnicowanie tych ostatnich pozwoliło też na określenie ich wzajemnych relacji i tendencji w cyrkulacji. Obserwacje materiału numizmatycznego i analiza źródeł wskazuje, że rzymskie monety, mogły mieć w Andhrze, czy szerzej w Indiach, funkcję środka wymiany, czy płatności, ale także odgrywać rolę kruszcową i prestiżową. Czas napływu rzymskiego pieniądza wskazuje, że był on związany przede wszystkim z okresem władania w dynastii Satawahanów. Niewielka liczba zarejestrowanych monet rzymskich w relacji do terytorium i jego roli w handlu wskazuje, że monety były tylko jednym, zapewne nie kluczowym elementem handlu indo-rzymskiego.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNotae NumismaticaeRegulated Roman Coins and Their Imitations from India: Did Roman Coins Circulate as Money in the Subcontinent?2020 • Emilia SmagurThis paper focuses on a relatively unknown group of published and unpublished Roman gold coins and their imitations from India with a large gold plug placed behind the head of an emperor. This phenomenon was briefly discussed by Peter Berghaus, who rightly noticed that the size of the filling on those coins suggests that the purpose for placing such material into the hole was different than simply the repair of a piercing made previously for a piece of jewellery. He considers the possibility that the holes were made in order to check whether those coins were plated or not and were later refilled with gold so that the coins could return to the money market. I would like to present a different explanation of this phenomenon. I would argue that those coins were perforated and plugged in order to adjust their weight. Such an adjustment let them be used as money in the Subcontinent. Similar phenomena from various parts of the world and time periods constitute the key to understand the purpose of plugging those coins and those analogies are examined in this paper as well.Download Free PDFView PDFRoman Coins in India and their impact.pdfkanchan gangulyROMAN COINS IN INDIA AND THEIR IMPACT KANCHAN GANGULY The English word ‘Numismatic’ is derived from latin word ‘Numisma’, means ‘study of coin’. Coins are remarkably durable objects and remained in circulation for long periods of times after they were originally issued. There are several series of foreign coins found in India. It is often applied in India to coins by dynasties of non-indigenous origin, as well as to coins imported from abroad. Among such coins, I would like to discuss some of the best coins found in Ancient India, the Roman coinages. So I shall pick up only a few of them to illustrate the relevance of their study, imported into India by a way of trade, brought by the Indians and left behind by the travelers. The discovery of a large number of Roman coins in India should originally indicate about commercial contacts of their origin. The coins are actually used for payments, but their value would have been determined by the worth of their metal in the Indian market. The Roman coins imported as bullion could have been used in certain areas and periods as media of exchange. It containing precious metals such as gold and silver will have arrived in India as trade consignments. The importance of the Roman coins in India goes beyond their commercial implications. The impact and influences of Roman coins directly reflects on Indian coins. The arrival in India of large number of Roman coins can however be dated to the early phase of Indo-Roman trade, the period 30 BC - 45 AD. The coins are found in various parts of India, like Andhrapradesh, Gujrat, Nasik, Kerala and Tamilnadu. The issues of gold aurei and silver denarii coins exported to India were carefully selected with weight-standard and high gold and silver content. The coins are generally used as a medium of exchange, as raw material for the indigenous coinage, and as ornaments for the natives. In the present essay an attempt has to be made to investigate the impact and influence of Roman coins on India. The types, techniques, weight-standard, metal, variety of these coins have to be studied. Since a large number of research papers, some monographs and books are available for serious researcher. Here an attempt will be made to acquaint the layman about the significance and importance of the foreign coins specially the Roman coins found in India.Download Free PDFView PDFJulio-Claudian denarii and aurei in Campania and India "Annali dell'Istituto Italiano di Numismatica"  58 (2012), pp. 161-192Federico De RomanisThe relative predominance of some Julio-Claudian denarii and aurei in the Indian coin hoards and their relative rarity in the Vesuvian area are in fact interrelated phenomena that suggest a selective export of coins from Italy during the Julio-Claudian and early Flavian periods.Download Free PDFView PDFZAAK 6 01 BorellBrigitte  BorellDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Power of Images – Coin Portraits of Roman Emperors on Jewellery Pendants in Early Southeast AsiaBrigitte BorellAbstract: This contribution presents fi nds of jewellery pendants with imitations of Roman coins from Southeast Asia. The examples from Óc Eo in southern Vietnam have been known already since the 1940s. The state of our knowledge has now been broadened by the fi nds from U Thong and Khlong Thom in Thailand. In some cases, the great faithfulness of the imitations permits an exact identifi cation of the original prototype. The fi nd of a mould leads to the conclusion of local production. The custom of wearing Roman coins or their imitations as pendants is documented by numerous fi nds from southern India. The equivalent phenomenon in Southeast Asia is to be seen in the context of the network of maritime routes. In the early centuries after the turn of the era, their connections extended from the South China Sea to the Mediterranean. Questions arise regarding the reception and meaning of the depictions on these jewellery pendants in their respective Eastern environment.Download Free PDFView PDFSTUDIES IN SOUTH INDIAN COINS, Vol.304 NOTE ON THE SOLITARY ROMAN GOLD COIN IN SRI VENKATESWARA MUSEUM, TIRUPATI COLLECTION2020 • P V RADHAKRISHNAN PONNIAH VELLIAHThis paper aims to bring out the importance of the gold aureus of Roman Emperor Nero and its chisel mark on the confronting busts of the royal authority with reference to the similar chisel cuts known from other hoards found in India.

The comparison of the coins from the two complexes which belong to the second and third century A. D. respectively provides insights into the local monetary history of this city. The discovery of these hoards offered the opportunity to look beyond the local coin circulation and to examine the role these coins played in the economic history of Šrī Lankā in general; this in turn necessitated a compilation and discussion of all known punch marked coins hitherto unearthed on the island.Download Free PDFView PDFHistory of Ancient India: Volume VII: Economy, Agriculture, Crafts & Trade ed.

During this long period, its minting techniques underwent a sea of change from an indigenous style called Punch-marked technique evolved in the pre-Buddhist and Mauryan era to Greek inspired Die-striking method along with Casting of certain series probably inspired by Chinese coinage.
