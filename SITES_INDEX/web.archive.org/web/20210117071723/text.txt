The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing. The government is struggling to reverse a surge in violent crime.TipVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.Definitions and NotesArrow Right IconGeographyLocationCaribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of VenezuelaGeographic coordinates11 00 N, 61 00 WMap referencesCentral America and the CaribbeanAreatotal: 5,128 sq kmland: 5,128 sq kmwater: 0 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 173Area - comparativeslightly smaller than DelawareArea comparison mapEnlargeLand boundariestotal: 0 kmCoastline362 kmMaritime claimsterritorial sea: 12 nmexclusive economic zone: 200 nmcontiguous zone: 24 nmcontinental shelf: 200 nm or to the outer edge of the continental marginmeasured from claimed archipelagic baselinesClimatetropical;

Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8% per year, significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same period; however, GDP has slowed down since then, contracting during 2009-12, making small gains in 2013 and contracting again in 2014-17. Trinidad and Tobago is buffered by considerable foreign reserves and a sovereign wealth fund that equals about one-and-a-half times the national budget, but the country is still in a recession and the government faces the dual challenge of gas shortages and a low price environment. Large-scale energy projects in the last quarter of 2017 are helping to mitigate the gas shortages.Energy production and downstream industrial use dominate the economy. Oil and gas typically account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports but less than 5% of employment. Trinidad and Tobago is home to one of the largest natural gas liquefaction facilities in the Western Hemisphere. The country produces about nine times more natural gas than crude oil on an energy equivalent basis with gas contributing about two-thirds of energy sector government revenue. The US is the country’s largest trading partner, accounting for 28% of its total imports and 48% of its exports.Economic diversification is a longstanding government talking point, and Trinidad and Tobago has much potential due to its stable, democratic government and its educated, English speaking workforce. The country is also a regional financial center with a well-regulated and stable financial system. Other sectors the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has targeted for increased investment and projected growth include tourism, agriculture, information and communications technology, and shipping. Unfortunately, a host of other factors, including low labor productivity, inefficient government bureaucracy, and corruption, have hampered economic development.GDP real growth rate-2.6% (2017 est.)-6.1% (2016 est.)1.7% (2015 est.)country comparison to the world: 210Inflation rate (consumer prices)1.9% (2017 est.)3.1% (2016 est.)country comparison to the world: 109Credit ratingsMoody's rating: Ba1 (2017)Standard & Poors rating: BBB- (2020)GDP (purchasing power parity) -
