Physical exercise as a means of rehabilitation for patients with cancer is an emerging area of research and treatment, emphasizing the need for accurate and feasible physical capacity measurements. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of peak oxygen consumption (o2peak) predicted by the Ekblom-Bak test (E-B) and the Åstrand-Rhyming prediction model (A-R). Eight patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy participated in the study. Submaximal exercise tests were performed at 2 different submaximal workloads. Estimated o2peak values were obtained by inserting the heart rate (HR) from the 2 workloads into the E-B prediction model and the HR of only the higher workload into the Åstrand nomogram. A 20-W incremental cycle test-to-peak effort was performed to obtain o2peak values.

Methods: We collected data on all men who underwent military conscription at ages 16-25 from 1968 through 2005 in Sweden. CRF was assessed as maximal aerobic workload on a cycle ergometer test and was classified as low, moderate, or high. BMI (kg/m2) was classified as underweight (&lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), or obesity (&gt;30). Data was cross-linked on individual level through the Swedish unique identification number with follow-up data from national registers with high validity containing information on cancer diagnosis and mortality. Follow-up started at diagnosis and continued until death, emigration, five years after diagnosis, or end of follow-up (2019-12-31), whichever happened earliest.

The primary aim is to describe and compare resting energy expenditure (REE) and energy expenditure (EE) during different standardized sedentary, non-exercise and exercise activities in people with motor-complete paraplegia (Th7 to Th12.). A secondary aim was to compare men and women. Thirty-eight adults (10 women) with SCI, T7-T12 AIS A-B, were recruited. All the data were collected through indirect calorimetry. REE was measured in supine for 30 min after 8 h of overnight fasting. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) for activities was measured for seven minutes during sedentary, non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) and exercise activities. AEE increased four to eight times when engaging in NEPA compared to that in sedentary activities. Men had significantly higher resting oxygen uptake compared to women, 0.19 vs 0.15 l min(-1) (P=0.005), REE per 24 h, 1286 vs 1030 kcal (P=0.003) and EE during weight-b...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Methods and results Prospective cohort study with data from occupational health screenings in Swedish employees, including n = 471 216 (aged 18–74 years) between 1995 and 2020, and n = 169 989 in risk analyses.

However, less is known about the associations of domain specific sitting and breaks at work and self-rated global health, likewise if physical activity could influence the associations. Methods 36,120 adults (42% women) from the Swedish working population who participated in a nationwide occupational health service screening 2014 -2018 were included in this cross-sectional study. Sitting duration and frequency of breaking sitting time at work, self-rated global health, exercise, leisure time sitting, diet, smoking and stress were self-reported.

Methods A total of 35 participants (21 men and 14 women), aged 29 to 63 years, performed the Ekblom-Bak (EB) submaximal cycle test for estimation of VO2max and a maximal treadmill running test for direct measurement of VO2max. The baseline tests were conducted between 2009 and 2012, and the follow-up tests were completed 5 to 8 years later. Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (r) and paired sample t-test were used to analyse the association between change in measured and estimated VO2max.

However, existing literature has mainly investigated CRF at baseline. For HEPA initiatives, it is important to know how change in CRF in midlife associate with incident hypertension, and whether this varies between sexes, age and baseline CRF.

Change in CRF between the two tests was expressed as % change in absolute CRF (L·min-1) per year and categorized as “maintainers” (-1% to 1% change/year), “decreases” (≥-1% change/year) or “increasers” (≥1% change/year).
