Bioarchaeology shows us that human responses are far more complex and diverse. https://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2020/04/22/the-long-view-of-climate-change-and-human-health/?fbclid=IwAR3CnSM-KDVDPqSmZ-w4xfDO5h3jap9gDzXZD79-N2UFUgF-jdOsOBo56BYSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBioarchaeologists Speak Out: Deep Time Perspectives on Contemporary Issues2018_Changing the Climate: Bioarchaeology Responds to Deterministic Thinking About Human-Environmental Interactions in the Past2018 • Gwen Robbins SchugAs members of the global public become increasingly concerned about climate change, popular presses promote " scientific " narratives about the success or failure of past societies (e.g., Diamond 2011), human security literature perpetuates a narrative that violence is a " natural " outcome of increased competition in such circumstances (e.g., Barnett 2007), and generally, neither the public nor policy-makers are exposed to information about the topic of human-environmental interactions from those who know it best, anthropologists. This chapter explores the development of the human security field and the development of pseudo-evolutionary, ahistorical, adaptationist narratives about human behavior in the face of changing climates. The chapter also demonstrates implications of these narratives as they have been adopted by policy-makers at the EPA and DoD. Finally, the chapter provides an example of a bioarchaeological approach to research on human-environmental relations in the past and the complex dynamics that shaped the human experience of climate, social, and economic changes in the first and second millennium BCE in South Asia. Human security literature is the basis for planning for a warmer world. Anthropological perspectives are the necessary antidote to narratives of competition and violence that promote a governmental agenda to prevail at all costs.Download Free PDFView PDFHalcrow, Sian Ellen; Ward, Stacey Maree. “Bioarchaeology of Childhood.” In Oxford Bibliographies in Childhood Studies.

After the disintegration of the Indus civilization, in a phase known as the Early Jorwe (1400–1000 BC), hundreds of agrarian villages flourished in the Deccan region of west-central India. Environmental degradation, combined with unsustainable agricultural practices, contributed to the abandonment of many communities around 1000 BC. Inamgaon was one of a handful of villages to persist into the Late Jorwe phase (1000–700 BC), wherein reliance on dry-plough agricultural production declined. Previous research demonstrated a significant decline in body size (stature and body mass index) through time, which is often used to infer increased levels of biocultural stress in bioarchaeology. This article assesses evidence for growth disruption in the immature human skeletal remains from Inamgaon by correlating measures of whole bone morphology with midshaft femur compact bone geometry and histology. Growth derangement is observable in immature archaeological femora as an alteration in the expected amount and distribution of bone mass and porosity in the midshaft cross-section. Cross-section shape matched expectations for older infants with the acquisition of bipedal locomotion. These results support the hypothesis that small body size was related to disruptions in homeostasis and high levels of biocultural stress in the Late Jorwe at Inamgaon. Further, the combined use of geometric properties and histological details provides a method for teasing apart the complex interactions among activity and “health,” demonstrating how biocultural stressors affect the acquisition and quality of bone mass.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
