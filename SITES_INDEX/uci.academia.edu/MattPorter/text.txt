It is argued here however, that it is as much of an epistemic injustice to afford an agent excessive credibility due to a prejudice, or expectation that the agent ought to be a knower. Miranda Fricker’s central case of testimonial injustice by means of credibility deficit is explored in relationship to the election of celebrity figures as spokespersons. In this position, the person is not epistemically harmed by a credibility deficit, rather a credibility excess. Sam Smith’s 2016 Oscar speech controversy is utilized as a case study in order to theorize the potential harms enacted, epistemic or otherwise, by means of being prescribed a spokesperson, and ascribed a credibility excess.Keywords:  epistemology, spokespersons, credibility excess, epistemic injustice, pop-culture, postmodernism, celebrity, fame, Sam SmithSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Research was conducted in order to examine the factors that would contribute to corporate dress code policy could be more inclusive of the dress behavior of LGBT women, in addition to examining the potential modifications to styles, and product offerings that apparel brands could instate in order to better target lesbian women as a market segment. Self-identifying, employed, LGBT women (n=76) working in a variety of industries participated in interviews, and an online survey focused on their personal gender expression, and how their sexual orientation translated into how they desired to dress in a professional setting. We hypothesized that LGBT women would prefer the option of dressing in a more masculine way while at work. While supported, the majority of the participants would prefer that menswear brands would target them as a market, as opposed to ladieswear firms.Keywords: lesbian, dress behavior, gender, dress code, work-environment, LGBTSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Framed with reference to historical men's dress practice, and the respective sociocultural institutions-most notably against midcentury postmodernity, as well as against the continually controversial meta-modernity-it is uncovered how agents such as masculinity, media, and aspiration to social norms work to manipulate youth males' perception of, and expression through fashion. Moreover, it is theorized how the sartorial stylistic discontents between traditional, and "new" masculinities can be ameliorated across generational lines.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
