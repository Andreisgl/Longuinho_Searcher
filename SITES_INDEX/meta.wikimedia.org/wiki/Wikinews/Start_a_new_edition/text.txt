Yiddish (אידיש)[edit]
יודל 11:28, 9 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Comment: I currently moderate the existing Yiddish Wikipedia, on the same model of wikinews, where readers generate the issues in the news. יידיש וויקיפּעדיע Expending it into a full Yiddish wikinews form will contribute greatly to the Yiddish Wikipedia. Logically when issues are discussed in news form it attracts new readers and new authors who will edit the burning issues.
support – Gangleri | Th | T 20:38, 11 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]
At first I was sceptical that there are enough people who would be able to contribute news daily in Yiddish.  But now that I see יודל's work - if what he moderates (which is extremely active) could be made a wiki project it would be extraordinary. Very strong support.Dovi 08:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Oppose. While I support the Yiddish language, I think that at the moment Yiddish is not ready for a Wikinews edition. I have seen the work Yudl has done, but I do not think it's as simple as just moving it here. --Node ue 17:10, 19 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]
So what if it's not so simple?  From Yudel's work, it seems to me the idea would be to focus on the news that interests Yiddish speakers.  As long as it's kept NPOV, what's the problem?  This could be incredibly cool, and its a great way of drawing the interest of these people to other wiki projects. It could be the most active Yiddish wiki project.  Let's see how much support it gets.Dovi 18:55, 19 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Thinking back on this, it occurs to me what a blessing this could be: an active Yiddish wikinews site could help the Yiddish wikipedia take off.  Stories would link to articles which don't exist or have little information in them, and interested parties—people already reading the news in Yiddish—could contribute to the exapnsion of said articles.  As Yudl has pointed out.  Great idea! —en:Firespeaker / yi:Firespeaker 08:24, 20 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I just saw this by chance ... well how can they really do that? for yi you need right to left features that are not possible here. It would mix up the whole meta website ... well of course, another possibility would be to open a separate right to left meta website - that would also help us with the translations of the communications since Arabic is one of the core languages where we need translations. Hmmmm ... should this been sent to the foundation list since they are anyway talking about the re-organisation of meta? Anyway: to create the ui etc. in rtl languages you need a separate wiki to get things really work fine. Mediawiki was not written to have multilingual features ... well it will have them in future. Thanks for considering this!--Sabine 22:59, 29 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
You could maybe ask the people at n:he:, n:ar: if you could use there site as its RTL. Also you could just put the dir atribute on a div to rtl. Bawolff 21:43, 13 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Random right to left text. uses <div dir="rtl"> 
V Saravanan, London, UK
The "div dir" attribute works for display on the wiki page, but is useless for typing. In other words, working on rtl text in a ltr edit box is an incredible pain in the neck. I agree that if people want a host for intrastructure pages in Yiddish, then something like n:he: is probably the way to go. They can be linked to from here.

However, Dr. Alf has not been active on the english wikipedia for more than 7 months. User:Holy Roman Emperor has been blocked, User:CrnaGora is from Montenegro. How do they have enoguh votes?
My understanding is that they only need to be active on a croation language project for that amount of time. they only need 3 active valid votes, and 5 votes minimun. to be active they only need to be active for 2 months/200 edits. Also HRE changed his name on en. Anyways, I counted, they may not have 11 votes, but they have at least 5. user:Bawolff 21:31, 14 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Oppose -- support instead, at least initially, a joint effort between Malay and Indonesians to work on one Wikinews project. Now that a unified spelling is used for many years now, differences between the two are minimal. They are even less than Brazilian Portuguese and Iberian Portuguese, and those two share a Wikipedia. So I think it's a reduction of potential workforce and totally ridiculous to have an "Indoensian Wikinews". --Node ue 04:56, 12 January 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

This concept is a good one, and encompasses the idea of a regional news source.

Creating WikiNews story is not like Current events input. It requires more time and more energy. I emphasize I am not against Wikinews generaly, but I just doubt about the capacity of the community. I would appreciate the cs.wikinews edition and I am ready to change my vote to support, if I will feel it ín my bones.Reply[reply]
Slight oppose: Cinik 11:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC) (contrib. 8500+ on cs.wikipedia) IMHO cs.wiki has no capacity for this. Maybe later and in cooperation with sk.wiki. But it is only my POV for consider. Sorry me "excelent english".Reply[reply]
I agree with Cinik: cooperation with sk.wiki and "maybe later". In my opinion it is good if users interested in future Czech and/or Slovak Wikinews will sign here. Later, if there will be enough people willing to start something, we can seriously disscuss if it is right time to start this project.

Väsk 21:43, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC) No, I think it's better having three different wikis, but with very much cooperation (e.g. the Swedish page for Köpenhamn could be redirected to the Danish København). See archive and discussion page.
Do you mean four wikis, not three? :) nn, no, da and sv. BjarteSorensen 11:21, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Yes, why three? -- Olve 01:24, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)
As there aren't enough contributors to create one wikinews in each language at this point, a scandinavian Wikinews would be a good project to recrute participants. Hopefully we can create one wikinews in each language in the future too, but that does not make the scandinavian wikinews less interesting. The existance of a swedish wikinews is great, and I hope the scandinavian and swedish wikinews can cooperate closely (As I hope the scandinavian can cooperate closely with upcoming danish or norwegian (nynorsk/bokmål) wikinews-editions in the future).

 Oppose no.wikinews og sv.wikinews har tilsammen 3 aktive brukere (og da tar jeg hardt i). Wikinews trenger brukere som skriver nyhetssaker, ikke brukere som støtter prosjektet ved å stemme "ja" til det på meta. Jeg forslår at dere heller begynner å skrive saker - en til to målbevisste brukere som bruker en del tid på prosjektene er sannsynligvis alt som trengs for å komme i gang med no.wikinews og/eller sv.wikinews igjen. Jeg merker meg forresten at av de 8 som skrev seg på for å starte no.wikinews ble ingen egentlig aktive. Er det noen grunn til å anta at ting blir veldig forskjellig med skandinavisk wikinews? Kjetil r 01:15, 23 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Ja, det er det grunn til. 18 er mer enn 8, for det første... Jeg hører med blant de som hele tiden har vært skeptisk til særspråksvariantene fordi brukermassen ville bli for liten til å opprettholde kontinuiteten. Takk for at du underbygger dette argumentet FOR en fellesskandinavisk utgave. Der norsk og svensk var dødfødt og dansk trolig ville bli det, mener jeg og flere med meg at et fellesprosjekt faktisk har en større sjanse til å greie seg. -- Olve 02:18, 23 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Vel, 0% av 8 ble aktive på :no, og da blir kanskje samme andel av de som er for :skan også aktive? ;-)  Jeg er nok ikke enig i at jeg underbygger argumentet for en skandinavisk versjon. Hadde det vært slik at ALLE aktive (og nå gjør jeg den tvilsomme antagelsen at prosjektene har aktive brukere) fra de forskjellige skandinaviske prosjektene ble med over til en skandinavisk variant, kunne en skandinavisk variant gitt mening. Nå er det vel imidlertid slik at også mange ikke blir med over, fordi de synes de andre språkene er for vanskelige. Det er slettes ikke gitt at brukerbasen til skan.wikinews vil bli større enn brukerbasen til de enkelte prosjektene på egen hånd. Kjetil r 03:01, 23 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Hvor mange av de som stemte for den fellesnorske var noen gang særlige aktive på Wikipedia? Hvor mange av de som stemte (og stemmer) for den skandinaviske var noen gang aktive på Wikipedia. Hvilken liste ser ut til å ha de mest seriøse brukerne? -- Olve 01:18, 25 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Men det er da ikke relevant hvor mange som er aktive på Wikipedia? Det er såpass mange aktive på både nynorsk, bokmål og svensk Wikipedia at det uten større vanskligheter kunne blitt levende Wikinews-miljøer dersom folk var interesserte i det, noe de tydeligvis ikke er. Når det gjelder seriøse brukere som er interesserte i skan.wikinews ser tallet ut til å være ca. 3 - man kan neppe tolke kommentarer gjort i mars 2005 som at de er villige til å engasjere seg i prosjektet nå. Dessuten finnes det opptil flere seriøse Wikipedia-folk på listene over folk som var interesserte i svensk og norsk wikinews, uten at de engasjerte seg i Wikinews da disse utgavene startet opp (kanskje utenom de første to-tre ukene).

Looks like the skanwikinews might as well start using sv.wikinews, the only active contributor there seems to the Weatherbot. You might as well occupy it and ask for a move to skan.wikinews.org later;-) --Dittaeva 14:48, 2005 Apr 29 (UTC)
The proposal is supported by people from all the four Scandinavian wikipedias, with the only the Swedish input being divided for/against (2 for, 1 against on this page). The need for a Scandinavian Wikinews is quite clearly indicated by the front page of se:wikinews: The World news section seems to have been dormant since 2 April, and the former pope's health is apparently still ailing...! So let us get the Skanwikinews up and going. The vote is 14/1 (!) in favour and the need is obvious. Respectfully, Olve 19:42, 14 May 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]The Bokmål/Nynorsk project (no) is inactive again, as usual and as predicted. The Swedish project (sv) is inactive again, as usual and as predicted. There is a proposal for a third one (da). And this only version which may stand a chance is ignored to death despite overwhelming (15/1) support. Do we have a scandal yet? -- Olve 18:21, 18 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]LET’S START WORKING
We have 18/1 in favour of a common Scandinavian WikiNews site now, and we should be more than ready to get going.

Det er neppe lurt å opprette en ny wiki, da det er tilnærmet umulig å få dem stengt ned igjen selv om de er stein døde. Bruk heller en av de wikiene som allerede finnes, enten svensk eller norsk. Det er jo ingen aktivitet på disse, og om det er så mange som er interesserte i å jobbe med en skandinavisk modell er det neppe noe problem å overta en av dem. Sett opp infrastrukturen, og se om det kommer brukere som vil skrive der. Hvis det viser seg å være en suksess (dvs at det forsatt er aktivitet av betydning der om 4 måneder), kan man jo flytte hele greia til scan.wikinews.org. Kjetil r 03:05, 25 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]Yes, maybe no.wikinews.org with all the articles could be moved to the scandinavian one. First we should import all the articles from sv.wikinews.org. ----EIRIK\talk 18:05, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]Slovenian[edit]--Millosh 06:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

--Millosh 07:01, 4 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]Failed requests[edit]English - Dialects and editions[edit]Open English[edit]An English-language edition of Wikinews which is open to any contributor, and which does not add complications for newcomers to overcome before they may contribute.  Proposed by Amgine.
Let's be clear about this. What changed on Wikinews was that now articles either have to have the text {{develop}} on them, if they're not ready to be published and need work, or {{publish}} if they are ready for the Main Page. All instructions were updated to reflect this and the change was widely advertised.When either of these tags are used, the article concerned is listed automatically in the correct places. There's no need for time-consuming editing lists of articles scattered across the site. What we have now is a slick, simple, content management system. There has been no problems with the system since its launch.These changes were debated on Wikinews. (You can also see another debate that took place on my Talk page.) They recieved widespread support - except from Amgine. As a result of us not buckling to Amgine's bullying, he has now left the project, and is attempting to set up this fork. Dan100 6 July 2005 08:10 (UTC)Oh and, just for readers: here's the before and after of "How to write an article", around which this debate is centered. Which is easier? Make your own minds up. Dan100 6 July 2005 10:41 (UTC)I believe, Dan100, you have failed either to understand what this proposal is about, or to understand how this page is set up. It is not a place to top-post or engage in cheap rhetoric, but to express your support, or opposition, to a proposed edition. - Amgine 7 July 2005 01:05 (UTC)Amgine 19:13, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC) - In an example of what is the current mode of community interaction on en.wikinews, supporters of this edition are here being required to justify their support of this edition. - Amgine 7 July 2005 00:08 (UTC)
Waerth 19:18, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC) - I am of the view that first every possibility must be pursued to create a concensus within the existing framework of en.wikinews. I have received messages that this is being actively pursued. So I hope I can withdraw this vote quite soon :) Waerth 6 July 2005 18:19 (UTC)Dcabrilo 20:31, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC) - the direction into which English Wikinews is heading should be a major concern. It seems that everything is going towards a point of creating moderated news source, where new editors are treated in do-it-our-way-or-don't-do-it-at-all style, and decisions that make this possible are made by few editors without taking much time to have an open discussion about it. I don't see a way to reverse this motion, probably due my own limits (such as ignorance or unwillingness to engage into edit wars and flames). I don't know if English Wikinews can be helped, though now I see there is people willing to work on it. But, as it is right now, I support this. --Dcabrilo 6 July 2005 20:16 (UTC)Comment: I do not see the point of this new Wikinews.  The effect it will probably have is getting new users confused as to which Wikinews to contribute to.  At Wikinews, we are constantly revising our system to make it easier for new contributors, and, at this point, any major trimming-down of our long-standing policies will not produce quality articles.  -- NGerda 20:37, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)Mrmiscellanious 20:36, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)Comment: I think this is great, however I'm not quite sure a new wiki needs to be started.  I'd like to hear more about it before I start supporting or endorsing such a project. -Mrmiscellanious 20:47, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)Slightly support. I believe many changes have been made recently, which make the system more complex, in the name of making additions easier. I'd rather see a movement from the users here to work with WIkinews to reform it, but that's personal, I'm sure. 68.32.193.91 20:39, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)
apologies, the above is me. Lyellin 20:42, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)The new system in fact is easier.  To publish an article, all one needs to do is put a {{Publish}} tag at the bottom of the page, which is way easier than running around changing templates. -- NGerda 20:56, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)
NGerda, please, don't argue with me. I'm tired of it. Lyellin 21:09, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)
But I don't understand how it makes publishing more difficult.  -- NGerda 21:10, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)Support, but I am not sure a new edition is the way to slove the problem. I think Wikinews can be reformed --Cspurrier 00:26, 6 Jul 2005 (UTC)
Neutral. Davodd | Talk 00:28, 6 Jul 2005 (UTC) Under the current en.wn system - it would be unthinkable for a mom from Peoria simply to write an article about her local city council meeting - without being attacked as being irrelevant and/or too Americentric. (Although I would prefer a rise-up of the little people to overthrow the current en.wn anti-localism cabal that has entrenched itself as de facto annointers of what is - and is not - news and systematically attempt to force out admins and other users they either dislike or who refuse to adopt the approved, clique-like party line.)Davodd - huh?? What anti-localism? Are we on the same wiki? Dan100 6 July 2005 07:26 (UTC)Oppose. Edbrown05 I'm of the belief this all stems from NGerda's less than diplomatic implementation of DPL for moving stories from the 'Developing stories' list to 'Headlines'. And yeah, sure there are other issues, but I mostly frame it that way. I think the recent "imposition" by NGerda of that DPL system is a plus, even though I remained quiet about it because I didn't know to where it was headed. It is a significant decision for a contributor the change a story from "develop" to "publish", a distinction properly highlighted by the current software. Imagine the contibution rate experienced at Wikinews being equivalent to that at Wikipedia. The maintenance headache to keep tidy the stories in 'developing' from the stories currently 'headlined' would be a nightmare. I've in the past posted a story from 'developing' to 'headlines' that was already 'headlined' previously. If that is really what this is all about, then I strongly oppose.Oppose Sblive There shouldn't be two edition in the same language! Just make a voting and decide how to make Wikinews easier to use for newcomers. Sblive 6 July 2005 10:12 (UTC)Oppose. One English edition is enough. —Nightstallion (?) 08:59, 14 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]First of all, I would appreciate it if those who support a separate project would make their reasons clearer. Amgine has very much, in his FAQ, blamed the reasons for this "new Wikinews" to be created on me personally, because I wrote the inputbox extension and demonstrated its use (I did not revert a single time, have spent much time discussing possible improvements to the process, and was not involved in the DPL discussions that preceded it). To quote from the FAQ:
[T]he decision to switch exclusively to the DPL was made by Bureaucrat Eloquence without consulting the community and in violation of an uneasy compromise which had been reached by the community. The decision to alter the main page and include the inputbox format of article submission was a unilateral decision by Eloquence, one which had no community discussion and which no one else could possibly have done.I've responded to this on Talk:Wikinews/Open English, but again, I would much appreciate it if those supporting a "restart from scratch" would clarify whether they agree with this history of the events, and whether it played a role in their decision.
I'm not sure this is the right place for this discussion, as we're not talking about a new language edition, but a separate project, or a restart of the existing one. I do not consider the conditions which were developed for new language editions -- a relatively low level of support -- to be sufficient to start a project which is to exist in parallel to an existing edition in that language. But, just for the record, I of course oppose the creation of such a new edition. 
I do not think there's a high likelihood of this actually happening, but I don't want to give those people who have voiced concerns here the feeling that they are simply being ignored. As I understand it from talking to people, there are a lot of different issues that are being talked about here, ranging from Wikinews not being local enough, to issues generally being not discussed sufficiently, to the new publication model being suboptimal.
Therefore, I invite all those who are interested to join me for a chat about the future of Wikinews, which I am planning at Wikinews/Future talk. I think an open dialogue is what should be taking place here in the first place, rather than open confrontation, and I would love to get constructive feedback on how we can increase and ease participation on Wikinews. Thanks for listening,--Eloquence 04:57, 6 Jul 2005 (UTC)
Open English pre-launch is being worked on at Wikinews/Open English. - Amgine 21:37, 5 Jul 2005 (UTC)
Simple English[edit]If you pop over to the Simple English Wikipedia you'll see that the text around the articles in very easy for people to read (especially kids and newcomers to the english language) and it is steadily growing day by day. By creating a new Wikinews this will be a really easy-to-read news site as there aren't many that focus on kids and newcomers.

I don't find so! It is silly dilly to hope such effect. As long as the education institutions in the foreing countries ask for pure and correct English, it is a nonsens to wish a simple wiki for children: you will only produce childrens without good comprehension of English and make very dangerous educative experiences! More: you will damage the children with that! Nobody need simple English because simple English is only a concurent more for better easy English (British American Scientific International Commercial). And not a good concurent (the best concurent in my opinion is Ingliso!). BASIC is a standard. BASIC has a full dictionary that simple don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t has. BASIC has already a own litterature. Simple is only a desease of Wiki. Wiki is the biggest site for the domination of English and America on the world and mainly that, and simple is the complement at the base for that...Oui 19:36, 24 October 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]
