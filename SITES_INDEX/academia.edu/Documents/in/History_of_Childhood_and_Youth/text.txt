Desperate and vulnerable individuals in every continent continue to fall into its trap. Despitethis, there is dearth of descriptive study that attempts to unravel the strategies employed by the perpetrators inNigeria, as an important precondition for workable and reliable policy direction to address the problem. Thisarticle has filled this gap by using data from 40 cybercrime perpetrators selected with snowballing technique.The findings revealed that most of the cybercrime perpetrators in Nigeria are between the age of 22 and 29 yearswho were undergraduates and have distinctive lifestyles from other youths. Their strategies include collaborationwith security agents and bank officials, local and international networking, and the use of voodoo that is,traditional supernatural power. It was clear that most perpetrators of cybercrime were involved in on-line datingand buying and selling with fake identity among others. The article discussed the need for reorientation ofNigerian youths in higher institutions, and various methods as guiding principles for potential victims. Itrecommended a complete reorganization of the Nigerian Police Force and Economic and Financial CrimeCommission, as some of the officers in the institutions aid and abet cybercrime. It finally suggested a review ofthe Nigerian law guiding the operations of banking, poster agencies, and various speed post services in thecountry, as these are necessary preconditions to effectively combat the problem.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Aransiola•History of Childhood and Youth“Are There Any Children for Sale?”: Genocide and the Transfer of Armenian Children (1915–1922)Save to LibraryDownloadby Keith David  Watenpaugh•  26  Ottoman History, Sociology of Children and Childhood, Armenian Studies, Human RightsDeath Mother as Nature's Shadow: Infanticide, Abandonment, and the Collective UnconsciousThe archetypal Death Mother symbolizes women whose behaviour or feelings threaten the lives of their children.

Western culture, however, believes that women evolved to love their children instinctively and selflessly, and that women who abandon, neglect, harm or kill their children are unnatural. Thus the Death Mother has no place in our cultural consciousness. This can be problematic, because it means that the Death Mother is buried deep in the shadow and surrounded with shame.   In this article, I introduce Jungian and psychodynamic perspectives on the Death Mother, archetype and then focus on evolutionary and anthropological perspectives. My aim is to show that when the Death Mother is approached with compassionate curiosity, we can better help the mothers who are living this frightening energy, as well as those who grow up traumatized by her impact. In particular, I propose that that when we bring the Death Mother into consciousness, learn about her evolutionary roots, and humanize her, we start to dismantle the self-perpetuating cycles of shame that constellate around her archetypal energy, thereby opening the doors to meaningful change.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniela  Sieff•  20  Anthropology, Jungian psychology, Anthropology of Children and Childhood, History of Childhood and YouthKnapík, Jiří/Franc, Martin u.a.: Mezi pionýrským šátkem a mopedem.

À travers une analyse socioculturelle de la notion d’adolescence, Laura Di Spurio retrace les mutations et les permanences de la figure de la jeune fille. Au cours du XXe siècle, l’adolescence se mue en classe d’âge pour bientôt devenir un espace culturel, social et biopsychologique. L’adolescence devient un principe explicatif « pour toutes ». Ce nouveau modèle adolescent est dessiné par des adultes emplis de peurs face à cette jeunesse féminine qu’ils jugent plus précoce, plus libre et plus affirmée. Comment accorder cette notion pensée au masculin sans troubler un féminin que l’on voudrait éternel ? Comment appliquer cette notion à toutes les jeunes filles, même à celles dont le quotidien s’éloigne du modèle tracé par les scientifiques ? Que fait l’adolescence aux jeunes filles ? Et enfin, comment celles-ci troublent-elles la notion ?Ce sont les questions posées par cet ouvrage qui, à partir d’un corpus de sources variées, raconte un demi- siècle d’histoire du côté des jeunes filles.Save to LibraryDownloadby Laura Di Spurio•  5  Gender History, History of Childhood and Youth, Children and Youth, History of GirlhoodRoundtable on Making Two Vietnams-H-Diplo XXI-25-H-Diplo, Jan. 20, 2020Save to LibraryDownloadby Olga Dror and +1Wynn Gadkar-Wilcox•  15  Southeast Asian Studies, Youth Studies, Cold War and Culture, Cold WarSpeelgoed als afscheidsgeschenk, Grieks en Romeins speelgoed uit kindergraven en votiefdepotsSave to LibraryDownloadby Annemarieke Willemsen•  3  History of Childhood and Youth, History of Toys and Play, Roman ArchaeologyTasas de actividad infantil y género en la Cataluña de 1900: estudio de casos en la cuenca del TerThe aim of this article is to reconstruct child labour force partici- pation rate in the first decade of the twenty century in two textile Catalan towns in the Cuenca del Ter: Manlleu and Torelló.

Local statistics on child labour show that the massive incorporation of children to the labour market occurred after the age of then. School leaving records support this finding. The incorpo- ration of boys and girls to the labour market was sharply affected by the differ- ent gender organization of labour in the textile spinning manufactures in these two municipalities, especially within the range of then to fourteen years old. Occupations and labour conditions of both boys and girls were also very differ- ent. Our analysis includes supply and demand as well as institutional factors.Save to LibraryDownloadby JOSE MARIA  BORRÁS LLOP•  8  Industrial And Labor Relations, Labour history, Labour Law, History of Childhood and YouthSpaces Imagined, Places Remembered: Childhood in 1950s AustraliaWith the end of World War II, Australians turned to rebuilding their nation, placing the perceived educational and social needs of children at the forefront of their efforts.

Urban planners aimed to protect children from the potential degradation of urban environments through refashioning slums and laying out spacious streets in suburbia. Concomitant with a renewed public emphasis on the domestic life of the family, architects and home magazines promoted the benefits of modernism, which encouraged a stark functionalism and new social relationships within the home. School authorities and architects sought to create educational environments that would foster learning and instil discipline in pupils. Whilst these were the spatial discourses most dominant in 1950s Australia, closer examination of two Melbourne localities reveals that such ideals were often compromised in practice. Australia was suffering a housing crisis, with building hampered by material and labour shortages that persisted until the mid-1950s. A fertility boom and the influx of migration caused a demographic leap that left urban planners scrambling to provide infrastructure for the rapidly expanding city. Thousands of new homes and scores of new schools were urgently needed. Given these circumstances, many of the neighbourhoods, houses and schools of the 1950s failed to live up to the aspirational ideals of planning and architectural discourses. The childhood memories of people who grew up in Melbourne during the 1950s reveal a markedly different perspective to the expert spatial notions of this era. In their recollections of the landscapes and buildings of childhood, interviewees recalled emotional resonances, sensory experiences and social interactions associated with particular places. Urban planners and architects viewed physical environments as abstract spaces. But for post-war children, these environments were places imbued with complex personal meanings.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carla Pascoe Leahy•  5  Space and Place, Oral history, History of Childhood and Youth, History of architectureWouldn’t a Boy Do?”: Placing Early-Twentieth-Century Male Youth Sex Work into Histories of SexualityThe article shifts the question of how to make meaning of boys involved in sex work away from a central concern with the development of the homo/hetero binary.

This chapter continues to examine the existence of a ‘legacy of fraternity’ around youth sport and reveals a network of sporting leaders who pushed and pulled the boundaries of European integration through sporting means regularly battling for sporting independence from politics through the height of the Cold War to the Detente. From 1956 it was handed over to newly founded UEFA and the tournament provided a meeting space for youth in Cold War Europe. In the eyes of some of the organisers, such a competitive space was to serve as a common ground for inter-cultural exchange. It allowed older boys from countries on either side of the Iron Curtain to meet, play and experience a ‘cultural’ programme that was a key part of the early years of the event, though this faded over time with greater importance placed on professionalizing youth sport. The event grew into a pan-European meeting place but was not exempt from the rise of nationalism and subtle advances of sport over politics as well as the shift of the event away from a cultural gathering. It was in the eyes of a number of the early leaders more an international rendez-vous for youth than a football competition between national sides.mots clés - Tournoi juniors, football, histoire, fraternité, politique, guerre froide, jeunesseSave to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Tallec Marston•  18  European History, European Studies, International Relations, Football (soccer)Rethinking ‘ethnic’ soccer: the National Junior Challenge Cup and the transformation of American soccer’s identity (1935–1976)This paper contends that the way in which the term ‘ethnic’ is applied to the history of soccer in America needs rethinking.

Through a case study of the National Junior Challenge Cup (now know as the JP McGuire Cup), the country’s oldest ongoing competition across all youth sports, this paper examines the transformation of American soccer’s identity. The tournament began in 1935 and evolved from an initial constituency of ethnic, immigrant and Catholic youth clubs. Following societal demographic trends, the growing national participantbase came from more suburban, middle-class neighbourhoods. The 1970s witnessed a paradigm change in youth soccer as the sport began to move closer to mainstream consciousness. The tournament is a window into the complexity of defining the term ‘ethnic’ and its individuals who straddled both ‘ethnic’ and ‘native’ worlds. This article explores the origins of soccer in America, the bridges between ethnic identity, immigration and the foreign-native cultural debate and Soccer Americana.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Tallec Marston•  11  History, American History, American Studies, Youth StudiesGrown-ups, boys and girls in the Ghent cotton industry : The Voortman mills, 1835-1914Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter Scholliers•  15  History, Gender Studies, Women's Studies, Women's HistoryMothers of the Renaissance (2003)Save to LibraryDownloadby Margaret L.

Childhood has often been a particular site of struggle for negotiating the location of religion in public and everyday social life, and children's involvement and non-involvement in religion raises strong feelings because they represent the future of religious and secular communities, even of society itself. The Bloomsbury Reader in Religion and Childhood addresses wider questions about the distinctiveness of childhood and its religious dimensions in historical and contemporary perspective. Divided into five thematic parts, it provides classic, contemporary, and specially commissioned readings from a range of perspectives, including the sociological, anthropological, historical, and theological. Case studies range from Augustine's description of childhood in Confessions, the psychology of religion and childhood, to religion in children's literature, religious education, and Qur'anic schools.- Religious traditions covered include Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, in the UK and Europe, USA, Latin America and Africa- An introduction situates each thematic part, and each reading is contextualised by the editors- Guidance on further reading and study questions are provided on the book's webpageSave to LibraryDownloadby Anna  Strhan and +2Stephen G .

As such, it offers a valuable window into Australian approaches to managing and reforming boys through the twentieth century. The present paper examines its approach to reforming teenage boys during a period marked by a mass escape in 1961. It argues that the reformatory education initially intended was no longer tenable during this moment in history, and that this period represents a breakdown of that approach. This paper draws on material including newspaper reports, memoirs, and the report of an inquiry into an escape by inmates in 1961. These are analysed in order to construct a picture of the type of reformatory education during this period and the public and official responses to this. Westbrook Farm Home for Boys was, during this period, an institution attempting to provide a reformatory education at a historical moment when such an education was no longer viewed as appropriate means of addressing the criminal behaviour of youths. This, combined with the leadership of a domineering figure in Superintendent Roy Golledge, led to a culture of abuse, rather than education. The uncovering of this culture was a pivotal moment in the transition of Westbrook into an institution explicitly dealing with criminal youths.Save to LibraryDownloadby Clarissa Carden•  6  History of Education, Juvenile Justice, History of Childhood and Youth, Australian HistoryCenturies of Childhood Conference ProgrammeCenturies of Childhood was a multidisciplinary conference exploring the history of children and childhood in Ireland and beyond from the late sixteenth century onward.

Die Arbeit verbindet diese innovative Forschungsrichtung mit der historischen Selbstzeugnisforschung: Untersucht werden Texte und Bilder, die die körperliche Verfasstheit als Teil alltäglicher Existenz thematisieren. Dazu gehören Lebensbeschreibungen, Haus- und Familienbücher, Kalendarien, Diarien, Rechnungs- und Haushaltsbücher sowie Briefe. Auf diese Weise rücken Aufzeichnungspraktiken, Kategorisierungs- und Benennungsfragen in den Blick. Zugleich werden die fließenden Übergänge zwischen ›Gesundheit‹ und ›Krankheit‹, ›Funktionsfähigkeit‹ und ›Untauglichkeit‹ deutlich. Die Studie zeigt die differenzierten Erwartungen, Haltungen und Inszenierungen auf, die sich mit dem ›gebrechlichen‹ Körper innerhalb bestimmter sozialer Gruppen verbanden und diesen als Teil der familiären Gedächtniskultur festschrieben.Disability History versteht sich als eine neue, umfassende Forschungsperspektive, die nicht auf die Erforschung eines Teilgebiets begrenzt ist, sondern den Blick auf das soziale und kulturelle Ganze richtet.

It deals with sections in Fronto's letters concerning wet-nurses and breastfeeding, pedagogues, child beating, youthful (mis)behaviour, affective relationships between master and pupil, pueri senes and old age – interesting passages hardly noticed by social historians or insufficiently treated in the commentary by M. P. J. VAN DEN HOUT. In the fourth paragraph, I elucidate passages testifying to the warm and close relationship between Fronto and the young children of Marcus Aurelius' imperial family. Both these texts and the letters about Fronto's grandchildren (elaborated upon in the fifth paragraph) reveal a petting attitude towards children, a way of thinking which is parallelled in various other sources,  especially in epigraphical poetry. In the conclusion, I ask whether Fronto's way of looking at children is to be linked with a changed attitude in the Antonine second century. I am, however, rather reluctant to posit suchlike changed mental attitude.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christian Laes•  3  History of Childhood and Youth, History of the Family, Roman Life courseДетско-молодёжная игра в традиционной культуре / Children and Youth Games in the Traditional CultureНаучно-популярная заметка.Названия разделов: Детские игры в культурологическом аспекте;Детские игры-потешки и старинные обряды;Детское игровое пространство и время;Подростковое антиповедение;Мелкие бесы.Save to LibraryDownloadby Vladimir Korshunkov•  19  Cultural Studies, Game studies, Sociology of Children and Childhood, Youth StudiesJuvenile Nation: Youth, Emotions and the Making of the Modern British CitizenIn the first five months of the Great War, one million men volunteered to fight.

Why did so many enlist, and conversely, why so few? Focusing on analyses of widely felt emotions related to moral and domestic duty, Juvenile Nation broaches these questions in new ways. Juvenile Nation examines how religious and secular youth groups, the juvenile periodical press, and a burgeoning new group of child psychologists, social workers and other ‘experts’ affected society’s perception of a new problem character, the ‘adolescent’. By what means should this character be turned into a ‘fit’ citizen? Considering qualities such as loyalty, character, temperance, manliness, fatherhood, and piety, Stephanie Olsen discusses the idea of an ‘informal education’, focused on building character through emotional control, and how this education was seen as key to shaping the future citizenry of Britain and the Empire. Juvenile Nation recasts the militarism of the 1880s onwards as part of an emotional outpouring based on association to family, to community and to Christian cultural continuity. Significantly, the same emotional responses explain why so many men turned away from active militarism, with duty to family and community perhaps thought to have been best carried out at home. By linking the historical study of the emotions with an examination of the individual’s place in society, Olsen provides an important new insight on how a generation of young men was formed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephanie Olsen•  10  History of Religion, Gender History, British History, History Of Emotions“Education and Politics in Wartime:  School Systems in North and South Vietnam, 1965-1975," Journal of Cold War Studies, 2018-ExcerptsOnly excerpts available here.

Full text is at https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/jcws_a_00819 (or through library access)Abstract:From the late 1950s until 1975, the war between North and South Vietnam had both domestic and international consequences. Unlike the Cold War divide between the United States and the Soviet Union, the war between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV, the Communist North) and the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, the non-Communist South) was an armed conflict between two polities that both identified themselves as Vietnamese. In this twenty-year-long struggle, the fates of the DRV and the RVN were tied to their success in producing new generations who would subscribe to their respective agendas. This was done through many venues, of which education was one of the most important.           This article analyzes the educational systems at the primary and secondary school levels in the DRV and RVN after the division of the country, with a special focus on the years between 1965 and 1975. It considers their respective “divorces” from the colonial educational system and explores their goals, their problems, and the means they used to overcome these problems. Moreover, the DRV attempted to create an educational mini-empire with the DRV centered agenda—establishing a Vietnamese-based system in China, bringing into the DRV Laotian children, and exporting their ideology in the educational system established in the NLF-controlled territories of the RVN. The DRV created a rigidly politicized school system focused on the war and the construction of socialism. The RVN, creating an educational antipode of the North, endeavored to separate schools from the war, largely taking politics out of the curriculum and leaving pupils to figure out for themselves the aims of the conflict and their place in it, stranding many of them in ambiguity. If the DRV system was depriving pupils of the means to challenge the government, the RVN was supplying children with such means. Relying on archival materials and published documents, this article compares the educational systems at the primary and secondary school levels in the DRV and RVN after the division of the country, with a special focus on the period 1965–1975.Save to LibraryDownloadby Olga Dror•  19  Education, Southeast Asian Studies, Youth Studies, Cold War and CultureForever young: Childhoods, fairy tales and philosophyFairy tales play a substantial role in the shaping of childhoods.

Developed into stories and played out in picture books, films and tales, they are powerful instruments that influence conceptions and treatments of the child and childhoods. This article argues that traditional fairy tales and contemporary stories derived from them use complex means to mould the ways that children live and experience their childhoods. This argument is illustrated through representations of childhoods and children in a selection of stories and an analysis of the ways they act on and produce the child subjects and childhoods they convey. The selected stories are examined through different philosophical lenses, utilizing Foucault, Lyotard and Rousseau. By problematizing these selected stories, the article analyses what lies beneath the surface of the obvious meanings of the text and enticing pictures in stories, as published or performed. Finally, this article argues for a careful recognition of the complexities of stories used in early childhood settings and their powerful and multifaceted influences on children and childhoods.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marek Tesar and +3David W KupfermanSophia RodriguezSonja K Arndt•  84  Philosophy, Political Philosophy, Education, Media StudiesJames Joyce's "The Sisters": Implied Pederasty and Interpreting the InexpressibleThe topic of pederasty in "The Sisters" has attracted extensive commentary.

In this discussion, the boy's confusion, growing up at the crux of two views of masculinity, has not been explored. Moreover, Father Flynn's nostalgic view of boyhood, and his dependency on the company of the boy, also warrants exploration. Furthermore, little has been made of the boy's antagonistic relationship with Father Flynn's sisters, as there is evidence in the story that the boy is considered corruptive. It is my contention that pederasty is not the larger issue, as in another context, this could be contested. Rather, the boundary between the boy and adults is constructed across two opposing ideals of masculinity, obliterating any possibility of contestation. Subsequently, sentient and reflexive aspects of the boy's characterization deviate from how children are viewed by adult characters in Dubliners.Save to LibraryDownloadby Barry Ryan•  19  Irish Studies, Sociology of Children and Childhood, Irish Literature, James JoyceInnocents Abroad: Borders, Citizenship, and What Children's Historians Can Tell Us About the World TodayA version of this article was delivered as the plenary lecture at the Society for the History of Children and Youth at Rutgers University-Camden, June 2017.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nara Milanich•  6  Sociology of Children and Childhood, Refugee Studies, Immigration, History of Childhood and Youth„Kinder, die unter Steinen aufwachsen“ Die Kinderdarstellung der Neuen Sachlichkeit im Kontext der Großstadt der Weimarer RepublikDer Beitrag beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, wie die Maler der Neuen Sachlichkeit in den 1920er Jahren Urbanisierung unter Betonung der kindlichen Entwicklung wahrnahmen und welche Wertungen sie diesbezüglich vornahmen.

Diametral zum romantischen Menschenbild führte ihre neusachlich veristische Schilderung von Kindern im urbanen Raum zu einer verstörenden Entzauberung der Kindheitsdarstellung. Dieser Wandel im Seh- und Darstellungsverhalten wurde einerseits von der prekären Nachkriegszeit und den sozial fragwürdigen Umständen in den Städten ausgelöst. Andererseits beruht dieser Wandel auf der neu entstandenen Psychoanalyse, welche der Kindheitsentwicklung erstmals eine große Bedeutung im Hinblick auf die Persönlichkeitsbildung beimaß. Für die Analyse wurden exemplarisch neusachliche Kinderdarstellungen ikonografischen Gruppen zugeordnet, in denen sie unter sozial-historischen Aspekten untersucht werden.  Das Motiv der Kindheit ist innerhalb der Malerei der Neuen Sachlichkeit von ganz wesentlicher Bedeutung. Kinder sind stets die schwächsten Mitglieder der Gesellschaft, und deshalb hängt ihr Leben außerordentlich von den sozialen, politischen und kulturellen Bedingungen ab, die durch die Erwachsenen geschaffen werden. Die Künstler der Neuen Sachlichkeit stellten diese Abhängigkeit mittels urbaner Szenen dar, in denen die Kinder keinen Platz zu einer ihnen gemäßen Entfaltung fanden. Sie drückten Solidarität mit ihren Motiven aus, indem sie Kinder in anklagender und oftmals empathischer Weise innerhalb eines urbanen und proletarisch geprägten Milieus zeigten.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ines Heisig•  3  History of Childhood and Youth, Neue Sachlichkeit / New vision, Weimarer RepublikThe 'Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa' and the foundling tokensHospital de Todos-os-Santos [All Saints Hospital] received since 1504 - the year the Regimento [rules of procedure] were approved - the abandoned or orphaned children of the city.

Minors were placed in the Hospital wheel so this institution would foster, support, and educate them. Since 1564 the Hospital administration was entrusted to the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa. Some years later, in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake on November 1, 1755, that Confraternity took on the direct responsibility for assisting unprotected children, creating the Hospital dos Expostos [Foundling Hospital].Therefore, a considerable collection of documents (almost 200 linear metres) relating to the assistance of foundlings, covering a period dating back to the 17th century, is preserved in the Historical Archive of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa (AHSCML). This collection includes different archival series, with common and complementary information. Some of these series are rare, such as the foundling tokens, which consist in handwritten notes that were left with some children when they were placed on the wheel. Sometimes these documents were accompanied by other pieces of various types.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nelson Moreira Antão•  20  History, Archival Studies, Early Modern History, Manuscripts and Early Printed BooksLo scautismo cattolico italiano di fronte al fascismoLe scelte dell'Associazione scautistica cattolica italiana (Asci) nel conflitto con la politica giovanile del regime fascista.

The study provides an important corrective to the existing accounts of re-education by proposing an approach in which institutional practices are analysed both from above and from below. The book draws attention to the process of reforming identities – the construction of reformatory identities – as the core of residential re-education. Special emphasis is placed on the interplay of notions of gender and social background.The book is based on extensive archival research drawing from a wide range of new and neglected sources. The primary material includes a unique collection of documents produced by the girls of the Vuorela State Reform School in Finland. Narrative analysis of correspondence, and careful scrutiny of the official sources created for re-educational purposes, form a basis for the investigation of the interaction between pupils’ own self-expression and the aims of re-education in the construction of reformed identities. The practices developed in Finland are carefully contextualised in the European history of re-education.Save to Libraryby Kaisa Vehkalahti•  7  Cultural History, History of Education, Juvenile Delinquency, History of Childhood and YouthMore Ignorant and Stupid Than Wilfully Cruel: Homicide Trials and 'Baby-Farming' in England and Wales in the wake of the 1908 Children ActThis article examines the impact of the Children Act 1908 on longstanding concerns that foster or informally 'adoptive' parents were uniquely likely to murder the children in their care.

Making particular reference to the last two high-profile cases of 'baby-farmers' tried for homicide on the Welsh and English Assize circuits (in 1907 and 1919, respectively) it argues that the infant life protection provisions in the 1908 Act had a dramatic and immediate impact on such prosecutions, removing the automatic presumption of malice in cases where fostered or adopted children died in suspicious circumstances.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Grey•  12  History, Criminal Justice, Gender History, British HistoryNextLast »Related TopicsHistory of ChildhoodFollowFollowingChildhood studiesFollowFollowingSociology of Children and ChildhoodFollowFollowingGender HistoryFollowFollowingAnthropology of Children and ChildhoodFollowFollowingHistory of EducationFollowFollowingCultural HistoryFollowFollowingHistory of the FamilyFollowFollowingGender StudiesFollowFollowingSocial HistoryFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
