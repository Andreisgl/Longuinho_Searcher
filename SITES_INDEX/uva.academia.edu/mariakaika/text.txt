Financializing Healthcare and Infrastructures of Social Reproduction: How to Bankrupt a Hospital and be Unprepared for a PandemicMosciaro, M., Kaika, M., & Engelen, E. (2022).

We call for the need to document and theorize the “lived” dimension of the financialization and marketization of social reproduction infrastructures, and of healthcare in particular. Our argument draws empirically on the analysis of patient and staff safety and vulnerability issues related to the bankruptcy of the Slotervaart hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  The case of Slotervaart’s bankruptcy that we analyze here is not only a story about financialization, marketization, and commodification of healthcare; it is also (and we argue, more importantly so) a story about the financialization of everyday life of doctors, nurses and patients, and about  the broader results of the delegation of near-absolute power to finance-led institutions over key social reproduction infrastructures.  Our analysis aims to put the management of infrastructures of social reproduction to the core of academic and policy debate; an act that the COVID-19 pandemic has made imperative.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

PapersRecommoning water: Crossing thresholds under citizen-driven remunicipalisationby Dona Geagea and maria kaikaGeagea, D., Kaika, M., & Dell’Angelo, J. (2023). Recommoning water: Crossing thresholds under citizen-driven remunicipalisation. Urban Studies. doi:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00420980231169612,  2023Since 2008, the call to 'remunicipalise' water resources has become a key strategy for water move... more Since 2008, the call to 'remunicipalise' water resources has become a key strategy for water movements across Europe. Remunicipalisation aimed at opposing the new wave of privatisation programmes and water commodification incentivised under austerity frameworks. However, the water movements' lack of direct engagement with questions of re/commoning resulted in underexplored links, in practitioner and scholarly arenas, between demands for water remunicipalisation and practices of commoning. This article brings into dialogue the bodies of literature on commoning and remunicipalisation. It examines the conditions which enable crossing the paradigm threshold from municipal governance, towards more collective and situated models of water governance rooted in practices of commoning. The article operationalises the concept of recommoning water to capture this process, and proposes an analytical definition grounded in a case study of water remunicipalisation in Terrassa, Spain. In 2019, Terrassa achieved remunicipalisation to create a citizen water observatory. The empirical findings demonstrate that water activists in Terassa's Observatory are reclaiming and reproducing the commons on a daily basis through a process of experimentation with institutional bricolage and (re)negotiation of power and autonomy. This citizen-led observatory is ensuring that resources are shared in common, are used for the common good and are reproducing the commons. The study concludes that water remunicipalisation can act as an important step for enabling processes of recommoning. Nevertheless, the institutionalisation of recommoning water under a public management regime is confronted with multifaceted tensions that merit attention from both activists and policymakers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The refugees' right to the centre of the city: City branding versus city commoning in Athensby Haris Tsavdaroglou and maria kaikaTsavdaroglou, C., & Kaika, M. (2022).

However, as this article demonstrates, there are important claims of the right to the city raised by newly arrived refugees in the city of Athens. Although most refugees reside in overcrowded state-run camps on the outskirts of the city, there are many cases in which refugees enact the production of collective common spaces, occupying abandoned buildings in the urban core and claiming the right to the centre of the city. In this context and following the Lefebvrian notion of the right to the city and the spatial analysis on commons and enclosures, we explore the actions of refugees, and the way they engage in commoning practices that not only strive against the official state policies, but also often contest city-branding policies. In particular, we focus on the area of Exarcheia in Athens, which is an emblematic case of the conflicted nexus between investors' and refugees' right to the city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We focus in particular on the role of architects within this process as mediators between different stakeholders, who nevertheless have their own specific agenda to pursue. We draw on an empirical case of the Taipei Performing Arts Centre, a cultural flagship project built in Taiwan and designed by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture. Through a review of internal documents, interviews, and content analysis on archival data, we expose the controversy over the integration of the historical 'low culture' local food market into the design for the new 'high culture' Performing Arts Centre. Although the architects imagined and pursued the integration of the new centre into the existing local culture, both policymakers and local citizens contested this attempt. The study concludes that, despite claims from both policymakers and architects of representing 'the people', there were often misunderstandings, deliberate or otherwise, regarding the needs of 'the people' or indeed of who 'the people' are.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our aim is threefold: to explore ways for 'operationalising' degrowth concepts into urban and regional everyday spatial practices; to sketch pathways for taking degrowth conceptually and methodologically beyond localised experiments and inform larger scale planning practices and international agendas; and to critically assess the multiple ways in which such a radical urban degrowth agenda will have to differ in the Global North and in the Global South. We outline five steps for such a programmatic, yet paradigmatic, urban degrowth agenda. These are: (1) grounding current degrowth debates within their historical-geographical context; (2) engaging (planning) institutions in linking degrowth practices to urbanisation policies; (3) examining how urban insurgent degrowth alliances can be scaled up without co-optation; (4) focusing on the role of experts and professionals in bringing degrowth principles into everyday urban practice; and (5) prefiguring how degrowth agendas can confront the diverse and unequal urban social relations and uneven outcomes in the Global North and South.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We exemplify this through the conflict over Ancoats Dispensary, a Victorian hospital at the heart of one of the UK's most deprived communities in East Manchester, which faced demolition following the 2000 New Islington Regeneration Plan. Using ethnographic and archival data we show how 200 years of community struggles for healthcare became catalytic for establishing Ancoats' working class identity and how Ancoats Dispensary became the spatial/material and symbolic infrastructure for community continuity. The building's socially embedded history became key for articulating anti-gentrification struggles as its planned demolition was seen as a symbolic demolition of the community itself. Local citizens formed the Ancoats Dispensary Trust and utilised tactics from historical struggles and entrepreneurial strategies to envision an alternative future in the defence of social reproduction infrastructures.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As critical scholarship discerns in this namenominationan opportunity to rethink the human/more-thanhuman/environmental nexus, debating the Anthropocenebecomes in itself more policy/politically relevant than its actualconfirmation as a new geological epoch. However, theAnthropocene debate remains remarkably disembodied, engagingrarely with emerging actors and practices across the world thatdrive precisely the socio-ecological transformations that criticalscholars advocate. Correspondingly, most actors involved in thesepractices are indifferent to the Anthropocene debate. And here, Iargue, lies the task of academic labour: to engage in what I call ascholarship of presence; a scholarship that adds empirical weightto our theoretical musings around the Anthropocene. To do this,we need to be prepared simultaneously to explore the world likea frog and see it like an eagle; to be present locally, splashing(frog-like) into the murky waters of empirics; and to zoom-outbroaden the gaze (eagle-like) from localized struggles, makecomparisons and develop broader conceptual contributions. Sucha scholarship of presence can be instrumental in making theAnthropocene the quilting point for articulating geographicallyfragmented struggles into a new ethico-aesthetic paradigm.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is a pre publication DraftA sharp increase in racism and xenophobia, alongside an increase in philanthropy and charity mark... more A sharp increase in racism and xenophobia, alongside an increase in philanthropy and charity mark Europe's Janus-faced reaction to the social consequences of the economic crisis. This paper goes beyond the racism/xenophobia vs. charity/philanthropy dualism, arguing that these seemingly antithetical responses have more in common than we may think.1) Both are equally divisive and 'othering' practices. Whilst racism transforms human beings into de-humanized entities in order to be able to hate them, charity transforms human beings into dependent objects in order to be able to offer aid; 2) Both are strongly a-ffective yet deeply apolitical reactions of people who lose their political agency as they become imbued with fear and insecurity; of citizens who turned into indebted apolitical objects, when social solidarity and welfare provision turned from a collective responsibility into a private affair. When housing, healthcare etc. became accessible mainly through private loans and mortgage markets, private welfare debt became the biopolitical tool that enrolled the workforce into volatile financial speculative practices and turned citizens into fear-imbued 'idiots', i.e. private individuals who can only care for their private matters. Understanding the biopolitics of privatized welfare and increased household debt as the process that drives this transformation of citizens into 'idiots', allows to move beyond the false dilemma of charity vs. racism, in search of a politics of solidarity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the new call for “safe, resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities” remains path-dependent on old methodological tools (e.g. indicators), techno-managerial solutions (e.g. smart cities), and institutional frameworks of an ecological modernization paradigm that did not work. Pursuing a new urban paradigm within this old framework can only act as immunology: it vaccinates citizens and environments so that they can take larger doses of inequality and degradation in the future; it mediates the effects of global socio-environmental inequality, but does little towards alleviating it. Indeed, an increasing number of communities across the world now decline these immunological offers. Instead, they rupture path dependency and establish effective alternative methods for accessing housing, healthcare, sanitation, etc. I argue that real smart solutions and real social innovation are to be found not in consensus-building exercises, but in these dissensus practices that act as living indicators of what/where urgently needs to be addressed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We ground our analysis on two grassroots conflicts in Greece: the “nomiddlemen” solidarity food distribution networks (across Greece) and the movement against gold mining in Halkidiki (northern Greece). Using a Gramscian political ecology framework, our analysis shows that by reciprocally combining anti-austerity politics and alternative ways of understanding and using “nature,” both projects challenge the reproduction of uneven society–environment relations exacerbated by the neoliberal austerity agenda.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Indeed, the 'sustainability' of contemporary urban life (understood as the expanded reproduction of its socio-physical form and functions) is responsible for 80% of the world's use of resources and most of the world's waste. We wish to highlight how these urban origins are routinely ignored in urban theory and practice, and how feeble techno-managerial attempts to produce more 'sustainable' forms of urban living are actually heightening the combined and uneven socio-ecological apocalypse that marks the contemporary dynamics of planetary urbanization. This paper is, therefore, not so much concerned with the question of nature IN the city, as it is with the urbanization OF nature, understood as the process through which all forms of nature are socially mobilized, economically incorporated and physically metabolized/transformed in order to support the urbanization process. First, we shall chart the strange history of how the relationship between cities and environments has been scripted and imagined over the last century or so. Second, we shall suggest how the environmental question entered urban theory and practice in the late 20 th century. And, finally, we shall explore how and why, despite our growing understanding of the relationship between environmental change and urbanization and a consensual focus on the need for 'sustain-able' urban development, the environmental conundrum and the pervasive problems it engenders do not show any sign of abating. We shall conclude by briefly charting some of the key intellectual and practical challenges ahead.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Taking seriously the materiality of mortgage contracts as a means of forging new embodied practices of financialisation, we urge for the need to move beyond a policy- and macroeconomics-based analysis of housing financialisation. We argue that more attention needs to be paid to how funnelling land-related capital flows goes hand in hand with signing off significant parts of future labour, decisionmaking capacity and well-being to mortgage debt repayments. The paper offers two key insights. First, it exemplifies how macroeconomic and policy changes could not have led to the financialisation of housing markets without a parallel biopolitical process that mobilised mortgage contracts to integrate the social reproduction of the workforce into speculative global real-estate practices. Second, it expands the framework of analysis of emerging literature on financialisation and subjectification. Focusing on the mortgage defaults and evictions crisis in Spain, we document how during Spain's 1997–2007 real-estate boom the promise of mortgages as a means to optimise income and wealth enrolled livelihoods into cycles of global financial and real-estate speculation, as home security and future wealth became directly dependent on the fluctuations of financial products, interest rates and capital accumulation strategies rooted in the built environment. When, after 2008 unemployment escalated and housing prices collapsed, mortgages became a punitive technology that led to at least 500 000 foreclosures and over 250 000 evictions in Spain.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Justice, we argue, needs to be understood not as a formalised and preconceived 'thing' to be delivered or applied but as an open egalitarian ideal that movements across the world continuously redefine in  embodied and performed ways which are historically and geographically distinct. Drawing upon the fifteen year long anti-mining struggles of Rosia Montana, Romania, we explore the tension between seeking 'traditional' forms of justice (i.e. dialogic consensual politics) and putting forward more radical demands for socio-ecological change, in which representation and recognition are seen as insufficient practices for distributing justice .  As visibility (rather than recognition) and egalitarian politics (rather than distribution) become the quilting points of struggles of many contemporary environmental movements, it becomes clear that equality can only be enacted (or staged) through praxis that disrupts the distribution of the sensible experience and exposes the arbitrariness and incompleteness of power. We argue that in order to analyse and theorize the praxis of contemporary environmental movements, it is imperative for geographical literature to engage with post-foundational theory, and 'un-do' pre-conceived ideas and theorizations of (environmental) justice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unfashionably shifting research focus from global elites and the “creative class” to local industrial elites and industrial workers, we show that socially embodied local struggles over land are as relevant to globalized urbanizations as they had been to industrial capitalism, and need to be brought back squarely into geographical analysis. We focus empirically on the closely knitted histories of the Pirelli company, Pirelli's workers, and Pirelli's industrial space at Bicocca (north-east Milan). As we unfold Bicocca's transformation from workers' village (nineteenth century), to radical industrial action hub (1960s–1970s), and finally to trendy mixed-use space (1990s–2000s), we show how, for over a century, social struggles over land remain the terrain on which new forms of urbanity are fought, and highlight two important points. First, class struggle over the economic, social, and symbolic role of industrial land was not the outcome of, but an essential precondition for urban restructuring. Second, the industrial working class and traditional elites were not passive recipients, but active producers of urban change.Italian abstract: L'articolo considera il ruolo fondamentale che il conflitto di classe relativo allo spazio urbano gioca nella negoziazione di nuove forme di urbanità. L'articolo si discosta dalle analisi in voga sulla classe creativa e sulle élite globali per concentrarsi su élite e lavoratori industriali locali. Il lavoro vuole dimostrare che le lotte tra questi ultimi, per il controllo di determinate porzioni dello spazio urbano, sono rilevanti per l'urbanizzazione globalizzata tanto quanto lo sono state per le dinamiche del capitalismo industriale, e meritano di essere inserite a pieno titolo nell'analisi geografica. La ricerca empirica si concentra sulla fitta trama di vicende che vedono protagonisti il gruppo Pirelli, i suoi lavoratori e l'area su cui era insediato uno dei suoi principali stabilimenti industriali (Bicocca, nell'area nord-est di Milano). Percorrendo le tappe della trasformazione di Bicocca da ‘villaggio dei lavoratori’ (XIX secolo) a centro dove si sperimentano nuove forme di lotta operaia (anni ‘60-‘70) e, infine, a nuovo distretto culturale, residenziale e di servizi (anni ‘90-‘00), si vuole evidenziare come, per oltre un secolo, il conflitto sociale relativo allo spazio rappresenti il terreno su cui si gioca la costruzione di nuove forme di urbanità. In particolare il lavoro vuole mettere in risalto due punti fondamentali. In primo luogo che la lotta di classe che ruota intorno al ruolo economico, sociale e simbolico dello spazio industriale non è il risultato, ma una precondizione essenziale della ristrutturazione dello spazio urbano. In secondo luogo che la classe operaia e le tradizionali élite industriali non sono destinatari passivi bensì protagonisti attivi della trasformazione urbana.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The refugees' right to the centre of the city: City branding versus city commoning in Athensby Haris Tsavdaroglou and maria kaikaTsavdaroglou, C., & Kaika, M. (2022).

However, as this article demonstrates, there are important claims of the right to the city raised by newly arrived refugees in the city of Athens. Although most refugees reside in overcrowded state-run camps on the outskirts of the city, there are many cases in which refugees enact the production of collective common spaces, occupying abandoned buildings in the urban core and claiming the right to the centre of the city. In this context and following the Lefebvrian notion of the right to the city and the spatial analysis on commons and enclosures, we explore the actions of refugees, and the way they engage in commoning practices that not only strive against the official state policies, but also often contest city-branding policies. In particular, we focus on the area of Exarcheia in Athens, which is an emblematic case of the conflicted nexus between investors' and refugees' right to the city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We focus in particular on the role of architects within this process as mediators between different stakeholders, who nevertheless have their own specific agenda to pursue. We draw on an empirical case of the Taipei Performing Arts Centre, a cultural flagship project built in Taiwan and designed by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture. Through a review of internal documents, interviews, and content analysis on archival data, we expose the controversy over the integration of the historical 'low culture' local food market into the design for the new 'high culture' Performing Arts Centre. Although the architects imagined and pursued the integration of the new centre into the existing local culture, both policymakers and local citizens contested this attempt. The study concludes that, despite claims from both policymakers and architects of representing 'the people', there were often misunderstandings, deliberate or otherwise, regarding the needs of 'the people' or indeed of who 'the people' are.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our aim is threefold: to explore ways for 'operationalising' degrowth concepts into urban and regional everyday spatial practices; to sketch pathways for taking degrowth conceptually and methodologically beyond localised experiments and inform larger scale planning practices and international agendas; and to critically assess the multiple ways in which such a radical urban degrowth agenda will have to differ in the Global North and in the Global South. We outline five steps for such a programmatic, yet paradigmatic, urban degrowth agenda. These are: (1) grounding current degrowth debates within their historical-geographical context; (2) engaging (planning) institutions in linking degrowth practices to urbanisation policies; (3) examining how urban insurgent degrowth alliances can be scaled up without co-optation; (4) focusing on the role of experts and professionals in bringing degrowth principles into everyday urban practice; and (5) prefiguring how degrowth agendas can confront the diverse and unequal urban social relations and uneven outcomes in the Global North and South.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We exemplify this through the conflict over Ancoats Dispensary, a Victorian hospital at the heart of one of the UK's most deprived communities in East Manchester, which faced demolition following the 2000 New Islington Regeneration Plan. Using ethnographic and archival data we show how 200 years of community struggles for healthcare became catalytic for establishing Ancoats' working class identity and how Ancoats Dispensary became the spatial/material and symbolic infrastructure for community continuity. The building's socially embedded history became key for articulating anti-gentrification struggles as its planned demolition was seen as a symbolic demolition of the community itself. Local citizens formed the Ancoats Dispensary Trust and utilised tactics from historical struggles and entrepreneurial strategies to envision an alternative future in the defence of social reproduction infrastructures.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As critical scholarship discerns in this namenominationan opportunity to rethink the human/more-thanhuman/environmental nexus, debating the Anthropocenebecomes in itself more policy/politically relevant than its actualconfirmation as a new geological epoch. However, theAnthropocene debate remains remarkably disembodied, engagingrarely with emerging actors and practices across the world thatdrive precisely the socio-ecological transformations that criticalscholars advocate. Correspondingly, most actors involved in thesepractices are indifferent to the Anthropocene debate. And here, Iargue, lies the task of academic labour: to engage in what I call ascholarship of presence; a scholarship that adds empirical weightto our theoretical musings around the Anthropocene. To do this,we need to be prepared simultaneously to explore the world likea frog and see it like an eagle; to be present locally, splashing(frog-like) into the murky waters of empirics; and to zoom-outbroaden the gaze (eagle-like) from localized struggles, makecomparisons and develop broader conceptual contributions. Sucha scholarship of presence can be instrumental in making theAnthropocene the quilting point for articulating geographicallyfragmented struggles into a new ethico-aesthetic paradigm.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is a pre publication DraftA sharp increase in racism and xenophobia, alongside an increase in philanthropy and charity mark... more A sharp increase in racism and xenophobia, alongside an increase in philanthropy and charity mark Europe's Janus-faced reaction to the social consequences of the economic crisis. This paper goes beyond the racism/xenophobia vs. charity/philanthropy dualism, arguing that these seemingly antithetical responses have more in common than we may think.1) Both are equally divisive and 'othering' practices. Whilst racism transforms human beings into de-humanized entities in order to be able to hate them, charity transforms human beings into dependent objects in order to be able to offer aid; 2) Both are strongly a-ffective yet deeply apolitical reactions of people who lose their political agency as they become imbued with fear and insecurity; of citizens who turned into indebted apolitical objects, when social solidarity and welfare provision turned from a collective responsibility into a private affair. When housing, healthcare etc. became accessible mainly through private loans and mortgage markets, private welfare debt became the biopolitical tool that enrolled the workforce into volatile financial speculative practices and turned citizens into fear-imbued 'idiots', i.e. private individuals who can only care for their private matters. Understanding the biopolitics of privatized welfare and increased household debt as the process that drives this transformation of citizens into 'idiots', allows to move beyond the false dilemma of charity vs. racism, in search of a politics of solidarity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the new call for “safe, resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities” remains path-dependent on old methodological tools (e.g. indicators), techno-managerial solutions (e.g. smart cities), and institutional frameworks of an ecological modernization paradigm that did not work. Pursuing a new urban paradigm within this old framework can only act as immunology: it vaccinates citizens and environments so that they can take larger doses of inequality and degradation in the future; it mediates the effects of global socio-environmental inequality, but does little towards alleviating it. Indeed, an increasing number of communities across the world now decline these immunological offers. Instead, they rupture path dependency and establish effective alternative methods for accessing housing, healthcare, sanitation, etc. I argue that real smart solutions and real social innovation are to be found not in consensus-building exercises, but in these dissensus practices that act as living indicators of what/where urgently needs to be addressed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We ground our analysis on two grassroots conflicts in Greece: the “nomiddlemen” solidarity food distribution networks (across Greece) and the movement against gold mining in Halkidiki (northern Greece). Using a Gramscian political ecology framework, our analysis shows that by reciprocally combining anti-austerity politics and alternative ways of understanding and using “nature,” both projects challenge the reproduction of uneven society–environment relations exacerbated by the neoliberal austerity agenda.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Indeed, the 'sustainability' of contemporary urban life (understood as the expanded reproduction of its socio-physical form and functions) is responsible for 80% of the world's use of resources and most of the world's waste. We wish to highlight how these urban origins are routinely ignored in urban theory and practice, and how feeble techno-managerial attempts to produce more 'sustainable' forms of urban living are actually heightening the combined and uneven socio-ecological apocalypse that marks the contemporary dynamics of planetary urbanization. This paper is, therefore, not so much concerned with the question of nature IN the city, as it is with the urbanization OF nature, understood as the process through which all forms of nature are socially mobilized, economically incorporated and physically metabolized/transformed in order to support the urbanization process. First, we shall chart the strange history of how the relationship between cities and environments has been scripted and imagined over the last century or so. Second, we shall suggest how the environmental question entered urban theory and practice in the late 20 th century. And, finally, we shall explore how and why, despite our growing understanding of the relationship between environmental change and urbanization and a consensual focus on the need for 'sustain-able' urban development, the environmental conundrum and the pervasive problems it engenders do not show any sign of abating. We shall conclude by briefly charting some of the key intellectual and practical challenges ahead.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Taking seriously the materiality of mortgage contracts as a means of forging new embodied practices of financialisation, we urge for the need to move beyond a policy- and macroeconomics-based analysis of housing financialisation. We argue that more attention needs to be paid to how funnelling land-related capital flows goes hand in hand with signing off significant parts of future labour, decisionmaking capacity and well-being to mortgage debt repayments. The paper offers two key insights. First, it exemplifies how macroeconomic and policy changes could not have led to the financialisation of housing markets without a parallel biopolitical process that mobilised mortgage contracts to integrate the social reproduction of the workforce into speculative global real-estate practices. Second, it expands the framework of analysis of emerging literature on financialisation and subjectification. Focusing on the mortgage defaults and evictions crisis in Spain, we document how during Spain's 1997–2007 real-estate boom the promise of mortgages as a means to optimise income and wealth enrolled livelihoods into cycles of global financial and real-estate speculation, as home security and future wealth became directly dependent on the fluctuations of financial products, interest rates and capital accumulation strategies rooted in the built environment. When, after 2008 unemployment escalated and housing prices collapsed, mortgages became a punitive technology that led to at least 500 000 foreclosures and over 250 000 evictions in Spain.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Justice, we argue, needs to be understood not as a formalised and preconceived 'thing' to be delivered or applied but as an open egalitarian ideal that movements across the world continuously redefine in  embodied and performed ways which are historically and geographically distinct. Drawing upon the fifteen year long anti-mining struggles of Rosia Montana, Romania, we explore the tension between seeking 'traditional' forms of justice (i.e. dialogic consensual politics) and putting forward more radical demands for socio-ecological change, in which representation and recognition are seen as insufficient practices for distributing justice .  As visibility (rather than recognition) and egalitarian politics (rather than distribution) become the quilting points of struggles of many contemporary environmental movements, it becomes clear that equality can only be enacted (or staged) through praxis that disrupts the distribution of the sensible experience and exposes the arbitrariness and incompleteness of power. We argue that in order to analyse and theorize the praxis of contemporary environmental movements, it is imperative for geographical literature to engage with post-foundational theory, and 'un-do' pre-conceived ideas and theorizations of (environmental) justice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unfashionably shifting research focus from global elites and the “creative class” to local industrial elites and industrial workers, we show that socially embodied local struggles over land are as relevant to globalized urbanizations as they had been to industrial capitalism, and need to be brought back squarely into geographical analysis. We focus empirically on the closely knitted histories of the Pirelli company, Pirelli's workers, and Pirelli's industrial space at Bicocca (north-east Milan). As we unfold Bicocca's transformation from workers' village (nineteenth century), to radical industrial action hub (1960s–1970s), and finally to trendy mixed-use space (1990s–2000s), we show how, for over a century, social struggles over land remain the terrain on which new forms of urbanity are fought, and highlight two important points. First, class struggle over the economic, social, and symbolic role of industrial land was not the outcome of, but an essential precondition for urban restructuring. Second, the industrial working class and traditional elites were not passive recipients, but active producers of urban change.Italian abstract: L'articolo considera il ruolo fondamentale che il conflitto di classe relativo allo spazio urbano gioca nella negoziazione di nuove forme di urbanità. L'articolo si discosta dalle analisi in voga sulla classe creativa e sulle élite globali per concentrarsi su élite e lavoratori industriali locali. Il lavoro vuole dimostrare che le lotte tra questi ultimi, per il controllo di determinate porzioni dello spazio urbano, sono rilevanti per l'urbanizzazione globalizzata tanto quanto lo sono state per le dinamiche del capitalismo industriale, e meritano di essere inserite a pieno titolo nell'analisi geografica. La ricerca empirica si concentra sulla fitta trama di vicende che vedono protagonisti il gruppo Pirelli, i suoi lavoratori e l'area su cui era insediato uno dei suoi principali stabilimenti industriali (Bicocca, nell'area nord-est di Milano). Percorrendo le tappe della trasformazione di Bicocca da ‘villaggio dei lavoratori’ (XIX secolo) a centro dove si sperimentano nuove forme di lotta operaia (anni ‘60-‘70) e, infine, a nuovo distretto culturale, residenziale e di servizi (anni ‘90-‘00), si vuole evidenziare come, per oltre un secolo, il conflitto sociale relativo allo spazio rappresenti il terreno su cui si gioca la costruzione di nuove forme di urbanità. In particolare il lavoro vuole mettere in risalto due punti fondamentali. In primo luogo che la lotta di classe che ruota intorno al ruolo economico, sociale e simbolico dello spazio industriale non è il risultato, ma una precondizione essenziale della ristrutturazione dello spazio urbano. In secondo luogo che la classe operaia e le tradizionali élite industriali non sono destinatari passivi bensì protagonisti attivi della trasformazione urbana.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Focusing empirically on Bicocca (a post-industrial area north-east of Milan that traditionally hosted the activities of Pirelli, one of Italyâ€™s most successful companies), the paper shifts the focus of enquiry on land financialization from global capital flows and real estate aggregate data to a qualitative analysis of the alliances and struggles between the elites and workers who animated the traditional manufacturing sector. Centring the analysis on these previously neglected actors permits an understanding of land financialization as a â€˜livedâ€™ and socially embodied process, and offers a complementary perspective to the discussion on the role of land rent in the making of financialized capitalism. First, it reveals the struggles and alliances between industrial elites, workersâ€™ unions, and local governance as key protagonists in the way land became mobilized as a financial asset, was subsequently embedded in practices of urban renewal, and finally contributed to an epochal change in urban capitalism. Second, it shows how mobilizing industrial land as a financial asset performed not just a coordinating but also a transformative role in the transition from industrial to financial capitalism as it enabled traditional elites to launch into a financialized phase of transnational competition. Third, it reveals changes in urban governance to be as much responses to the needs of local traditional elites as they are responses to the demands of global financial elites.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Despite the fact that many of these buildings are located in the City (London’s financial heart), little attention has been paid to the relationship between the transformation of London’s skyline and the recent institutional reconfiguration of the Corporation of London, the authority that runs the City. Focusing empirically on the City’s iconic architecture, and foregrounding a period of institutional crisis for the Corporation (1970–1990), the paper: first, departs from the standard analysis of iconic buildings as signifiers of economic success, and sketches a framework for examining the role of iconic architecture during moments of crisis and, second, offers a new approach to understanding the City’s iconic commissions: not as signifiers of London’s international economic power, but as symptoms of changes in the institutions and élites that promote the City’s new urbanity. The article details how the internationalisation of London’s economy after the 1970s challenged the Corporation’s insular character. The Corporation’s resistance to the ‘invasion’ of foreign companies, people and architectural styles in the City in the midst of a rapid expansion of London’s economy and growing inter-urban competition, led to open threats from the government for the abolition of the Corporation. Responding to these threats, the Corporation reinvented itself with an institutional reform and re-branded its identity in the early 2000s as an outward-looking institution, open to London’s new transnational élites. The 2002 Unitary Development Plan that introduced a new architectural language in the City corresponds to the same need to construct a new imaginary identity for a re-branded Corporation. Towering over the City’s traditional signifiers, the City’s new buildings constitute an ode to the Corporation’s new identity and a visual coup d’état against its time-old heritage-oriented planning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
