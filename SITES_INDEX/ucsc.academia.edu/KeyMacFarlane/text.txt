And yet much of the environmental work conducted in these cities has been directed at an industrial past, cleaning up the waste left over from long-departed manufacturing sectors. Drawing on David Harvey’s writings on urban process, this paper develops a theory of “waste switching” that situates EGS within a larger negotiation of space and time across city landscapes. This theory is fleshed out in case studies of the EGS industry in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, where new cycles of accumulation have been built on refuse, toxins, and dead labor. These “toxi-cities” challenge traditional conceptions of urbanization as spatially – but also temporally – bounded. Increasingly, “creative” urban development involves the recollection and revalorization of toxic pasts. But a radical urban politics emerges from the same waste, recollecting otherwise.*forthcoming*Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper seeks to map one point at which this binding occurs: in critical theory. Recently scholars in strategic management have turned to processual and relational ontologies in an attempt to reimagine the logics of profit, value, and growth. These same ontologies have appealed to critical geographers as a means of reconceiving space as unfixed. Drawing on a case study of Deleuze’s appropriation in management literature, I show how such ontologies presuppose a vitalism that necessarily reproduces and obscures the structures of exploitation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Today the concept has returned as one of importance in the protection ofrefugees worldwide. In this article, which focuses on sanctuary practices in Germany, we examine theimportance of the spaces of church-based asylum—the structure, physical spaces, and neighborhood of thechurch itself. We investigate the ways in which these spaces are constitutive of collective memories ofalternative justice and resistance and how these memories are used to transform the actions and possibilitiesof the present. The article builds off other nonlinear, counterhegemonic concepts of space and time, such asthe demonic, as ways of moving beyond normative assumptions of the cultural landscape. The demonicchallenges both the abstract space of modern liberalism as well as the absolute space of the sacred; it is aradical reworking—one that relies on forgotten or hidden pasts yet remains new and open-ended. Forsanctuary to contest the racialized violence of modern state governance it likewise must both remember andrework the idea of sacred space and sacred time in new, materialist, and fluid forms. Drawing on a case studyfrom Berlin, the article explores ways to conceptualize the temporal and spatial anchoring of alternative,nonliberal memories and their potential for contemporary resistance. The Heilig-Kreuz church and its pastorsand allies, as well as an associated church network, the German Ecumenical Committee on Church Asylum,provide the empirical case studies.

And yet, wealthy global cities like Hamburg continue to present themselves as the gatekeepers of liberal progress and cosmopolitan openness. This paper argues that Hamburg’s urban boosterism relies on, while simultaneously obscuring, the same structures of racial violence that embolden reactionary movements. Drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin and Allan Pred, we present an archeology of Hamburg’s landscape, uncovering some of its ‘spaces of danger’—sites layered with histories of violence, many of which lie buried and forgotten. We find that these spaces, when they become visible, threaten to undermine Hamburg’s cosmopolitan narrative. They must, as a result, be continually erased or downplayed in order to secure the city as an attractive site for capital investment. To illustrate this argument, we give three historical examples: Hamburg’s role in the Hanseatic League during the medieval and early modern period; the city under the Nazi regime; and the recent treatment of Black African refugees. The paper’s main contribution is to better situate issues of historical landscape, collective memory, and violent legacy within the political economy of today’s global city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Several studies have examined how e-waste is increasingly exported to processing sites in China, India, Pakistan, Ghana and elsewhere across the global south, where it leads to devastating health effects. Through an interdisciplinary patchwork of human geography, public health, narrative theory, and philosophies of memory, this paper seeks to show how the export of e-waste to the global south-and the toxins it brings along with it-is part of what makes "resilient" urban growth and citizenship possible elsewhere, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. The surplus value of technological production is only recuperable, in places like Silicon Valley, if its toxicity is spatially and temporally displaced onto-and hidden within-surplus bodies who are cast into necropolitical terrains of ill-health and danger. Tracing this story of e-waste, which spans from the epigenetic to the geopolitical, from the San Francisco Bay Area to China's Greater Bay Area, requires a method of empirical allegory that can detect global iniquities on the most granular of scales, and vice versa.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From its o... more The inevitability of flooding is a constant reminder of Hamburg’s waterlogged history. From its origins, both the city’s prosperity and its precarity have been closely tied to its marshland geography. Largely due to its strategic position along the Elbe, Hamburg has been a major hub of international commerce for centuries. This began in 1189, when the Holy Roman Emperor issued a charter granting freedom from customs duties for ships sailing between Hamburg and the North Sea. In the next century, the city’s trade alliance with Lübeck in 1230 (expanded in 1241) would lay much of the groundwork for the Hanseatic League, a confederation of northern European towns that dominated Baltic maritime trade from the 13th to the late-15th century. Although the League declined over time, and officially collapsed in 1862, it created the foundations for Hamburg’s continued economic success. With its Hanseatic pedigree, the city was – and still is – able to retain its local trade monopoly and its status as a global marketplace. Deep-seated merchant connections have helped solidify Hamburg as Germany’s wealthiest city by most accounts, with the second-busiest container port in Europe, with ships from all over the world traveling on the Elbe between Hamburg and the North Sea.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One area that is beginning to receive attention is how noise is formalized in law and policy. This paper contributes to that literature by developing a geographic theory of modern noise regulation. Two policies are examined: the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Noise Control Act of 1972 and Seattle’s Noise Ordinance of 1977. Combining Foucauldian and Marxian frameworks, I argue that these documents trace a biopolitics of “sensible citizenship” that emerges within, as a means of managing, a changing regime of capitalist accumulation, as global attention began to shift from production to the “noisy sphere” of exchange in the 1960s and 1970s. Noise, I claim here, has come to physically embody capitalism’s inner contradictions—between needing to promote commercial activities and needing to control the noisy externalities those activities create. Such an analysis addresses recent calls for a more historically and materially grounded approach to the study of sound in human geography, while also adding a critical legal perspective to recent debates on the relations between citizenship, the body, and governance.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Beyond the Educational Dystopia: New Ways of Learning Through Rememberingby Katharyne Mitchell and Key MacFarlaneBeyond Market Dystopia: New Ways of Living (Socialist Register),  2019In this essay we explore this dystopic world of neoliberal education, while at the same time givi... more In this essay we explore this dystopic world of neoliberal education, while at the same time giving examples of how teachers and students are taking back classrooms and pedagogic practices throughout the United States. The key to contesting dislocation, we suggest, is quite literal: bringing back time and place in radical ways that resonate with young people. Walter Benjamin explored possibilities of the revolutionary past in his concept of 'Jetztzeit'. Rather than relying on any vulgar Marxist teleological or evolutionist notion of history (made up of ‘homogenous, empty time’), he favored a more kaleidoscopic approach – one in which a ‘tiger’s leap into the past’ opened up possibilities for revolutionary thought and action in the present. For Benjamin, as for his friend Ernst Bloch, one place where these possibilities expressed themselves is in the figure of the child. Both writers were drawn to, and at times deeply enchanted by, the spaces and rhythms of childhood – its toys, fairytales, and colorful dreams. While often overlooked, Benjamin’s and Bloch’s writings on childhood provide a microcosm of their political projects more generally. As Bloch once argued, the moment of youth is always also a moment of radical political potential. To be young, for Bloch, is to have one foot out of the present. It is to be open to other pasts and other futures, an idea with rich pedagogic possibility. This essay is inspired by the radical pedagogical potential of Benjamin’s and Bloch’s work, highlighting in particular how new configurations of political possibility are formed through spatially situated practices and modes of learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sonic methods have largely emerged as part of the so-called “affective turn” in geography, as efforts to attend to the performative, emotional, and pre-reflective aspects of experience. Drawing on the work of Adorno, I develop a critique of existing sonic methods, arguing that their focus on affect and immediate experience is unable to grasp “negative geographies”: what and who fails to appear and remains silent to the researcher. These claims are grounded in two autoethnographic accounts of my own experimentation with sonic methods. The first is a GIS study of noise-monitoring data in King County, Washington. The second is a participatory mapping project that sought to record and collect “sound diaries” from migrants and refugees across the greater Seattle area. In both cases, I show how silences and failures in the research process make sonic methods useful tools for social critique.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ammar, who is only 12, was hoping to find their family at the protest along Gaza’s eastern border – part of the weeks-long “Great March of Return." At the protest, they managed to track down Layla’s grandmother, Heyam Omar, but they found something else as well. Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers were firing tear-gas canisters into the crowd. One landed nearby. After fleeing the scene, the family realized that Layla had stopped breathing. She later died of toxic gas inhalation. She was one of the 62 Palestinians killed by the IDF that day, one of ten children.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Climate MathematicsACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies,  2019This essay is a critical response to Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright's 2018 book Climate Leviathan... more This essay is a critical response to Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright's 2018 book Climate Leviathan. It focuses on the political alternative fleshed out towards the end of the book: "Climate X." For Mann and Wainwright, X is a variable to "solve for." I seek to take this seriously as a mathematical statement, exploring the extent to which a politics of Climate X can be considered algebraic, especially in light of Mann and Wainwright's references to "fragments" in the work of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. The book's algebraic approach, I argue, reduces the fragment (X), and politics along with it, to something numerable. From a different reading of Adorno and Benjamin, I show how two other fields of mathematics-set theory and fractal geometry-help address some of the pitfalls of Climate X, while pointing towards another climate politics that embraces deviation, infinity, and nothingness.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our focus is on Europe, where activist churches and related institutions share information, contacts, and strategies for aiding and sheltering migrants. We investigate several key transnational institutions, including the German Ecumenical Committee on Church Asylum (GECCA) and the Churches’ Commission for Migrants in Europe (CCME), as well as a number of critical actors and events. To better grasp the formation of cross-border relationships and their successes and limitations we turn to existing literature on policy transfer and transnational activist networks. Such scholarship, we argue, cannot fully account for the socially, politically, and physically embedded qualities of sanctuary networks, which have existed in various forms for centuries. Drawing on interviews and archival data, we show how faith actors continually “reactivate” historical landscapes of collective memory and alternative forms of justice associated with both the concepts and the spatial practices of sanctuary. The sanctuary network is therefore understood not only as a bundle of solidarities across space – but also across time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Neoliberal policies during this era worked to orchestrate personal development within the increasingly flexible processes of global capitalism, placing both within the rhythm of a personal life that must be fulfilled. Such an orchestration produced certain spaces—captured in notions such as the “learning society” and “creative city”—in which citizens were expected to take responsibility for their own human capital development as flexible entrepreneurs. For the majority of the population, however, this process led primarily to their own deskilling. Moreover, not only did lifelong learning strategies promote the standardization and homogenization of educational skills, and thus the abstraction and interchangeability of labor, but they were also bound up with the production of a so-called learning society that demanded increasing levels of external management. This chapter looks at some of the ramifications of these processes on workers and systems of education.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These metropolises, which function as key command centers in globalproduction networks, manifest many of the social, economic, and political tensions andinequities of neoliberal globalization. Their international appeal as sites of financialfreedom and free trade frequently obscures the global city underbelly: practices of laborexploitation, racial discrimination, and migrant deferral. This chapter explores some ofthese global tensions, showing how they have shaped the strategies and technologiesbehind urban crime prevention, security, and policing. In particular, the chapter showshow certain populations perceived as risky become treated as pre-criminals: individualsin need of management and control before any criminal behavior has occurred. It isdemonstrated further how the production of the pre-criminal can lead to dispossession,delay, and detention as well as to increasing gentrification and violence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The key to contesting dislocation, we suggest, is quite literal: bringing back time and place in radical ways that resonate with young people. Walter Benjamin explored possibilities of the revolutionary past in his concept of 'Jetztzeit'. Rather than relying on any vulgar Marxist teleological or evolutionist notion of history (made up of ‘homogenous, empty time’), he favored a more kaleidoscopic approach – one in which a ‘tiger’s leap into the past’ opened up possibilities for revolutionary thought and action in the present. For Benjamin, as for his friend Ernst Bloch, one place where these possibilities expressed themselves is in the figure of the child. Both writers were drawn to, and at times deeply enchanted by, the spaces and rhythms of childhood – its toys, fairytales, and colorful dreams. While often overlooked, Benjamin’s and Bloch’s writings on childhood provide a microcosm of their political projects more generally. As Bloch once argued, the moment of youth is always also a moment of radical political potential. To be young, for Bloch, is to have one foot out of the present. It is to be open to other pasts and other futures, an idea with rich pedagogic possibility. This essay is inspired by the radical pedagogical potential of Benjamin’s and Bloch’s work, highlighting in particular how new configurations of political possibility are formed through spatially situated practices and modes of learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sonic methods have largely emerged as part of the so-called “affective turn” in geography, as efforts to attend to the performative, emotional, and pre-reflective aspects of experience. Drawing on the work of Adorno, I develop a critique of existing sonic methods, arguing that their focus on affect and immediate experience is unable to grasp “negative geographies”: what and who fails to appear and remains silent to the researcher. These claims are grounded in two autoethnographic accounts of my own experimentation with sonic methods. The first is a GIS study of noise-monitoring data in King County, Washington. The second is a participatory mapping project that sought to record and collect “sound diaries” from migrants and refugees across the greater Seattle area. In both cases, I show how silences and failures in the research process make sonic methods useful tools for social critique.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ammar, who is only 12, was hoping to find their family at the protest along Gaza’s eastern border – part of the weeks-long “Great March of Return." At the protest, they managed to track down Layla’s grandmother, Heyam Omar, but they found something else as well. Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers were firing tear-gas canisters into the crowd. One landed nearby. After fleeing the scene, the family realized that Layla had stopped breathing. She later died of toxic gas inhalation. She was one of the 62 Palestinians killed by the IDF that day, one of ten children.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses on the political alternative fleshed out towards the end of the book: "Climate X." For Mann and Wainwright, X is a variable to "solve for." I seek to take this seriously as a mathematical statement, exploring the extent to which a politics of Climate X can be considered algebraic, especially in light of Mann and Wainwright's references to "fragments" in the work of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. The book's algebraic approach, I argue, reduces the fragment (X), and politics along with it, to something numerable. From a different reading of Adorno and Benjamin, I show how two other fields of mathematics-set theory and fractal geometry-help address some of the pitfalls of Climate X, while pointing towards another climate politics that embraces deviation, infinity, and nothingness.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

HAMBURG'S SPACES OF DANGER: Race, Violence and Memory in a Contemporary Global Cityby Katharyne Mitchell and Key MacFarlaneIJURR,  2019Germany today is experiencing the strongest upsurge of right-wing populism since the second world... more Germany today is experiencing the strongest upsurge of right-wing populism since the second world war, most notably with the rise of Pegida and Alternative für Deutschland. Yet wealthy global cities like Hamburg continue to present themselves as the gatekeepers of liberal progress and cosmopolitan openness. This article argues that Hamburg's urban boosterism relies on, while simultaneously obscuring, the same structures of racial violence that embolden reactionary movements. Drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin and Allan Pred, we present an archaeology of Hamburg's landscape, uncovering some of its 'spaces of danger'-sites layered with histories of violence, many of which lie buried and forgotten. We find that these spaces, when they become visible, threaten to undermine Hamburg's cosmopolitan narrative. They must, as a result, be continually erased or downplayed in order to secure the city as an attractive site for capital investment. To illustrate this argument, we give three historical examples: Hamburg's role in the Hanseatic League during the medieval and early modern period; the city under the Nazi regime; and the recent treatment of Black African refugees. The article's main contribution is to better situate issues of historical landscape, collective memory and racialized violence within the political economy of today's global city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our focus is on Europe, where activist churches and related institutions share information, contacts, and strategies for aiding and sheltering migrants. We investigate several key transnational institutions, including the German Ecumenical Committee on Church Asylum (GECCA) and the Churches’ Commission for Migrants in Europe (CCME), as well as a number of critical actors and events. To better grasp the formation of cross-border relationships and their successes and limitations we turn to existing literature on policy transfer and transnational activist networks. Such scholarship, we argue, cannot fully account for the socially, politically, and physically embedded qualities of sanctuary networks, which have existed in various forms for centuries. Drawing on interviews and archival data, we show how faith actors continually “reactivate” historical landscapes of collective memory and alternative forms of justice associated with both the concepts and the spatial practices of sanctuary. The sanctuary network is therefore understood not only as a bundle of solidarities across space – but also across time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Neoliberal policies during this era worked to orchestrate personal development within the increasingly flexible processes of global capitalism, placing both within the rhythm of a personal life that must be fulfilled. Such an orchestration produced certain spaces—captured in notions such as the “learning society” and “creative city”—in which citizens were expected to take responsibility for their own human capital development as flexible entrepreneurs. For the majority of the population, however, this process led primarily to their own deskilling. Moreover, not only did lifelong learning strategies promote the standardization and homogenization of educational skills, and thus the abstraction and interchangeability of labor, but they were also bound up with the production of a so-called learning society that demanded increasing levels of external management. This chapter looks at some of the ramifications of these processes on workers and systems of education.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These metropolises, which function as key command centers in globalproduction networks, manifest many of the social, economic, and political tensions andinequities of neoliberal globalization. Their international appeal as sites of financialfreedom and free trade frequently obscures the global city underbelly: practices of laborexploitation, racial discrimination, and migrant deferral. This chapter explores some ofthese global tensions, showing how they have shaped the strategies and technologiesbehind urban crime prevention, security, and policing. In particular, the chapter showshow certain populations perceived as risky become treated as pre-criminals: individualsin need of management and control before any criminal behavior has occurred. It isdemonstrated further how the production of the pre-criminal can lead to dispossession,delay, and detention as well as to increasing gentrification and violence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Though the United Nations put “equity” on equal footing with economy and ecology in laying out its “three pillars” of sustainability in 1987, incorporating social equity goals into sustainability planning has remained a challenge in urban practice. “Equity”—like sustainability itself—is an amorphous goal, and a large-scale problem not obviously solved through city-scaled planning efforts.This report analyzes the inclusion and operationalization of “equity” in 170 California cities’ and counties’ Climate Action Plans (CAPs). California’s municipal climate action planning landscape is unique for both its size and diversity, as aggressive statewide environmental legislation has put unique pressure on all cities—even (or especially) small and less well-resourced ones—to adopt climate/emissions plans. We conducted a content analysis of the plans, compared different cities’ approaches to equity, and how cities’ approaches relate to city characteristics such as size, social composition, and income inequality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For decades, geographers have stressed that space is not an abstract dimension or some container to be filled. Space is rather formed actively through social relations. Capitalist society is marked by a particular kind of social relation: class conflict. Class conflict forms the basic ingredient in capital accumulation, insofar as the latter relies on the ongoing exploitation of labor. But capital accumulation is riddled with contradiction. Highlighted here is capitalism's moving contradiction: between the need for human labor and the need to reduce the duration of that labor. Geographers have shown how this contradiction is “fixed” in and through space. From the local to the global, the movement of capital relies on patterns of uneven development, which generate violent divisions between regions and between bodies. In this way capital transforms space in its own image: as a terrain of conflict and competition. Radical geographers explore how space is transformed otherwise, in ways that abolish existing social relations.***uncorrected proof, there are some typos***Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The class will focus on broad debates and narratives about progress, development, race, creativity, and justice, tying these large themes to how the contemporary American city is produced, governed, and imagined. Students will draw on their own experiences to examine what geographer David Harvey calls “the urbanization of consciousness” – how everyday life is shaped by the city and its inequalities. A particular emphasis will be placed on issues of social justice and political resistance in the city. Rather than delving deeply into one specific field, the course will introduce—on a weekly basis—a number of different lenses through which urban life and inequality can be seen and analyzed; these include processes such as gentrification, segregation, environmental racism, policing, fortification, and enclaving. Whenever possible, Santa Cruz and the greater Bay Area will be used as a case study and laboratory where theories can be applied and challenged. In addition to learning about the city and the processes that shape it, this course is designed to improve and challenge students’ academic skills in critical thinking, writing, and political and geographical debate.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They seek to reclaim strategy for emancipatory ends – removing it from the boardrooms and bringing it down to the streets of everyday struggle. Such a project is clearly relevant for critical management studies (CMS) or for anyone who would like to see organizational strategy put to for more radical ends. But Hardt and Negri also overlook something that CMS scholars have been stressing for years: the relationship between strategy and history. The following critical review provides an summary of Hardt and Negri’s argument, before showing how their notion of strategy ultimately rests on a (false) utopianism that ignores the existing archive of radical organizational experiments.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Over the last decade a growing number of critical geographers have examined the links between waste management and uneven development, although not always with questions of urban geography explicitly in mind. What this body of scholarship has shown is that the disposal of certain objects is deeply entangled with the dispossession of certain bodies, along lines of class, race, gender, or otherwise.A major theoretical concern raised by this panel is the question of time. The designation of “waste” brings with it certain temporal assumptions. People and things characterized as “waste” are often considered obsolete, behind the times, remnants of the past. What does this mean for the study urban geography? How might the temporalities of waste expand our territorial notions of the city? And how are the temporalities of waste embodied in the unfolding of (slow) violence, in the racialization of certain lives, in rendering them “disposable”?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on an ethnography of Atomic Tourism in New Mexico, this paper explores how the commodity form mediates these various tensions. In turning our attention to kitsch objects, museum collections, nuclear testing sites, and other “dark tourist” attractions, we trace the ways the invisible past lives out a half-life in the consumerist present, how landscapes of sublimity and violence are contained, “miniaturized,” and sold. Our study draws in particular on the work of Walter Benjamin and Susan Stewart to examine the ways the “souvenir” and the “collection” mediate time and space, particularly in term of collective memory. The commodification of the nuclear in New Mexico, we argue, provides a particularly useful map for how structures of violence are systematically forgotten, buried within the everyday, coopted into contemporary visual and consumer culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper looks at... more Noise is one of the most common complaints of city dwellers across the world. This paper looks at a database of 350 noise complaints submitted to the City of Seattle from 1893 to the present. These complaints are examined under the Foucauldian concept of confession, as bodily discourses of the self that bind freedom (individual silence) with the necessity of authority (the listening state). Read as such, Seattle noise complaints are shown to reinforce social hierarchies of race, class, and gender by transposing them within the sphere of “culture.” This transposition occurs through noise and the politics of listening it implies. As a health risk to the urban population, noise provides an “objective” phenomenon through which social antagonisms may be made to appear natural. Actual relations of white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism are simultaneously silenced and policed as cultural issues, which are spatially and historically specific to Seattle. From “hot-rodders” in the 1950s, to obnoxious hippies in the 1960s, to “rappers” in the 1990s, “cultures” posing a noisy challenge to liberal ideals of tolerance, civility, and the “healthy city” are subjected to acts of silencing. The violence embedded in noise complaints shows how health, well-being, and quality of life (the “lovely city”) are always political categories, inseparable from struggles over urban space, from the suffering of certain bodies. "Unintelligible: Noise Against Capture"UC Santa CruzApril 20, 2018Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In many US cities, especially those in the Rust Belt, the EGS industry has played a significant role in the restructuring of local economies to promote new, flexible, and “creative” forms of service-based work. And yet environmental work in cities such as Baltimore and Pittsburgh has often been directed at an industrial past, cleaning up hazardous waste left over from long-departed manufacturing sectors. In examining the socioeconomic history of the EGS industry is these areas, this paper demonstrates how new cycles of “green” and “creative” accumulation are often built on the refuse, toxins, and dead labor of what is purportedly left behind. Both within the city and beyond, these polluted landscapes challenge traditional definitions of urbanization that refer solely to the growth of cities as linear and spatially bounded. Taking up Schoenberger and Walker’s (2017) recent call for geographers to examine the “historical–geographical roots” of urban markets, the study of EGS industry shows how contemporary urbanization reinserts industrial, but also military, pasts into the accumulation of capital, squeezing value out of the soils of environmental catastrophe. This analysis engages and expands on the concept of “socioecological fix,” showing how economic and environmental crisis is not only deferred into the future but actively mined, “recycled,” and “conserved” within the urban present. The toxic violences of extraction, military experiment, and social hierarchy—all of these return to urban space in a new green form.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The skills and theories developed from this practice, however, have played an increasingly significant role in shaping management strategies within the post-fordist firm. In particular, I look at the ways relational theories of space—so important for human geographers in the last several decades (Harvey 1973, Soja 1989, Massey 2005)—have been recently taken up in business strategy, as tools for mapping and maximizing value creation. Relational and process-based ontologies, models, and theories remain important in helping geographers, both in research and in pedagogy, to challenge dominant conceptions of space as absolute and fixed. That these strategies are co-opted by business does not deny their worth or radical potential, but raises questions about our roles as academics and educators who produce and disseminate theory. 13th Annual Meeting of the Cultural Studies AssociationMay 21-24 2015Riverside, CASave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Murray Schafer at Simon Fraser University, the World Soundscape Project is considered to have birthed acoustic ecology, a discipline recently taken up by geographers looking at the relations between fauna, space, and sound, as well as those interested in the bodily aspects of the aural. What’s missing from the literature, though, is an exploration of how the framing and technological monitoring of “soundscapes” have functioned biopolitically to maintain hierarchies of power. Drawing on a GIS study that intersects sound monitoring points with different demographic areas in King County, WA, along with a discourse analysis of federal and local noise control regulations, I explore the ways in which the construction of a “soundscape” works to re-present marginalized groups as literally inaudible, while naturalizing capitalist production, silencing its “noisy” contradictions.9th Annual Critical Geographies Mini-ConferenceSimon Fraser University22 November 2014Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the extreme end, Agamben famously claimed that all life today is subject to the sovereign exception—to sudden death—and that we are all virtually homines sacri. Left underdeveloped in Agamben’s work, however, is how the value-form of capitalism does or does not contribute to this intertwining of biopolitics and necropolitics. It seems to me that there are two ways Marxist conceptions of value have been, or can be, theorized alongside biopolitics and necropolitics. The first, and most common, is to theorize the governance of life and death through Marxist notions of surplus value and relative surplus population. The second is through the theory of commodity fetishism wherein, according to Guy Debord, the “commodity completes its colonization of social life.” Or where, amid the intertwining of biopolitical (re)production and capital accumulation, it becomes difficult to think of life outside of the concepts of political economy—including value.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
