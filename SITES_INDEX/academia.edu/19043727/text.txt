A Survey of User  MotivationsEhsan Mohammadi, Kayvan KoushaAlthough Mendeley bookmarking counts appear to correlate moderately with conventional citation metrics, it is not known whether academic publications are bookmarked in Mendeley in order to be read or not. Without this information, it is not possible to give a confident interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley. In response, a survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most (55%) users with a Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half of their bookmarked publications. This was true across all broad areas of scholarship except for the arts and humanities (42%). About 85% of the respondents also declared that they bookmarked articles in Mendeley to cite them in their publications, but some also bookmark articles for use in professional (50%), teaching (25%) and educational activities (13%). Of course, it is likely that most readers do not record articles in Mendeley and so this data does not represent all readers. In conclusion, Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be indicators of readership leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider professional impact.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of the  …Relying on electronic journals: Reading patterns of astronomers2005 • Keri-Lynn PaulsonDownload Free PDFView PDFScholarly Information Practices in the Online Environment: Implications for Shared Library2009 • Constance MalpasDownload Free PDFView PDFInformation Seeking and Searching Habits of Greek Physicists and Astronomers: A Case Study of Undergraduate StudentsHara BrindesiThe aim of this study was to investigate the information seeking and searching behavior of Greek physicists and especially astronomers. More specifically, it attempted to shed a light on students' information needs and their familiarity with different ways of satisfying them. The interest for this research emanated from a lack of relative studies among Greek astronomers, despite the fact that the investigation of astronomers' information behaviour has already been an area of research abroad. The target group of the study was the undergraduate students of the Department of Astrophysics, Astronomy and Mechanics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. They were invited to complete a questionnaire focused on investigating their personal information, such as semester and gender, frequency and capabilities of information searching, interest in keeping up-to-date, frequency and reasons for use and non-use of specific information sources, searching behavior and reading preference and methods used for getting access to full-text articles. Results revealed that undegraduate students show a preference for familiar, flexible, and easy-to-use information resources that provide quick access to information. In addition, they seldom or never attend seminars or conferences, rarely or never visit their faculty library and are not aware of the existence of some basic information sources. Regarding their searching abilities, they are ordinary searchers using only one or two terms, with no use of advanced searching techniques such as Boolean operators or truncation.

Studies have typically focused either on single disciplines or attempted to reach an overview by using broad disciplinary groupings. Attempts to reach a fuller understanding of distinct characteristics of scientific specialisms by extending Whitley's theory to information and communication practices, hence taking into account both epistemic and social aspects, which shape reading practices.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Academic LibrarianshipE-print depositing behavior of physicists and astronomers: An intradisciplinary study2009 • David NicholasDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
