The underlying mechanisms may include altered tissue distribution or increased catabolism via pyridoxal (PL) to pyridoxic acid (PA). Recently, we showed that catabolic enzyme activity could be assessed by substrate product ratios measured in plasma. We evaluated the ratios PA:PL, PA:PLP, and PA:(PL + PLP) as possible markers of vitamin B-6 catabolism. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were derived from the Western Norway B-Vitamin Intervention Trial. We analyzed associations of ratios with inflammatory markers and other clinical variables by using multiple linear regression and partial correlation. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the ability of plasma indexes to differentiate between subjects. PA:(PL + PLP) had the highest ICC of all vitamin B-6 metabolites and ratios tested. In regression models, the i...Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Clinical NutritionSubstrate product ratios of enzymes in the kynurenine pathway measured in plasma as indicators of functional vitamin B-6 status2013 • Per Magne  UelandDownload Free PDFView PDFVitamin B-6 catabolism and long-term mortality risk in patients with coronary artery disease 1,2Per Magne  UelandDownload Free PDFView PDFMarkers of vitamin B6 status and metabolism as predictors of incident cancer: The Hordaland Health StudyPer Magne  Ueland, Klaus MeyerDietary intake and/or circulating concentrations of vitamin B6 have been associated with risk of cancer, but results are inconsistent and mechanisms uncertain. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the most commonly used marker of B6 status. We recently proposed the ratio 3-hydroxykynurenine/xanthurenic acid (HK/XA) as an indicator of functional vitamin B6 status, and the 4-pyridoxic acid (PA) /(pyridoxal (PL) 1PLP) ratio (PAr) as a marker of vitamin B6 catabolism during inflammation. We compared plasma PLP, HK/XA and PAr as predictors of cancer incidence in a prospective community-based cohort in Norway. This study included 6,539 adults without known cancer at baseline (1998–99) from the Hordaland Health Study (HUSK). HR and 95% CI were calculated for the risk of overall and site-specific cancers using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for potential confounders. After a median follow-up time of 11.9 years, 963 cancer cases (501 men and 462 women) were identified. Multivariate-adjusted Cox-regression showed no significant relation of plasma PLP or HK/XA with risk of incident cancer. In contrast, PAr was significantly associated with risk of cancer with HR (95% CI) 5 1.31 (1.12–1.52) per two standard deviation (SD) increment (p < 0.01). Further analysis showed that PAr was a particular strong predictor of lung cancer with HR (95% CI) 5 2.46 (1.49–4.05) per two SD increment (p < 0.01). The present results indicate that associations of vitamin B6 with cancer may be related to increased catabolism of vitamin B6, in particular for lung cancer where inflammation may be largely involved in carcinogenesis.Download Free PDFView PDFBritish Journal of NutritionVitamins B2 and B6 as determinants of kynurenines and related markers of interferon-γ-mediated immune activation in the community-based Hordaland Health Study2014 • Grethe TellDownload Free PDFView PDFrios_2015_jn_145_87.pdfPer Magne  UelandBackground: The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) has been associated with low plasma pyridoxal 5#-phosphate (PLP).Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of nutritionTryptophan catabolism and vitamin B-6 status are affected by gender and lifestyle factors in healthy young adults2015 • Oivind Midttun, Eamon LairdAbnormalities of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism through the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway have been reported in various diseases; however, nutritional and lifestyle factors that affect this pathway in healthy individuals are not well documented. Our aim was to examine the effect of vitamin B-6 status and lifestyle factors including the use of vitamin B-6 supplements, alcohol, smoking, and oral contraceptives on Trp and its Kyn metabolites in a cohort of 2436 healthy young adults aged 18-28 y. Anthropometric and lifestyle data were collected by questionnaire. Participants provided blood samples for analysis of Trp, Kyn, anthranilic acid, kynurenic acid (KA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA), and xanthurenic acid (XA). Vitamin B-6 species were also measured. Serum Trp metabolites were 10-15% higher among men (n = 993) compared with women (n = 1443; P &lt; 0.0001), except for HK and XA. In all participants, serum Trp was positively associated with plasma pyridoxal 5&#3...Download Free PDFView PDFTryptophan Catabolism and Vitamin B-6 Status Are Affected by Gender and Lifestyle Factors in Healthy Young Adults 1–3Per Magne  UelandDownload Free PDFView PDFAnnual Review of NutritionDirect and Functional Biomarkers of Vitamin B6 Status2014 • Oivind Midttun, Arve UlvikDownload Free PDFView PDFRapid Communications in Mass SpectrometryQuantitative profiling of biomarkers related to B-vitamin status, tryptophan metabolism and inflammation in human plasma by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry2009 • Oivind MidttunDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
