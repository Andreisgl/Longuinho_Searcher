Narratives from a larger study using grounded theory were analyzed using constant comparative analysis and induction. A secondary analysis of the narratives of 21 participants was undertaken. Transcripts were read line-by-line and all relevant language was highlighted and reviewed with the aim of identifying relationships and themes. The narratives revealed a diverse range of metaphoric language. Four categories were identified: being shackled, hope, external authority, and communication fears. Three additional themes were interwoven into the narratives: aging and death, medication personified, and the body as object. The authors conclude that metaphor reveals the tension and unresolved dilemmas faced by seniors with regard to medication use.Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter Stephenson and +2Britt VegsundRosanne Beuthin•  12  Nursing, Aging, Metaphor, NarrationResponsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science CommunicationSave to LibraryDownloadby Brendon  Larson•  20  Environmental Science, Journalism, Science Communication, Environmental Law從意象基模來解析《小王子》篇章的上層結構(An Analysis of the Image Schemas and Superstructure in The Little Prince)Save to LibraryDownloadby Jung-hsing Chang•  3  Metaphor, Cognitive Linguistics, Image SchemasСТРУКТУРА МЕТАФОРЫ В ТРАКТАТЕ ЭМАНУЭЛЕ ТЕЗАУРО «ПОДЗОРНАЯ ТРУБА АРИСТОТЕЛЯ» И СЮИТЕ “BIZZARIE DI VARIE FIGURE” ДЖОВАННИ БАТТИТСТА БРАЧЕЛЛИ / STRUCTURE OF THE METAPHOR IN THE EMANUELE TESAURO’S TREATISE “ARISTOTELIAN TELESCOPE” AND GIOVANNI BATTISTA BRACELLI’S PRINT SUITE “BIZZARIE DI VARIE FIGURE”В статье рассматривается сходство между теорией построения метафор, описанной в трактате Э.

Тезауро «Подзорная труба Аристотеля» и визуально реализованной в сюите офортов Дж. Б. Брачелли “Bizzarie di varie figure”. Согласно рассуждениям Тезауро метафора не является только средством для выявления скрытых природных связей между объектами, которые автор литературного или живописного произведения должен лишь найти и показать зрителю в гармоничной форме. В трактате остроумная метафора предстает как главная художественная ценность произведения, а остроумие как самодостаточная категория, особая интеллектуальная и творческая способность. Именно такое понимание метафоры, ее роли и сути делает возможным создание фантастических и гротескных образов “Bizzarie di varie figure”, основанных на сопоставлении различных объектов. The article deals with the similarity of the theory of the metaphor construction described in the treatise of E.Tesauro’s “Aristotelian telescope” and visually realized in the G. B. Bracelli’s print set “Bizzarie di varie figure”. Tesauro’s tractate presents a metaphor as the main artistic value of the work of art and a wit as self-contained category, specific creative ability, rather than as an instrument to reveal some latent preset similarity of the objects, which should be found by the author of a literary or pictorial object of art and shown to the viewer in a harmonious form. It is this conception of the role and the essence of the metaphor which make possible creation of fantastic and grotesque characters of “Bizzarie di varie figure”, based on comparison of different.

According to them, the Chinese concept of “allegory/metaphor” has little to do with creation or invention, and is known for its lack of disjunction, which is founded on the monistic worldview that assumes a pre-established unity between the subject and object. Such a representation for Chinese poetics, as this essay argues, constitutes at best a part, or rather, a line of thought in Chinese poetry, which interestingly recalls the symbolist aesthetics challenged by Paul de Man since the late 60s. Tracing the changing observations in major comparative works on Chinese poetics since Qian Zhongshu, the essay considers problems in comparative poetics, the relationship between philosophy-religion-worldview and literature, and understanding of the Self and the Other.Save to LibraryDownloadby Amanda Wang•  11  Rhetoric, Deconstruction, Symbolism, MetaphorThe Healing Forest Metaphor Revisited: The Seen and “Unseen World” of Drug UseThere is one world we live in.

We see it on maps, we see it on television, and we see it when we walk out of the door. Children, adults, and people of all races and creeds live in this one world. The world we live in is viewed differently by these many individuals. Some see it as hostile, some see it as peaceful, and some go about their daily business and do not see it at all. This is the seen world. The one we can see with our eyes. The seen world is not the only one that exists, however, because there is also another world behind our eyes. When we close our eyes, it is in there. We have an imagination to tell us what it could be like, we have thoughts to tell us what we want it to be like, and we have dreams to tell us what we want it to be. Where is this unseen world? We carry it around with us every nanosecond of every day that we are alive. While we live in the seen world, the unseen world is alive in us. What could the unseen world be like for substance users?

Using videotapes of 10 fifteen-hour short-term therapies by very experienced therapists treating an unselected group of patients, facial affect and metaphoric language of the therapist and the patient as well as the temporal distance between the two was recorded. The density of metaphors was not significantly correlated with symptom reduction but with treatment satisfaction. However, symptom reduction correlated significantly with the frequency of interactive metaphors used by both the therapist and the patient. It could be shown that there is an optimal time window between facial affect and metaphor production beyond the here and now, but not as a long term memory.Save to Libraryby Rainer Krause and +1Myria Fabregat•  16  Psychology, Brief Psychotherapy, Anxiety Disorders, Eating DisordersUsing metaphor in healthcare: Physical health (from the Routledge Handbook of Metaphor and Language, 2017)Save to LibraryDownloadby Zsófia  Demjén and +1Elena  Semino•  7  Discourse Analysis, Health Communication, Cancer, Applied LinguisticsMysteries of the cloaked body: analogy and metaphor in concepts of weaving and body tissuesSave to LibraryDownloadby Penny Dransart•  11  Archaeology, Anthropology, Ethnography, TextilesHeilmann, Jan: Wein und Blut.

Sie hinterfragt dabei die bisherigen Forschungspositionen. Neuere Ergebnisse der ritual- und sozialgeschichtlichen Forschung zur frühchristlichen Mahlpraxis verändern die Perspektive auf traditionell als "Abendmahlstexte" wahrgenommene Perikopen. Zugleich sind damit aber auch zentrale Fragen der Theologie des Johannesevangeliums mit im Blick. Auch hier bietet die Studie neue Impulse. Der Text des Johannesevangeliums war in seiner Rezeption ritualprägend und eben nicht umgekehrt durch ein angenommenes Eucharistieritual vorgeprägt. Die Metaphorik des Essens und Trinkens für die Annahme von Lehre, die bisher von der "eucharistischen" Diskussion verdeckt war, erlaubt einen neuen Blick auf die ritualgeschichtliche Entwicklung und Theologie des Abendmahls.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jan Heilmann•  6  Conceptual Metaphor, Metaphor, Eucharist, Gospel of JohnMetaphors we die by?

This article examines promotional discourse related to geoengineering from the 1980s to 2010. It asks in particular how this option for dealing with the problems posed by climate change were framed through the use of conceptual and discourse metaphors and whether one can argue that these are metaphors we ‘live by’ or metaphors we might ‘die by’. Findings show that an overarching argument from catastrophe was bolstered by three conceptual master-metaphors, namely The Planet is a body, The Planet is a machine and The planet is a patient/addict, linked to a variety of discourse metaphors, older conceptual metaphors and clichés. This metaphorical landscape began to shift while the article was being written and will have to be closely monitored in the future.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rusi Jaspal•  7  Discourse Analysis, Science Communication, Climate Change, MetaphorThe Philosophy of LanguagePublished in September, 2020, as part of OUP's Fundamentals of Philosophy Series. (https://global.oup.com/ushe/series/fps/?cc=us&lang=en)Save to LibraryDownloadby Mitch Green•  20  Metaphor, Bertrand Russell, Proper Names, Gottlob FregeArchäologische Forschungen in Kasachstan, Tadschikistan, Turkmenistan und Usbekistan.

The study explains the strong configurational character of ancient Egyptian (mythological) thought which has the ability to connect various ontological levels of human experience with the surrounding world into complex synchronic structures. These symbolical systems are shown to be mediating between the various cultural paradoxes which were inherent to ancient Egyptian society. Axial role in this process is attributed to the institution of positional kingship represented by the Pharaoh. Its transformative function is also put into relation to the special status of female characters who are shown to play the part of the “powerful powerless ones” further personifying the aspects of the mediating function of myth. Gradually, the study outlines a genuinely Egyptian “structural net” of basic mythemes and explains in what way it was possible for such a system to change and incorporate foreign mythological motifs especially from the Near East.Save to LibraryDownloadby Martin  Pehal•  67  Religion, Ancient Egyptian Religion, Egyptology, Mythology"La nota del Stato di Firenze".

If, on the onehand, Savonarola's preaching does not have any properly predictive character, in terms of intentional "divination", standing rather as a projection or representation of the contingency of the current days, in purely political terms, Leonardo's riddles, which he literally called "prophecies", on the other hand - and similarly - transform the genre of presages or predictions into entertainment tools for courtly audiences, that, however, in some cases, become a vehicle for a critical evaluation of the troubles of contemporary society. The likelihood that, on the occasion of his convocation in Florence in 1495, Leonardo was able to listen to Savonarola's sermons, so steeped in apocalyptic prophecy, may provide anexplanation to the appearance of writings called "prophecies", among his notes, just in the last five years of the century. Their underlying vision of man, clearly pessimistic, offers significant points of contact with the negative anthropology advocated by Savonarola's preaching, which also makes use of animal apology, especially in the conceptual and ideological interpretation of the "anti-human" conflictuality among men, that makes them "beasts" towards themselves, in a sort of anticipation of Hobbes' famous motto homo hominilupus.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marco Versiero•  20  Political Philosophy, Italian Studies, Renaissance Studies, Renaissance HumanismTrust dynamics in multimodal corporate discourse: The role of metaphor - ICLC13 conference - Northumbria University, July 20-25, 2015This paper investigates how large multinational corporations use multimodal meaning-making resources to communicate a trustworthy corporate identity.

It combines insights from Forceville’s work on pictorial and multimodal metaphor (Forceville 1996, 2002; Forceville and Urios-Aparisi, 2009) and key features of Fuoli and Paradis’ (2014) model of trust-repair discourse to examine the discursive dynamics of trust- building in a corpus of promotional corporate videos produced by some of the world’s largest corporations. The analysis shows that multimodal metaphors are deployed as key persuasive devices to promote three fundamental attributes of the companies’ trustworthiness, i.e. ability, integrity and benevolence. This paper sheds some light on how trustworthiness is constructed through multimodal resources in corporate discourse and contributes to our understanding of the discursive dynamics of trust, which is still limited and fragmentary (Fuoli and Paradis, 2014; Linell and Keselman, 2011). But the study also carries implications for cognitive linguistic theory, in particular for conceptual metaphor theory. Three theoretical issues requiring further discussion are highlighted: (i) the distinction between conventional and novel metaphor and the question of ‘deliberateness’ (Steen, 2008), (ii) the usefulness of the notion of metaphor scenario (Musolff, 2006) as a descriptive tool in the realm of multimodal discourse, and (iii) the adequacy of Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) model versus Blending Theory (Fauconnier and Turner, 1996, 1998; Grady et al. 1999) for describing novel multimodal metaphors and accounting for the evaluative function they can perform in persuasive multimodal discourse. Keywords: pictorial and multimodal metaphor, conceptual metaphor theory, blending, trust, corporate multimodal discourseSave to LibraryDownloadby Matteo  Fuoli•  11  Semantics, Cognitive Semantics, Trust, Conceptual Metaphor"Metaphors of Health, Illness and Disease in Margaret Atwood’s Fiction."

Effective methods of communicating sustainability will be necessary. Although there is a notable range of successful methods, opportunities to expand that range always remain and are worthy of exploration. This study pursues capacity building by testing a communication method variation that uses questions, audience participation, and metaphors intended to make the subject matter more easily understood and more permanently retained. An initial trial of the method was attempted with several groups of senior secondary students who were introduced to the ideas of sustainability during group and individual sessions. The students were surveyed before, during and after the sessions to measure their understanding and acceptance of sustainability concepts and principles.

The data were collected through a form containing the question 'Pop music is like... because...'. The data were analysed through content analysis. Based on the 324 different metaphors created by high school students, these metaphors are classified into 13 categories based on their shared characteristics. Students' gender and their conditions whether they play an instrument or not were considered when categorising them. According to the findings of the study, high school students described pop music as the most energising/friendly genre. The study also demonstrates that metaphors can be an effective tool for eliciting students' perceptions of pop music.Save to LibraryDownloadby Demet AYDINLI GÜRLER•  3  Popular Music, Metaphor, High School StudentsProcessing of Ironic Language in Children with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum DisorderSave to LibraryDownloadby Melanie  Glenwright•  20  Discourse Analysis, Education, Autism, MetaphorCarte BlancheOne of a series of digital montages, many of which consist of faux (virtual) book page spreads.

This paper discusses some of the differences between these theories and investigates their main empirical prediction: that metaphor interpretation involves enhancing properties of the metaphor vehicle that are relevant for interpretation, while suppressing those that are irrelevant. This hypothesis was tested in a cross-modal lexical priming study adapted from early studies on lexical ambiguity. The different patterns of suppression of irrelevant meanings observed in disambiguation studies and in the experiment on metaphor reported here are discussed in terms of differences between meaning selection and meaning construction.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paula Rubio-Fernández•MetaphorD.

The current study employed the descriptive phenomenological design, one of the qualitative research methods. A total of 210 individuals living in Turkey (114 females (68.6%) and 66 males (31.4%)) participated in the current study through an online questionnaire on a voluntary basis. As the data collection tool, the online questionnaire form developed by the researchers was used. The collected data were analyzed within the framework of five-stage metaphor analysis. As a result of the analysis, a total of seven metaphor categories called being restricted, restlessness, uncertainty/obscurity, deadly/ dangerous, struggling, faith/destiny, and supernatural were obtained. These categories were subsumed under three themes called "anxiety/concern, risk, and faith".Save to LibraryDownloadby Ayşe Gök Uslu•  2  Metaphor, Coronavirus COVID-19Eliciting Metaphor through Clean Language: An Innovation in Qualitative ResearchSave to LibraryDownloadby James  Lawley•  7  Marketing, Psychology, Metaphor, Qualitative Research MethodsBahuvrihi and Coordinative Exocentric Compounds in Alashtari Dialect of LakiWhile compounding is one of the major processes of word formation in world languages, it remains one of the most controversial linguistic descriptions.

There are various kinds of classifications for compound words, and one of the most common ones is the exocentric compounds. In Laki, one of the languages belonging to the northwest branches in the Iranian language, compounding is the most important word formation process. The majority of its compounds are exocentric. The present article aims to find and analyze two types of exocentric compounds in the Alashtari dialect based on Bauer (2017). The results based on data from Laki show that Bahuvrihi exocentric compounds in Laki include five different structures: (1) Adj + N; (2) N + Adj; (3) N + N; (4) quantifier + N; (5) N + P + N. Coordinative exocentric compounds include two types: class-maintaining and classchanging categories of which the former appears as (N + N) and the later as (V + V) or (NP + NP). The semantic analysis of the data reveals the effect of embodiment, metaphorical, cultural belief, and lifestyle of Laki speakers on the construction of exocentric compounds in their language.Save to LibraryDownloadby Research in Western Iranian Languages and Dialects and +1Faranak Naderi•  5  Metaphor, Compounding, Exocentric, Laki DialectMetaphors in “The Elements of Language” by E.SapirThe research is aimed at identifying metaphors and building metaphorical models underlying the scientific article on linguistics "The Elements of Language" by E.Sapir on the grounds of cognitive linguistics.

It also provides classification and analysis of the metaphors used in the scientific text under question and correlation of the researcher's metaphorical models with the core ones in Linguistics. The methodology is based on the cognitive principle that each scientific text has a sense productive structure, derivative from a scientific cognitive and communicative situation, with particular stages of sense development represented in all subtexts of the scientific text. Cognitive and linguistic analyses are procedures used to identify the subtexts, metaphors (Steen 2002), to analyse and classify the latter and to build metaphorical models. The analysis revealed that E.Sapir uses mostly three kinds of metaphors: dead, conventional scientific and original (his own). Dead metaphors dominate in all the subtexts of the article.

As outlined below: “They work by different principles, are learned and used in different ways, and may even reside in different parts of the brain. Their border disputes shape and reshape languages over centuries, and make language not only a tool for communication but also a medium for wordplay or poetry and an heirloom of endless fascination.” (Pinker, 2015) The importance and significance of metaphor’s in the evolutionary emergence of language arguably plays a key role in the ‘shaping and reshaping of languages over centuries’, and some would even argue in the origins of linguistical thought itself. A metaphor is ‘a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable’, or in other words a metaphor is ‘a thing regarded as representative or symbolic of something else’ (Oxford Dictionaries | English, 2017). This essay will be drawing from the theories of Tomasello (2003), Deutscher (2005) and Smith and Hoefler (2014) in the recreation and summary of a recent theoretical journey towards understanding the importance of metaphor within the deep structural formations of language and language theory. I will approach these theorists in chronological order of which their theories came. This will allow me to end on Smith and Hoefler’s more recent approach to the importance of metaphor in language evolution, where they give a more detailed outline of the apparent cognitive mechanisms at hand.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maisie D Dawes•  3  Metaphor, Evolutionary Linguistics, Theories of Language and LinguisticsWhat Is the Literary Image in 2019?

Mitchell discussesin his encyclopedia entry and his articles on the concept. The image is usuallyconsidered an overly psychological concept that lacks the rigor of rhetorical devices suchas metaphor. This article clarifies the relationship between the image and metaphor byarguing that, while an image may not be immediately considered a metaphor, a metaphormay be thought of as a composite and relational proposition-image. It underscoresthe futility of insisting on the concrete sensual (or visual) aspect of the image, arguingthat, before any sensual attribution, the image must primarily be thought of as a referenceor picture, which may at times be obscure, indefinite, or even empty. It also raisessome objections to the conceptualization of the mental picture as private by arguing thatthe word on which the mental image is based cannot be less private or “mental.”Keywords: image, W.

Drawing on my earlier work which emphasizes the "agency" of tropes (by reference to Peter Galison and Bruno Latour) I attempt to recuperate tropes from within a Deleuzean frame, through an analysis of of "terminological junctions" as "shocks of thought."Save to LibraryDownloadby Martin E.

Las características formales y semánticas de estas construcciones lingüísticas generan una serie de dificultades y problemas en lo que respecta al procedimiento de su adquisición y aprendizaje. Para facilitar su presentación y descripción al profesor y su reconocimiento, aprendizaje y uso al alumno, se propone que el tratamiento de las UFs se haga de forma transversal y progresiva en clase de ELE.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carolina Julià Luna•  5  Cognitive Semantics, Metaphor, Phraseology, Spanish as a Second LanguageNextLast »Related TopicsConceptual Metaphor TheoryFollowFollowingConceptual MetaphorFollowFollowingCognitive LinguisticsFollowFollowingCorpus LinguisticsFollowFollowingMythFollowFollowingEmbodied CognitionFollowFollowingSemanticsFollowFollowingAncient Near EasternFollowFollowingDiscourse AnalysisFollowFollowingPragmaticsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
