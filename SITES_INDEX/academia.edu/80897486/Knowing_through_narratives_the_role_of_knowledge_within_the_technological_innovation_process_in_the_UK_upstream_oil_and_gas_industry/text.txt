The scope of the research encompassed three groups of actors within the innovation process: technology providers, enablers and end users. The research employed a qualitative approach using narrative and semi-structured interviews as a method for data collection, and employed an analytical template to analyse the data which was developed by integrating elements of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) with narrative schema. A hypertextual system was also developed to determine how the explicit knowledge of the actors within the innovation process could be codified and transferred. The findings identify six knowledge-based processes present within the technological innovation process: knowledge acquisition and learning; knowledge transfer; knowledge storage and maintenance; knowledge creation; ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBuilding bridges between the past, present and future: Narrative and emotional remembering of organizational change efforts2005 • Yrjö EngeströmAbstract: In our paper, we explore the multidimensional, comprehensive and complex characteristics of change. For this purpose, we trace change in a current study focusing on the consequentiality of change efforts in health care projects in Finland. In our study, we perceive change from the perspective of knowledge creation and destruction as deeply embedded in social practices. We use narratives gathered in employees' interviews as bridges to reconstruct the consequences of organizational change efforts.Download Free PDFView PDFAn Integrated Knowledge Management Model for Community Enterprises: A Case Study of a Rural Community Enterprise in ThailandLanthom JonThis research seeks to explore the characteristics, organisational culture and current knowledge management (KM) practice in a community enterprise (CE). Prae Pun - a hand weaving CE in the northeast rural area of Thailand - has typical CE characteristics - self-employed and collaborative management, and a home-based production system utilising local resources and knowledge. This research used a qualitative method. Data were collected through narrative inquiry, participant observation and document analysis. The 18 respondents were Prae Pun members, committee members, an advisory committee member and office staff members. The data were analysed through theme analysis. The findings of this research reveal that, although community members would not be aware of doing so, Prae Pun managed its knowledge through informal educational activities - learning by doing and observation - and work processes concerned with collaboration and informality. The current KM practice of Prae Pun entails ...Download Free PDFView PDFKnowledge mobilisation in healthcare organisations: Synthesising evidence and theory using perspectives of organisational form, resource based view of the firm and critical theory2013 • Susan TrenholmDownload Free PDFView PDFE-work and E- …Learning on Process Knowledge: A Technological and Methodological Proposition2001 • Panagiotis ZahariasDownload Free PDFView PDFThe satellite applications catapult: Design’s contribution to science and technology innovation services2018 • Alison PrendivilleThis positioning paper presents a six-month scoping study on the role of design in one of the UK Governments’ science and technology innovation centres, the Satellite Applications Catapult. Established in 2013 by Innovate UK, the remit of the Satellite Applications is to support economic growth through the exploitation of space with the application of satellite technologies. As one of the earliest adopters of design, the Satellite Applications, with the Transport Systems Catapult, was selected by the UK government’s innovation network, the Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), to be the sites for this research. For the purpose of this paper the Satellite Applications Catapult is presented as a case study as a first step to explain how different design practices shape the organisation’s innovation capability with the paper conceptualising how these activities work at different levels of the organisation. To reflect on design more generally across the Catapults this paper also frames thes...Download Free PDFView PDFVirtual working: Social and  …11 Organisational learning and the virtual organisation1999 • Ian McLoughlinDownload Free PDFView PDFEnterprise systems enabled organisational change : a qualitative critical realist approach on organisational routines dynamics2017 • Sohrab MoshiriDownload Free PDFView PDFIntellectual Capital and Value Creation: Evidence from the Por tuguese Banking IndustryMaria CabritaDownload Free PDFView PDFThe role of knowledge management in supporting innovation and learning in construction2006 • Tayyab MaqsoodDownload Free PDFView PDFLearning Network as a mechanism for bridging the knowledge gap between European Cultural Institutions and Digital Technologies professionals2008 • Despina  KanellouPaper presented in the IV Globelics Conference at Mexico City, September 22-24 2008 1 Globelics Learning Network as a mechanism for bridging the knowledge gap between European Cultural Institutions and Digital Technologies professionals Despina Kanellou 1 Andrew ...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
