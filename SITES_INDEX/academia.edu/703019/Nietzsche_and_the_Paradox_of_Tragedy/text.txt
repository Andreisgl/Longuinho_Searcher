Nietzsche's Tragic Affirmation of Life in a Remote Corner of the UniverseRobrecht VandemeulebroeckeIn this extended essay, I trace the nature and origin of Nietzsche's eventual disagreement with Schopenhauer, arguing that its seed was Nietzsche's early discovery of a performative contradiction between his spiritual mentor's actions as a writer and the pessimistic insights described in his work. I propose that Nietzsche sought to reconcile these contrasting aspects of his "educator's" example by carving a legitimate place for affirmation within Schopenhauer's pessimistic worldview. I then explore the mechanism that makes the artform of Attic tragedy a powerful technique to attain this, arguing that the apollonian element plays a much more prominent role in this than is often acknowledged, with examples from Nietzsche's appreciation of music and art, as well as from his own life and work.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Tragic Nature of Also sprach ZarathustraMatthew MeyerThis is a version of a paper I published some ten years ago (2002) in Nietzscheforschung (prior to entering a PhD program). The research on the secondary literature could have been more extensive and I do have concerns about some of the specifics of the argument. Nevertheless, I am still committed to the central thesis of the paper: Thus Spoke Zarathustra should be read as a tragedy that accomplishes in deed what The Birth of Tragedy described in theory. The companion piece to this paper is my recently published article in The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, "The Comic Nature of Ecce Homo."Download Free PDFView PDFNietzsche on Aesthetics, Educators and EducationSteven StolzDownload Free PDFView PDFCambridge University Press'The Birth of Tragedy: Transfiguration through Art', in 'The New Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche' (ed. Tom Stern, Cambridge University Press, 2019)2019 • Paul DanielsFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) remains one of the most challenging, influential and controversial figures in the history of philosophy. The New Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche provides a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to his most difficult ideas, including the will to power and the affirmation of life, as well as his treatment of truth, science, art and history. An accessible introduction sets out the nineteenth-century background of Nietzsche's life and work. Individual chapters are devoted to significant texts such as The Birth of Tragedy, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morality. Other chapters explore major influences such as Wagner and Schopenhauer, as well as examining Nietzsche's reception and investigating his enduring and often divisive legacy. The volume will be valuable for readers seeking to enhance their understanding of Nietzsche's philosophy and of his role in the development of Western thought.Download Free PDFView PDFJustifying the world as an aesthetic phenomenon [AUTHOR'S FINAL MS: published in Cambridge Classical Journal 64 (2018) 91-112]Stephen  HalliwellThis article scrutinises one of the most challenging theses of Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, that only as an aesthetic phenomenon can existence and the world be (or appear to be) 'justified'. Through a close examination of the work's frequently masked revaluation of a series of Greek sources of thinking, not least its 'inversion' of both the metaphysics and the aesthetics of Plato's Republic, the article shows how the thesis of aesthetic 'justification' is caught up in a tension between Apolline and Dionysian interpretations, the first entailing a quasi-Homeric sense that the Olympians justify human existence by living a transfigured form of it themselves, the second involving a tragic insight into reality as itself the creative work of a 'world-artist', the latter allusively associated by Nietzsche with the philosophy of Heraclitus.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Who and Philosophy"Behind Zarathustra's Eyes: The Bad, Sad Man Meets Nietzsche's Prophet" from The Who and Philosophy2016 • M.

Rethinking the Nietzschean Concept of ‘Untimely’ , Mimesis International, Milano 2018, ISBN 9788869771514, pp. 105-122.Luca LupoThe figure of the demon plays a significant role in the work of Nietzsche.2 Nietzsche entrusts to this figure the first, most important and explicit communication of the Eternal Return in the aphorism 341 of The Gay Science.3 What could be the sense of the eternal return revelation entrusted to a demon? When you consider the usual Nietzschean accuracy in the construction of texts and of their texture, it is to rule out the possibility of a simply ornamental use of a literary topos, especially when you consider how crucial this text is. Although this aspect has already been effectively highlighted,4 it is worth returning on our first question about the nature of the demon, starting from its origin and its function in Nietzsche and in the traditions which Nietzsche draws on and to which he refers. These include in particular the Greek tradition.5 I will try to show how the figure of this demon in the aphorism 341 of The Gay Science refers, above all, to this tradition, particularly to the pre-platonic one. The reference to the Greeks constitutes the background and the main theme of the context in which the eternal return revelation appears in The Gay Science, as it is proved by the succession of the last three aphorisms of the fourth book, where the aphorism 341 occupies a central and strategic position in the textual architecture. A survey of occurrences makes it plausible that the «epiphany» of the demon in the aphorism 341 can be in continuity with and related to other epiphanies that date back to the period of The Birth of Tragedy. These can therefore be read as anticipations of the text contained in The Gay Science. In this sense, a further aim of my contribution is to show how the main ideas of the aphorism 341 are rooted in the period of The Birth of Tragedy. Considering these anticipations, the aphorism 341 would be an expression of the tragic thought and of the Dionysian vision and the figure of the demon appearing in this text could be considered a decisive epiphany of the Dionysian and, more generally, of the Tragic. The essential reason for the presence of the demon in the aphorism 341 would be closely linked to the more archaic semantics of the word «demon» and the experience described in the text would have something to do with the experience of the Tragic as a radical experience of temporality and hence of what can be considered the proprium of existence itself.Download Free PDFView PDFNietzsche’s Zarathustra. The Misreading of a Hero (Nietzsche-Studien, Band 25, 2006))David AikenThere is no evidence that the character of Zarathustra is modeled upon the life and reforming religious activities of the historical Zoroaster/Zarathustra. Religious history casts no interpretative light on the identity of Nietzsche’s Zarathustra; likewise, it is apparent that Zarathustra and the Zoroaster of history are incompatible in their metaphysical visions of the world. It would therefore seem that the reader of Also sprach Zarathustra is at liberty to understand that Zarathustra is a new, anhistorical, and entirely literary dramatis personae, which brings up a new question altogether.
