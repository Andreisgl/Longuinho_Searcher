This paper argues that the sensory affordances of the first-millennium b.c. temples of Nabu, the god of wisdom and writing, manifested the exclusive, specialised knowledge that was associated with this god in a manner that differentiated these built environments within the active, sensory landscape of the Neo-Assyrian royal citadel. This potential of the Nabu temples is best shown in the most well-preserved examples at the capital cities of Kalḫu (modern Nimrud) and Dur-Šarrukin (modern Khorsabad). These two temples of Nabu have the same combination of architectural features that produced this sensory experience, despite being in different cities and despite having different spatial layouts. These features include: (1) a sense of emphatic placement of the temples on the royal citadels and distinctive exterior features; (2) an indirect route towards the cult rooms of Nabu that passed through multiple courtyards, passage-chambers, and doorways with remarkable architectural programmes; (3) and akītu-suites, which were associated with the Assyrian akītu-festival and adê-ceremony. The appreciation of knowledge and of experts (Akk. ummânu) materialised in these built environments expresses developments in royal ideology and the preferences of Neo-Assyrian kings, in particular during the eighth and seventh centuries b.c. This examination of the temples of Nabu demonstrates the ways in which a sensory-oriented approach adds a unique perspective to previous archaeological and textual studies, as well as insight into the relationship between cultural and ideological values and complex sensory landscapes of past societies.Download Free PDFView PDFThe ancient scholar at work – Some glimpses from the ancient Near EastKlaus WagensonnerThis short essay aims to provide a few glimpses into the life of scholars in ancient Mesopotamia. What we focus on here, in particular, are textual sources that highlight his or her work ethics, tasks and aspirations. It is not the intention in this paper to discuss every aspect in the life of scholars in the ancient Near East, since a thorough study would go far beyond the scope of this paper. 1 It is, nonetheless, important to highlight certain key aspects, which set apart the Mesopotamian scholar from a common scribe engaged in tasks such as performing administrative duties or drafting letters. Some of these key aspects are vividly described in the well-known Autobiography of the Neo-Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, in which the king states as follows: 2 I learnt the lore of the wise sage Adapa, the hidden secret of all scribal art. I can recognize celestial and terrestrial omens (and) discuss (them) in the assembly of the scholars. I can deliberate upon (the series) " (If) the liver is a mirror (image) of heaven " with able experts in oil divination. I can solve complicated multiplications and divisions which do not have an (obvious) solution. I have studied elaborate composition(s) in obscure Sumerian (and) Akkadian which are difficult to get right. I have inspected cuneiform sign(s) on stones from before the flood, which are cryptic, impenetrable (and) muddled up. This famous statement is suitable to set the stage. The king portrays himself as a devout scholar capable of reading obscure inscriptions, deliberate upon difficult treatises, and engage in scientific discourse with other experts. How much of this account is mere fiction, to what extent the king received an education that allowed him to excel in these tasks, has been subject of  I would like to thank the organisers of the colloquium Écriture, Pouvoir, Légitimité, Affichage culturel, politique et identitaire en Orient & Méditerranée. IIIe millénaire av. – IIe millénaire ap. J.-C., Paris, 6–7 October 2016, for offering to publish my paper in the colloquium's proceedings.
