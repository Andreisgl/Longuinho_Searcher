As a local researcher in the Birmingham team based at BCU I developed case study material on the role of BCU in supporting creative industries and on the development of the Custard Factory and Fazeley Studios as providers of rental offices for creative businesses.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEuropean Planning StudiesUrban Policies for the Creative Industries: A European Comparison2014 • Silja Lassur, Külliki Tafel-ViiaDownload Free PDFView PDFCultural and Creative Economy in depth Analysis of the Main Trends2018 • Caterina PuricelliMeasuring the role of the cultural and creative sectors and their socio-economic performance is a relatively recent trend. For many, the arts are perceived as marginal in terms of economic contribution and should therefore be confined to the realms of public intervention. To an extent, it explains the lack of a common statistical framework and shared tools compared with other industrial sectors. The present study attempts to identify the main theoretical backgrounds that underlie the most used methodological approaches in the assessment of the Creative and Cultural Industries (CCIs). Once identified, it tries to quantify the major economic-related trends at the global and European level: trade in cultural and creative goods and services, employment, turnover by sector, intellectual property dimension, business demography, by relying on statistical tools and databanks such as those provided by UNCTAD, EUROSTAT, UNESCO, OECD, WIPO, World Bank. A special section is dedicated to the concept and involvement of the so-called global cities in providing the ground for creativity and innovation to meet and grow. Creativity, in return, may shape the fortune of a city from many perspectives: urban architecture, design, cultural venues and events, tourism attraction, talent retention and job creation, building up human capital, innovation of products and methods, technological advancement are some of the important contribution of the Cultural and Creative Economy to the economic and social growth of a city that dedicates resources to this sector. This topic covers the last part of this work, where it is presented a very recent and comprehensive attempt of delineating a ranking of the best performing cities in terms of CCE, made at the European level by the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor (a European Commission initiative). This part provides an in-depth presentation of this 2017 initiative, and of the methodologies and results that it brought. Furthermore, it also makes an explorative attempt to interpret relationships that have not been investigated yet, given the newness of data and analysis made on this topic. It does not seek for a cause-consequence finding, rather it is aimed at making the first research step towards the relationship between the cultural and creative content of a city and its growth relative to the broader economic environment. The ultimate question that could be answered only by a complex econometric model, refers to whether cultural and creative commitment (in financial, social and policy terms) could be a strong driver for growth or just one of the many, and if wealth is an inescapable starting condition for a city, a region or a country to obtain positive results from investments in CCIs. The end of the chapter provides a showcase of some examples of public/private involvement into projects to raise the creativity content of the exemplified cities. It especially aims at underlying the variety of approaches, targets, budgets and results, depending on the intrinsic historical, social, economic, territorial and resource endowment features of each creative city.Download Free PDFView PDFInfrastructures for Innovation: Enhancing Innovation Activity through Urban Planning in Baltic Metropolises2007 • Sampo  RuoppilaDownload Free PDFView PDFCreative city concept in local economic development: the case of Finnish cities 2014 • Ari-Veikko  AnttiroikoThis paper provides an overview of the approach to and application of the creative city concept in Finnish local government. The discussion revolves around how local governments have utilised the creative city concept in local economic development. The empirical part focuses on local governments’ approaches to creative city with special reference to two cases: the cities of Helsinki and Tampere, which are at the forefront of the Finnish creative city movement. The analysis shows that only a few small and remote local communities have given creativity, culture and arts a major role in their economic development policy, whereas larger cities are increasingly incorporating the creative city concept into their development strategies. Finnish local governments’ approach can be described as institutional, even if the business-oriented approach is gradually gaining ground, as exemplified by the case of the city of Tampere. In all, it appears that so far the idea of creative city has been applied in Finnish cities on a partial and ad hoc basis.Download Free PDFView PDFCross Innovation: A Report on Best PracticePaul LongDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Cultural Foundation Idea Camp 2015Ana GonçalvesSelected as one of the 50 participants at the ECF Idea Camp 2015 on "Build the City"Download Free PDFView PDFTechnology and knowledge-based development.
