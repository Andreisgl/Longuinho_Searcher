Comparison of Discrete Return and Waveform Airborne Lidar Derived Estimates of Fractional Cover in an Australian SavannaRequest PDFComparison of Discrete Return and Waveform Airborne Lidar Derived Estimates of Fractional Cover in an Australian SavannaPhilip LewisAbstractABSTRACT The advance of commercial airborne lidar systems from discrete-return to waveform recording instruments has made repeatable estimates of biophysical variables from these different methods questionable. Using an experimental airborne waveform lidar dataset acquired in an Australian savanna, this study presents a method for the derivation of canopy/ground backscatter coefficients from waveform lidar and a comparison of discrete return and waveform approaches to the estimation of fractional cover. Despite limited validation, the results indicate that waveform estimates of fractional cover can provide consistently higher accuracy than discrete return estimates under varying survey properties. Ongoing work using raw waveform data across larger areas and 3D radiative transfer simulations aims to develop a quantitative understanding of the impact of disparate sensor and survey properties on the detection of change in vegetation structure using commercial lidar instruments.Philip Lewis hasn't uploaded this paper.Let Philip know you want this paper to be uploaded.Ask for this paper to be uploaded.Request PDFRelated topicsRelated topicsLiDARCanopySensorsVegetationAboutPressBlogPeoplePapersTopicsJob Board We're Hiring! Help CenterFind new research papers in:PhysicsChemistryBiologyHealth SciencesEcologyEarth SciencesCognitive ScienceMathematicsComputer ScienceTermsPrivacyCopyrightAcademia ©2023
