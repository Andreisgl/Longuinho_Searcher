No evidence for an effect on brain atrophy rate of atorvastatin add-on to interferon β1a therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (the ARIANNA study)Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England),  Jan 14, 2015A previous phase 2 trial has suggested that statins might delay brain atrophy in secondary progre... more A previous phase 2 trial has suggested that statins might delay brain atrophy in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin add-on therapy on cerebral atrophy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. This randomised, placebo-controlled study compared atorvastatin 40 mg or placebo add-on therapy to interferon β1b for 24 months. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, multiple sclerosis functional composite score, Rao neuropsychological battery and expanded disability status scale were evaluated over 24 months. A total of 154 patients were randomly assigned, 75 in the atorvastatin and 79 in the placebo arms, with a comparable drop-out rate (overall 23.4%). Brain atrophy over 2 years was not different in the two arms (-0.38% and -0.32% for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively).

ENABLE assessed the effect of long-term prolonged-release (PR) fampridine (dalfampridine extended release in the United States) treatment on patient-perceived health impact in patients with MS with walking impairment. ENABLE was a 48-week, open-label, Phase 4 study of PR-fampridine 10 mg twice daily. Patients who showed any improvement in Timed 25-Foot Walk walking speed at weeks 2 and 4 and any improvement in 12-item MS Walking Scale score at week 4 remained on treatment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) score. At week 4, 707/901 (78.5%) patients met the criteria to remain on treatment. Patients on treatment demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in SF-36 PCS scores from baseline (mean change (95% confidence interval)) to week 12 (4.30 (3.83, 4.78); p &lt; 0.0001), week 24 (3...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

First, after natalizumab suspension, the relapse risk during the untreated wash-out period and during the course of switch therapies was estimated through Poisson regression analyses in separated models. During the wash-out period an increased risk of relapses was found in patients with a higher number of relapses before natalizumab treatment (incidence rate ratio = 1.31, P = 0.0014) and in patients discontinuing natalizumab due to lack of efficacy (incidence rate ratio = 2.33, P = 0.0288), patient&#39;s choice (incidence rate ratio = 2.18, P = 0.0064) and adverse events (incidence rate ratio = 2.09, P = 0.0084).

Haemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in patients after reversible ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke assessed with positron emission tomographyNeuroradiology,  1987Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV) and oxygen metabolic rate (CMRO2) were eva... more Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV) and oxygen metabolic rate (CMRO2) were evaluated and compared among normals, patients with recent reversible ischaemic attacks (RIAs) and patients with chronic minor infarction using positron emission tomography. Average CBF together with CMRO2 significantly decreased in the infarction group in the middle cerebral artery territory of the affected hemisphere while the mean values for RIAs were intermediate between the other two groups. CBV also reduced, however it was more preserved compared to flow as seen in decreased CBF/CBV values. Significant interhemispheric difference was found in CBF/CBV ratio, but it did not clearly correlate with OEF changes. Higher OEF was noted only in the restricted brain regions of RIAs where CBF showed large hemispheric asymmetry. However, in other regions, the coupled decline of blood flow and metabolism was found which suggests tissue damage or neuronal cell loss in the brain with previous RIA symptoms.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The introduct... more Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a life-long disease that typically affects young adults. The introduction of disease-modifying therapy has changed the clinical and social burden of the disease. Safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles of Interferon beta (IFNbeta) therapy in MS have been widely highlighted both in trial settings and in daily clinical practice. However, there is a relative lack of information on the long-term period: all pivotal trials must be considered short-term in a disease with an average duration of 30-40 years and post-marketing studies suffer from some limitations. Moreover, current available IFNbeta preparations are only partially effective and are difficult to administer, which has led to poor patient compliance. Over the treatment period, a problem could be the development of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) against the drug, which have been related to lessening treatment benefits. Despite these restrictions, IFNbeta still remains the first choice treatment in MS.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, not all treated patients experience a satisfied response to therapy in terms of suppression of relapse and slowing disability progression.At the present time none of the proposed criteria of response to disease modifying therapies (DMTs) have been validated. Clinical parameters, such as relapse rate and disability progression assessing with EDSS scale, may represent two useful indicators of therapeutic response, but their value in predicting the long-term response to DMTs is weak.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Here we examine the specificity of NAbs developed during therapy for RRMS with recombinant interferon (rIFN) beta-1a or rIFN beta-1b, and study the effect of switching from rIFN beta-1a to rIFN beta-1b on the incidence and specificity of NAbs. The relative ability to neutralize rIFN beta-1a and beta-1b was assayed in sera positive for NAbs derived from RRMS patients treated with either rIFN beta-1a (N=9) or rIFN beta-1b (N=16), while the incidence and specificity of NAbs to IFN beta developed during therapy were studied in 50 RRMS patients who were treated for two years with rIFN beta-1a followed by a further year either switching to rIFN beta-1b (N=34) or continuing treatment with rIFN beta-1a (N=16). The results show that all positive sera, independent of the source, may recognize both forms of rIFN beta and that a further year of treatment does not significantly affect the incidence and specificity of the NAbs developed during the first two years of treatment even if treatment is switched to a different type of IFN beta. The data then suggests that it is unlikely that the administration of rIFN beta-1b to anti-rIFN beta-1a NAbs-positive patients can overcome the inhibitory effect exerted by the serum antibodies (and vice versa), and that a further period of treatment with IFN beta-1b in patients previously treated with rIFN beta-1a does not significantly change the pattern of antibody response to IFN beta.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Neurological examination, CT and CBF study were performed no later than 6 h after the onset of symptoms. Regional perfusion abnormalities were seen in all patients when the CT scan was still normal. Follow-up CT revealed low-density areas roughly corresponding to the core of the perfusion defect. Nimodipine infusion significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure (P less than 0.01), while PaCO2 and clinical symptoms remained unchanged. A significant CBF improvement (P less than 0.05) after nimodipine was seen in the border zone of the ischaemic infarct but not in the core of the lesion or in the unaffected contralateral hemisphere.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Clinicians from a large number of Italian MS centers took part in a Delphi process aimed at obtaining consensus statements among the participants. Large consensus was obtained for statements grouped under the following main MS themes: identification of the most useful scales to evaluate mobility, integration of objective evaluation with patient perceptions, impact of walking impairment on daily life, management of the disabled patient using a rehabilitative and pharmacological approach. The consensus statements developed by a large number of experts may be used as a practical reference tool to help physicians treat MS patients with motor impairment.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

After two years, a significant increase was found in the physical health composite score (Δ = +3.1 in group a, Δ = +3 in group b, p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05 in both), mental health composite score (Δ = +4.7 in group a, Δ = +5.5 in group b, p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in both), in eight MSQoL sub-items of group a and in seven sub-items in group b. Conversely, the untreated group showed a slight decrease in seven domains.

QoL of RRMS could be improved by IFNβ-1a treatment, despite natural history data which seem to demonstrate that QoL could get worse over the time.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Influence of nimodipine on cerebral blood flow in human cerebral ischaemiaJournal of Neurology,  1989Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by xenon-133 inhalation and single photon emission compute... more Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by xenon-133 inhalation and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in 7 patients with acute cerebral ischaemia prior to and 30 min after intravenous infusion of nimodipine (1 mg). Neurological examination, CT and CBF study were performed no later than 6 h after the onset of symptoms. Regional perfusion abnormalities were seen in all patients when the CT scan was still normal. Follow-up CT revealed low-density areas roughly corresponding to the core of the perfusion defect. Nimodipine infusion significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure (P less than 0.01), while PaCO2 and clinical symptoms remained unchanged. A significant CBF improvement (P less than 0.05) after nimodipine was seen in the border zone of the ischaemic infarct but not in the core of the lesion or in the unaffected contralateral hemisphere.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The MoSt Project––More Steps in multiple sclerosis: a Delphi method consensus initiative for the evaluation of mobility management of MS patients in ItalyJournal of Neurology,  2014The aim of the study was to identify the main factors that impact mobility impairment in multiple... more The aim of the study was to identify the main factors that impact mobility impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in Italy. Clinicians from a large number of Italian MS centers took part in a Delphi process aimed at obtaining consensus statements among the participants. Large consensus was obtained for statements grouped under the following main MS themes: identification of the most useful scales to evaluate mobility, integration of objective evaluation with patient perceptions, impact of walking impairment on daily life, management of the disabled patient using a rehabilitative and pharmacological approach. The consensus statements developed by a large number of experts may be used as a practical reference tool to help physicians treat MS patients with motor impairment.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
