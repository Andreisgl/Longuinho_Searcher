After governmental constructive involvements and Community Empowerment, it has developed not only western horizontal transplantation but also local significance. This article focuses on the two-year plan "Environmental Art Movement at Plum Tree Creek", which links to the ecological system of Plum Tree Creek to present artistic significance. Criticisms of new genre public all will also be used to discuss how the problems of new genre public art can be solved through this movement. 2004年《量繪形貌》一書的翻譯出版開始，「新類型公共藝術」在臺灣開始以一個新的藝術型態被認知，發生實踐與論述，在臺灣公家單位的積極介入，接續了社區總體營造之發展延伸，發展出不僅是西方橫向論述移植而發展出地方的意義。本文以2010年國家文化藝術基金會視覺藝術策展類補助的二年計畫《樹梅坑溪環境藝術行動》為研究對象，連結以樹梅坑溪為軸的周邊生態，從中討論新類型公共藝術的展示問題，如何輻射出藝術內涵，並且從幾項對新類型公共藝術的批判出發，觀察樹梅坑溪環境藝術行動處理新類型公共藝術問題的方式。Save to LibraryDownloadby Fiona  Cheng•  9  Public Art, Taiwan Studies, Community Action Projects (Art), Taiwanese ArtThe New Global Politics of the Asia Pacific: Conflict and Cooperation in the Asian Century,The New Global Politics of the Asia Pacific: Conflict and Cooperation in the Asian Century, 3rd Edition ©2017 Routledge: London & New York. 341pp. + x.

Based on new research and offering fresh interpretation, this edition evaluates the prospects for continuing US dominance in the ‘Asian Century’. Whilst presenting evidence for a multifaceted ‘Beijing Strategy’, which aims to counter the US by building an alternative regional order, it also explains Japan’s definitive departure from its limited military role. Key content includes: -Intra-regional conflicts in the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula,-The different responses within the Asia Pacific to globalisation and western ideas of democracy and political economy,-The underappreciated success of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in building a regional identity-The European Union’s soft power in the region.A highly topical account, which offers an overview of the main actors, institutions and contemporary issues in the Asia Pacific, the book will be essential reading for students of Asian Studies, International Politics, and anyone interested in the region. Michael K.

Two proposals model this relationship, one suggesting a direct relation with PAn, the other with PMP (Proto-Malayo-Polynesian). The paper evaluates all existing proposals, comparing them with reconstructed Tai, Kra-Dai and Hlaic, as well as suggesting new comparisons. It suggests that the only convincing explanation of the comparisons with different subsets of Austronesian is to suppose the relationship is multi-genetic, that intense contact across the Taiwan Strait in the early period of Austronesian maritime activity, allowed different elements to make up Daic. This can be compared with the genesis of Malagasy, where multiple islands contributed to the lexicon of present-day Malagasy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Roger Blench•  6  Archaeology, Languages and Linguistics, Austronesian Languages, Taiwan StudiesLiminoid space and place-fixing in urban activismThe past 10 years witnessed a resurgence of youth activism in East Asia.

While some may consider it as simply reflecting a broader, general trend of young people reacting to the neoliberalizing world, this paper pays special attention to the changing cultural geographies of East Asia that underlie part of the picture. In 2014, the Sunflower movement in Taiwan was triggered by a group of young people who occupied the Legislative Yuan, paralyzed the establishment for 23 days, and brought about alternative politics, which soon was echoed by the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong during 26 September to 15 December the same year. This paper is interested in understanding how young people, walking away from the aforementioned urban uprising with their memories of participating in a sort of exceptional city for short time, carried on their aspiration for alternatives in their everyday lives. Finding inspiration from Victor Turner’s notion of liminoid and anti-structure, it attends to the activism embedded in everyday life. It also attends to the translocal, transnational interaction among young actors across cities in East Asia, with a focus on the act of place-fixing, which enables connection, collaboration, and circulation (of resources) through materialistic, transactive practices and can be compared to place-making.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shu-mei Huang•  4  Taiwan Studies, Hong Kong, Activism, Hong Kong Umbrella MovementBook Review_Japanese Taiwan: Colonial Rule and Its Contested LegacySave to LibraryDownloadby Nianshen Song•  2  Japanese Colonialism, Taiwan StudiesJapanese homoerotic manga in Taiwan Same sex love and utopian imaginationMARTIN, Fran. “Japanese homoerotic manga in Taiwan: Same-sex love and utopian imagination,” in Women’s Manga in Asia and Beyond: Uniting Different Cultures and Identities, edited by Fusami Ogi, Rebecca Suter, Kazumi Nagaike and John A.... moreMARTIN, Fran. “Japanese homoerotic manga in Taiwan: Same-sex love and utopian imagination,” in Women’s Manga in Asia and Beyond: Uniting Different Cultures and Identities, edited by Fusami Ogi, Rebecca Suter, Kazumi Nagaike and John A.

The tours represented Beijing opera as a high-profilevictim of the Cultural Revolution and promoted the Nationalist government on Taiwanas the legitimate guardian of China’s ancient cultural traditions and what it meant tobe “Chinese.” The ultimate failure to stop the US shift to Beijing highlights, amongother things, the Nationalist government’s lack of control over the “infrastructureof persuasion” dominated by American impresarios and show business.

We, thus, pointed out the logic of politicalsurvival was the main mechanism to explain how the land and spaces were developed inTaiwan after WWII; land and spatial developments were the policies that political elitesmanipulated to build their winning coalitions and to maximize the probability ofpolitical survival.Save to LibraryDownloadby Weiche Fu and +1Zonghong Lin•  4  Taiwan Studies, Urban Development, Land Grabbing, Expropriation of land中文摺頁 v.4中文摺頁 v.4Save to LibraryDownloadby Kun-hui Ku•  8  Indigenous Studies, Taiwan Studies, Asia Pacific Region, Indigenous PeoplesLearn to BE, not Taught to FIT (Keynote at the 2020 AERO Conference)Save to LibraryDownloadby Adler Yang•  11  Social Change, Media and Cultural Studies, Democratic Education, Alternative EducationOral History Summary Taiwan Homosexuality 1980s and AIDS 2016With the humanistic ideals of narrative medicine, the author and two graduate students of Taipei Medical University in 2012 explored a halfway house for AIDS sufferers in Taiwan, and found a man in his late fifties who was eager to set... moreWith the humanistic ideals of narrative medicine, the author and two graduate students of Taipei Medical University in 2012 explored a halfway house for AIDS sufferers in Taiwan, and found a man in his late fifties who was eager to set down his story, " Handsome ". Six hours of interviewing produced an 82-page transcript in Chinese. The following oral history in English is a summary of his account, one rich in description of traditional custom and social and economic history. Born in 1958 to an adopted daughter-in-law (a peculiarly Taiwanese custom) in a rich landowner family in Sanchong, west of Taipei, Handsome and his mother were ejected from the family and taken in by a retired military man, a " mainlander " who had fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communist/Nationalist civil war. Running away from home at age 16, Handsome was molested by an older man he met in New Park, the well-known locus of an emerging subculture of homosexuality in Taiwan. He narrowly escaped being sold by a police inspector to serve as a male prostitute. Later he formed a platonic relationship with a young woman he considered his one pure love, but at age 25 he fled from marriage and abandoned himself to wanton gay sexuality, in which he seemed to hold great charm and power. He was successful in business as well. But turning HIV-positive at age 51, he gradually lost much of his eyesight, and has been reduced to living in a crowded halfway house of an AIDS NGO. All the same, his motto is " Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry, and you cry alone " , and he has put together an extraordinarily popular blog beginning from the interview of his early life transcribed by my students.Save to LibraryDownloadby Linda Arrigo•Taiwan StudiesAre You What You Wear?: Taiwanese Vintage Fashion Choices and IdentityFinal paper for History of Modern East Asia: Politics, Society, and Daily Life Experience 2.0Save to LibraryDownloadby Chew Tzi Ling•  6  Taiwan Studies, Fashion History, Vintage Fashion, Clothing CultureTaiwan's 'tongzhi' warm powerSave to LibraryDownloadby Adam Chen-Dedman (formerly Adam K.

More opportunities for shifting alliances now exist, especially given the current global economic meltdown which has had an impact on both China and Taiwan’s ability to sustain its assistance to many Latin American states. Taiwan-China relations in Latin America are at a crossroads. This paper starts with an overview of Taipei’s struggle to ensure the support of its Latin American allies, in face of a fast growing and increasingly appealing Beijing. It then focuses on two case studies, St Lucia and Costa Rica, which have recently switched allegiance. St. Lucia has flipped back and forth; while Costa Rica ended a 63-year relationship with Taiwan in June 2007 and recognised the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

Drawing from fieldwork with gender and sexually nonconforming people ranging in age from their 20s to their 70s, she argues that dominant identity-based frameworks are inadequate for understanding how and why this discourse has emerged in Taiwan at this historical moment. The findings point instead to generational shifts in familial interdependency and intimacy, which require new and hybridized strategies for managing gender and sexuality within families.

In Taiwan, where the further development of nuclear power is suspended due to public antinuclear sentiment, offshore wind farms have been heavily promoted as a way of meeting electricity demand. The planned site for offshore wind farms, mainly the intertidal zone along the coast of Changhua County, overlaps with both oyster farms and the habitat of Taiwanese humpbacked dolphins, categorized as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This has resulted in a clash between conserving the oyster farming landscape, protecting an endangered species, and developing green energy. Facing this dilemma, pro–wind farm discourses that highlight concerns about global climate change have gradually supplanted those stressing the welfare of oysters and dolphins, even though the latter have been used successfully as local icons by movements opposing previous development projects on the intertidal zone. This article reconsiders the politics of territorialization implied by the “green” label affixed to offshore wind farm projects and other forms of green energy in general. As such, the meaning of offshore wind farms, as a newly discovered energy resource, is intertwined with the changing meanings of both dolphins and oyster farms, as rival nonhuman objects of resource exploitation and natural conservation. The territorialization of such resources in the emerging discursive space of green energy has proceeded via relational placemaking with nonlinear connections among multiple human and nonhuman elements.Key Words: conservation, intertidal zone, landscape, renewable resources, resource frontier.Save to LibraryDownloadby Po-Yi  Hung (洪伯邑)•  11  Renewable Energy, Wind Energy, Space and Place, Political Ecology植民地台湾を映す日本の絵葉書概要, 1900-1945 (Colonial Taiwan as Reflected in Japanese Picture Postcards: An Overview, 1900-1945), in 絵葉書に見る日本と中国:The Rupnow Collection, 1894-1945.

These dilemmas, in consequence, become the mechanism to create a leeway for the state to ‘tailor’ different meanings of frontier to meet the contingent market demands. I use tea production on China’s southwest frontier as an example to demonstrate that dilemma is not an end result, but a mechanism to rearticulate the relationship among frontier, the state and the market economy. Specifically, I argue that dilemmas on China’s southwest frontier have been forged by the Chinese state with its incompatible desires between ‘modernisation’ and ‘primitiveness’ of the tea landscapes in Yunnan, a province on China’s southwest frontier. Meanwhile, the incompatible desires and the resulting dilemmas on China’s southwest frontier have further mobilised the state to flexibly rework its power to reconstruct the frontier to meet contingent market demand. Based on the shifting meanings of tea landscapes, the state has flexibly ‘shuttled through’ the dilemmas between development of modernisation and preservation of primitiveness on the frontier.Save to LibraryDownloadby Po-Yi  Hung (洪伯邑)•  21  Human Geography, Cultural Geography, Environmental Geography, Development StudiesInvestor Relations Activities in TaiwanSave to LibraryDownloadby Teddy Tsai•  6  Business, Communication, Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate CommunicationCanada’s IndoPacific absence leaves us on the outside looking in The HubSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen R Nagy•  19  International Relations, International Security, Taiwan Studies, Chinese foreign policy為馬紹爾喝采：在後核武、後殖民世界取回掌控權的島國（中文翻譯）Bravo for the Marshallese: Regaining Control in a Post-Nuclear, Post-Colonial World (2nd Edition) Author: Holly M.

Counter-intuitively, Taiwan’s success was achieved in part due to its exclusion from international bodies such as the World Health Organization, which led it to adopt a highly vigilant approach to health threats, especially those that emerge in China, whose irredentist claims impinge on Taiwan’s participation in the international community and constitute an existential military threat. Taiwan’s response to COVID-19 was recast by its diplomatic representatives into “The Taiwan Model”, a formulation used to pursue increased international recognition and participation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ian Rowen•  14  History, Geography, International Relations, Geopolitics戦後台湾の動物慰霊碑―日本統治時代からの連続と断絶―Cenotaphs Erected for the Repose of Animals’ Soul after World War II in TaiwanSave to LibraryDownloadby Masayuki Manabe•  7  Japanese History, Taiwan Studies, History of Taiwan, Modern Japanese HistoryAnthropology's Orientalist Slot?

The emergent homosexual cultural politics in Taiwan is one such marginalized voice trying to assert itself through literary discourse, commanding focus on complex ethnic and social relationships that exist and interact within the country (Chang 196). Specifically, the development of queer literature () since the 1980s uses cultural representations of homosexuality to reflect a growing sense of identity crisis on the island and address the psychological dilemma of living under rapidly changing global conditions (Martin [1] 4). Queer discourses thus define new social categories that forge resistance to foreign influences but are nonetheless still trapped within an institutionalized network subjugated to a global circulation of ideas. Bai Xianyong’s and Zhu Tianwen’s() are two Taiwanese novels that portray a suppressed homosexual identity to illustrate the complex dynamic arising from a shift in the island’s societal and political framework amidst the emergence of a new globalized cultural paradigm.

The project bears on Taiwan's judicial reform of 1999. It is the first book-length study of Taiwan's judiciary and its transformation in the early stage of Taiwan's democratization.  Written after a second judicial reform that was launched in 2017, this chapter aims at historicizing not only Taiwan's judiciary but also the attempts to reform it. This chapter provides in its first part a historical account of Taiwan's justice system and the society's perception of it in the long century between 1895 to 1999. Rejecting the conventional narratives which enumerate origins of legal reception, this part explains how the justice system under Japanese rule (1895--1945) has earned respect despite the colonialism, and why this system fell into disarray under the Republican Chinese occupation (1945--92).  This chapter argues then in its second part that Taiwan's reformers have reduced the poor quality of the country's administration of justice to the malfunction of the judiciary alone. Taking into account the history of Western judiciary itself, this chapter argues that the key reform issues pertain rather to state-building than the making of organizational and procedural laws. This chapter argues that the centralization of government lawyering in a broad sense is Taiwan's priority and expects that this issue would soon lead to more reform attempts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tzung-Mou Wu•  14  Legal History, Taiwan Studies, State Building, Judicial Reform(2021) La littérature comme outil d'analyse politiqueTelle est la contribution politique de la littérature qui rappelle, documente, prédit et invente tout ce que l’Académie, encadrée par une dictature, engoncée dans son besoin de citer des sources, alourdie par ses notes de bas de page, ne... moreTelle est la contribution politique de la littérature qui rappelle, documente, prédit et invente tout ce que l’Académie, encadrée par une dictature, engoncée dans son besoin de citer des sources, alourdie par ses notes de bas de page, ne peut dire ou n’ose pas faire : penser le politique et ses injustices, sa répression des individus et de leur mémoire, ses métamorphoses et ses espoirs. La littérature rappelle que la politique est nationale, mais aussi locale, avec ses factions, ses intérêts, ses surprises, que la vie politique est individuelle autant que collective. Elle montre que Taiwan est toujours, et de plus en plus, un État, une société, où la démocratie, parce qu’elle est à l’origine une greffe, a l’audace de se réinventer souvent, là où, chez nous, elle semble vouloir s’éroder. Pluralité culturelle, strates historiques, croisements de civilisations, frontières de valeurs et de cultures, la société taïwanaise est un objet complexe à appréhender.

Toutes octogénaires, ces VuVu (« grand-mère » en langue paiwan) portent sur leurs mains les traces de ce rituel initiatique visant à marquer leur statut social, invoquer la protection divine et ouvrir les portes de l'après-vie. Si traditionnelle-ment, les hommes Paiwan étaient eux aussi marqués (les chefs portaient sur leurs poitrines des motifs spécifiques et complexes traduisant la puissance de leur statut social), leurs traces ont elles déjà disparu, avec le décès notamment de la dernière génération dans les années 1990. La coutume connaît son premier déclin durant l'occupation de l'île par le Japon de 1895 à 1945. Interdite, elle devient secrète, les femmes allant se faire tatouer dans les montagnes à l'abri du pouvoir. À la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, l'île entre dans le giron de la République de Chine, qui elle aussi désavouera cette pratique. « La passation du pouvoir pris deux ans néan-moins, se souvient Ho Yu-mei, une femme âgée vivant à Laiyi Township, ville montagnarde indigène situé au sud de l'île. Durant cette période, mes grands-parents nous ont encouragé à nous faire tatouer. Mais ensuite, la pratique s'est arrêtée ». Un rite initiatique soumis à des règles rigoureuses La société paiwan reposant sur le principe de classe sociale héréditaire, les tatoueurs (chaque village en avait au moins un) étaient soit noble, soit shaman, soit un homme, soit une femme. Les parents de la jeune fille en passe d'être tatouée devaient offrir au chef du village une boisson cérémonielle à base de vin de céréales. Ce dernier décidait alors de la date à laquelle le tatouage serait réalisé, et choisissait parmi cinq classes possi-Ljalep Qamuljilj, née en 1927, est une noble paiwan. Elle a été tatouée par une femme : « Quand la séance s'est terminée, une cérémonie pour calmer la température des mains était obligatoire. Nous avons aussi prié pour que cela ne s'infecte pas, et que le motif soit clair et brillant » raconte-t-elle.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lars Krutak•  12  Indigenous Studies, Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies, Taiwan Studies, Indigenous KnowledgeNextLast »Related TopicsHistory of TaiwanFollowFollowingChinese StudiesFollowFollowingChinese Language and CultureFollowFollowingEast Asian StudiesFollowFollowingTaiwanFollowFollowingTaiwanese LiteratureFollowFollowingContemporary ChinaFollowFollowingAnthropology of TaiwanFollowFollowingChinese literatureFollowFollowingChinaFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
