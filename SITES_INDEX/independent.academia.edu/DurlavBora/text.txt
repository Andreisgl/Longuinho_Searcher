GTPV is closely related to other members of the genus such as SPPV and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). Diseases caused by members of the genus Capripoxvirus (Poxviridae) are Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE) notifiable diseases (Bhanuprakash et al., 2011).

The sequencing was done on a Nanopore MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Two new annotations were added to the genome. Three of the genes were found to have frameshifts, which might be of importance in relation to infection. When compared to the only other reported whole genome sequence of swinepox virus, which was obtained from an isolate from America in 1999, our sequence is only 98.19% identical at the nucleotide level. The average amino acid sequence identity of the viral proteins, based on the common 149 annotations, is also 98.19%, demonstrating that these viruses are distinctly divergent. Owing to the fact that swinepox virus infects only swine, it could not have entered America until the introduction of swine in the 16th century from Europe.

This disease is characterized by its peculiar cutaneous lesions present mainly in the mouth region and less commonly on other sites, such as the abdomen and inguinal region. The unique immune-evasion properties of the orf virus results into short-term immunity both in natural infection as well as post-vaccination, as compared to other poxviruses associated with the presence of virulence genes namely VEGF, GIF (GM-CSF/IL2 inhibition factor), vIL10, VIR and apoptosis inhibitor etc. The disease mostly occurs in a mild form. However, the ability of the virus to cause repeated infection in the same animal, high morbidity in adults, mortality in young lambs and kids, its zoonotic nature, and its ability to cross-infect other species besides sheep and goats, make it an important disease globally. The disease is endemic to all the parts of India and cau...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The causative agent, ORFV was successfully isolated in primary lamb testes cells and identified using a semi-nested diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence and phylogenetic analyses of immunogenic envelope protein (B2L) coding gene. The affected animals showed characteristic proliferative skin lesions around the mouth and on nostrils and, in a few animals, lesions were also noticed on the tongue irrespective of age and sex. The morbidity, mortality and case fatality rates observed were 6%, 45% and 13%, respectively. Clinical samples were initially screened by counter immuno-electrophoresis and the serum neutralisation test; further positive skin scabs were tested with diagnostic PCR and virus isolation was performed on primary or secondary lamb testes cultures.

ASF has been identified in India for the first time in domestic pigs from outbreaks reported in two of the northeastern states, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in 2020. A total of 11 ASF outbreaks in different regions killed over 3700 pigs and devastated the economy of small-scale livestock owners of both the states. Considering the first outbreak of ASF in India, a generic risk assessment framework was determined to identify potential risk factors that might favor future emergence of the disease. Based on the Indian scenario, we considered population density of host, farming practice, availability of biological vectors and wildlife reservoirs, epidemiological cycles, and international trade to analyze the possibility of future outbreaks of ASF and chances of establishment of endemism. On critical analysis of the identified risk factors associated with ASFV transmission, we observed that the risk fact...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The disease is characterized by sudden death, high mortality, hemorrhages and necrosis in the internal organs. Duck farming plays an important role in the livelihood of the farmers of Assam. Duck Plague being the major killer disease among duck population of Assam, posing a threat to the growth of duck farming in the state. The present report investigates various outbreaks of Duck plague in Assam, detection and isolation of the virus. A total of 29 outbreaks suspected for Duck Plague were attended in different districts of Assam and 380 numbers of samples comprising of both clinical (n=107) as well as post mortem (n=273) were collected. Presence of DPV in samples was detected by Sandwich-ELISA (S-ELISA) and amplification of UL 44.5 as well as DNA polymerase gene of DPV by PCR. ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A total of 66 E. coli isolates were recovered from 420 samples of different food animals and further confirmed by PCR targeting E. coli specific uidA gene. These isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin and resistant to ampicillin and cloxacillin.
