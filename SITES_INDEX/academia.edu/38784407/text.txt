By ascribing to these texts intentional anonymity, we romanticise them and misjudge the social character of their authors. Instead, most medieval poems and manuscripts presuppose familiarity with their authorial or scribal maker. Last Words: The Public Self and the Social Author in Late Medieval England attempts to recover this familiarity and understand the literary motivation behind some of the most important fifteenth-century texts and authors. Last Words captures the public selves of such social authors when they attempt to extract themselves from the context of a lived life. Driven by archival research and literary inquiry, this book will reveal where John Gower kept the Trentham manuscript in his final years, how John Lydgate wished to be remembered, and why Thomas Hoccleve wrote his best-known work, the Series. This book will include documentary breakthroughs and archival discoveries, and will introduce a new life record for Hoccleve, identify the author of a significant political poem, and reveal the handwriting of John Gower and George Ashby. Through its investments in archival study, book history, and literary criticism, Last Words charts the extent to which medieval English literature was shaped by the social selves of their authors.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWriting and Reading Byzantine Secular Poetry, 1025-10812014 • Floris  Bernardn the mid-eleventh century, secular Byzantine poetry attained a hitherto unseen degree of wit, vividness, and personal involvement, chiefly exemplified in the poetry of Christophoros Mitylenaios, Ioannes Mauropous, and Michael Psellos. This is the first volume to consider this poetic activity as a whole, critically reconsidering modern assumptions about Byzantine poetry, and focusing on Byzantine conceptions of the role of poetry in society. By providing a detailed account of the various media through which poetry was presented to its readers, and by tracing the initial circulation of poems, this volume takes an interest in the Byzantine reader and his/her reading habits and strategies, allowing aspects of performance and visual representation, rarely addressed, to come to the fore. It also examines the social interests that motivated the composition of poetry, establishing a connection with the extraordinary social mobility of the time. Self-representative strategies are analyzed against the background of an unstable elite struggling to find moral justification, which allows the study to raise the question of patronage, examine the discourse used by poets to secure material rewards, and explain the social dynamics of dedicatory epigrams. Finally, gift exchange is explored as a medium that underlines the value of poetry and confirms the exclusive nature of intellectual friendship.Download Free PDFView PDFThomas Hoccleve and the poetics of reading2010 • Elon LangDownload Free PDFView PDFSonja Drimmer, "The Disorder of Operations: Illuminators, Scribes, and John Gower's Confessio Amantis," LIAS 44 (2017): 5-28.Sonja DrimmerDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Sick Child in Early Modern England, 1580-1720 (OUP, 2012; paperback 2014)Hannah  NewtonThe book is about sick children in England between approximately 1580 and 1720. At this time, the sickness or death of a child was a common occurrence – over a quarter of young people died before the age of fifteen – and yet this subject has received little scholarly attention. The book takes three perspectives: first, it investigates medical understandings and treatments of children. It argues that a concept of ‘children’s physic’ existed amongst doctors and laypeople: the young were thought to be physiologically distinct, and in need of special medicines. Secondly, the book examines the family’s experience, demonstrating that parents devoted considerable time and effort to the care of their sick offspring, and experienced feelings of devastating grief upon their illnesses and deaths. Thirdly, the book takes the viewpoint of sick children themselves, offering rare and intimate insights into the emotional, spiritual, physical, and social dimensions of sickness, pain, and death. It asserts that children’s experiences were characterised by profound ambivalence: whilst young patients were often tormented by feelings of guilt, fears of hell, and physical pain, sickness could also be emotionally and spiritually uplifting, and a source of much attention and love from parents. Drawing on a wide array of printed and archival sources, The Sick Child will be of interest to scholars working in the interconnected fields of the history of medicine, childhood, parenthood, bodies, emotion, pain, death, religion, and gender.Download Free PDFView PDFSonja Drimmer, "The Manuscript as an Ambigraphic Medium: Hoccleve's Scribes, Illuminators, and Their Problems," Exemplaria 29 (2017): 175-94Sonja DrimmerThis essay argues that late medieval manuscript producers were both aware of and at times troubled by the ontological ambiguity of the medium in which they worked. Nelson Goodman’s aesthetic philosophy provides an apt framework for characterizing this ambiguity, which rests on the manuscript’s dual status as both an allograph and an autograph. Embodying features of both, the manuscript demands a third category, which I term the “ambigraph.” Through an examination of manuscripts of Hoccleve’s Regiment of Princes, I demonstrate how both scribes and illuminators struggled with a self-referential text that presents itself as both an original document and the performance of a script. When called upon by the text they copied to produce pictorial evidence of Chaucer’s likeness, scribes and illuminators left behind evidence in both word and image of their perturbation at this brief, as well as their reluctance and refusal to fulfill it. These exertions, I argue, offer a practical theorization of a premodern media concept in lieu of such a theorization in words.Download Free PDFView PDFStudies in the Age of Chaucer'The writyng of this tretys': Margery Kempe’s Son and the Authorship of Her Book2015 • Sebastian SobeckiThe authorship of The Book of Margery Kempe has been the subject of much debate ever since the sole manuscript copy of the text was identified by Hope Emily Allen in 1934. My paper presents two pieces of new evidence relating to Margery Kempe’s son and to Robert Spryngolde, her confessor. The first item, a letter prepared for her son in Danzig (modern Gdańsk) in 1431, discloses the son’s name and the reasons for his journey to Lynn. This information, in turn, sheds new light on the account of The Book’s production as given in the Proem. As a result, the discovery of the letter corroborates the theory that the son was Kempe’s first scribe. A second previously unknown document shows the extent of Robert Spryngolde’s ties to Margery Kempe’s family, strengthening his role as the clerical scribe behind much of The Book. Both findings help to anchor the supposedly autobiographical narrative in its immediate historical situation, thereby strengthening the historicity of the work. Finally, I offer a revised explanation for the collaborative model behind the production of this text.Download Free PDFView PDFDialects in the Harley Miscellany: The Song of the Husbandman and the Poet's RepentanceAd PutterArgues (against Brook) that the alliterative poems were composed in the West Midlands, through an examination of phonology, dialect words, and verse form.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Oxford History of Classical Reception in English Literature, Vol. 1:  The Middle Ages.

Thomas Keymer (Oxford: OUP, 2017)Tiffany SternIN the 1580s and 90s a man was writing who never called any of his works satires: Thomas Nashe (1567–c.1601). Yet ‘satire’ was to be a term conferred upon his works by admirers who sought to define—and so limit—the nature of the prose he wrote. Samuel Sheppard wrote of Nashe’s ‘sweet Satyrick veine’, and John Taylor swore by the urn of ‘sweete Satyricke Nash’. Thomas Dekker memorialized ‘ingenious, ingenuous, fluent, facetious, T. Nash: from whose aboundant pen, hony flow’d to [his] friends, and mortall Aconite to [his] enemies’, and saw Nashe as both ‘Luculent Poet’ and ‘Sharpest Satyre’. But what, to Nashe’s friends and enemies, did ‘satire’ denote, particularly in combination with honey or sweetness? And why did Nashe himself avoid the word? This chapter explores the extent to which Nashe was and was not a writer of satires, as well as where his ‘sweetness’ resides, examining, first, what early modern writers took ‘satire’ to mean, and then to examine who was thought to be writing it.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
