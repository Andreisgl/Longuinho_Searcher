ParkerSusan B RidgelyAnna  StrhanFrom recent sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, to arguments about faith schools and religious indoctrination, this volume considers the interconnection between the actual lives of children and the position of children as placeholders for the future. Childhood has often been a particular site of struggle for negotiating the location of religion in public and everyday social life, and children's involvement and non-involvement in religion raises strong feelings because they represent the future of religious and secular communities, even of society itself. The Bloomsbury Reader in Religion and Childhood addresses wider questions about the distinctiveness of childhood and its religious dimensions in historical and contemporary perspective. Divided into five thematic parts, it provides classic, contemporary, and specially commissioned readings from a range of perspectives, including the sociological, anthropological, historical, and theological. Case studies range from Augustine's description of childhood in Confessions, the psychology of religion and childhood, to religion in children's literature, religious education, and Qur'anic schools. - Religious traditions covered include Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, in the UK and Europe, USA, Latin America and Africa - An introduction situates each thematic part, and each reading is contextualised by the editors - Guidance on further reading and study questions are provided on the book's webpageSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSociologyThe Stickiness of Non-Religion? Intergenerational Transmission and the Formation of Non-Religious Identities in ChildhoodAnna  StrhanThe rapid rise of those identifying as 'non-religious' across many countries has prompted growing interest in the 'religious nones'. A now burgeoning literature has emerged, challenging the idea that 'non-religion' is the mere absence of religion and exploring the substantive beliefs, practices and identities that are associated with so-called unbelief. Yet we know little about the micro-processes through which this cultural shift towards non-religion is taking place. Drawing on data from an ethnographic study, this article examines how, when, where, and with whom children learn to be non-religious, and considers the different factors that are implicated in the formation of non-religious identities. While research on religious transmission has demonstrated the importance of the family, our multi-sited approach reveals the important role also played by both school context and children's own reflections in shaping their formation as non-religious, suggesting a complex pattern of how non-religious socialization is occurring in Britain today.Download Free PDFView PDFTeaching Islam to Islam Teachers: Islamic Theological Studies in Germany at the Interchange of  Religion, State, and SocietyJan Felix EngelhardtIn Germany, religious education at state schools and theological teachers’ training are to be given “in accordance with the tenets of the religious community”. In the last 15 years, Islamic religious education and Islamic Theology have been established at school and university level. Faculties at the Islamic theological departments and the future Islam teachers are expected to be reformers of Islam and prototypes of the “good Muslim”. Critics, however, consider these steps an attempt for social control of Muslims. In my paper, I will look at the way German Islamic Theology designs its curricula between the requirements to teach Islam in accordance to the tenets of Muslim organizations and the public interest of having an Islam compatible to Western society. I will examine in which sense Islam as a subject in public education presents a litmus test to the relation between state, society, and the religious (Muslim) community in Germany.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Bloomsbury Reader in Religion and Childhood, ed.

ParkerAlthough many theological works are written by and for adults, scholars can use objects of everyday life to assess how religion is taught to and understood by children. Toys provide a hands-on way for young practitioners of religion to learn their religion’s values and goals. In this article, I overview the tools scholars have used for analyzing toys, and then look at recent ultra-Orthodox (“Haredi”) Jewish engagements with the toy industry. While many forms of Judaism see modern life and religion as compatible, Haredi Jews tend to separate themselves from modern society. Thus in the past Haredi communities have often rejected certain modern toys because of the secular values the toys convey. Recently, however, Haredi Jews have changed their tactics and started creating their own toys, ones that reinforce rather than undermine their religious traditions. These toys draw the line between women's spaces and men's spaces, and provide an alternative vision of American Judaism. Here American Judaism revolves around adherence to Jewish law in the home, the synagogue, the book room, and helping people, not through "cultural" Judaism. Toys represent one example of fundamentalists’ ability to adapt modern forms even as they adhere to a traditional way of life.

This paper examines how “love” as an affective concept was brought into the Chinese vocabulary where previously such meaning was absent, and the ways in which it has been adapted as a political discourse and a social force in Republican (1911-1949) and Communist China (1949-) in different ways. Although the making of love as an affect for the project of Chinese modernity has been noted by certain scholars, the source of such affect is primarily attributed to Christianity and Christian humanism (Lee, Goossaert, Wielander, Wickeri). My project will show 1) a typology of Christian influence as missionaries helped to reconfigure Asia through love when overt political and military power had begun to prove difficult or impossible to execute effectively, and as legacies of sentimentalism drawn into the age of modern nation-state nationalism: imperialism registered in the language of love; 2) alternative impact from revolutionary radicalism (e.g. October Revolution in Russia and socialism in France) and folk religions that has been decisive to the formation of the discourse of universal love, equality, and ‘harmonious society’ in state propaganda and everyday politics. This project will carefully take a top-down and from-below approach, to explore sources from media, contextual theology, and state propaganda. Ultimately, I wish this project could elucidate the expression of feeling as the means by which institutions and cultural authenticity are created and renewed, a means that has so far been neglected in the study of religion and politics in China.Download Free PDFView PDFCosmopolitanism as Political Resistance: Between Social Gospel and Christian Humanism in Republican and Contemporary China2016 • Ting GUOCondé Nast Traveler, Lonely Planet, Bon Voyage… Vividly as these magazine titles indicate, the word “cosmopolitanism” is often associated with the image of well-off world travelers who can be at ease everywhere but not rooted at their native places anywhere. In other words, it indicates the freedom of movement and a lifestyle enabled by the market of globalization. As an ideology, cosmopolitanism is also seen as a positive counterweight to the organizing power of such market and nation-states. However, the etymological roots of cosmopolitanism, that is, πόλις (polis), meaning “city”, also constitutes the origin for the English word “politics”, while polis itself derives from the Proto-Indo-European root pelə-, meaning “citadel or fortiﬁed high place.” Cosmopolitanism thus entails not only a freedom or a liberating ideology, but a structural political exclusion as a result of walled cities. Those who are often excluded include the natives who (are often forced to) accept, adapt, and instrumentalize foreign cultures and influences. As many scholars have pointed out, cosmopolitanism is potentially consonant with a European vision of what constitutes nations — preserving not only cultural difference but also political autonomy — so long as nationalism is not ethnically communitarian and is subordinated to human and civil rights. The philosopher Kant most famously proposed this notion of cosmopolitan right as a right to hospitality, which is widely viewed as the philosophical origin of modern cosmopolitan thought. Kant’s notion of cosmopolitanism is a legal order in which there are established lawful external relations among states and a universal civic society. Reflecting on this, contemporary scholars have argued that local solidarity and its individual manifestation in a sense of belonging in specific cultural and social settings is equally important, as it is marginalized and often stigmatized in the asocial imaginary characteristic of the new self-declared cosmopolitan variants of liberalism. The questions that this paper tackles include: how was this cosmopolitan ideal manifested in places that are forced to become connected to the larger world, for instance, as a result of conquest and colonialism? Contrary to the normative discourses on cosmopolitanism which entails both a privileged economic-political order and a universal, unencumbered humanity, the belief in a universal humanity restores hope and liberates humans from uncertainties and tragedies as a species as a whole. I define “cosmopolitanism” as the tenacity to resist external ideological and economic forces by reflecting upon, learning and incorporating openness to values outside one’s immediate historical and cultural condition, and forging local solidarities. I describe the aspiration of those, when were forced to become part of the larger world, want to be part of the world order in order to strengthen their own local solidarity.Download Free PDFView PDFThe paradigms of religious educationLiam GearonDownload Free PDFView PDFBoston (MA), 18-21 November 2017: AAR Annual MeetingAngela BernardoDownload Free PDFView PDFCHILDREN IN THE ANCIENT WORLD AND THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES. A BIBLIOGRAPHY (9th expanded edition)2018 • Ville Vuolanto, Reidar Aasgaard, Oana Maria CojocaruVille Vuolanto started this bibliography project in 2003 under the auspices of the University of Tampere as a modest enterprise of some 300 entries. Since then scholarship on ancient childhood has continued to flourish, and the original perspective of the bibliography has been widened from works by historians and classicists to include more and more scholarship from art history, archaeology and, in particular, Biblical and early Christian studies. The fourth edition had 1140 entries (2008), the fifth 1573 (2010), the sixth 1771 (2014), the seventh 2067 (2015), and the eighth 2186 (2016). Oana Maria Cojocaru has taken care of major part of the editorial process of the ninth edition. The earlier work of the research assistants (for the 2014 and 2015 editions) Camilla Christensen, Cecilie Krohn and Camilla Roll have been crucial for the outcome. The financial support from the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Ideas (IFIKK, University of Oslo) and the Tiny Voices from the Past: New Perspectives on Childhood in Early Europe project (IFIKK, 2013–2017) - led by Reidar Aasgaard and financed by the University of Oslo and the Research Council of Norway - has made it possible to carry the project on (the bibliography is published on IFIKK internet pages: https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/childhood/bibliography-ninth-edition.pdf). I want to thank also all those of you who have sent information about publications or mistakes in the bibliography. In the earlier phases of the project, the help and encouragement obtained from Kathleen Coleman and Christian Laes have been precious. The Academy of Finland, through the research project Religion and Children. Socialization in Pre-Modern Europe from the Roman Empire to the Christian World (2009–2012) funded the compilation of the fifth edition of this bibliography.Download Free PDFView PDFServices on DemandLiam GearonDownload Free PDFView PDFCopy of CHILDREN IN THE ANCIENT WORLD AND THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES.
