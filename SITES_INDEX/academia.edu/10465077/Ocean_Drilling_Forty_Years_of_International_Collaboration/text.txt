(2) What are the types of metabolism/carbon/energy sources and the rates of subsurface activity? (3) How is deep microbial life adapted to subsurface conditions? (4) How do subsurface microbial communities affect energy resources? And (5) how does the deep biosphere interact with the geosphere and atmosphere?&quot; (Horsfield et al., 2014) Many ICDP-sponsored drilling projects have included a deep-life component; however, to date, not one project has been driven by deep-life goals, in part because geomicrobiologists have been slow to initiate deep biosphere-driven ICDP projects. Therefore, the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) recently partnered with the ICDP to sponsor a workshop ...Download Free PDFView PDFExploring subseafloor life with the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program2007 • Paul KempDownload Free PDFView PDFOceanographyFifty Years of Scientific Ocean Drilling2019 • Judith McKenzieDownload Free PDFView PDFEos, Transactions American Geophysical UnionOcean drilling program's research intensifies as end nears2001 • William HAYDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific DrillingCOBBOOM: The Continental Breakkup and Birth of Oceans Mission2007 • Mike CoffinDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific DrillingExploring Subseafloor Life with the Integerated Ocean Drilling Program2007 • Patricia SobeckyDownload Free PDFView PDFInitial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project A Project Planned by and Carried Out With the Advice of the JOINT OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTIONS FOR DEEP EARTH SAMPLING (JOIDES)2000 • Paul EnosDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Initial Reports Volume 174AX (Suppl.)2016 • Tom McKennaThe following, who are listed in alphabetical order, are responsibleDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
