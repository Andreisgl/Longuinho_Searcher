This model called “4Hum-”, digs into etymology to address the research question about how to embed the term’s multidimensionality by re-connecting “humor” with “human”, “humility” and “humus”. This info-graphic is permanently evolving as part of an on-going process. The working hypothesis has been tested previously in the frame of “ASSIST 2010, Summer School of Arts and Sciences for Sustainability in Social Transformation”, that took place in Gabrovo (Bulgaria). This city is being gradually recognized as an international capital of humor and satire, reinforced by its existing cultural institutions such as the House of Humor and Satire. These positive results led to enlarge the scope of the research. Thus, nowadays, the “4hum” conceptual and visual model is being tested within the European project "Happy-Nests: Incubating and connecting creative communities for social innovation as a means to improve local wealth in peripheral regions", for 2013-2015 period. Finally, the author aspirates that humor, through info-graphics and visual communications, could become a weapon of “mass construction”, for further investigations in this field.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersA case study of public data design.

Information design has become much more important as a result of the chaos created by the unprocessed heap of data and information traffic. Therefore, people need designed information like infographics and data visualisation today. Design of information, which is among the most significant requirements of our age, has become a subject which needs to be dealt with more systematically in the education of visual communication design. Visual design of information and data is important not only for increasing perceptibility but also revealing the patterns within complex information, and being educative, persuasive and guiding depending on the content and objective. In this sense, incorporating data visualization and infographics works into the education of visual communication design would have significant contributions to train designers with sufficient qualification to meet the requirements of today’s world. This study examines the current/potential expansion of data visualization and infographics in the education of visual communication design at the age of information. With respect to students, it deals with its effects to the design method, process and perception and its contributions to the multidisciplinary design approach.Download Free PDFView PDFcommunicating complexity edited by Nicolò CeccarelliPaolo Tamborrini, Bardone LucaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Arts and Humanities, vol. 3, iss. 5.GÖRSEL İLETİŞİM TASARIMI EĞİTİMİNDE VERİ GÖRSELLEŞTİRME VE İNFOGRAFİK2014 • Banu İnanç  UYAN DURSon yüzyıldaki bilimsel ve teknolojik gelişmelerin sonuçları insanoğlunun hayatını kolaylaştırmakla birlikte, daha çok bilgiyle karşılaşmalarına neden olmaktadır. Giderek artan yığınlar halinde işlenmemiş veri ve bilgi trafiğinin yarattığı karmaşa sonucu bilginin tasarımı çok daha önemli hale gelmiştir. Bu nedenle, günümüz dünyasında insanlar infografik ve veri görselleştirme gibi tasarlanmış bilgilere daha çok ihtiyaç duymaktadır. Çağımızın önemli ihtiyaçlarından bilginin tasarımı, görsel iletişim tasarımı eğitiminde daha sistemli olarak ele alınması gereken bir konu haline gelmiştir. Bilgi ve verilerin görsel olarak tasarlanması sadece algılanırlığı artırması açısından değil aynı zamanda karmaşık bilgiler içindeki örüntüleri ortaya çıkarma, içeriğine ve amacına göre kimi zaman eğitici, ikna edici, yönledirici olma gibi nitelikleri bakımından da önemlidir. Bu bağlamda görsel iletişim tasarımı eğitimde veri görselleştirme ve infografik çalışmalarının yer alması, günümüz dünyasının gereksinimlerini karşılayabilecek donanımda tasarımcı yetiştirmeye önemli katkılarda bulunacaktır. Bu çalışmada, bilgi çağında, veri görselleştirme ve infografiklerin görsel iletişim tasarımı eğitiminde sağladığı/sağlayacağı açılım araştırılmaktadır. Öğrenciler açısından, tasarım yöntem, süreç ve algısına olan etkileri ve multidisipliner tasarım yaklaşımına katkıları ele alınmaktadır.Download Free PDFView PDFHere | Now | Look | See: Information visualizations of recent climate records in AlbertaChristine ClarkThis thesis is an analysis of the application of information visualization and design to wicked problems, a class of problems whose complexity, interconnectedness and fluctuation make them extremely difficult to resolve, and serves as a supporting document for my studio research and practice. In this paper I identify challenges that emerge with information visualizations of wicked problems and describe methods for addressing these challenges through my practice-based research project. Using climate data provided by Dr. Stefan W. Kienzle, Associate Professor of Hydrology and GIS at the University of Lethbridge, my research project attempts to use information visualization to communicate the climate data by applying design strategies that explore the relationship between aesthetic and functionality.Download Free PDFView PDFTechniques of Power in Branded Data VisualizationsAndrian GeorgievDownload Free PDFView PDFPlayable Data: Characterizing the Design Space of Game-y Infographics2011 • Funda Kivran-SwaineDownload Free PDFView PDFIEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer GraphicsBenefitting InfoVis with Visual Difficulties2011 • Jessica HullmanMany well-cited theories for visualization design state that a visual representation should be optimized for quick and immediate interpretation by a user. Distracting elements like decorative "chartjunk" or extraneous information are avoided so as not to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a user's understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which comprehension and recall are crucial. We identify implications of this view for the design and evaluation of information visualizations.Download Free PDFView PDFPublic CultureThe Aesthetics of Environmental Visualizations: More than Information Ecstasy?2014 • Heather  HouserDownload Free PDFView PDFPlaying with Data: an Experience in Creative InfovisAndrea GaiardoInformation Visualization (Infovis) methods provide an effective way to make sense of the vast amount of data flowing around our everyday experience. Using creative Infovis designs is possible to convey the mean-­‐ ing and enhance the understanding of complex topics. The purpose of this paper is to present the design method adopted in a collaboration between Polytechnic of Turin and Telecom Italia, whose goal is to devise novel and useful Infovis concepts to deal with data.
