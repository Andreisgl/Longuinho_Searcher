In Australia women have historically tended to participate in the labour force less and earn less income than men due to a range of legal, economic and social barriers (Evans 1996). Despite the progressive removal of these barriers over time, they continue to do so (ABS 2005). Women also have tended to have less superannuation than men (Ferris and Olsberg 2001; ABS 2001; Kelly 2006). One of the contributory factors to women’s lack of superannuation has undoubtedly been their loss of earnings from having childrenDownload Free PDFView PDFEconomic Advantage and Disadvantage among Older Australians: Producing National and Small Area ProfilesHal  KendigDownload Free PDFView PDFAPPSIM – Modelling the Labour ForceMarcia KeeganAbout NATSEM The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling was established on 1 January 1993, and supports its activities through research grants, commissioned research and longer term contracts for model maintenance and development with the federal departments of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Employment and Workplace Relations, Treasury, and Education, Science and Training. NATSEM aims to be a key contributor to social and economic policy debate and analysis by developing models of the highest quality, undertaking independent and impartial research, and supplying valued consultancy services. Policy changes often have to be made without sufficient information about either the current environment or the consequences of change. NATSEM specialises in analysing data and producing models so that decision makers have the best possible quantitative information on which to base their decisions. NATSEM has an international reputation as a centre of excellence f...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Public HealthThe personal and national costs of lost labour force participation due to arthritis: an economic study2013 • Megan PasseyDownload Free PDFView PDFModelling the cost of ill health in Health&WealthMOD (Version II): lost labour force participation, income and taxation, and the impact of disease prevention2011 • Megan PasseyDownload Free PDFView PDFAustralasian Journal on AgeingAustralian baby boomers’ expectations and plans for their old age2006 • Susan QuineDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of MicrosimulationHealth&WealthMOD2030: A Microsimulation Model of the Long Term Economic Impacts of Disease Leading to Premature Retirements of Australians Aged 45-64 Years Old.2014 • Robert  TantonPolicymakers in Australia, like in most OECD countries, have recognised the importance of early retirement due to ill health on individuals and families, as well as on the budget balance when planning for the health needs of an ageing population. In order to understand these effects, a unique microsimulation model, called Health&WealthMOD2030, was built to estimate the impacts of early retirement due to ill health on labour force participation, personal and household income, economic hardship (poverty), and government taxation revenue, spending and GDP in the years 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030. This paper describes the construction of Health&WealthMOD2030. The model captures the long term projections of demographic change, changing labour force participation patterns, real wages growth and trends in major illnesses affecting the older working age population. The base population of Health&WealthMOD2030 are the individuals aged 45-64 years with information on their work force status and health from the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Surveys of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2003 and 2009. Projected estimates of income, taxation, income support payments, savings and superannuation from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM’s) dynamic microsimulation model Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM) were synthetically matched with the base population. Health&WealthMOD2030 project forward the economic impacts of early retirement from ill health to 2030. This will fill substantial gaps in the current Australian evidence of health conditions that will keep older working age Australians out of the labour market over the long- term.Download Free PDFView PDFAustralian Evidence of Baby Boomers Financial Security: A ReviewHal  KendigPurpose: In light of the recent global economic crisis, many policy makers and consumer groups are questioning the financial preparedness of Australian Baby Boomers. A review of the Australian evidence since 2000, including government reports and working papers, on financial security of baby boomers as they approach retirement was undertaken. Method: Online databases were systematically searched, resulting in 63 articles and reports that met inclusion criteria of being published between 2000 and 2009 and financial matters for older Australians. The following search terms were used: baby boom*, Australian baby boomers*, financial security*, financial satisfaction*, financial perceptions*, retirement financial security baby boomer*; economic security and retirement*, resulting in 2,153 articles. Results: This review revealed four key topic areas: 1. Income, 2. Wealth and Superannuation, 3. Gender perspectives, 4. Self rated measures. The majority of studies reviewed examined objective...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Impact of Australia's Retirement Incomes System on Women's Retirement IncomesYolanda van GellecumIn compliance with a request from the Office for Women, Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the University of Queensland Social Research Centre has prepared this report in order to synthesise the findings of existing Australian and international research concerning the factors influencing women’s retirement incomes and the impacts of policies and programs on the gender gap in retirement savings. One of the most significant matters emphasized in the literature is that the retirement incomes system is enmeshed in a complex social and institutional environment which underlies inequalities between outcomes for men and women. The major social structural problem is that the interactions of key institutions including the labour market, the tax-transfers system, and the retirement incomes system itself are underpinned by and reinforce the traditional breadwinner structures of family formation.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
