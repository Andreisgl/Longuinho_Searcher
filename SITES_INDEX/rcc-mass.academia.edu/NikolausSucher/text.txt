Minocycline prevents glutamate-induced apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons by differential regulation of p38 and Akt pathways: Mechanisms of minocycline against apoptosisJournal of Neurochemistry,  2004Minocycline has been shown to have remarkably neuroprotective qualities, but underlying mechanism... more Minocycline has been shown to have remarkably neuroprotective qualities, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We reported here the robust neuroprotection by minocycline against glutamate-induced apoptosis through regulations of p38 and Akt pathways. Pre-treatment of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) with minocycline (10–100 µm) elicited a dose-dependent reduction of glutamate excitotoxicity and blocked glutamate-induced nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentations. Using patch-clamping and fluorescence Ca2+ imaging techniques, it was found that minocycline neither blocked NMDA receptors, nor reduced glutamate-caused rises in intracellular Ca2+. Instead, confirmed by immunoblots, minocycline in vivo and in vitro was shown to directly inhibit the activation of p38 caused by glutamate. A p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, also attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of minocycline were blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, while pharmacologic inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) attenuated glutamate-induced apoptosis. In addition, immunoblots revealed that minocycline reversed the suppression of phosphorylated Akt and GSK3β caused by glutamate, as were abolished by PI3-K inhibitors. These results demonstrate that minocycline prevents glutamate-induced apoptosis in CGNs by directly inhibiting p38 activity and maintaining the activation of PI3-K/Akt pathway, which offers a novel modality as to how the drug exerts protective effects.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Glutathione prevents N -methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated neurotoxicityNeuroreport,  1991N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) antagonists afford possible therapeutic modalities for stroke, trauma,... more N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) antagonists afford possible therapeutic modalities for stroke, trauma, and various neurodegenerative conditions thought to be mediated by excessive stimulation of NMDA receptors in the brain. To date, however, no drug has been demonstrated to be a safe NMDA antagonist at a dosage necessary for neuroprotection. In the present study, we use an in-vitro preparation to show that glutathione is capable of attenuating neuronal damage mediated by NMDA receptor activation. Both oxidized and reduced glutathione are protective, and an extracellular mechanism of action on the NMDA receptor-channel complex is suggested.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The invention of the patch-clamp recording technique has enabled the characterization of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of single channels. Rapid progress in the development of molecular biology techniques and their application to ion channel research led to the cloning, in the 1980s, of genes encoding all major classes of voltage- and ligand-gated ionic channels. It has become clear that operationally defined channel types represent extended families of ionic channels. Several experimental approaches have been developed to test whether there is a correlation between the detection of particular ion channel subunit mRNAs and the electrophysiological response to a pharmacological or electrical stimulus in a cell. In one method, whole-cell patch-clamp recording is performed on a cell in culture or tissue-slice preparation. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of the ionic channels of interest are characterized and the cytoplasmic contents of the recorded cell are then harvested into the patch pipette. In a variant of this method, the physiological properties of a cell are characterized with a two-electrode voltage clamp and, following the recording, the entire cell is harvested for its RNA. In both methods, the RNA from a single cell is reverse-transcribed into cDNA by a reverse transcriptase and subsequently amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, i.e. by the so-called single-cell/reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction method (SC-RT-PCR). This review presents an analysis of the results of work obtained by using a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recording or two-electrode voltage clamp and SC-RT-PCR with emphasis on its potential and limitations for quantitative analysis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Activation of NMDA receptor-channels in human retinal Müller glial cells inhibits inward-rectifying potassium currentsVisual Neuroscience,  1996Although it is well known that neurotransmitters mediate neuron-to-neuron communication, it is be... more Although it is well known that neurotransmitters mediate neuron-to-neuron communication, it is becoming clear that neurotransmitters also affect glial cells. However, knowledge of neuron-to-glial signalling is limited. In this study, we examined the effects of the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) on Müller cells, the predominant glia of the retina. Our immunocytochemical studies and immunodetection by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies specific for the NMDAR1 subunit provided evidence for the expression by human Müller cells of this essential component of NMDA receptor-channels. Under conditions in which potassium currents were blocked, NMDA-induced currents could be detected in perforated-patch recordings from cultured and freshly dissociated human Müller cells. These currents were inhibited by competitive and non-competitive blockers of NMDA receptor-channels. Extracellular magnesium reduced the NMDA-activated currents in a voltage-dependent manner. However, despite a partial block by magnesium, Müller cells remained responsive to NMDA at the resting membrane potential. Under assay conditions not blocking K+ currents, exposure of Müller cells to NMDA was associated with an MK-801 sensitive inhibition of the inward-rectifying K+ current (IK(IR)), the largest current of these glia. This inhibitory effect of NMDA appears to be mediated by an influx of calcium since the inhibition of IK(IR) was significantly reduced when calcium was removed from the bathing solution or when the Müller cells contained the calcium chelator, BAPTA. Inhibition of the Müller cell KIR channels by the neurotransmitter glutamate is likely to have significant functional consequences for the retina since these ion channels are involved in K+ homeostasis, which in turn influences neuronal excitability.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Retinal ganglion cells were fluorescently labeled in situ, dissociated from the retina, and maintained in culture. With physiological solutions in the bath and the pipette, depolarizing voltage steps from physiological holding potentials activated Na(+)-(INa), Ca2+ (ICa), and K(+)-currents studied previously in retinal ganglion cells. Here we report on a slowly decaying K+ current, not heretofore reported in rat. With 4-AP, TEA, and Co2+ in the bath, to block IA, IK, and IK(Ca), respectively, a slowly decaying outward current was activated from -80 mV by steps positive to -40 mV. This current was present in 92% of all ganglion cells tested (n = 83). It activated within 10 ms and inactivated with a voltage-independent time constant of about 70 ms at 35 degrees C. Inactivation was voltage-dependent, half-maximal at -55 mV, and almost complete at 0 mV. The current was blocked by internal Cs+ and TEA, or by external application of 1 mM Ba2+, but not by 3 mM extracellular Co2+. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of this current are distinctly different from those of slowly inactivating K+ currents studied in other rat neurons. It was very similar, however, to a slowly inactivating K+ current previously reported in ganglion cells of tiger salamander retina. This last finding indicates conservation of a defined K+ channel type in functionally related cells in both lower vertebrates and mammals.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The molecular basis of the neuroprotective effects is unknown. We wondered whether or not the neuroprotective effect of TCMs might be due to their N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist properties. We used the patch-clamp technique to screen 22 TCM stroke drugs for NMDAR antagonist activity in cultured cortical neurons. The drugs were also screened for their ability to abate NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. Aqueous extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis, Stephania tetrandra, and Salvia miltiorrhiza blocked currents induced by NMDA (200 microM, 10 microM glycine, 0 Mg2+) at a holding potential of -80 mV by 83.45+/-4.34, 38.65+/-7.50, and 52.97+/-1.78%, respectively. The block of the NMDA-evoked currents was voltage-dependent and showed a negative slope conductance reminiscent of Mg2+. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed the presence of 12.5, 2, and 8.7 mM Mg2+ in the extracts of S. baicalensis,S. tetrandra, and S. miltiorrhiza, respectively. None of these extracts blocked NMDA-induced neuronal death. The Uncaria rhynchophylla extract blocked NMDA-evoked currents by 54.98+/-8.61% even at +60 mV and reduced NMDA-induced neuronal death by 59.13+/-3.52%. NMDAR antagonist activity may underlie the neuroprotective effects of this TCM. Some TCM drugs may exert therapeutic effects due to their Mg2+ content.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although the effectiveness and remarkable safety of TCM have been documented after controlled clinical studies, there are several herbal and animal parts that are toxic or difficult to identify. DNA polymorphism-based assays have recently been developed for the identification of herbal medicines. In this approach, small amounts of DNA are amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the reactions products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, sequencing, or hybridization with species-specific probes. With the DNA based identification of TCM materials as an example, chip-based analytical micro devices were developed with the goal of fabricating an integrated device that will enable sample preparation, amplification, and analysis on a single microchip-based device ("lab-on-a-chip"). The application of a silicon-based polymerase chain reaction microreactor and a DNA microarray for the DNA sequence-based identification of toxic medicinal plants is reported here.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We reported here the robust neuroprotection by minocycline against glutamate-induced apoptosis through regulations of p38 and Akt pathways. Pre-treatment of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) with minocycline (10–100 µm) elicited a dose-dependent reduction of glutamate excitotoxicity and blocked glutamate-induced nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentations. Using patch-clamping and fluorescence Ca2+ imaging techniques, it was found that minocycline neither blocked NMDA receptors, nor reduced glutamate-caused rises in intracellular Ca2+. Instead, confirmed by immunoblots, minocycline in vivo and in vitro was shown to directly inhibit the activation of p38 caused by glutamate. A p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, also attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of minocycline were blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, while pharmacologic inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) attenuated glutamate-induced apoptosis. In addition, immunoblots revealed that minocycline reversed the suppression of phosphorylated Akt and GSK3β caused by glutamate, as were abolished by PI3-K inhibitors. These results demonstrate that minocycline prevents glutamate-induced apoptosis in CGNs by directly inhibiting p38 activity and maintaining the activation of PI3-K/Akt pathway, which offers a novel modality as to how the drug exerts protective effects.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
