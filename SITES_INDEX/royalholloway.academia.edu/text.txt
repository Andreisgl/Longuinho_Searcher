In recent years this has been exemplified by the movement for agile methods. This paper seeks to bring some theoretical underpinning to this discourse by drawing upon the literature of “improvisation”, extensively explored in organization science. We relate this discussion to an example of a large scale system development effort undertaken “in the wild ” – the ongoing construction of a particle physics grid in the UK (GridPP), itself part of the world’s largest grid, the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) Computing Grid. Our findings show that a combination of top-down coordination and bottom-up innovation is at work in this domain. Limited defined system development methodology is explicitly employed in the project, and homegown methods and ad hoc activities seem to dominate the day-to-day practices of system development. We also find that this way of working is embedded in, and dr...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We investigate the performativity of social media in generating innovative sociomaterial practices of an NGO campaign, embedded in a context where civil society is under-developed and politically restricted. We propose a situated perspective of technological affordances, and through the collective action model, explicitly take into account the enactment of, and potential changes to, institutional arrangements. Such an approach moves beyond the individual level of analysis both in ICT affordance studies and the institutional entrepreneurship, and considers technological affordances as relational to human agency, as well as institutional constraints and opportunities. The paper generates theoretical and practical implications in understanding the role of social media in social transformation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The time-sensitive nature of food delivery service and the spatial distribution of a large number of delivery workers require intensive algorithmic coordination and control. In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative study conducted in Beijing with food-delivery platform workers and managers. By taking a critical, sociomaterial perspective, the study shows how the workers are tethered to and simultaneously co-construct multiple spatiotemporalities in their daily work to meet the demand of speed defined by platform algorithms. We further argue that the algorithms are not creating so-called “atomized” workers in the gig economy, but interconnected and co-dependent collective agencies in space and time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There is therefore an increased interest to take this concept to address today’s global collaboration challenges and it is now believed that organizations can play a critical role in nurturing such communities. Despite this, limited research carried out to date has investigated how VCoP can be cultivated to support distributed collaborative work, particularly within widely distributed and global software development contexts. This paper contributes to this area of research, by adopting the creolization framework, drawing upon the case of the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider computing Grid (WLCG) from the highly distributed and collaborative particle physics community.

Digital social innovation: An overview and research frameworkInformation Systems Journal,  2021Digital social innovation (DSI) involves the use of digital technologies in the development and i... more Digital social innovation (DSI) involves the use of digital technologies in the development and implementation of innovative products, services, processes and business models that seek to improve the well-being and agency of socially disadvantaged groups or address social problems related to marginality, inequality and social exclusion (Qureshi, Pan, &amp; Zheng, 2017; Shalini et al., 2021). Often, DSI is less about technological innovation and more about social innovation—a process of finding innovative, effective and sustainable solutions to pressing societal challenges, such as those listed in sustainable development goals (SDGs). Thus, technology can be anywhere in the range of simple WhatsApp enabled groups (Parthiban et al., 2021; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020) and advanced blockchain-enabled supply chain (Hota et al., 2021), but its deployment is innovative in tackling wicked social problems, such as poverty, inequality, social exclusion, marginalisation and poor healthcare access (Bhatt et al., 2021; Escobedo et al., 2021; Hota &amp; Mitra, 2021; Jha et al., 2016; Leong et al., 2016; Qureshi et al., 2018). The DSI initiatives can be led by social entrepreneurs, government agencies, charities, trust, nongovernment organisations (NGOs), cooperatives or corporations under their corporate social responsibilities. However, given the scope and scale of SDGs, such initiatives more likely involve cross-sector partnerships and multiple stakeholders. Various international agencies envisage the role of DSIs in achieving SDGs in three principal ways: providing access to information for example, commodity prices and weather information to the small landholding farmers; providing access to services to marginalised communities for example, education, health and financial services; and measuring and monitoring the SDGs progress for example, evidence-based, real-time measurements (UNGA, 2015; United Nation, 2021). The extant research highlights several instances of DSI, even though the term itself is not used often. For example, a social enterprise in India used a simple battery-operated portable projector to disseminate locally embedded farming best practices (Qureshi et al., 2018). In this special issue, Ravishankar (2021) highlights how a financial intermediary, Rang De, leveraged a digital platform to provide small loans to marginalised farmers. Hota et al. (2021) studied Ethitrade, a social intermediary, which uses advanced block chain technology to provide better prices to rural farmers by establishing provenance. DSI is, therefore, a current and important topic and a promising research area for information systems (IS) and management researchers. Thus, DSI holds tremendous promise at the conceptual, practical and pragmatic levels in addressing social issues and achieving SDGs; however, we have only recently started developing a theoretical understanding of this complex and fast-emerging phenomenon. As of now, this stream of research mostly focuses on issues around accessing information and services but has paid scant attention to issues related to measuring and monitoring SDGs progress (see Table 2). Also, research on ethical dilemmas inherent in engaging with marginalised communities and negotiating various ways power manifests in these contexts has been lacking. This editorial provides a research framework to highlight various stimulating research directions and theoretical lenses to explore them.

The chapter presents Creolization as a set of interrelated processes operating at the conceptual levels of the individual, organization, inter-organizational and the national, that enable cross-cultural collaboration to take place. The interrelated processes are briefly, identity multiplicity, cultural hybridity, mutual sensemaking and network expansion. Once the origin of Creolization is discussed and justified, an analysis of the case study company is undertaken demonstrating how it is able to achieve effective cross-cultural collaboration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
