After publishing his first novel, Odditorium, Broun underwent a spinal surgery that saved his life but left him permanently paralyzed from the neck down. By blowing through a tube connected to a specially outfitted keyboard, Broun was able to complete his second novel, Inner Tube, and write the short stories of Cardinal Numbers. He was at work on a third novel when he died at age thirty-seven in 1987.view lessBooks by Hob BrounView MoreSkip carouselcarousel previouscarousel nextCardinal Numbers: StoriesAuthor Odditorium: A NovelAuthor Inner Tube: A NovelAuthor LoadingQuick navigationHomeBooksAudiobooksDocuments
