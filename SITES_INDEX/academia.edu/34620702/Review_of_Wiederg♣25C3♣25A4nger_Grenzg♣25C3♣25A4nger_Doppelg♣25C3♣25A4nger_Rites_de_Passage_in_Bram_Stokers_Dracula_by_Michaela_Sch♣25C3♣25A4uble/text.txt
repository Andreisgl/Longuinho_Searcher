However, whilst remaining fixed on the page, he has evolved almost beyond recognition in its adaptations on stage and screen. This paper aims to look at the ways the immortal Count has changed not just across mediums but because of the inherent nature of those mediums themselves. Some of these changes have been so dramatic and so fundamental to his nature that the Vampire King we see today is virtually unrecognisable to the one created by Stoker over a hundred years ago. From his initial transfer from the page and first appearance in the early stage productions of Hamilton Dean and his first tentative steps in front of the camera of F.W. Murnau and up to the present day not only the look but the inherent nature of Dracula has been transformed. So much so that it can be argued that it is not the vampire that feeds and evolves to suit the times3 but rather the times or the medium of translation that feed off and shape the vampire. Film, which has been variously identified as one of the dominant languages of the twentieth century, more than any other medium can be seen to have transposed its own nature upon the revenant making it dependent upon, not just the play of shadows and reflections, but upon the very nature of light itself. Further the demands of sound and ever increasing intricacies of CGI (Computer Generated Images) make the contemporary vampire both super and supra-natural in being not just more than human but also an entirely separate evolutionary species. Interestingly within this wider development of the vampire, the Count himself retains a distinct and discrete persona, so that while his kith and kin have changed their kind from figures of abjection and abhor ration to ones of aspiration and human becoming, 4 the Dark Lord retains the sinister Otherness and liminality that made him so mesmerising to audiences in the late 19th Century.Download Free PDFView PDFCount Dracula versus Abraham Van Helsing through the Looking Glass: A Tour de Force Narasingha P SilCount Dracula versus Abraham Van Helsing through the Looking Glass: A Tour de Force Abstract Bram Stoker’s Gothic ghost story, a common enough popular tale of terror, has been subjected to a mammoth hermeneutical enterprise that encompasses almost all kinds of interpretive strategies and theorizing—gender and feminist studies, Freudian heterosexual, homosexual, and postmodernist queer perspectives, postcolonial readings, and also Christian theological exegeses— whereby the monster of Carpathian folklore is engulfed under a new mythos. This paper interrogates this unrelenting hermeneutical overriding of Stoker’s text and seeks to salvage the story’s didactic intent and content by glossing the text and cleansing it of its politically or ideologically charged hermeneutical encrustation. This paper presumes Dracula’s author to be innocent and/or unconscious of the need to purvey any muted or overt agenda other than the book’s commercial success.Download Free PDFView PDFBram Stoker’s Dracula: A Century of Publication and Critical Responseyvonne  garrettDracula’s place within the literary culture of the 1890s is as problematic and at times as contradictory as its text. The novel presents the allure of the forbidden – a surrender to pleasure, sexual ambiguity, superstition, seduction by the foreign or decadent “other” – only to assert suppression of the forbidden by traditional Victorian masculine morality. However, the victory of that morality is never final: the death of the Count cannot undo the transgressions he has enacted or those enacted by the other characters in response. The novel’s uneasy movement between competing states of being, its different layers of romance and horror, the sexual elements of the plot and its perceived commentaries upon gender, race, and empire, are a part of the appeal to both readers and critics alike. Certainly, the novel’s longevity can be connected directly to the varied receptions and the myriad layers of possible personal and critical interpretation.Download Free PDFView PDFOld Masters in New Interpretations : Readings in Literature and Visual CultureBram Stoker's Dracula : The Master of Terror and His Impact on Popular Culture2016 • Olivier HarendaThe article examines how the figure of Dracula became the driving force of changes within the Gothic convention of the 20th century, how exactly the character became re-invented throughout the decades in the field of cinema, and what influences these transformations have on the present culture. The paper focuses on the origins of the Dracula novel and its main antagonist by presenting the major traditional and literary influences which led to the creation of the titular villain. Next, the character is juxtaposed with its Gothic predecessors along with the imaginings of vampires in local folklore beliefs. Finally, the article presents cinematic trends of adapting the vampire figure for the silver screen. The comparative analysis aims to show that 1) the character of Dracula derives from the classical canon of the Gothic fiction and 2) his uniqueness and embodiment of all stereotypical traits has a major influence on the creation and re-invention of vampires in modern popular culture.Download Free PDFView PDFDRACULA Part 2Norbert  SpehnerDownload Free PDFView PDFWbnqjsft; Nzuit! boe!

Incorporating recent advances in evolutionary social science, I offer a biocultural reading of Dracula to account for the novel’s impact and resilience. Dracula connected squarely with late-Victorian anxieties, but the novel also appeals to trans-historical adaptive dispositions. I analyze Stoker’s use of narrative strategies to grab and sustain attention, and Count Dracula as a supercharged predator, a counterintuitive monster well-designed to engage attention and spark the imagination.Download Free PDFView PDF"In Search of Dracula's Oracular History," in Dracula: An International Perspective (Palgrave Gothic), ed.
