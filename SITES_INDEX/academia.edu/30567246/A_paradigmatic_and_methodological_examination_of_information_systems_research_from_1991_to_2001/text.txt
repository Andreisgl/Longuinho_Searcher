Although many schools of thought have emerged and even become well established, few historical analyses of research paradigms and methodologies have been undertaken. One of the rare exceptions is . Yet, the IS research community has evolved substantially since 1991 in many aspects. A variety of journal outlets have emerged and become well established.

Therefore, it should be an opportune time for the field to ask: 'What changes are manifested in journal publications?' 'Is the field making progress regarding pluralism in IS research?'
