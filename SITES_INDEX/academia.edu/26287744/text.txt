Within this framework, relative sub-genres, such as hilarodia, magodia, simodia and lysiodia are discussed. In the present second part, the literary sources for all the aforementioned sub-genres are examined, as the archaeological evidence has already been dealt with in the first part. The general conclusion is that not only lyric mime (in the framework of which the solo performance was significant) existed in Antiquity, but also that, from the fourth century BC onwards, a large variety of entertainment genres developed, similar to those encountered in the modern music hall and cabaret performance.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMousike and Mimesis: Aspects of Western Greek Musical Culture, in H.L.

This paper offers a new appraisal of the invective poetics of by taking a musicological and sociological approach, that is, by attending to the musical as well as the sexual dimensions of the epithet, and by reading it within the socio-musical context of Archaic Mytilene and Archaic and Classical Greece more widely. It is argued that the motivation and impact of the " dildo-receiving strings " evoked in the fragment are best appreciated in terms of the prestige of musical culture in Archaic Mytilene, society, sexually framed musical invective would have had a powerful effect, with political, social, and moral implications that went beyond the musical and the sexual. The paper concludes with a hypothesis about the origin of the tradition, reported in the Suda Keywords Timothy Power 1 Lyric Indecorum in Archaic Mytilene (and Beyond): Sappho F 99 c.

Despite it being difficult to ascertain whether specific spaces were intended for the performance of music and dance through archaeological records, the essays featured in this book raise the notion that particular architectural features might have facilitated music and dance performances. Contributing authors were asked to address music and dance which took place not only in dedicated musical settings and dance floors in purpose-built spaces in the forecourts of the sanctuaries, but also instances of performance along processional streets and around altars and cult statues, as well as on monumental steps and in dining rooms in a sacred context. Together, the papers cover different regions and a broad chronological span. Furthermore, most papers present archaeological material that has either been recently discovered or is published here for the first time. Contents: Angela Bellia, Acknowledgements. Abbreviations.
