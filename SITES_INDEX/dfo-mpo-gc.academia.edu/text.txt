Data gathering and input parameters to construct ecosystem models for the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (mid-1980s)RÉSUMÉ Morissette, L., S.-P. Despatie, C. Savenkoff, M. O. Hammill, H.

Data gathering and input parameters to construct ecosystem models for the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (mid-1980s). Can. Tech. Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 2497: vi+94 p. In the present study, we use Ecopath and inverse methods to reconstruct trophic flows through the whole northern Gulf of St. Lawrence ecosystem (NAFO zones 4RS) for the mid1980s period, prior to the groundfish stock collapses. This was a period of relatively constant biomass for the major species. The whole-system model of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence is divided into 32 functional groups or compartments from phytoplankton and detritus to marine mammals and seabirds, including harvested species of pelagic, demersal, and benthic domains. We present here details of the input data (biomass, production, consumption, export, and diet composition) for each compartment used for modelling.

To better understand the trophic implications of the surging redfish biomass within the GSL ecosystem, 3,690 stomachs containing food were collected during two periods: one characterised by low redfish abundance (1993–1999) and the other during a period of record abundance (2015–2019). Taxonomical analysis of stomach contents from individuals of different sizes from three subareas of the GSL was carried out to determine diet composition during both periods. Zooplankton represented the main prey category for small redfish (&lt; 20 cm), which was driven by a predation on amphipods, mostly Themisto sp. in North-East Gulf, in the 1990s and on copepods of the genus Calanus in the deep channels and euphausiids in North-West Gulf in the 2010s.

The St. Lawrence estuary, in Eastern Canada, hosted one of these ERI conducted from 2007 to 2012. The estuary is a high biological production area that supports a wide variety of human pressures and activities that might impact its integrity and sustainable use. Based on planning workshops that involved scientists as well as the main relevant managers of the region, two common priority issues were identified for the implementation of this ERI : (i) for...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A Rare Case of Completely Ambicoloured Atlantic Halibut, <em>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</em>, from the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, QuebecThe Canadian Field-Naturalist,  2007An Atlantic Halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) (41.4 cm fork length) with the same pigmentation ... more An Atlantic Halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) (41.4 cm fork length) with the same pigmentation on the blind side as on the ocular side (ambicoloration) was captured in the lower St. Lawrence estuary, Canada, on 24 June 2004. This specimen represents the most extreme case of ambicoloration published for this species to date. As in other cases of extreme ambicoloration, this specimen shows other signs of abridged metamorphosis and reduced asymmetry, such as incomplete migration of the left eye and a hooked dorsal fin. Studies of hatchery-reared larvae have shown that the most common cause of malpigmentation, including ambicoloration, in halibut is a diet containing inadequate amounts and proportions of essential unsaturated fatty acids shortly before metamorphosis. Even though not expected to be common in the wild, inadequate diet for a short duration before metamorphosis is the most likely cause of ambicolouration in wild halibut.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Whereas it is easy to measure in fishes that remain calm and motionless during the entire digestion period, spontaneous locomotor activity is a frequent problem that leads to overestimation of SDA amplitude and magnitude (area under the curve, bound by the standard metabolic rate, SMR). Few studies have attempted to remove the effect of fish activity on SDA. A new method, non-parametric quantile regression, is described to estimate SDA even when pronounced circadian activity cycles are present. Data from juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua are used to demonstrate its use and advantages compared with traditional techniques. Software (scripts in the R language) is provided to facilitate its use.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
