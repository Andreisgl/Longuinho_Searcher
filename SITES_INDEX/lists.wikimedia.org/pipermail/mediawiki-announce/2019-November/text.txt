[MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki 1.34.0-rc.1 is ready for testing

I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of MediaWiki 1.34.0-rc.1,
the first second candidate for 1.34.x. Download links at the end of the
e-mail. The tag has been signed and pushed to Git.
Please note that MediaWiki 1.34 no longer supports HHVM, and also the PHP
version requirement has been raised from 7.0.13 in MediaWiki 1.33, to 7.2.9.
This is not a final release and should not be used for production websites.
Known issues are tracked in Phabricator on the release workboard [1].
As always please do try out the release candidate in a test environment and
report any issues that you discover. Please use the #MW-1.34-Release [2] tag
in Phabricator when reporting issues specific to this release.
MediaWiki 1.34.0-rc.1 reverts some deprecations in the Parser code that were
reported for not properly following our deprecation policy.
There is a known and intermittent issue that surfaces itself as "Circular
dependency when creating service!", see T231866 [3] for more information.
If you
experience this issue, please let us know (on the ticket) to get an idea of
how
prevalent it is. It is intended to get this resolved for 1.34.0.
It is expected that MediaWiki 1.34 will become final in the second half of
November 2019.
