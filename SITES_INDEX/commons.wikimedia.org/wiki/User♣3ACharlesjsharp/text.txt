Wildlife portrait photographer from the UK.
April 2022's issue of A Sharp Eye on Wildlife Photography is on Sri Lanka.
The first five previous editions of my free magazine offer 100 wildlife photography tips and promote Wikipedia & Commons.The Read online links take you to a flip book of what I have called "medium quality".You can access downloadable pdf versions by visiting the Sharp Eye on wildlife photography page
My web site is www.sharpphotography.co.uk which takes you to images on Flickr. The latest edits and highest resolutions of my images are always here on Commons. 
Many of my pictures are taken outside of the UK and the best ones will be in my galleries of favourites,  Featured pictures (427 from 57 countries),  Quality images (3,129) and  Valued images (2,762).Here is a link to my most recent Featured Pictures.The quality of Valued Images may not be great, but are provided as reference images - the best Commons has at the moment.Click an icon for POTY , Wiki Loves Earth 2021  and barnstars etc. Awards

Please feel free to use any of the wildlife photos that I have uploaded here, most of which are used in Wikipedia articles, with attribution Charles J Sharp. Please remember that images uploaded before 2020 may not have been processed with the latest software. I can quickly re-process them for you.
Males are marked ♂ and females ♀These animals were not photographed in zoos, safari parks, rescue centres, butterfly houses, in captivity or in a studio.
Most of the images are geocoded with very precise geocodes (six decimal places). Please do not take account of more than three decimal places.
