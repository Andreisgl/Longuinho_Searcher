It may be, therefore, that they never gave rise to full palatial states. Rather, in regions such as Achaia, local elites may have functioned within less-articulated organizational orders (perhaps chiefdoms), which did not require the centralization of economic activities. These polities existed alongside the more complex palatial states, but it is not necessary to posit that they were subjected to or dependent on the palaces economically or politically, although their opportunities may have been constricted by the presence of the larger power. After the collapse of the palatial system around 1200 b.c., some of these smaller polities seem to have flourished in the LH IIIC period.Download Free PDFView PDF(2018) "Από την «Kοινή» στο «Kενό»; / From “Koine” to “Void”?

I demonstrate that it contains certain internal inconsistencies, and present material and literary evidence that contradict the validity of the model. I then introduce and discuss archaeological data in order to substantiate my claim that the model has prevented us from appreciating two important aspects of the post-palatial period and the Early Iron Age, namely the diversity in local or regional responses to the collapse of the palatial societies in both the short and the long term, and the considerable degree of continuity in socio-economic complexity and socio-politicalstructures in certain regions."Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
