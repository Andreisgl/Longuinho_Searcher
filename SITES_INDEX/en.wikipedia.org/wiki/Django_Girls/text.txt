Django Girls is an international non-profit organization started by two Polish women, Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka,[1] to inspire women from all backgrounds[2] to get interested in technology and to become programmers,[3] offering a safe and friendly environment.[4][5] It is known for the free workshops it hosts to help women to learn to program[6] and for its Django tutorial.[7] It is often supported by the Python Software Foundation,[8] and they often hold sessions at the Python Conference.[9]
History[edit]
The first Django Girls workshop, which kicked off Django Girls, happened during EuroPython 2014, in Berlin.[10]  Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka decided to use Django and Python because both are open source code platforms, which may help women developing their own ideas.[11] Since then, the initiative has spread worldwide,[12] reaching countries like Argentina,[13][14] Australia,[15] Bolivia,[16] Brazil,[17] Colombia,[18] Ecuador,[19][20][21] Ghana,[22] Nigeria,[23][24] United Kingdom,[4] Peru,[25][26] United States,[27][2] Zimbabwe[28][29] and many others.
Tutorial[edit]
The tutorial, which teaches how to create and deploy a blog application using Django, is maintained and updated by the Django Girls community, using  Github. As of May 2018, the Django Girls tutorial has been published online in 14 languages[30] besides its original English version. As of May 2018, more than 1,000,000 users have visited its website.[31]
Django Girls workshops[edit]
Using a manual provided by the organization,[4][11] Django Girls volunteers offer free[32] one[33] or two days workshops in many cities of the world, usually held during weekends.[2] It is aimed at complete beginners, teaching about HTML, CSS, Python and Django.[34] As of May 2018, 414 cities across 90 countries[35] have hosted Django Girls workshops, with Accra,[22] Athens,[36] Florence,[37] Kathmandu,[38] Lagos,[39] Lahore,[40] Oxford,[41] and São José dos Campos[42] among them. As of May 2018, over 14,000 women have attended Django Girls workshops held across the globe.[citation needed]
