She’s written hundreds of books in her head before going to sleep at night; this is just the first one she remembered well enough to write down. Bellows was raised between Los Angeles and Denman Island, BC, where she started writing because she had no friends her age to spend time with, other than a few fairies who lived in the trees, and an otter that she tried to convince her parents to let her keep in the bathtub. Ava Bellows lives in Los Angeles with her dog, Sally, but sometimes she pretends she lives with Lorde, Florence Pugh, Molly Baz, Stevie Nicks and Zoe Kravitz, just because it’s fun to imagine what that life would look like.view lessBooks by Ava BellowsView MoreSkip carouselcarousel previouscarousel nextAll I Stole From You: A NovelAuthor Audiobooks by Ava BellowsView MoreSkip carouselcarousel previouscarousel nextAll I Stole From You: A NovelAuthor LoadingQuick navigationHomeBooksAudiobooksDocuments
