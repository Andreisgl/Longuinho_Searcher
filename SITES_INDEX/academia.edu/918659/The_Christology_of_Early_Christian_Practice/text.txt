" There are nevertheless trajectories from early conceptions to later confessions, and I do not want to convey the idea of early conceptions as "protochristologies" in the sense of being somehow insufficient or by necessity temporary in comparison with later developments.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Biblical LiteratureRethinking Early Jewish—Christian Relations: Matthean Community History as Pharisaic Intragroup Conflict, JBL, Runesson2008 • Anders RunessonDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical LiteratureThe Messiah is “the Holy One”: ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ θεοῦ as a Messianic Title in Mark 1:24, JBL 136.2 (2017): 417-332017 • Max BotnerThe christological title ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ θεοῦ (“the Holy One of God”) appears a total of three times in the New Testament (Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; John 6:69), and is unattested in other Jewish and Christian literature. While scholars offer a wide range of proposals concerning the background and significance of this title, no one has demonstrated the possibility of a link with messianic traditions. This article fills this lacuna in two ways. First, I examine four texts (Ps 88:19 LXX; LAB 59:2; Pss 152, 153) that explicitly refer to the anointed David as God’s “holy one,” and two additional sources that indicate awareness of the archaic tradition that the oil used to anoint Israel’s kings was holy (Ps 89:21 [88:21]; 11QPsa XXVIII, 11; Josephus, Ant. 6.157). Second, I explore how the underlying logical connection between “messiah” and “holy one” within these texts illuminates certain features of Mark’s Gospel: (1) Jesus’s baptism as messianic anointing and his ensuing wilderness temptation (Mark 1:9–13), (2) the logical connection between the baptism-temptation sequence (1:9–13) and Jesus’s first act of public ministry (1:21–28), and (3) the exorcistic connotations surrounding the “son of David” title.Download Free PDFView PDFMatthew's Titulus and Psalm 2's King on Mount Zion_JBL 133Tucker FerdaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical Literature"'I Will Set His Hand to the Sea': Psalm 88:26 LXX and Christology in Mark"2014 • Stephen YoungA recent trend in NT scholarship is to see Jesus’ participation in actions or attributes allegedly reserved for God as indications that a writer depicts Jesus as divine. One set of texts to which such an argument has been applied is that in which Jesus exercises authority over the seas (Mark 4:35–41; 6:45–52). Our study uses the portrayal of the idealized Davidic king in Ps 88:26 as one whose “hand is set to the sea” to call this specific argument into question. In the psalm, the human king participates in God’s rule over the sea without being represented as God. Ancillary support for the plausibility of a human ruling the waters comes from (1) other Judean stories of people exercising control over waters, (2) the coherence of Ps 88 with the manner Jesus is depicted more broadly in Mark, and (3) evidence that other early readers of Judean ("Jewish") scripture interpreted Psalm 88’s language about the Davidic king eschatologically.Download Free PDFView PDFReconfiguring the Akedah and Recasting God: Lament and Divine Abandonment in MarkMatthew RindgeDownload Free PDFView PDFDiscerning Trajectories: 4QInstruction and the Sapiential Background of the Sayings Source QMatthew GoffDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical LiteratureCannibalistic Language in the Fourth Gospel and Greco-Roman Polemics of Factionalism (John 6: 52-66)2008 • J.

I assume that Luke has access not only to oral and written resurrection narratives but also to a collection of the Pauline Epistles and that Luke frames Lukan narrative as the result of the scriptural practices of one second-century textual community, among others. In mapping both divergences and convergences between Lukan understandings of resurrection and views often attributed to Marcionites and/or so-called docetists, I challenge the view that Luke’s assertions of fleshly resurrection represent (proto)orthodoxy’s incipient battle with heresy over the nature of the resurrection of Jesus.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Man with the Flow of Power: Porous Bodies in Mark 5:25-34, Journal of Biblical Literature 129:3 (2010): 507-519Candida  MossDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical Literature no. 126 pp. 361-381The Label Xristiano/j: 1 Pet 4.16 and the Formation of Christian Identity2007 • David HorrellDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
