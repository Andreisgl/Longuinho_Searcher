In order to locate their sources, characterize their mode, and determine atmospheric transport levels, airflow back trajectories were calculated using the branching atmospheric trajectory (BAT) model for two layers (300-2000 and 1500-3000 m) in conjunction with the synoptic situations prevailing during these dust outbreak events. It is shown that transport of Saharan dust occurring in the central part of the Mediterranean is usually rather intensive in the atmospheric mass-loading capacity and takes place in deeper atmospheric layers for a longer duration (approximately 2-4 days) than eastern Mediterranean dust events. The eastern transport usually originates from the Arabian Desert for short periods (approximately 1 day) and is restricted to a rather shallow atmospheric transport layer featured by low optical depth values.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Improving Environmental Projections in Nonboreal Eastern Europe: Regional Aspects of Climate-Terrestrial-Hydrologic Interactions in Non-boreal Eastern Europe; Odessa, Ukraine, 23-28 August 2008by Sergiy Ivanov and Garik GutmanEos, Transactions American Geophysical Union,  2009ABSTRACT Ecosystems in Eastern Europe, in particular environments such as grasslands and semiarid... more ABSTRACT Ecosystems in Eastern Europe, in particular environments such as grasslands and semiarid regions, have undergone significant changes during the entire twentieth century due to warming climate and socioeconomic impacts. As a result, the biome boundaries between forests and steppes and between steppes and semideserts have become increasingly volatile, with dramatic changes in phenology and land fertility. Compounding these problems is a dense rural population engaging in intense land use, a population that suffers socioeconomic hardships resulting from recent and still unsettled political changes. Such political problems combined with a lack of local funds have limited the amount of observational data collected in Eastern Europe, leaving climate modelers unable to validate regional climate projections.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Earth observation capacity building activities - The Czech Republic case study2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,  2012ABSTRACT Since the Czech Republic joined ESA in 2008, the Charles University in Prague, the Scien... more ABSTRACT Since the Czech Republic joined ESA in 2008, the Charles University in Prague, the Scientica Agency, the Czech Space Office and the European Space Agency (ESA) have started several joint activities for the promotion of EO techniques and applications, in order to create awareness and build up capacity and skills for the use of remote sensing in the country. Main activities are focused on the education of young generations, who should become from their early age naturally familiar with EO/GIS tools and data in order to be eager to use them later in their own research or in their profession, whenever making use of geoinformation. Capacity building activities have been oriented on the cooperation with the potential users of EO data and technologies as well, e.g. institutions of nature protection, public administration services. Several joint quick-win projects have been carried out for implementing EO into the decision-making processes at these institutions. Quick-win projects have been based on the close cooperation between EO experts and public servants in the Czech Republic.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Automated Monitoring of Snow Cover over North America with Multispectral Satellite DataJournal of Applied Meteorology,  Nov 1, 2000Current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational global- and continenta... more Current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational global- and continental-scale snow cover maps are produced interactively by visual analysis of satellite imagery. This snow product is subjective, and its preparation requires a substantial daily human effort. The primary objective of the current study was to develop an automated system that could provide NOAA analysts with a first-guess snow cover map and thus to reduce the human labor in the daily snow cover analysis. The proposed system uses a combination of observations in the visible, midinfrared, and infrared made by the Imager instrument aboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and microwave observations of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) aboard the polar-orbiting Defense Meteorological Satellite Program platform. The devised technique was applied to satellite data for mapping snow cover for the North American continent during the winter season of 1998/99. To assess the system performance, the automatically produced snow maps were compared with the NOAA interactive operational product and were validated against in situ land surface observations. Validation tests revealed that in 85% of cases the automated snow maps fit exactly the ground snow cover reports. Snow identification with the combination of GOES and SSM/I observations was found to be more efficient than the one based solely on satellite microwave data. Comparisons between the automated maps and the NOAA operational product have shown their good agreement in the distribution of snow cover and its area coverage. The accuracy of the automated product was found to be similar to and sometimes higher than the accuracy of the operational snow cover maps manually produced at NOAA.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The enhanced NOAA global land dataset from the advanced very high resolution radiometerBulletin of the American Meteorological Society,  1995Global mapped data of reflected radiation in the visible (0.63 m) and near-infrared (0.85 m) wave... more Global mapped data of reflected radiation in the visible (0.63 m) and near-infrared (0.85 m) wavebands of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites have been collected as the global vegetation index (GVI) dataset since 1982. Its primary objective has been vegetation studies (hence its title) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from the visible and near-IR data. The second-generation GVI, which started in April 1985, has also included brightness temperatures in the thermal IR (11 and 12,um) and the associated observation-illumination geometry. This multiyear, multispectral, multisatellite dataset is a unique tool for global land studies. At the same time, it raises challenging remote sensing and data management problems with respect to uniformity in time, enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio, retrieval of geophysical parameters from satellite radiances, and large data volumes. The authors explored a four-level generic structure for processing AVHRR data-the first two levels being remote sensing oriented and the other two directed at environmental studies-and will describe the present status of each level. The uniformity of GVI data was improved by applying an updated calibration, and noise was reduced by applying a more accurate cloud-screening procedure. In addition to the enhanced weekly data (recalibrated with appended quality/cloud flags), the available land environmental products include monthly 0.15°-resolution global maps of top-of-the-atmosphere visible and near-IR reflectances, NDVI, brightness temperatures, and a precipitable water index for April 1985-September 1994. For the first time, a 5-yr monthly climatology (means and standard deviations) of each quantity was produced. These products show strong potential for detecting and analyzing large-scale spatial and seasonal land variability. The data can also be used for educational purposes to illustrate the annual global dynamics of vegetation cover, albedo, temperature, and water vapor. Development of the GVI data product contributes to the activities of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment and, in particular, to the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project. Monthly standardized anomalies of the GVI variables have been calculated for April 1985-present and are routinely produced on UNIX workstations thus providing a prototype land monitoring system. Standardized anomalies clearly indicate that strong signals at the land surface, such as droughts and floods and their teleconnections with such global environmental phenomena as El Niño-Southern Oscillation, can be detected and analyzed. The monitoring of relatively small year-to-year variability is, however, contingent on the removal of residual trends/noise in GVI data, which are of the order of the analyzed effects.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A new method for achieving accurate thickness control for uniform and graded multilayer coatings on large flat substratesMultilayer and Grazing Incidence X Ray Euv Optics For Astronomy and Projection Lithography,  1993High performance in normal incidence soft X-ray optical systems requires accurate control of the ... more High performance in normal incidence soft X-ray optical systems requires accurate control of the d-spacing across the surface of each mirror in the system. As a first step towards being able to fabricate any desired d-spacing variation, we demonstrate the ability to produce large (25 x 150 mm) flat Mo/Si multilayer coated mirrors with a d-spacing uniformity of +/- 0.4 percent. Instead of applying the approach most often taken to minimize the d-spacing variation physical shielding of the deposition source, we use a mask with a corrected profile positioned just in front of the rotating substrate to compensate for the nonuniform deposition flux. Results obtained from hard (lambda = 0.154 nm) and soft (wavelength of interest) X-ray mapping of the surface are presented along with a discussion of the technique used to control the d-spacing distribution.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
