The papers in this panel explore the many ways in which mobile and social media reshape identities, community participation and transnational relationships. Based on in-depth studies, each paper examines the consequences of digital communication technology use in Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia. Bernice Loh's paper investigates the influential role played by watching videos on YouTube in shaping the adultification of tween girls' dressing in Singapore. Earvin Cabalquinto unpacks the contradictory experiences triggered by mobile media use among the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines in sustaining long-distance relationships.

In a networked society, these enhanced digital technologies afford various 'mobile capacities' (Urry, 2007) such as corporeal and imagined, enabling the organisation and maintenance of social relations at a distance. This paper explores the ways in which selected advertisements of Globe Telecom, one of the largest telecommunications firms in the Philippines, manufacture 'social mobility' through the use of smartphones and other broadband-enabled communications platforms. Using textual analysis as method of investigation, the present study coins the term 'mythic mobilities' to articulate the illusionary representations of mobile experiences facilitated by mobile device use in various contexts. On the one hand, these creative advertisements often invite and engage its audience to visualise a life filled with progress, stability, comfort, and satisfaction. On the other hand, such narratives elide the different factors such as socioeconomic conditions and infrastructural divide that predominantly engender and constrain a mobile life. It is through the latter point that I underscore the politics of mobility (Cresswell, 2010). I contend that mobile imaginaries presented by selected advertisements reinforce the production and reproduction of asymmetrical mobilities in the age of mobile social computing.), a new research unit at MFJ. His research interests include domestication of digital technologies, transnational communication, mobile and social media, locative media, intimacy at a distance, and asymmetrical mediated mobilities.Save to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  9  Internet Studies, Mobile Media, Advertising, PhilippinesThe Asian Cultural and Media Studies Research Cluster PhD Pre-Conference Workshop Program (With Abstracts)Prior to the 5th Inter-Asia Popular Music Studies Conference in Melbourne (11th – 12th December), Monash Asia Institute (MAI) and Asia Cultural and Media Studies Research Cluster (ACMS) hosted a half day pre-conference workshop for... morePrior to the 5th Inter-Asia Popular Music Studies Conference in Melbourne (11th – 12th December), Monash Asia Institute (MAI) and Asia Cultural and Media Studies Research Cluster (ACMS) hosted a half day pre-conference workshop for current and recently graduated PhD students.CHAIRS:          Dr. Xin Gu (xin.gu@monash.edu) Dr. Earvin Charles Cabalquinto (earvin.cabalquinto@monash.edu )Save to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  5  Asian Studies, Communication, Media Studies, Digital MediaOn Ritualistic (Dis)Connections: Re-imagining the Homeland Through the Lens of Affective MediaSave to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto and +1Estelle Marie  Ladrido•  6  Facebook, Migration Studies, Transnational migration, Philippine StudiesMoving Through Networks: Smartphones, Wi-Fi Networks and the Attitudes of Rail Commuters to the monitoring of their movementWi-Fi enabled smartphones and tablets search for wireless hotspots in their immediate vicinity.

This capacity can be used to count the number of devices via installed sensors, and by association, the number of people in a designated space. With sufficient coverage by sensors, the number and flow of people through a space can be mapped. This technical capacity is of potential use in the case of busy public transport systems in major cities where the flow of crowds is central to the commuter experience. However, the ability to monitor commuter movement via Wi-Fi networks and signals tells us nothing about the range of attitudes that exist towards the potential for this mapping and the possible use of the collected data. This paper emerges from an interdisciplinary pilot project investigating the mapping of commuter movement in public transport systems, and is conducted by researchers in the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Engineering, and Art Design and Architecture at Monash University in Melbourne. Train platforms are approached as mutable 'technosocial public spaces' that are sites for simultaneously parallel and divergent commuter experiences, and differing intensities of engagement with mobile media, communications networks and telecommunications infrastructures (Berry & Hamilton 2010). We first discuss the methodological challenges of conducting qualitative research – simple observation and a three-question survey – on a difficult-to-access public railway system run by both a metropolitan train network operator and a customer-focussed statutory authority. We then outline preliminary results from a three question survey of 100 commuters completed at one of Melbourne's busiest train stations, Richmond Station,over a three-day period. According to station staff, Richmond Station hosts anywhere between 20,000 and 100,000 commuters per day. Commuters were asked about their attitudes towards the possible monitoring of their physical movement on train platforms via Wi-Fi enabled mobile devices. The results of the survey suggest that attitudes can be grouped into six categories: (1) in favour; (2) in favour with guarantees; (3) apathetic; (4) confused; (5) sceptical, and; (6) staunchly opposed. This range of views helps us move closer to an understanding of how secure and non-intrusive Wi-Fi network monitoring and data collection practices in public spaces might be enacted and communicated to citizens.Save to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  3  Mobile Media, Railway Transport, Wi-FiPhD Thesis AbstractSave to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  6  Transnationalism, Mobile Media, Social Media, FacebookBook Review of Mobile communication and the family: Asian experiences in technology domesticationSave to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  5  Digital Media, Mobile Technology, Family, Migration Studies" We're not only here but we're there in spirit": Asymmetrical mobile intimacy and the transnational Filipino familyOrganising, performing, and experiencing festive family rituals sustain relationships among family members.

However, in recent times, high levels of human migration alongside the rapid development of digital communication technologies are reconfiguring family traditions. This paper investigates the ways in which 21 overseas Filipino workers in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile devices and communications platforms to restage festive family rituals. Employing a visual method and drawing on in-depth interviews, the empirical study uncovers the personalised and heterogenous practices of the transnational Filipino family in performing intimacy at a distance, paving the way for constructing copresence during festivities. Importantly, using the mobilities lens (Urry, 2007) as a framework for critical investigation, the findings show that a disproportionate level of network capital as informed by age, gender, and social class produces " asymmetrical mobile intimacy. " The present study also reveals how ambivalent feelings emerge due to technological asymmetries and parameters. Importantly, transnational families often negotiate such contradictory experiences through mobile device use. By comparing and contrasting the mobile practices of dispersed family members, the present study uncovers the hidden social inequalities perpetuated in a networked family life.Save to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  5  Philippines, Facebook, Migration Studies, IntimacyHome on the move: negotiating differential domesticity in family life at a distanceThis article examines the ways in which 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile media to re-stage, experience and negotiate home.

Based on deploying in-depth interviews and visual methods, the findings show the reconstruction of a sense of dwelling through mobile devices. This transformation is shaped by the performance of ritualistic practices, gender roles and socioeconomic conditions. The study also uncovers how mediated mobilities are undermined by social structures and uneven technological infrastructures, paving the way for unstable, exclusionary and ambivalent experiences. Hence, members of the transnational Filipino family often negotiate such challenges by deploying various tactics to ensure that ties are maintained. By unravelling the differential and constrained mobile practices of the transnational Filipino family in forging a sense of at-homeness, the article attends to a critical conception of domesticity in the age of smartphones and mobile phone applications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  5  Mobile Media, Philippines, Facebook, Migration StudiesBook Review of 'Smartphones as locative media'Save to LibraryDownloadby Earvin Charles Cabalquinto•  6  Mobility/Mobilities, Mobile Technology, Wi-Fi, SmartphonesAsiaPacific@RMIT Seminar Series: Rethinking mediated Im/mobilities.

Further, I unpack the communicative strategies deployed by the members of the transnational Filipino family to cope with the obstacles in sustaining family life across borders and distances. Bio: Earvin Charles Cabalquinto is a Lecturer in the School of Media, Film and Journalism at Monash University. His research examines the role of mobile devices and networked communications platforms in the organisation of family life at a distance through a mobilities lens. His research interests include transnational communication, mediated intimacies, caregiving at a distance, mediation of family rituals, the digitalisation of public and private spaces, and the politics of mediated mobilities.The seminar is a brown bag lunch event.

I specifically pointed out the role of visual communication – the use of camera phone images – in mediating intimate interactions and a sense of co-presence. I also emphasised the different factors – socio-cultural and socioeconomic – that mould transnational exchanges. Significantly, tensions in transnational communication were presented and critically analysed.
