 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. 
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.
Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)
  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.
This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

Doing Malaysia proud
      Posted on 13 September 2010 - 06:05pm

MALAYSIANS have high expectations of our athletes who will compete at the 19th Commonwealth Games in New Delhi from Oct 3 to 14. 
In 2001, the three values of humanity, equality and destiny were adopted as the core values of the games. Our nation has competed at these games in the true spirit of sportsmanship and with distinction, since 1950 as Malaya and from 1966 as Malaysia.
While our first medals were won in weightlifting at the 1950 games and on several occasions up to the most recent games in Melbourne in 2006, it is undoubtedly in badminton that Malaysia has been dominant at these games since 1966.
Over the years Malaysia’s medals, besides weightlifting and badminton, have been won in aquatics, athletics, tenpin bowling, boxing, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, lawn bowls, shooting and squash, clearly demonstrating the outstanding prowess of our sportsmen and women in a broad range of sports.
In 1998, Malaysia had the privilege and honour to hold the 16th Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, making it the first Asian country to act as host. That year, Malaysia won the most medals in its history of competing in the games, with 10 gold, 14 silver and 12 bronze. 
It will be our pride and joy to see the Jalur Gemilang raised and the refrain of Negaraku filling the air as our athletes win even more medals in Delhi. Malaysia berjaya!
