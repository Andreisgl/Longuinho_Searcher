This has only been exacerbated by the emergence of controversial alternatives such as shale gas and increasing concerns with notions like carbon leakage and greenwashing. Energy poverty, mainly located in those euro (€) countries suffering from European Central Bank (ECB) bail-outs, has also become a growing social issue. In addition, 'green growth' policies that combine job creation with carbon reduction have encountered multiple challenges and impediments. Cities and towns have found themselves in dilemmas in setting the 'green growth' agenda whilst ensuring the financial and organisational backing to move towards sustainable economic growth.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersGlobal Sustainable City-Regions (2nd #MScGSCGlasgow Edition): Stockholm, Berlin, Kolkata, Masdar, Bengaluru, Malawi, Belfast, Hong Kong, Seoul, Helsinki and GlasgowGlobal Sustainable City-Regions: Changing Social Innovation (Belfast, Berlin, Malawi, Hong Kong, Helsinki & Glasgow) & Transformative Smart Cities (Stockholm, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Masdar & Seoul)(Policy Report) (2017)2017 • Dr Igor Calzada, MBA, FeRSAABSTRACT: This policy report about the 2nd Edition 2016-2017 of the MSC in Global Sustainable Cities, entitled ‘Global Sustainable City-Regions,’ covers the work developed jointly by the lecturer, Dr Igor Calzada, MBA, as the editor of the publication and students/participants of the second edition of the MSc from September to December 2016 at the Institute for Future Cities in the Business Faculty at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow (Scotland – UK). Specifically, this policy report follows a two-sequential-module structure: • The first module, entitled ‘Global Cities: Sustainability and Society,’ consists of six methodological units. • Thereafter, the second module, entitled ‘Public Policy, Governance and Strategic Change in Cities,’ consists of five methodological units. The policy report focuses on three urban global issues in a comparative basis. The MSc was developed in a team-based dynamic by applying qualitative action research methodologies to understand and interpret each case and to benchmark and contrast with other cases that addressed the same global urban issue. The cases were selected jointly by the lecturer and the students/participants in a dynamic process in order to achieve a suitable selection of cases that would allow them to: • arrange groups around one specific global urban issue, • compare cases around the same specific urban issue, and • produce a full case study by applying the two-sequential-module methodology. As a result, the following three global urban issues and seven Global Sustainable City-Region case studies were selected. Each student/participant worked on each of them, as follows: Transformative Smart Cities: Stockholm (Melissa Candel) Kolkata (Dalia Hui) Masdar (Omar Islam) Bengaluru (Seema Issar) Seoul (Nattharucha Piamsawat) Changing Social Innovation: Berlin (Laura Fritsche) Belfast (Laetitia Lucy) Malawi (Akuzike Florence Kamwanja) Hong Kong (Rebecca Seraphine Mueller) Helsinki (Venla Riekkinen) Glasgow (Rhona Morven Sampson) --- The series of editions have been published as follows: Calzada, I.

Why are there blockages to achieving the goal of a sustainable city? How is it possible to overcome the practical difficulties that initiatives often face? And how can an increasingly technocratic focus be rebalanced with more of a public perspective? In this wide-ranging text, Simon Joss examines mainstream policy and practice and looks at the approaches that can overcome some of their drawbacks.Download Free PDFView PDFGoverning Sustainable CitiesALI ALSHAHIBIDownload Free PDFView PDFProblemy EkorozwojuGreen Smart City as a New Paradigm of Local Development2021 • Izabela JanickaThe idea of a smart city is widely discussed in literature but is associated to a lesser extent with the idea of mov-ing towards a green smart city. Authors debate the critique of this type of approach and are of the opinion that climate change forces the construction of green models Like businesses, municipalities must be systematically assessed to identify assistance in terms of specialist advice or financial aid. The aim of this article is to develop the concept of a green smart city model, which may become a new development paradigm for municipalities. The article introduces the term eco-transformation in relation to the evolution of changes in the green smart city idea and proposes a tool to measure the action taken by municipalities in their pursuit of ecological maturity. The proposed models are universal in nature, i.e. they can be used to study other areas of a municipality’s activ-ity. Many areas in the model are debatable and difficult for municipalities to incorporate wi...Download Free PDFView PDFSmart-Eco Cities UK 2016.pdfRobert CowleyDownload Free PDFView PDF'Smart city': a regressive agenda?Simon JossThe history of the smart city may be a brief one, but it has already left an indelible mark on contemporary discourses on urban development and associated innovation practices. Only a couple of decades ago, the term ‘smart city’ was hardly used by scholars, let alone by policy makers and practitioners. Yet, within the last decade or so, the term has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the extent that in the academic literature it has now come close to replacing the concept of ‘sustainable city’ that has dominated urban planning and policy for so long; meanwhile, policy-makers appear to have embraced this new concept wholeheartedly based on its (as yet untested) promise to reinvigorate urban economic growth while improving liveability and environmental performance. The risk of such popular embrace is that the smart city becomes a catch-phrase bereft of much precise conceptual meaning and, thus, susceptible to diverse interpretations and superficial practice. However, a different critical reading of this emergent phenomenon suggests that the popularity of the ‘smart city’ is in no small part due to the successful amalgamation of two powerful conceptual discourses – namely, the prospect of harnessing digital urban innovations for the purpose of urban economic growth and governance reform. In order to investigate this more fully, this paper seeks to analyse the conceptual roots of the ‘smart city’. This acknowledges that, while the focus on applying digital technological systems to urban infrastructure and governance processes arguably lends this concept unique novelty, the ‘smart city’ nevertheless builds on pre-existing concepts. And in at least two important ways, it is argued that the ‘smart city’ represents a somewhat regressive agenda: for one thing, it suggests a return to a more modernist, rational planning tradition centred upon digital technology as standardising process for decision-making; and for another, it indicates a relative retreat from the commitment to urban sustainability, given the dominant focus on economic growth through digital technological innovation.Download Free PDFView PDFSSRN Electronic JournalSustainable Cities: Oxymoron or the Shape of the Future?2000 • Tiona ZuzulDownload Free PDFView PDFSustainability and the 'Successful City': The Case of a European Green Capital2015 • Pierre A HermanInter-urban competition has become a defining feature of city governance. More recently, cities have also become important centres for sustainable action, with the title of ‘green capital’ now a prestigious, sought-after honour. Through an investigation of official policy and interviews with community leaders in the city of Bristol (UK), the motivations behind the city’s bid for the EU’s European Green Capital title become apparent. As the various meanings of sustainability among the governing class in the city are explored, the ‘green capital’ is seen as one vying for a portfolio of ‘talents’ deemed essential by the competitive, ‘successful city’ of the twenty-first century. While green credentials and strengths are vigorously promoted as this investigation demonstrates, they are treated in discourse as conduits to the overarching ends of profile enhancement and economic growth. Appended to the post-political growth-consensus, sustainability becomes not a hoped-for refocus on the environment crisis but an integral element of competitive, entrepreneurial urbanism.Download Free PDFView PDFUrban smartness and sustainaibility in the European UnionGiulio PedriniDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
