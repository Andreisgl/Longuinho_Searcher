Human-driven degradation, such as channel modifications and flood regulation or drainage were intensified in the latest decades and, as a result, diversity and abundance of alien plants have increased in riparian zones throughout the world (Richadrson et al. 2007). However, invasibility of a particular ecosystem is not the only thing to take into account to assess the invasion process: species invasiveness is also of capital importance (Richardson & Pysek 2006). In this work we are looking for relationships among species attributes and their invasion success across several riparian habitats. Our aims are: 1- to analyze the relationship among species traits and the general invasion proce...Download Free PDFView PDFComparison of the effect of herbivore insect guilds on the thistle Cirsium arvense in Europe and North America Neobiota towards a synthesisInés Abela HofbauerováDownload Free PDFView PDFWidespread distribution of an invasive crustacean Artemia franciscana in France: morphological, genetic and morphometric dataRomain ScaloneNew parthenogenetic and sexual populations of Artemia were found along the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. In order to determine the specific status of these populations, we used referential populations of A. franciscana (from USA) and A. salina (from Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt). We present a genetic study using the variability of the developmental caudal gene in these populations (Copf et al. 2003). In addition, morphological investigations of the frontal knob and penis using the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) were conducted to support the molecular data. The usefulness of a third morphological trait (the ratio of spine clusters on the frontal knob) for the Artemia systematics is discussed in the light of a statistical analysis using morphometric traits. This study reveals that all French sexual populations of Artemia belong to the species A. franciscana (Kellog, 1906) and not to A. salina (Linnaeus, 1758) accepted as a sexual native species in Mediterranean area.
