Like Sallaberger 1999, I have also added a few references from the years covered in the previous bibliographical list (in this case, 1994–1997). But unlike the previous lists, the one presented here includes not only publications of tablets and texts, but also studies referring to the Ur III period and the Ur III sources in general. My hope is that the list will be of use both to Assyriologists working with Ur III texts and to scholars interested in the art history and archaeology of the period, as well as those carrying out comparative studies with other periods.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Present and Future of Neo-Sumerian Studies: From the 21st Century BC to the 21st Century AD.

When done, it may be concluded that prisons in early Mesopotamia do not share a one-to-one correspondence with the various manifestations of prisons in the modern Western world. Although prisons in early Mesopotamia functioned in broader ways than modern examples, I argue that significant functional overlap also exists. These similarities directly relate to theoretical and definitional criteria employed in historical discussions about prisons, demonstrating that the Mesopotamian evidence belongs in a world history of prisons.Download Free PDFView PDFBMO 10 (2018) 149-162 (ISBN: 978-84-9168-073-4); Gender and Methodology in the Ancient Near EastFemale Scholars in Mesopotamia?2018 • Natalie Naomi MayDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Barbers of Iri-SagrigAlex KleinermanDownload Free PDFView PDFSusa and Elam.
