To identify the factors influencing audit fees, the stakeholders of 30 auditing firms, members of the Iranian Association of Certified Public Accountants in Tehran selected randomly, were interviewed. Finally, the linear programming model for audit fees and its determinants is defined and sum of squared error is used to solve the function with minimum.
