Recent efforts have focused mainly on computational fluid dynamics based on solution of the Navier-Stokes equations . Three-dimensional modelling using this technique can provide detailed information on indoor airflows but requires costly software and considerable computation. Such a technique is unlikely to be used in the design of the numerous low-cost buildings built in developing countries in humid tropical regions where natural ventilation is often the only means of achieving indoor thermal comfort. The lowspeed indoor airflow in lazy eddy regions away from the main air streams is usually of little value for indoor thermal comfort. Simpler computational methods that restrict airflow information to the main air stream through large openings are generally adequate for basic design purposes . These methods make use of pressure differences and discharge...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of wind engineering and industrial …Calculation of wind-driven cross ventilation in buildings with large openings2006 • James  AxleyDownload Free PDFView PDFTurbulence effects on the discharge coefficient and mean flow rate of wind-driven cross-ventilation2009 • Chia-Ren ChuThis experimental study uses a wind tunnel and scale model to investigate turbulence effects on the discharge coefficient and mean flow rate of wind-driven cross-ventilation. The approaching flows include low turbulence smooth flow and grid-generated turbulent flow. Two different cross-ventilation configurations are considered in this study:(1) two opposite walls, each with one opening, and (2) two adjacent walls, each with one opening. The discharge coefficients of different flow conditions are determined by a fan technique.Download Free PDFView PDFBuildings and EnvironmentWind-driven cross ventilation in long buildings2014 • Chia-Ren ChuThe rule of thumb for effective wind-driven cross ventilation suggests that the building length L should be less than five times of ceiling height H. This study uses a Large Eddy Simulation model to investigate the mechanism behind this rule of thumb. The numerical results reveal that the ventilation rate decreases as the building length increases. This is partly due to the pressure difference between the windward and leeward façades of long buildings (aspect ratio L/H ≥ 2.5) is smaller than that of a short building (L/H = 1.25). The other reason is owing to the internal friction, which can produce a sluggish zone with a low-wind speed inside the building. For buildings with aspect ratio L/H ≥ 5, the ventilation rate will be over-estimated, as much as about 20%, by ventilation models that do not consider the internal resistance. The location of the external openings can also influence the ventilation rate. When the openings are located in the opposite corners of the windward and leeward walls, also due to the internal friction, the ventilation was 15.5% less than that of openings on the centerline of the building. The mitigation effect of internal resistance on the ventilation rate can be quantified by a resistance model.Download Free PDFView PDFThe loss factors of building openings for wind-driven ventilation朱佳仁  老師This study used wind tunnel experiments to determine the loss factors of building openings for wind-driven ventilation. It is found that the loss factor is a function of internal porosity, but independent of Reynolds number. The loss factor of a partially open door increased as the door angle decreased. In addition, the influence of thickness ratio on the loss factor is much smaller than the internal porosity. The present study also derived the relationship between the loss factor and the discharge coefficient used in the orifice equation. The experimental results demonstrate that the ventilation rate of wind-driven cross ventilation can be predicted by a resistance model, once the loss factors of the openings and external pressure coefficients are known. Besides, it was found that the flow resistance of the internal opening dominated the ventilation rate when the external openings are large. But the resistance of external opening is the governing parameter when the external openings are small.Download Free PDFView PDFHow temperature affects the airflow around a single-block isolated buildingFabio Nardecchia, Fabio NardecchiaThis study examines the influence of outdoor phenomena together with temperature changes around an isolated building. Considering different wind velocities, temperature differences and building heights, several numerical CFD simulations were performed to investigate the effect of the temperature on the recirculation zones, for various characteristics of the ambient flow field. In the first part, the temperature effects between undisturbed air and building surface were analyzed together with their impact on the flow field. In the second part it was also taken into consideration the influence of the solar radiation. Finally the study was completed by evaluating how different building geometries can affect the previous scenarios. The results show the importance of the temperature variation for the ventilation around the building and how it modifies, in a significant way, the fluid dynamics close to the building envelope. The correlations found allow to make a proper estimation of the extent of the recirculation regions near the building.Download Free PDFView PDFH1207024660.pdfIOSR Journals publish within 3 daysDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Wind Engineering and Industrial AerodynamicsNatural ventilation in buildings: measurement in a wind tunnel and numerical simulation with large-eddy simulation2003 • Yong JiangDownload Free PDFView PDFProcessesIndoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Analysis of a Two-Sided Windcatcher Integrated with Anti-Short-Circuit Device for Low Wind Conditionspayam nejatWindcatchers are considered as promising passive ventilation and cooling strategy, but the ventilation performance of this system is still of concern in areas with low speed and unpredictable winds. The air short circuiting in windcatchers can reduce its ventilation performance and ability to introduce clean air and remove stale air. The current work aimed to evaluate the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) performance of a two-sided windcatcher fitted with an anti-short-circuit device (ASCD) for improving its performance in low wind speed conditions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed for different ASCD configurations. The CFD method was verified using grid-sensitivity analysis and validated by comparing the simulation results with wind tunnel data. The results indicated that the average difference between CFD results and previous experimentation was below 10%, therefore indicating good agreement.

Reynolds number is explained as the means to determine the relative influence of inertia forces to viscous forces at each point in an airflow. Bernoulli's equation is introduced asa means to evaluate changes in static and dynamic pressures in organised regions of airflow around buildings but not applicable in wake regions. Some common misconceptions on the influence of building shape on overall wind lift forces on buildings are discussed. The dominance of suction forces due to wind is demonstrated by compadng them to positive wind pressures at the same wind speed. Techniques for evaluating aiflow through buildings are discussed including cautions regarding use of CFD on small computers.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
