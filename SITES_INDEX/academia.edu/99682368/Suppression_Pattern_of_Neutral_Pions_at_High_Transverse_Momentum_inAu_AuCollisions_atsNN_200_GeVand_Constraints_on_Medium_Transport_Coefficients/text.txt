LaceyDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CProduction of omega mesons in p + p, d + Au, Cu + Cu, and Au + Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV2011 • Sim SinghThe PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured ω meson production via leptonic and hadronic decay channels in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu, and Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV. The invariant transverse momentum spectra measured in different decay modes give consistent results. Measurements in the hadronic decay channel in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions show that ω production has a suppression pattern at high transverse momentum, similar to that of π0 and η in central collisions, but no suppression is observed in peripheral collisions. The nuclear modification factors, RAA, are consistent in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at similar numbers of participant nucleons.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CProduction ofωmesons inp+p,d+ Au, Cu + Cu, and Au + Au collisions atsNN=200GeV2011 • H.

The data are compared to π0 measurements from the same experiment. For both charged hadrons and neutral pions, the yields per nucleon-nucleon collision are significantly suppressed in central compared to peripheral and nucleon-nucleon collisions. The suppression sets in gradually and increases with increasing centrality of the collisions. Above 4 5 GeV/c in pT , a constant and almost identical suppression of charged hadrons and π0 ’s is observed. The pT spectra are compared to published spectra from Au+Au at √(sNN )=130 in terms of xT scaling. Central and peripheral π0 as well as peripheral charged spectra exhibit the same xT scaling as observed in p+p data.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CDielectron production in Au + Au collisions atsNN=200GeV2016 • Ming X LiuDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review CHigh- p_{T} charged hadron suppression in Au+Au collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=200GeV2004 • A.
