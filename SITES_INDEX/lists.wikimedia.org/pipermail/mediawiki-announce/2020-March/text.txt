[MediaWiki-announce] Security and maintenance release: 1.31.7 /1.33.3 / 1.34.1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.34.1, 1.33.3 and 1.31.7!
These releases also serve as a maintenance release for these branches.
We've noted that these issues are minor, and as such you don't need to
apply them as quickly as with other security releases, if you're unable to
do so. We therefore decided to continue with getting the security (and
maintenance) release out for this quarter as planned, even with the global
situation as is.
While tarballs have already been uploaded, git tags will follow later on
today.
An "MediaWiki Extensions Security Release Supplement" email will follow
this one.
Note that T232932 only applies to 1.34.0. T246602 applies to 1.31.6, 1.33.2
and 1.34.0.
== Security fixes ==
* (T232932) User content can redirect the logout button to different URL.
* (T246602) jquery.makeCollapsible allows applying event handler to any CSS
selector.
