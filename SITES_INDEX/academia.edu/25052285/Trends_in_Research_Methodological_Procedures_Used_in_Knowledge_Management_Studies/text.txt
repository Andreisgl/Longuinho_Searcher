A total of 303 articles published in the Journal of Knowledge Management were critically reviewed and subjected to a descriptive content analysis research approach. Non-empirical studies were on the decline. Positivist epistemologies and quantitative research approaches predominated research in knowledge management (KM). Surveys, case studies and content analysis were the most favoured research approaches. Other major research approaches such as field experiments, ethnography, grounded theory and phenomenology were conspicuous by their absence. Questionnaires and interviews were commonly used for data collection, but the use of more than one research method was not prevalent. Based on the findings, many implications emerge that improve our understanding of research procedures used in KM research. One research method was used in this study. The use of more than one research paradigm and research method may extend our understanding of research in KM. The findings revealed good practices and gaps in using research methods. The results from this article can be used to relook or reanalyse the research methodologies that are used in the KM field. Consequently, it will assist KM researchers in making informed decisions about method selection and deployment in their studies. The study used a broader and systematic multi-stage conceptual framework to comprehensively analyse the research procedures used in the KM field.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMIXED METHODS RESEARCH IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES: AN INVESTIGATION OF TRENDS IN THE LITERATUREPatrick NgulubeMixed methods research (MMR), which is touted as a third methodological movement is increasingly becoming a popular approach in several fields as a result of the promise it holds to providing a better and balanced investigation of research problems in context. In spite of that, there is limited knowledge about its pervasiveness in economic and management sciences in South Africa. Based on a content analysis of 332 articles published in The South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences from 2003 to 2011, the main purpose of this quantitative study is to explore the prevalence of MMR in SAJEMS. Although methodological advances have been made in the field of economic and management sciences as reflected in the articles in SAJEMS, the findings reveal that scholars employ quantitative and qualitative methodologies than MMR. Given the paucity of MMR in the field, this study underscores the potential benefits of embracing methodological pluralism as it offers methodological and theoretical benefits. First, the use of MMR provides the possibility for researchers to obtain a comprehensive picture of a phenomenon under investigation and achieve their research purpose effectively. Secondly, its utilisation may also contribute to theory development and the maturity of the field as reflected in SAJEMS.Download Free PDFView PDFBLENDING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAPatrick NgulubeThis article explores how researchers for library and information science (LIS) journals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) blended both qualitative and quantitative methods into their articles between the period 2002 and 2010. The mixed methods research framework provided in methodological literature was used to determine how the LIS scientific community in SSA blended qualitative and qualitative methodological approaches. Content analysis and semi-structured telephonic interviews with editors and members of the editorial boards were used for collecting data. Seven hundred and ninety-three (793) articles published in nine peer-reviewed LIS journals in SAA were reviewed, finding the dominant research methods to be survey designs and historical research. Fifty out of 793 articles integrated research methods. The study concluded that the blending of different research methods was limited in SSA. It is recommended that LIS researchers in SSA blend methods to inform each other to obtain a comprehensive picture of a phenomenon under investigation and to achieve their research purpose more effectively.Download Free PDFView PDFSouth African Journal of Libraries and Information ScienceUtilisation and prevalence of mixed methods research in library and information research in South Africa 2002-20082009 • Koketso MokwatloDownload Free PDFView PDFMixed methods researchPatrick Ngulube, Norma RommThis chapter explores various ways of conceiving what is called mixed methods research (MMR) – mixing quantitative and qualitative traditions. After reading this chapter, you should be able to discuss the debates around what it might mean to “mix” different methods employed in the process of doing MMR; explore the philosophical underpinnings which can be said to underlie the use of different methods in MMR; reflect on whether we should regard mixed methods research as encapsulating a different paradigm from those that are seen as traditionally underpinning quantitatively-directed or qualitatively-directed research traditions; articulate how a “third” paradigmatic stance as an underpinning for MMR can be justified; differentiate between multi-methods and MMR; describe key considerations that should inform the choice of MMR as a methodology to conduct research; outline key MMR designs; and reflect on how to conduct MMR.Download Free PDFView PDFMixed Methods Research for Health Policy Development in Africa: The Case of Identifying Very Poor Households for Health Insurance Premium Exemptions in Ghana;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Williams118 ;http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/09/02/1558689816665056.abstractJohn J WilliamsDespite the utility of applying mixed methods research to understand complex phenomenon, few studies have applied this approach to health policy and in Africa. This article illustrates the application of mixed methods research to inform health policy in Ghana with the intent of com-plementarity. Through an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design involving 24 focus group interviews and 417 household surveys, we developed criteria for identifying very poor households for health insurance premium exemptions in Ghana. The qualitative procedures identified communities' concerns regarding being very poor: food insecurity, lack of seeds to sow, compromised access to education, financial insecurity, and status as unemployed widows with children. The survey findings illustrated the distribution and predictors of poverty in the Kassena-Nankana District. Based on these findings, the authors proposed a four-question survey for the Kassena-Nankana District Health Insurance Scheme to administer to determine extreme poverty. Based on these recommendations, the local government has a unique opportunity to increase the very poor's access to and utilization of health care services; see: ;http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/09/02/1558689816665056.abstractDownload Free PDFView PDFMobile Learning: Towards Secure Learning Environmentsheila  mahalingamMobile learning has a tendency to grow advance and transform the learning environment in future. Rapid growth of mobile devices such as smart phones, I pad and other ensemble mobile devices gives a wide range of expanding learning into mobility environment which gives a bright growth to the mobile learning. At the same time security of the mobile learning system and its environment need to be considered in order to provide a reliable secure communication between the learners and providers. In this paper survey are being constructed in order to analyze at what point security awareness are put into consideration when using mobile devices. Finally the paper focuses security concern and suggestion to prepare a better secure platform of learning in mobile environment.Download Free PDFView PDFLanguage Teaching Journal/CambridgeMixed-methods research in language teaching and learning2014 • Mehdi RiaziThis state-of-the-art paper foregrounds mixed-methods research (MMR) in language teaching and learning by discussing and critically reviewing issues related to this newly developed research paradigm. The paper has six sections. The first provides a context for the discussion of MMR through an introductory review of quantitative and qualitative paradigms. In the second section we discuss the nature and scope of MMR, its underlying principles, and its techniques and procedures. In the third section we discuss trends in MMR in language teaching and learning, and review 40 published papers in 30 journals related to this field, covering one decade (2002–2011). Issues and challenges facing MMR and its researchers are discussed in the fourth section, while in the fifth we discuss the significance of replicating MMR studies in language teaching and learning. Finally, we conclude by presenting prospects and avenues for further developing mixed-methods research.Download Free PDFView PDFCONCEPTUALIZATION OF CROSS-SECTIONAL MIXED METHODS STUDIES IN HEALTH SCIENCE: A METHODOLOGICAL REVIEWMingying ZhengThe purpose of this review was to discuss some methodological issues inherent within cross-sectional mixed methods designs in health sciences, and to provide an initial conceptualization of cross-sectional mixed method designs in health sciences by conducting a methodological review of empirical studies through the end of 2014. The results identified three basic commonly-used cross-sectional mixed methods designs that have been used by the researchers in health sciences, and several methodological issues corresponding to the cross-sectional mixed methods designs, and suggest recommendations and implications for both applied researchers and methodologists interested in using cross-sectional mixed methods approaches in health sciences.Download Free PDFView PDFTacit Cultural Knowledge: An Instrumental Qualitative Case Study of Mixed Methods Research in South AfricaDebbie MillerNotwithstanding the dramatic expansion of mixed methods research, research methodologies, methods, and findings are culturally situated. Problematically, studies conducted outside the global north often embrace canonical methodologies aimed at understanding concepts more explicit than tacit. Learning about the needs of researchers and participants in South Africa may bring to light taken-for-granted assumptions in Anglo-American orientations of mixed methods. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore aspects of tacit cultural knowledge that contextualize mixed methods research in South Africa. In-person interviews among South African professors as well as a corpus of books, sections, journal articles, and theses informed the study. Narrative, thematic, and discursive analysis served to naturalistically generalize themes of the case and to approach an integrated crystallization of findings across data sources. Findings showed that research methodology in South Africa serves as a means to an end and requires relational ethics. Relational aspects of life require communicatively embedded collaborative approaches with time for minimally structured talk and storytelling in and across data collection events. Mixed methods studies face challenges of hybrid languages and styles with even educated participants displaying multiple forms of literacies. To deal with these realities, qualitative approaches dominate across studies of all approaches and in applications of mixed methods research. Whether asked by South African researchers or by external funders, research questions need to be contextually sensitive. Sensitive contexts require researchers to connect with both heart and mind in attempting to walk in participants’ shoes. Tacit cultural knowledge involves methodologies as political identities that lead to economically based knowledge. Recommendations for research in South Africa and beyond include allowing plans to flexibly change, basing approaches to ethics on unregimented trust, considering cultural expressions of doubt when probing, and implementing fewer studies to result in more meaningful data. Ultimately, this study contributes an overview of mixed methods research conducted in South Africa for researchers on the subcontinent, and contributes an understanding of how to handle extreme cultural contrasts within a given study for audiences in the global north and south.Download Free PDFView PDFPublic sector knowledge management: A structured literature reviewMaurizio MassaroThis paper reviews and critiques the public sector knowledge management (KM) literature, offers an overview of the state of public sector KM research and outlines a future research agenda. Articles published in KM journals are analyzed using a structured literature review methodology. The paper analyzes 180 papers published within 10 journals specializing in the field of KM. Findings show that few authors specialize in the field and there are several obstacles to developing a cohesive body of literature. Low levels of international cooperation among authors and international comparisons mean that the literature is fragmented. Some research topics and some geographical areas within the public sector theme are over-analyzed, while others are under-investigated. Additionally, academic researchers should re-think their methodological approach if they wish to make significant contributions to the literature and work toward developing research which impacts practice in conjunction with practitioners.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
