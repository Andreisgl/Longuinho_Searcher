Knowledge Base of Chemistry Teachers' Support Materials Used in Teaching Practical Skills in Titration in the Senior High Schools in GhanaInternational Journal of Materials Chemistry and Physics ,  2021The study focused on knowledge Base of chemistry Teachers' Support Materials used in Teaching Pra... more The study focused on knowledge Base of chemistry Teachers' Support Materials used in Teaching Practical Skills in Titration in the Senior High Schools in Ghana. The purpose of the research was to develop Teacher Support Material for the teaching of laboratory practical skills of Observation, Communication, Listening and Manipulation of equipment in simple acid-base titration. The population for the study were chemistry teachers and students in three Senior High Schools (Edinaman, Komenda and Eguafo) in the municipality. Convenient, purposive and simple random techniques were used to the municipality, schools, teachers and students for the study. The (six) 6 teachers were purposively sampled out of the total of 8 chemistry teachers because they had qualification in Science Education in Chemistry. Five (5) students each were randomly selected from every SHS in the municipality. The study concluded that, the practical skills (PS)-based teacher support materials designed for use in teaching fundamental skills of observation, listening communication and manipulation of equipment in titration was a way of showing Senior High School Chemistry teachers how to develop these essential science process skills in teaching titration. It is recommended that, Ministry of Education, Ghana Education Service and Ghana Association of Science Teaching (GAST) must ensure that Senior High Schools chemistry teachers are taught how to use the Practical Skills-based Teacher Support Materials (TSMs) to enable them develop practical skills of Observation, Listening, Communication and Manipulation of apparatus in their students as they teach titration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Using Cooperative Learning Model to Enhance Academic Performance of Teacher Trainees in Some Selected Topics in Integrated Science at Saint Monica's College Of EducationInternational Journal of Scientific Research and Management (IJSRM),  2020The study sought to investigate the effects of using cooperative learning on female teacher train... more The study sought to investigate the effects of using cooperative learning on female teacher trainees of the Colleges of Education in learning some selected topics in Integrated Science. The investigation also sought to determine whether the Cooperative Learning Approach enhances the attitude and motivation of the trainees towards learning of Integrated Science. The study was carried out at the St. Monica's College of Education in the Mampong Municipality of the Ashanti Region. In all, 80 teacher trainees consisting of 40 each from control and experimental groups were purposively sampled to participate in the study. The teacher trainees in the experimental group were exposed to the Cooperative Learning Approach and the trainees in the control group were lectured during the period of the study. The results of the study showed that the cooperative learning strategy was very relevant and beneficial in helping the teacher trainees of the St. Monica's College of Education to improve on their performance in, and attitudes towards, the teaching and learning of Integrated Science. It was therefore recommended among other things that the science teachers should endeavour to integrate cooperative learning into their routine methods of instruction in the teaching and learning of Integrated Science.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Differential Effects of the Algorithm and Proportional Reasoning Approaches on Senior High School Students' Understanding of Titrimetric Analysiswww.ijsrm.in,  2019This study evaluated The Differential Effects of Algorithm and Proportional Reasoning Approaches ... more This study evaluated The Differential Effects of Algorithm and Proportional Reasoning Approaches on Senior High School Students' Understanding of Titrimetric Analysis in Berekum Presbyterian Senior High School in the Brong Ahafo Region. The target population was the science students in the school. The accessible population consisted of science one and science two final year elective chemistry students. Quasi-experimental design was used for this study. In this design the researcher used a questionnaire and test to solicit information on students' understanding on the Effects of Proportional and Algorithm Reasoning Approaches. Purposive sampling technique was used to select 30 students for the research. Science A students formed the experimental group and were taught using algorithm approach while the science B students comprised the control group and were taught using the proportional reasoning approach. There was no interaction between the control group and the experimental group. Difference in performance in pre-test and post-test, the analysis of the study imply that students exposed to algorithm instructional approach to the teaching and learning in titrimetric analysis performed statistically better at significant level (p-value = 0.000 at =0.05). Students in the experimental group (algorithm approach) performance were better in post-test than the post-test of students in the control group (proportional reasoning). The Hake Gain was then used to calculate for students understanding in titrimetric analysis using algorithm instructional approach in teaching and learning of titrimetric analysis. The gain 0.46 (SD = 0.132) achieved fell within the range i.e. 0.36< 〈 g〉 <0.68 meaning that students understood the titrimetric analysis after they were exposed to algorithm instructional approach. The results of the study imply that students exposed to algorithm instructional approach to the teaching and learning in titrimetric analysis performed significantly better than proportional instructional approach Key Words: Abstract Concepts in Chemistry: algorithm approach, stoichiometry, proportional instructional approach, titration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Using Observational Techniques as Assessment Instruments to Improve Learners' Performance at Nkawkaw,GhanaIOSR Journal of Research & Method in Education (IOSR-JRME) ,  2018Educational objectives can be achieved successfully through gradual assessment of students and th... more Educational objectives can be achieved successfully through gradual assessment of students and the feedback used to instruct the students more effectively. This research was set forth to investigate how observational techniques can be used as assessment instruments to improve pupils' performance in learning at Nkawkaw in the Kwahu West Municipality of Ghana. It further assessed the extent of Junior High School teachers' knowledge of observational techniques and identifies some of the benefits and uses of the data gathered through the application of these techniques. The basic research designs used were descriptive statistics and participant observation among 250 respondents, who were selected through simple random sampling. The findings from the study showed that, teachers in the study area preferred employing unstructured observational technique, followed by structured observational technique to collect data on students with limited emphasis on the clinical and global impression techniques. Again, only a few preferred the application of other instruments and approaches such as the use of anecdotes, norm-referenced tests, rating scales and checklists to gather data. Based on the findings, the work concluded that unstructured observational technique was very useful to apply and does not involve the use of sophisticated equipment to record data. The study therefore recommends the use of these observational techniques and instruments to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of the students. It was also recommended that, government should support training and appointing of personnels to undertake observational studies on regular basis to ensure effective teaching and learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
