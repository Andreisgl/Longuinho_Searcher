Uploaded during September 2023;
During the upload process, you give permission with a CC BY-SA license to re-use the image;
Contain a listed monument, which you have identified using the monument identifier (see elsewhere on this page);
Next to that, there are a few practical rules:
You should have an activated e-mail address on Wikimedia Commons - otherwise we may not be able to contact you if you win;
If the photo gets deleted for any reason, it is automatically disqualified from the competition;

Images that reach a top ranking of the international finale, will typically at least fulfill the technical criteria of the ‘Featured Image’ process at Wikimedia Commons. But feel free to submit many images, and let the jury be concerned if they are good enough.
