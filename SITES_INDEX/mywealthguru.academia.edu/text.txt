As an adolescent in wartime Poland, he lost his father and grandparents in the Ho-locaust and, with his immediate family, evaded capture by the Germans. A pioneer in depicting genocide, and war through animated films for younger children, he has explicitly and implicitly projected his experiences of survival and separation from his family onto animal and human characters who escape and resist danger with the help of kind strangers. He typically represents the persecution of the Jews in symbolic images and casts the enemy broadly as ecocide, imprisonment, or war. In his experimental shorts, he combines animation with documentary footage from the Holocaust. His message, however, remains the same: do not forget the human capacity for compassion as well as cruelty.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The period from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s looks more and more distinct with the passage of time. Fermaglich’s subjects were interested in using the example of the Holocaust to explore larger questions about conformity, bureaucracy, and alienation—an approach that stands in sharp contrast to the post-1960s identity politics that highlights differences of race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation. Universalism is now widely discredited, especially among intellectuals. Though Fermaglich agrees with many who criticized various aspects of these scholars’ interpretations, she finds their universal focus admirable and provides a welcome, though perhaps too hopeful, push in that direction. Fermaglich also offers some important contributions to the history of American Jews. She not only adds to the evidence that Jews debated the meaning of the Holocaust well before the late 1960s, but a...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Pioneering American Jewish Women Directors From Elaine May to Claudia WeillJews and Gender,  2021For most of the silent movie era American studios employed a considerable number of women directo... more For most of the silent movie era American studios employed a considerable number of women directors. Initially churning out low-budget shorts, the studios emulated the egalitarian practices of live theatre, where the positions men and women filled were fluid. Popular actresses like Mary Pickford and directors like Alice Guy-Blaché and Lois Weber even founded their own production companies. As the Hollywood movie industry evolved into a profitable big business dependent on the profits from star-studded feature films, it consolidated around a handful of major studios that were managed like corporations and required external investment. Their owners gradually removed women from the ranks of directors out of concern that having women in such a key role would scare off financiers. 1 The gender criteria for various filmmaking jobs negotiated by the craft unions thereafter further limited the opportunities for women to direct. 2 From the 1930s until the 1960s, Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino were the only women directing studio feature films. 3 During this period, women directors gravitated to New York, where documentary, experimental, and independent filmmaking was centered. In New York film circles there were two notable Jewish women precursors of the directors discussed in this essay. Maya Deren created avant-garde motion pictures that eventually earned her the title of being "the mother of underground film." 4 Shirley Clarke specialized in documentaries and gritty realistic feature films about urban drug and gang subcultures. Her Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel with the World (1963) won an Oscar for best documentary feature. 5 Neither Deren nor Clarke directly addressed Jewish themes in their works.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
