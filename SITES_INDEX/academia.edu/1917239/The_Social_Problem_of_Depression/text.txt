Though 1968 is no longer simply a year but a name for what is known as " the Sixties, " a time whose myth still survives in our cultural history. Philosophy in that time was part and parcel of the international phenomenon of the Sixties in which decolonization, the New Left, youth politics, the fight against institutional racism, women's liberation, anti-war activism, cultural radicalism, and many more strands were woven together. I want to assert that the dominant philosophy of the Sixties was Marxist humanism or existential Marxism.Download Free PDFView PDFFreedomFreedom2021 • Carlos F ObregonThis book claims that individual freedom is, by its very nature, a belonging phenomenon. The best way to strengthen our individual freedom is to develop our belonging. To be free individually we must satisfy our three ways of belonging: to our loved ones, to the society, and to the surrounding biological and material universe. It discusses individual freedom from a broad perspective. It argues that, on one side, the Western conception of individual freedom has been historically very important, because it has inspired individual creativity in many areas and, no doubt, it is related to the economic success of capitalism. But it also sustains that, on the other side, this conception is too narrow as a full blown view of social life and has had several negative consequences. Among them, most of the psychological problems of individuals living in contemporary Western societies such as personality disorders; and at the social level it reinforces an unjust world with a very unequal income distribution, extended poverty, and with many other unresolved problems such as international crime and global warming. It argues that the world has to strengthen its belonging ties. Belonging is in itself freedom and belonging strengthens the individual capacity to make individual choices. Thus, freedom understood in the sense of individualism requires belonging. Belonging and freedom are not opposites, they go together.Download Free PDFView PDF"Introduction" to Marxism and Phenomenology (2021)Bryan Smyth, Richard WestermanOriginal uncorrected proofs.

The social constructs of university highlight that the potential for any friendship or relationship within the institution is very uncommon and both parties usually assume that integration of their social groups cannot take place. Many people argue that the relationship of this nature can adversely affect grade attainment and fairness of judgement. We assess and reflect upon the merits of this conventional view by drawing upon a real-life case-study involving the first author (a lecturer) and the remaining six authors (his students). After considering the various arguments on both sides, and drawing upon authors such as Freud, Marx, and Sartre, we conclude that, if individuals remain honest, the relationship can only mean a greater understanding for the student and a lesser alienation complex for both parties.Download Free PDFView PDFDictionary of New HumanismDaniel C RobaldoDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
