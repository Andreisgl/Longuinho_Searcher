  Working definition of multi-competence (2015)
  'the overall system of a mind  or a community that uses more than one language’.
Uncut version of a shorter encyclopaedia entry 2012
The
  
  term 'multi-competence' was originally defined as 'the compound state of a mind
  
  with two grammars' (Cook, 1991); in the context of that paper, grammar was
  
  used in the Chomskyan sense of the total knowledge of language in the mind (the
  
  I-language) leading some people to infer wrongly that multi-competence
  
  was restricted to syntax. So multi-competence is now usually said to be
  
  the knowledge of more than one language in the same mind (Cook, 1994). Multi-competence
  
  thus presents a view of second language acquisition
  
  (SLA) based on the second
  
  language (L2) user as a whole person rather
  
  than on the monolingual native speaker. It is neither particularly a
  
  psychological concept, as some have claimed (Kelly Hall et al, 2006), nor
  
  particularly sociological: It is a perspective for viewing both approaches to
  
  SLA and thus applies both to the individual and to the community. It is perhaps
  
  closest to approaches that treat language as a continuously changing system (De
  
  Bot et al, 2005; Herdina & Jessner, 2002). Accounts of the historical
  
  development
  
  of the concept can be found in Cook (2006; 2007a); a bibliography is available (Murahata
  
  & Murahata, 2008).
Multi-competence therefore involves the whole mind of the speaker,
  
  not simply their first language (L1) or their second.
  
  It assumes that someone who knows two or more languages is a different person from a monolingual and so needs to be
  
  looked at in their own right rather than as a deficient monolingual, an idea put
  
  forward by Grosjean (1989) from a different background. Multi-competence is thus not a model nor
  
  a theory so much as an overall perspective or framework: It changes the angle
  
  from which second language acquisition is viewed. It constitutes a bilingual
  
  wholistic interpretation of bilingualism as opposed to a monolingual
  
  fractional interpretation of bilingualism, in Grosjean ( 2009)s terms.
In
  
  the 1960s the conceptual breakthrough in the linguistic study of language
  
  acquisition was the independent grammars assumption that children
  
  do not distort the adult language system but invent systems of their own, put
  
  forward by McNeill (1966) and Braine (1963) among others. This insisted that children are not defective speakers of
  
  adult language but speakers of a distinct language with its own rules,
  
  vocabulary and phonology, which gradually develop into the adults linguistic
  
  competence. The idea soon crossed over into the nascent field of second
  
  language acquisition (SLA) research through such concepts as 'approximative
  
  system' (Nemser, 1971) and interlanguage
  
  (Selinker, 1972). It was generally assumed that L2 learners too speak languages
  
  that do not correspond to established languages such as Spanish or English but
  
  have their own properties, created by L2 learners in a similar way to L1 children. Interlanguage opened the floodgates of SLA research and became an
  
  almost unchallenged axiom.
Multi-competence and
  
  the native speaker 
Multi-competence proposed to take the concept of interlanguage seriously.
  
  If L2 users are to be treated in their own right, the native speaker has no particular status: It
  
  is the users own language that matters. This
  
  remains the key aspect of multi-competence. If a native speaker is someone who still
  
  speaks the first language (L1) that they learnt in childhood, being a native
  
  speaker is an unalterable historic fact; you cannot change your native
  
  language any more than you can change who brought you up (Cook, 1999);
  
  you can try to pass as a native speaker of another language but never become one
  
   by definition. Multi-competence thus includes the first language, the
  
  interlanguage
  
  and other aspects of the L2 users mind. 
Some arguments in favour of multi-competence are:
-          the normality of the L2 user. In many parts of the world like India and the
  
  Cameroon, monolinguals form a small minority: Everybody has to use more than one
  
  language in their everyday lives. Brutt-Griffler (2002) has argued for the
  
  multi-competence of the community: Rather than a community being defined by a
  
  single language, many communities in say India or Central Africa have multiple
  
  languages at their core, specialized by function and so on. While it is hard to
  
  get exact figures, multi-competence is probably not so much an exception as the
  
  norm for twenty-first century human beings. 
-          the rights of individuals. Linguistics has progressively refused to
  
  classify speakers in terms of groups of which they are not, and never could be,
  
  members, first granting independence to primitive languages (Boas, 1920/1940),
  
  then freeing childrens language from adults (the independent grammars
  
  assumption), then liberating black English speakers from white (Labov, 1969),
  
  working-class restricted code from middle-class elaborated code (Bernstein,
  
  1971) and womens language from mens. The only group still to be judged by
  
  the standards of another is L2 users. But they too have the right to use
  
  language appropriately for their needs, not for those of a native speaker group to which they can never belong. 
Despite its acceptance of interlanguage, much SLA research has continued
  
  to measure L2 users against native speakers.
  
  Inevitably what L2 users do is seen as a mistake whenever it fails to conform to
  
  the language of monolingual native speakers and the L2 users level of
  
  language proficiency is seen as deficient rather than different: Its all
  
  right if your English accent proclaims you come from Newcastle upon Tyne but not
  
  from Paris. This native speaker comparison lurks behind such typical statements
  
  as: Unfortunately, language mastery is not often the outcome of SLA
  
  (Larsen Freeman & Long, 1991, p. 153); or The lack of general guaranteed
  
  success is the most striking characteristic of adult foreign language
  
  learning (Bley-Vroman, 1989, p. 42). It is possible to measure ducks in terms of
  
  swans. But when everything has to satisfy the swan criteria, the unique
  
  qualities of ducks will always elude the observer, just as black English,
  
  working-class English and womens language were once seen as pale shadows of a
  
  true variety. Uniquely bilingual functions of language like codeswitching
  
  and translation will never show up in a native speaker model; unique grammatical
  
  forms of L2 users like the rules of the Basic Variety (Klein & Perdue, 1997)
  
  will appear just as mistakes. 
While
  
  overt denigration of L2 users for not being native
  
  speakers is now less common, the perennial SLA research
  
  questions continue to revolve around whether the L2 user is like a native
  
  speaker: Whether age affects L2 learning depends on speaking like a native 
  
  [we] have
  
  yet to show that later learners can achieve the same level of phonology as
  
  native speakers in production (DeKeyser & Larson Hall, 2005, p. 96); the ultimate attainment of L2 learners is assessed in terms of absolute
  
  native-like command of an L2 (Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson, 2003); whether L2
  
  learners have access to Universal Grammar is seen as depending on whether they
  
  attain the identical grammar
  
  to native speakers (Clahsen & Muysken, 1987). The typical SLA research
  
  techniques outlined in Cook (1997) consist of Error Analysis (i.e. mostly
  
  defining errors as things native speakers would not do), obligatory occurrence
  
  (Pienemann, 1998) (omitting elements that native speakers would not leave out), grammaticality judgements (based on the
  
  correct native speaker grammar), elicited imitation (Cook, 1973) (defined
  
  by how the native speaker would repeat), and so on. The commitment to the
  
  independent L2 user is often a matter of rhetoric rather than the reality
  
  reflected in the research questions and techniques of SLA research. 
But
  
  what term should be used to describe people who are multicompetent? People
  
  who acquire their first language are not regarded as L1 learners for the rest of
  
  their lives. Why should people who know more than one language be treated differently? Calling
  
  people L2 learners seemed to confirm their subordinate status. Hence
  
  the more neutral term L2 user was introduced. L2 user refers to
  
  people who know and use a second lang­uage at any level; multi-competence is
  
  not restricted to high-level balanced bilinguals but concerns the mind of any
  
  user of a second language 
  at any level of achievement.L2
  
  learner is reserved for people who have no everyday use of the second
  
  language, say children in foreign language classrooms. Of course L2 users
  
  may also be L2 learners at different times of life or indeed times of day 
  
  an L2 learner of English in London who steps out of the classroom immediately
  
  become an L2 user of English. More recently at least five different groups of L2
  
  users have been distinguished (Cook, 2009a): Those
  
  using an L2 within a larger community, say Arabic residents of Berlin using
  
  German; those using it internationally for restricted functions, for example
  
  Muslims using Arabic for religious purposes regardless of their first
  
  language and the country in which they live
  
  whether Germany or Saudi Arabia; those using it globally for a wide range of
  
  functions, primarily nowadays the use of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) say
  
  for business, tourism or electronic communication; those using it with
  
  spouses, siblings or friends with different first languages (Piller, 2002);
  
  and those historically from a particular community (re-) acquiring its
  
  language for cultural use, say British Chinese speakers of Cantonese learning Mandarin. Each of these groups undoubtedly have specific
  
  qualities that do not generalize to L2 learning
  
  in general. The people usually studied in SLA research are classroom L2
  
  learners, many of whom are not and never will be L2 users, for example Chinese
  
  children learning English at school in Shanghai, and immigrants adjusting
  
  to a new country (hence the importance of Age of Arrival in much SLA research).
The
  
  multi-competence perspective was first supported by reinterpreting
  
  research from various domains to show the effects of second languages on the human mind (Cook, 1992). But
  
  it led to research specifically aimed at multi-competence that generated
  
  research questions which had previously barely been mentioned. 
Effects
  
  of the L2 on the L1  
A
  
  vast amount of SLA research has looked at the effects of the first language on
  
  the second, labelled transfer or crosslinguistic influence, still a
  
  favorite topic for dissertations exploring yet more first
  
  languages or
  
  novel aspects of language. By looking at the whole learners mind, multi-competence opened up reverse transfer from the second language to the first and
  
  other forms of transfer (Jarvis & Pavlenko, 2009). A new research question
  
  was then: Do you still speak your first language like a monolingual
  
  native speaker when you know another language?
  
  A negative answer to this could reverberate across SLA research, and indeed much
  
  linguistics, as it would be unsafe to regard any person who knows another
  
  language as having normal monolingual linguistic competence; the
  
  judgments about English of Bloomfield, Halliday or Chomsky are not trustworthy,
  
  except where they are supported by evidence from pure monolinguals (Cook, 2002): the founder of linguistic
  
  relativity, Whorf (1941/1956), based his ideas about the indigenous
  
  American language Hopi in large part on an informant living in New York and so
  
  an L2 user. 
In
  
  virtually every aspect of language studied, L2 users have turned out to be
  
  different from monolinguals. To take some representative studies:
-          phonology. Much
  
  research has shown the changes in Voice Onset Time (the duration of silence that
  
  distinguishes voiced and unvoiced plosive consonants) in the L2 users first
  
  language, for example English Spanish (Zampini & Green, 2001). L1 intonation
  
  is also influenced by the L2, for example in Dutch users of Greek
  
  Mennen, 2004).
-          lexicons. Since Caramazza & Brones (1980), many have argued for a single
  
  lexicon in the L2 users mind where words from one language are stored
  
  alongside words from the other. An L2 user seems unable to switch off one
  
  language entirely while processing another, only to lower the level of
  
  activation. Spivey & Marian (1999) for example showed in an eye-tracking
  
  task that words from one language were activated even when processing the other.
-          syntax. The L1 syntax
  
  of the L2 user is subtly altered by the second language they know. Using a Competition Model paradigm,
  
  Cook et al (2003) found that the cues to the processing of L1 word
  
  order change when another language is known. Balcom (2003) found that French L2
  
  users of English had different grammaticality judgements of French
  
  middle constructions from monolinguals.
-          pragmatics. Russians who knew English interpret film sequences differently from monolinguals
  
  (Pavlenko, 2003). L2 users indeed have a range of functions for language such as
  
  codeswitching and translation
  
  unknown to monolinguals.
Rather
  
  than enumerate further examples, the reader is referred to Cook (2003), which
  
  was devoted to this issue.
More
  
  than language has changed in the L2 users mind. Learning another
  
  language helps with learning 
  to read the first
  
  language (Yelland et al, 1993), with
  
  metalinguistic awareness (Bialystok, 2001), and with the ability to write essays
  
  in the first language (Kecskes & Papp,
  
  2000). Knowing another language delays the onset of Alzheimers disease
  
  (Bialystok, Craik, Klein & Viswanathan, 2004),leads to greater
  
  density of connections in the corpus callosum area that connects left and right
  
  hemispheres of the brain (Coggins et al, 2004), and develops the areas of the
  
  brain responsible for control (Green, 2010.). All of these support the
  
  proposition that the L2 user is a distinct kind of person from a monolingual. 
Bilingual
  
  Cognition
The
  
  focus in recent research has been on the different ways in which L2 users think,
  
  surveyed in Cook & Bassetti (2010). The research looks at well-known areas
  
  where cognitive difference have been shown to occur crosslinguistically between
  
  a pair of languages and then
  
  sees how L2 users of the two languages 
  think. Typical areas include:
-          shape and material. Imai
  
  and Gentner (1997) showed that Japanese classify objects more by material,
  
  English speakers by shape. Cook et al (2006) found that Japanese L2 users of
  
  English living in England had moved some way towards the English preference.
-          colors. Many languages
  
  recognize two distinct blue colors where English has only one.
  
  Athanasopoulos (2009) showed that speakers of Greek who had learnt English had altered classifications
  
  of colors.
-          gender. Speakers of grammatical arbitrary gender languages
  
  tend to assign gender to inanimate objects in the natural world; this effect is diminished for
  
  those who know two languages with
  
  different gender systems (Bassetti, 2007).
-          motion. Descriptions of motion events in L2 learners are affected by their first language  (Jarvis & Odlin, 2000). In particular Talmys
  
  (1985) division between satellite and verb-framed languages has
  
  generated masses of L2 research, showing effects of bilingualism on ideas of
  
  motion, for example Hohenstein, Eisenberg & Naigles (2006).
Multi-competence
  
  and language teaching 
The
  
  multi-competence< idea has important
  
  implications for language teaching, which has often
  
  seen its task as making students as like native speakers as possible. Multi-competence 
  
  is now starting to be utilized in books on SLA and language teaching such as
  
  Cook (2008), Ortega (2009) and Scott (2009). 
-          Goals
  
  of language teaching. Multi-competence
  
  takes the goal of language teaching as producing a successful L2 user, not an
  
  imitation native speaker. It thus aligns with the English as Lingua Franca (ELF)
  
  movement (Seidlhofer, 2004) rather than with the Common European Framework of
  
  Reference (Council of Europe, 2001), which seems to use the native rather than
  
  the L2 user as a touchstone. 
-          The
  
  language teaching classroom. The multi-competence
  
  perspective does not see any virtue in making the students use only the second
  
  language in the classroom since this denies the very existence of the first language in their minds. It
  
  advocates principled use of the second
  
  language when classroom goals can be achieved more efficiently by its use
  
  (Cook, 1999). 
-          Native speaker language teachers. A non-native speaker teacher (NNST) is an L2 user who has acquired another language; a native
  
  speaker teacher (NST) is not. Hence the NNST can present a role model for
  
  the students, has learnt the language by a similar route to the students and can
  
  codeswitch to the students own language when necessary. The NSTs only
  
  substantive advantage may be a greater facility in the target language, but as a
  
  native speaker not as an L2 user. Recent
  
  attitudes are conveyed in Llurda (2005).
Overall
  
  the development of a multi-competence perspective has been
  
  fruitful in suggesting not only new interpretations of existing theories and
  
  phenomena but also new research questions to be tackled. It has gone some way to
  
  redressing the bias in favor of the native
  
  speaker. But its importance extends beyond SLA research to linguistics,
  
  psycholinguistics and psychology in its insistence on the uniqueness of the L2
  
  user. The fundamental questions of linguistic competence and language
  
  acquisition are different if most human minds in fact know more than language.
  
  In particular it is a question whether UG
  
  theory can achieve its basic task of describing how human minds acquire, store
  
  and use language without taking into account the minds that cope with more than
  
  one language (Cook, 2009b). Chomskys four questions for linguistics
  
  (Chomsky, 1988), namely accounting for knowledge of language, its acquisition,
  
  use and physical manifestation in the brain, are transformed when multi-competence knowledge
  
  of languages in the plural  is the
  
  normal state of the human mind, is the norm: rather than the dominant form of
  
  language knowledge, monolingualism becomes
  
  an aberration due to linguistic deprivation of second
  
  language input. The monolingual native
  
  speaker is language-deprived; they would have acquired multi-competence in more
  
  than one language if their caretakers had not deprived them of a second
  
  language (Cook, 2010).
