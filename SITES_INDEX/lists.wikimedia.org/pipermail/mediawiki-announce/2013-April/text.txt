I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.20.5 and 1.19.6.
These releases fix 2 security related issues that could affect users
of MediaWiki. Download links are given at the end of this email.
* Jan Schejbal / Hatforce.com reported that SVG script filtering could
be bypassed for Chrome and Firefox clients by using an encoding that
MediaWiki understood, but these browsers interpreted as UTF-8.
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47304>
* Internal review discovered that extensions were not given the
opportunity to disable a password reset, which could lead to
circumvention of two-factor authentication.
