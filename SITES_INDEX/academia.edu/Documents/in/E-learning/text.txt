The most frequently cited reference for best practices comes from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). WICHE (1997) has published a number of documents, including Good Practices in Distance Education (WCET, 1997, Publication Number 2A299). Principles of Good Practice was also developed by the Southern Region Education Board (SREB) (2003) to assess program quality. Both WICHE and SREB offer the following principles for best practices in distance education: curriculum and instruction; institutional context and commitment; and evaluation and assessment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kim Dooley•Computer ScienceAnnals of Education Heightened Character of Sensuality and Sexual Images in the Poetry of Shiv K.

He is famous for his thoughtful and scholarly poetry. Recurrence of sexual images in his poetry sometimes beguiles his readers who initially begin to understand him a poet of cheap sentimentality. But a larger view of his poetry helps us open the layers of the sound meaning of life hidden behind them. Shiv K. Kumar was impressed by D.H. Lawrence&#39;s theory of the religion of blood and Bergson&#39;s theory of instinctive memory as the best source to know the Truth. In this research article attempt has been made to understand the real motive of Shiv K. Kumar behind the recurrence of sexual images and portrayal of sexual urges in his poetry. Kumar considers sexual urges of a living being as the beginning of a grand life. Perfect realization of the life of blood opens the floodgates of the dazzling light of intuitive vision. Humanity is at a loss in disallowing the properties of sexual life to come in open expression.

The source text’s language naturally carries the culture where it is used both in life and writing.  So is the case of the language used in the translated text. Here lies the problem of cultural transfer from the source to the translated text. This article deals with the same problem in general and the transfer of Nepali text into English in particular. Currently, available theories of translation and their focus in regard to the obstacles of transferring the culture through translation and their possible solutions have been reviewed as the theoretical support for the discussion. The examples have been supplied from different languages and their translation with a major focus on the translation of Nepali text into English and vice-versa. This article will be useful for the researchers of Nepali translation into English and other languages.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ramji Timalsina•Analiza pseudodogađaja u strateškom komuniciranju visokog školstva u HrvatskojKomunikacija s ciljanom javnosti i promocija proizvoda i usluga proteklih godina transformirala se iz mogućnosti u nužnost, a odnosi se na profitni i neprofitni sektor gospodarstva.

Digitalizacija i popularizacija društvenih medija, potreba za publicitetom i dosegom do krajnjih korisnika i potrošača te praćenje konkurencije postaju primarni izazovi strateškog komuniciranja. Isticanje pojedinih elemenata poslovanja na nov i inovativan način omogućava privlačenje pažnje javnosti te postizanje šireg publiciteta. U tome se posebno ističe alat odnosa s javnošću tzv. promidžbena dosjetka, pseudodogađaj ili PR stunt. Novi mediji, a posebno platforme za društveno umrežavanje, ovakvim sadržajima daju veliki doseg, značajnu popularnost, ali možda ono najvažnije – veliki povrat uloženog.

Studies conducted by specialists in different areas, indicate that numerous people are not willing to work under stressful conditions. In this paper, we want to find out what can motivate a person to work in abnormal conditions of stress, risk of illness, which motivational tools may be applicable with a di­rect view on students who remained online for more than 21 months. Humanity is facing one of the greatest challenges of this century: the COVID 19. People are going through a period of fearful insecurity and stress caus­ing many problems and even mental health issues, some of them probably hard to remediate.

Zoia Prestes define-se como professora e pesquisadora da área da Educação. Viveu parte de sua infância e juventude na União Soviética, período em que o Brasil vivia sob o regime militar, instaurado com o golpe de Estado em 1964. Aos 7 anos de idade teve de se exilar na União Soviética com seus pais, Luiz Carlos Prestes e Maria Prestes. Durante os quinze anos em que esteve lá, vivenciou sua imersão na cultura e na língua russa. Foi alfabetizada em russo, graduou-se e se tornou mestre em Ciências da Educação pela Faculdade de Pedagogia e Psicologia Pré-Escolar da Universidade Estatal Lenin de Pedagogia de Moscou. Retornou ao Brasil em 1985 e, por não ter o diploma reconhecido por mais de 15 anos, dedicou-se à tradução de textos técnicos, de palestras em eventos e de obras literárias russas.

Background: Although e-portfolios are still a relatively new trend in developing countries, they are becoming an alternative teaching and learning tool in distance education and online environments. Research has placed e-portfolios as channels through which important skills such as self-directed learning, critical thinking, and lifelong learning can be infused. Most research has focused on students’ perceptions of e-portfolios and/or implementation and adoption thereof, and not on how lecturers can design learning objects that foster active student engagement with the e-portfolios. Methodology: Within an interpretive paradigm, the research followed a qualitative approach.

In the Nigerian context however the field experience component of teacher education witnessed an unprecedented setback as the online system that was later activated in some universities failed to factor the component into the alternative arrangement. Given that the present COVID-19 is not likely to be the last, as established by various reports including the World Bank December, 2021 document, the exercise may have to be suspended or delayed whenever there are emergency school closure. This paper attempts to formulate a COVID-19 compliant field experience framework for the Nigerian setting.

This paper describes and summarizes part of the work developed within the pilot-survey, which includes a theoretical review outlining the context of CTs use and its impact on teacher training. First results of the pilot-study, which included four institutions, will be used to present institutional perspectives about CT use. The responses cannot be generalized as wide-reaching statements, but they already reveal that higher education institutions are making an effort to bring together policies and practices.

Thus, the purpose of this article is to review and analyze existing learning management systems (LMS), in order to use their potential in streamlining the learning process. To achieve this goal, the LMS assessment criteria were selected, the most popular open-source distance learning platforms were analyzed; the current LMS Integration capabilities were assessed. For the LMS analysis the following criteria were proposed: Functionality; Reliability; Stability; Cost, Availability of content development tools; SCORM support; Knowledge testing system; Easy to use; Modularity; Ensuring access; Multimedia; Scalability and Extensibility; Multiplatform LMS.

An instrument was designed to calculate the various aspect factors and social networking use intention by using the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information success model (ISSM). A survey was administered among university students of China and Pakistan. The purposed model was empirically tested by PLS-SEM to examine the influential factors on the use of social networking sites.

Cognitive, social, and emotional engagement as part of the MOOCs learning context is a basic principle that prescribes the relationships and interactions between the teacher, student, and learning setting. Each of these components has multiple features and is related to the complex nature of learning and teaching. The qualitative exploratory research design as a case study was conducted with educators and students from two countries – Latvia and Thailand.

The emergence of new learning technologies requires new perspectives on Educational Design. When the areas of MOOCs, Learning Analytics and Instructional Design developed, the interest and connection between these three concepts became important for research. Learning Analytics provides progress information and other individualized support in MOOC settings where teachers are not able to provide learners with individual attention, which would be possible in a traditional face-to-face setting. Through collective views over the learning process, the overall progress and performance are indicated. Moreover, results can lead to Educational Design improvements.
