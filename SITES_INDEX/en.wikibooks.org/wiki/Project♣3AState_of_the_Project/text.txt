This page is being written in preparation for the 3-year anniversary (July 10th, 2006) of Wikibooks, and is to be a formal report presented to the Wikimedia Foundation on behalf of this project.  This is to show off the accomplishments of this project and to let people outside of the Wikibooks community know some of the cool things that are happening here.  --Rob Horning 18:13, 14 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
