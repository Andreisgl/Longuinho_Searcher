The work concerns an acoustic investigation into Saydnaya Military Prison, in Syria, where an estimated thirteen thousand people have been executed by the Assad regime since 2011. The essay begins by situating Saydnaya (the missing 19dB) in relation to Abu Hamdan’s broader artistic, political and jurisprudential project before turning to the work’s specific exemplification of what the artist calls “forensic listening”. In doing so, I draw out the conversation the work inevitably stages with John Cage’s 4’33” (1952). Abu Hamdan’s work can, I suggest, be understood precisely as a critique of the twin conceptions of sound and silence advanced by Cage and taken up by his inheritors. But unlike Cage, Abu Hamdan’s work presents itself as already jurisprudential. It works with, on and against legal techniques and idioms; gathers, presents and interprets evidence; stages virtual trials; and makes explicit doctrinal claims; all with a view to intervening in political struggles in which questions of law are directly implicated. If, in Cage’s thinking, the power relations that produce and mediate sound and silence are systematically elided, for Hamdan, it is precisely these power relations and their material residues that we are asked to listen out for. But it is not a matter of simply appealing to legal structures of critique and condemnation either. In the final analysis, Saydnaya (the missing 19dB) poses “forensic listening” as a technique of resistance available to the least empowered, precisely as a function of their disempowerment in fact, and independent of law’s recognition or authorisation. http://www.index-journal.org/issues/law/part-2-lacunae/forensic-listeningin-lawrence-abu-hamdans-saydnaya-the-missing-19db-by-james-parkerSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSound StudiesSonic lawfare: on the jurisprudence of weaponised sound2018 • James ParkerThis article suggests that the growing literature on sonic warfare has not been as sensitive to the work of law and legal institutions as it might be, and that it is exemplary in this respect of a lot of work in sound studies more generally. Just as jurisprudence must learn to think sonically, sound studies must endeavour to listen jurisprudentially. Across a series of examples – some well-known, others less so – the article draws out some key elements of the jurisprudence of weaponised sound. It shows how law is necessarily implicated in the story of sonic warfare, and not just insofar as it is prohibitive or emancipatory. Law doesn’t simply oppose violence; it authorises and channels it, and increasingly towards the acoustic. In this respect, it is doing more than just expressing or clearing a path for the expression of other forms of power. Law itself is a form of power that, by means of complex institutional architectures across multiple jurisdictions, crucially shapes our sonic worlds.Download Free PDFView PDFA lexicon of law and listeningJames ParkerDownload Free PDFView PDFLaw Text CultureCarceral atmospheres on Manus Island: Listening to how are you today2020 • Emma K RussellThis paper develops a conception of ‘carceral atmospheres’ as a way of framing our encounter with the sound art and archive "how are you today", created by the Manus Recording Project Collective (MRPC). Over a period of fourteen weeks in 2018, this work involved the creation and collection of 84 field recordings by six men indefinitely detained on Manus Island by the Australian government. Highlighting the mobile qualities of sound, each 10-minute field recording was sent from Manus to Melbourne and uploaded for playback as part of the Eavesdropping exhibition, originally staged at the Ian Potter Museum of Art in Melbourne in 2018 and later at City Gallery in Wellington in 2019.Download Free PDFView PDFSurveillance & SocietyThe Resonate Prison: Earwitnessing the Panacoustic Affect2021 • Stephen J . NevillePanacoustic surveillance can be low-intensity and mundane, but when taken to its extreme, it is coordinated with physical violence to create an atmosphere of hallucinatory fear. Our entry point into this problem is through a case study of the Saydnaya torture prison in Syria, a terrifying and opaque architecture of power. This short paper draws from the earwitness art and human rights activism of Lawrence Abu Hamdan concerning Saydnaya in collaboration with Amnesty International: from our analysis of the prison, we extrapolate lessons of panacoustic technologies more broadly, which are not necessarily or immediately violent but nonetheless disempower subjects by constraining their behaviors and rendering walls indefensibly porous. In developing a nascent theory of panacoustic surveillance, this paper makes two distinct contributions to surveillance studies. First, it puts sound and surveillance studies scholars into dialogue to echo Hamdam's argument that walls do not represent an absolute barrier but a corporeal medium by which power and knowledge can permeate and reflect as vibration. Second, our discussion articulates a politics of transparency and accountability that helps rethink notions of actuarial surveillance as not only a form of top-down statistical and biopolitical monitoring and governance but also as a means of developing panacoustic audits that seek to hold governments and other human rights abusers to account.Download Free PDFView PDFAnimated Memories - A case study of the animated documentary 'Saydnaya – Inside a Syrian Torture Prison' (2016) and its potential within social memoryMelina ScheuermannThrough its ability to create images of non-representable incidents animation expands the range and depth of what documentary can represent and how. This master thesis investigates the potential of animated documentary within social memory exemplified by the interactive animated documentary Saydnaya – Inside a Syrian Torture Prison (Forensic Architecture, 2016). By applying a feminist spatial approach, I aim to contribute to the understanding of the role of animated documentary images within social memory. Embodied and haptic spectatorship as well as haptic materiality are crucial in this case study due to the nature of the virtual screen images and interactive navigation (compared to montage) of the architectural 3D model. Testimonies and evidence presented in documentary film require a discursive establishment of truth. Indexicality is discussed in this regard and eventually a theoretical shift towards movement suggested. I demonstrate that Saydnaya extends the strategies in animated documentary that have been in focus so far, such as representing mental states and subjective experiences, by deploying methods of forensic aesthetics. This opens up novel ways to establish truth claims and persuasion in documentary filmmaking that require future research.Download Free PDFView PDFCanvasMAPPING CITIES, MAPPING CULTURES2018 • Melissa GronlundA discussion of Lawrence Abu Hamdan's "earwitness" testimonies and audio-led contemporary art works.Download Free PDFView PDFReading Guide - Law and Sound 2016James ParkerReading guide for a Legal Research course on Law and Sound taught at Melbourne Law School in Semester 1 2016Download Free PDFView PDFArts Stolen Voices Is a Slowly Unfolding Eavesdrop on the East Coast of the UK2019 • Rebecca CollinsStolen Voices is a research enquiry that uses listening as both methodology and material. Stolen Voices develops techniques for 'listening in' and eavesdropping to help articulate an epistemology of place through sonic frameworks. A core motivation for the listening is a semi-fictional story we tell ourselves (and anyone else who is listening): an 'event' has taken place along the East Coast of the United Kingdom (UK), and we have been tasked with figuring out what has happened. While the specifics of the event might be difficult to pin down, the urgency of the investigation is fuelled by concrete concerns found in the UK edgelands, at the border/margin of the country: the uncertain future of the UK's relationship with Europe; the effects of climate change on coastal landscapes; the waning of industries like manufacturing and coal extraction; the oil industry in crisis; the rise of global shipping infrastructures. By using a semi-fictional framework, we move away from mapping techniques like data-sonification towards a methodology that embraces gaps and inventive excesses while insisting on the importance of making an account. Through listening, we foster attention to contingencies and indeterminacies and their relationships to prevailing structures and knowledge hierarchies. Stolen Voices asks: what is the relationship between a listener and what is heard? How can listening attune us to the complexities of contemporary political, economic, ecological and social processes? How did we get to where we are now, and how, through listening, can we seek out levers for change? What do the rhythms and atmospheres of specific geographic locations inform or reveal about history? Evolving over several years, in response to what we hear, the investigation necessarily proceeds slowly. In this article, we unfold our methodological processes for the detection of sound, voices, atmosphere and affect. We use creative-critical writing to evidence the construction of a research investigation focused on the act of listening as a spatial practice and necessarily collective endeavour.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw and LiteratureWhy Art and Law2021 • Joan KeeIntroduction to special issue on "Law and Contemporary Art", vol 33, no. 3Download Free PDFView PDFThe Nordic Journal of AestheticsThe Promise of the Index in Contemporary Documentary PerformanceSolveig GadeThis essay investigates the troubled status of the concept of the index and its concomitant notion of evidence within the context of a global, visual culture. Specifically, the essay centres on the notion of the index in an era, where the use of digital images claiming to truthfully represent war and conflict has become an increasingly important part of warfare. Focusing on two documentary works by respectively performance artist Rabih Mroué and visual artist Abu Lawrence Hamdan (Forensic Architecture), the article shows that whilst both artists rely on material documents, which in each their way index back to conflictual events, the crucial point is not so much the status of the evidentiary material per se. Instead, enabled by fictitious strategies, the artists invite us to pay attention to the differing statuses and meanings assigned to documents depending on the particular knowledge systems and spaces of appearance within which they are perceived. In this way, the essay argues, ...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
