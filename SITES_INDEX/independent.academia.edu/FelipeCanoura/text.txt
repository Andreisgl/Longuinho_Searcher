The geometries found are obtained by solving the equations of motion of supergravity coupled to a suitable continuous distribution of flavor branes. The background obtained preserves two supersymmetries. We find that when N_c\ge 2N_f the behavior of the solutions is compatible with having an asymptotically free dual gauge theory with dynamical quarks. On the contrary, when N_c&lt;2N_f the theory develops a Landau pole in the UV. We also find a new family of (unflavored) backgrounds generated by D5-branes that wrap a three-cycle of a cone with G_2 holonomy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We provide a precise field theory dual and a detailed analysis of the duality cascade which describes its RG flow. Matchings of beta functions and anomalies between the field theory and the string setup are presented. We give an understanding of Seiberg duality as a large gauge transformation on the RR and NSNS potentials. We also analyze the UV behavior of the field theory, that as suggested by the string background can be associated with a duality wall.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the case of D3-branes, we recover the known three-cycles dual to the dibaryonic operators of the gauge theory and we also find a new family of supersymmetric embeddings. Supersymmetric configurations of D5-branes, representing fractional branes, and of spacetime filling D7-branes (which can be used to add flavor) are also found. Stable non supersymmetric configurations corresponding to fat strings and domain walls are found as well.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our d... more We study the stringy description of N=1 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory on R^{1,2} X S^1. Our description is based on the known Klebanov-Strassler and Maldacena-Nunez solutions, properly modified to account for the compact dimension. The presence of this circle turns out to be a non trivial modification and it leads us to consider the up-lifted eleven dimensional solution. We discuss some of its properties. Perhaps the most interesting one is that extra BPS M-branes are present. These generate a non-perturbative superpotential that we explicitly compute. Our findings, besides their interest in the gauge-string correspondence, may also have applications in the cosmological KKLT and KKLMMT scenarios.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Thesis we concentrate on the study of the extension of the AdS/CFT correspondence to theories with less supersymmetry. In particular, we search for the possibility of adding supersymmetric D-branes in type IIB supergravity solutions which are dual to N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. In the probe approximation we perform a systematic analysis of the possible supersymmetric D-brane configurations in backgrounds dual to N=1 superconformal field theories, firstly in the AdS_5xY^{p,q} solutions and then in their generalisation to the AdS_5xL^{a,b,c} backgrounds. Some checks of the correspondence between D-brane configurations and chiral operators of the dual gauge theory are performed. We also analyse the possible supersymmetric D5-brane configurations dual to defects (of codimension one and two) in N=1 SYM theory in the framework of the Maldacena-Nunez solution. Beyond the probe approximation, we develop techniques in order to take into account the ba...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
