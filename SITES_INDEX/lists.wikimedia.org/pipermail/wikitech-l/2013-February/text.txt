Google's announced that they will run Google Summer of Code again this
year, and we plan to apply.  I've updated
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2013 and I'd love for
potential mentors to add their ideas to
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mentorship_programs/Possible_projects .
Note that this year students are expected to work on their project June
17-September 23, so mentors would also be needed during that period, and
somewhat less April 8th-June 17th for talking with potential candidates
and helping with the community bonding period.
