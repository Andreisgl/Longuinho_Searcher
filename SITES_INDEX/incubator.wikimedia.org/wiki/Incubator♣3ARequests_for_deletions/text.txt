Wikinews projects in languages of the Russian Federation
I'll wait to see how people respond here. I do keep in mind how much work it takes to keep a Wikinews project going. However, all three of these languages have Wikipedias already, so they presumably could have Wikinews projects if they wish (and get that far). And as the ongoing situation with Western Armenian Wikipedia attests, we can also manage to approve a project that has incubation content in two different places.

Wn/tt
I'm a bit confused by this test project, this looks like a Tatar language edition of Wikinews test project, which is however, according to Meta-Wiki notes, the Russian Wikinews already served Wikinews in this language, and a list of Tatar pages can also be found at n:ru:Категория:Бастырылган, so I'm wondering if Tatar users really wanna split their project or not.

Russian Wikinews community deserves our gratitude for helping us within their Domestic multilingualism project, into which I contribute regularly. I would recommend to keep the separate test project, as it might eventually be better for us to move Tatar Wikinews into its own domain. At the moment, UG TAT members mainly concentrate  their efforts in ttWP, but we already start seeing the benefits of having separate WikiBooks & see similar potential utility in the separate Wikinews (to lower the mandatory translation into Russian hurdle, which might eventually contribute into increasing participation). --Frhdkazan (talk) 12:08, 17 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I'm also confusing since there's problem with co-existing for two places for one language edition, because of Akan and Twi problem. --60.26.9.13 07:12, 4 January 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]

These are two different approaches with different goals. For us, the test project is the predecessor of the project entirely in Sakha. Sakha news in the Russian Wikinews is a way to popularize Wikinews in the Sakha Republic, a way to support its Russian colleagues, a way to spread important republican news, as well as training. --HalanTul (talk) 22:52, 17 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
For all
Keep. These are two different approaches with different goals. There is writing multilingual news on Russian Wikinews. But here are separate language editions of  Wikinews on Incubator. These approaches are not interchangeable. I hope these two independent approaches together will help create own Wikinews editions for these languages. --sasha (krassotkin) 17:41, 17 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Keep, per above. By way, was created "soft redirect" for Wn/ba. Maybe would be a good idea to create similar templates for other languages from this list. --Kaganer (talk) 20:38, 18 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
We can do that eventually. But we'd handle it differently, since projects also exist here. Hold off for the moment. StevenJ81 (talk) 21:12, 18 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Yes, this may be combined: Project design in the Incubator and working space in the Russian Wikinews. --Kaganer (talk) 22:51, 20 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Keep per above from top to bottom: it's true that two approaches can be later combined and interlinked. This, I believe, will help in integration and training because all national speakers also speak Russian and talk in Russian to each other. Many (or most) multilingual Wikinews stories written during this project describe events related to Wikimedia across Russia: all that serves global development of Wikimedia movement. In the past I also was trying to collaborate with English Wikinews, because a lot of these people also speak English (1, 2, 3, 4), but now they seem to possess unacceptable policies. Russian Wikinews have valuable experience useful for future, e. g. multiple interface translations. So that, this is just the way to go. --Ssr (talk) 15:25, 7 January 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
 Not done It seems there are good reasons to keep parallel efforts going for now. I'm going to take any similar requests as being off-limits for a minimum of one year.

You make a fair point. I'll try to get to these in the next few days. StevenJ81 (talk) 22:58, 6 February 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Oppose for Wp/pst, it's just a rural area speaked dialect of Pashto, and has no significant differents between other Pashto dialects (for more reason of this, consult @The Amjad: separately) and that, hence the pst speakers should better keep contributing the Pashto Wikipedia ps.wikipedia.org, no oppose comments for others, aka feel free to delete others. --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 23:55, 6 February 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
 Done, except with respect to Wp/pst.
Wn/kk, Wp/apd, Wp/zro, Wp/ruo deleted.
Wp/ukl reset.
@Liuxinyu970226, The Amjad: Based on the Wikipedia article, I read the situation on Central Pashto differently: that it is a standardized, prestige dialect of Pashto. That would probably make it even more likely not to be appropriate for its own project separate from the existing Pashto Wikipedia. But before I finalize this, can anyone please commment? StevenJ81 (talk) 14:52, 19 February 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Recreation of Wp/rus
@Kaganer, Левъ Царёвъ, Timsher71: As noted above, and as I said at Talk:Wp/rus/Главная страница, this is not going to happen on Incubator or anywhere else in Wikimedia. (Belarus was a grandfathered case, and would not be allowed to happen today.) I intend to archive and delete this content in ten days. StevenJ81 (talk) (administrator) 13:16, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@StevenJ81: Hello, I would like to challenge your decision to delete the project Wp/rus. This project aims to make encyclopedic information more accessible to Russian people reading and writing in traditional spelling. The expansion of the information space is included in the objectives of the Wikimedia project. Also, this section may be useful to Russians reading in modern spelling, expanding their horizons and promoting general education. Creating articles in pre-reform spelling on Russian Wikipedia (ru.wikipedia.org) is difficult for two reasons: firstly, automatic translation of articles from new to old spelling is not possible due to the dynamism of the pre-reform Russian language (this means that each article will need to be rewritten manually); secondly, will the coexistence of articles in the new and old spelling in Russian Wikipedia be acceptable? However, if you consider it possible for us to continue working within the framework of the Russian Wikipedia, we could transfer our activities. — Левъ Царёвъ (talk) 14:39, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@StevenJ81: This is "exotical" case, but - IMHO - that project may be implemented. There are many sources written using this spelling. And there are also many activists who practice writing in this spelling. If they prove that they are capable of supporting and developing such a project for a long time, then it would be wise to provide them with such a hosting. --Kaganer (talk) 15:26, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
PS: I understand your reluctance to see this case, but you did not bring rational arguments. This is a bad decision-making style in a public project. It makes me sad. The simple word "because" would make this statement more correct. --Kaganer (talk) 15:30, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
edit conflict @Kaganer, Левъ Царёвъ, Timsher71: I'll provide some time for discussion, and after discussion I will take to LangCom and discuss. Still, at least according to the ordinary rules, you would have to demonstrate the following (which are not necessarily in a particular order):
The community at Russian Wikipedia is not willing to include articles written in pre-reform Russian.
There is a community of people who need pre-reform Russian who cannot read modern Russian. Note: If this community is avoiding Russian Wikipedia over political or ideological issues, LangCom will say no.
You may also have to explain why working on the existing project at Wikia/Fandom is problematic, or why moving the project to the new Incubator Plus 2.0 on Miraheze and working on it there would be a problem.
The fact that sources exist is not relevant in and of itself. If Russian Wikisource wouldn't allow such documents (unlikely), we'd put source documents like that on Multilingual Wikisource. But the rules are different for Wikipedia, and I'm having a hard time seeing why you need to do this. StevenJ81 (talk) 15:41, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Technical note: Wp/rus is satisfactory for this purpose while in Incubator, assuming the project is allowed to stay here. It will complicate my life for you to create a whole tagged code like ru-x-old or something like that. We'll worry about a final coding for this if and only if the project is allowed to stay here and eventually becomes ready for creation as an independent wiki. StevenJ81 (talk) 15:45, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@StevenJ81: Hello. The spelling question in Russia is cultural, not political. The traditional spelling allows to convey more layers and nuances of meanings. Russian philologist N. Pertsov points that Pushkin's works (and, of course, the works of any other Russian author that uses the traditional spelling) lose the nuances of meanings when published using the simplified spelling. By the way, if the Bielorussian case cannot be an example, there is a Chinese case with two spellings, traditional and simplified. My English isn't good, sorry. :) --Timsher71 (talk) 18:57, 23 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]

ISO-3 code "rus" for pre-1917-revolution orthography of Russian is lie. This code is for modern Russian (https://www.ethnologue.com/language/rus). Wiki cannot be created for language without ISO code, as far as I know. MBH (talk) 04:19, 24 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I think, it's senseless to create pre-reform-Russian wiki. There are no people who can read pre-reform Russian and can't read modern (this people were in post-revolution Russian emigration, but all died). See local discussion. MBH (talk) 04:27, 24 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@MBH: Hello. You're wrong. Descendants of white emigrants live and now, I am one of them. Some, like me, continue to write in pre-reform spelling. For me, this spelling is native and I am not comfortable reading Soviet spelling. Yes, I can optionally read Soviet spelling, but it’s harder for me. It's as hard as reading «lenguaj» instead of «language», «kuin» instead of «queen». — Левъ Царёвъ (talk) 20:20, 28 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Здесь есть некоторая ошибка в логике. Тот аргумент, что нету людей, которые могли бы читать дореформенную орфография, но не могли  бы современную - ничего особенного не означает. Википедия на языке Саха существует, хотя все её авторы и читатели наверняка владеют русским языком. --Kaganer (talk) 19:28, 25 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
There are also projects in North American and Australian aboriginal languages, even though generally those communities are fluent in English and/or French. But (a) they're still different languages, and (b) because of that, they potentially cover locally notable subject material that doesn't make the cut in a larger Wikipedia.  In this case, LangCom will want to understand if there is a community that is going to be served that is not adequately served by ruwiki. Also ... I'm finding it a little hard to believe that the layers and nuances in the traditional spelling matter a lot in something like an encyclopedia.
Let me also point out that this has been requested previously. See m:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Pre-reform Russian. Is there a new argument you make that is not already made there? StevenJ81 (talk) 20:08, 26 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@StevenJ81: Hello. As I wrote above, I and other emigrants (as well as all Russians) can write and read if desired in Soviet spelling. But this spelling is harder for us. It is not perceived by us, it is not dear to us. It’s also hard and unpleasant, as you read and write “mather” instead of “mother”, “pis” instead of “peace”, “lav” instead of “love”, etc. Other arguments have already been named. But for me the most important thing is to write as my ancestors wrote. The modern Russian language, especially the literary one, is in decline (that is how I perceive it). And at the time of this crash, I hope to create a resource that reflects a holistic, clean, convenient and native language for me. — Левъ Царёвъ (talk) 20:48, 28 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Question: Would it be possible to create a script converter between the standard and pre-reform orthographies (similar to Serbian, which has a Cyrillic-Latin converter)? If such a thing were to exist, it would eliminate the need for a separate Wikipedia in pre-reform Russian, while still allowing people who want to write in pre-reform orthography to contribute to Russian Wikipedia. DraconicDark (talk) 15:16, 31 August 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@DraconicDark: You are absolutely right: the creation of a converter would resolve this issue without the need to create a separate Wikipedia section. However, this is not possible for several reasons. Many words, which are written differently in traditional spelling, began to be written equally in the reformed one. For a competent translation, it is often necessary to refer to the context and meaning of the phrase. So, for example, Tolstoy’s novel “War and Peace” in Soviet spelling is written as “Война и мир”, and there are two versions of the translation into the traditional spelling: “Война и миръ” and “Война и міръ”. You should also distinguish between the words "всѣ" and "все", which are often spelled the same in a reformed spelling: "все." There are different rules for writing the letters “e” and “o” in traditional and reformed spelling (writing depends on the openness/closedness of the syllable). In traditional spelling, feminine plural endings are distinguished. In reformed endings, masculine and feminine are spelled the same. In general, one can long list groups of words and constructions that cannot be translated into traditional spelling. — Левъ Царёвъ (talk) 22:56, 1 September 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]

@Liuxinyu970226: Good afternoon. The fact is that the Old Russian language and the language in which the Traditional Russian Wikipedia is compiled are two different languages. Traditional Russian Wikipedia is written in modern Russian (which, of course, has some differences from the language in which Russian Wikipedia is written). Old Russian is the ancestor of Russian.
In addition, I should note that the project of “Old Russian Wikipedia” is compiled by amateurs who do not know the Old Russian language at all. This can already be judged even by their name: “Вікіпѣдіѩ” (the letter “ѣ” cannot be written in this word, since it is not Slavic; the letter “ѩ” also cannot be used here, it should be written or “ѧ” or “ꙗ”). — Левъ Царёвъ (talk) 13:29, 12 September 2019 (UTC).Reply[reply]

I am almost completely certain that this is a hoax. The language, Ghotuo, for which it is very difficult to find any material online, is an Edoid language, so there should at least be some similarity to the Edo language, for which it is a bit easier to find matierial online. To me it reads more like a Romance- or Germanic-inspired conlang than anything. The one user who has contributed to this test started off by creating 5-word articles for several years, and likewise for letters, and created articles on a couple of international companies. There is nothing of substance, and it just looks like it was made up for the purpose of this Incubator.

This project is dead and I think that it should be deleted completely. There is no point in keeping the 17 pages of the project, since there is little Ter Sami on them. These pages consist either of a proper noun and 1 word of Ter or 1 word of Ter, the "abbreviation" for Russian in Ter and the word in Russian. A picture has been added to each page to pad out the bytes. There is one redirect as well as one page in Russian and English about the project. There are thus 17 words of Ter in the whole project, yet only 12 unique words since the word for mountain лыэһке (lɨehke in the version of the orthography used on this project) is repeated on 5 of those pages. -Yupik (talk) 07:08, 28 March 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]

However the 17 individual articles (created in 2011) are one word stubs and could possibly be deleted since no one has expanded it for 9 years now. Since Ter Sami speakers reside in Russia and this is the easternmost Sami language, the Ter Sami's may actually find it more practical to  contribute in the Ter Sami cyrillic alphabet. --Ernesztina (talk) 08:00, 19 April 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]

While I agree the decision for a test **Wikipedia** (which requires the language to have active modern use), I contest such decision for Wiktionary and Wikisource (which is meant to contain reliable historic data as part of important human culture which can still be studied actively, especially for hosting a free dictionary of that language, and a free collection of historic source texts, that may also benefit from OCR efforts in Wikisource).
"Extinct language" is only valid for denying a test for Wikipedia, or Wikinews, and probably Wikiquote (though you won't hear anybody speaking it in the medias or in new books, the only reliable source would be in old books, i.e. hosting these citations in the test Wikisource).
Also I don't see the relation with "Miraheze" suggested above. And Incubator Plus does not even exists 2 years after this unjustified decision which is un fact inapplicable. Incubator is just fine for hosting many minor languages, even extinct ones that have little contents (glossaries, reconstructed languages like proto-Indo-European and other proto-languages which are very actively studied by linguists, because they have lot of interests in relation with the modern languages that followed them and are interesting to understand how these modern languages have evolved or of terms were native natural phonetic evolutions, or adaptations in contact with other languages and cultures, or if they were borrowed. This also helps understanding the foundation of the modern syntax/grammar, and helps modern language to preserve their inheritage and being recognizable even when they borrow and adapt terms from other languages. It helps modern speakers to keep their language active, and sometimes it helps revitalization efforts. And finally many historic records will be better understood and can become proofs to explain or justify why we need to preserve the ability to read or understand past languages, when these records show what may happen again in the future. We need the lessons of the past to avoid repeating the same past errors. Verdy p (talk) 23:45, 13 September 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]
An I'm sure that our public libraries in the world have tons of old documents and books that need to be preserved in some way, and that risk to disappear for lack of money or because of political troubles in some areas or because of wars/conflicts and sabotages. Preserving them as facsimiles also has a huge cost compared to preserving at least the OCR'ed texts that would facilitate the efforts to read or understand them.
We need a free online archive of historic texts, accessible to the world and not just a few specialists living in dangerous areas, and Wikisource was created for that, including for communities that have fled the areas of conflicts or misery and that could help revitalize and honor their past culture and be proud of it, even if they no longer use these languages in their modern life. Many of these libraries are in danger and they could benefit from help by a diverse community of a few passionate spread all around the world, some of the developing expertise in these languages (there may exist new Champollion's starting to work isolately to help decrypt old texts as long as they are preserved; later these works may prove to be important).
Note that for archives of historic texts, "OldWikisource" may be useful. But it's not very well suited for hosting glossaries and linguistic research papers trying to organize it as an open dictionary (even if there remains many unknown items or items that need further work for hypotheses (often justified by making comparisons and using any other documents produced at the same epoch or by old travelmen, explorer and merchants that have left their testimonials, which are of course oriented but whose source can at least be asserted and dated).

Abkhazian is only the official language of an unrecognised Russian puppet state, where most people speak only Russian in the first place. But politics aside, I do think all these bogus test wikis with no absolute content in the language itself should be deleted immediately. They are far more badly in need of deletion than wikis in ancient languages, since they create the false impression that we actually have relevant content in the languages they purport to represent. There's no reason to keep them, and nothing at all will be lost by their deletion. If, in the future, a competent speaker wants to recreate them, s/he can go ahead. Steinbach (talk) 11:02, 5 March 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Indeed. Deleting this only increases administrative work. If someone starts the test, they usually do not make the info page, which means it has to be recreated anyway in case it is noticed. --OWTB (talk) 15:17, 5 March 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I was planning to nominate all of these no-content test wikis for deletion in the near future, but apparently there's no consensus about it. So let's discuss the matter here and apply our decision to all of these.
You (Ooswesthoesbes) object to the administrative work deletion gives. By that argument, you may never delete a test wiki, since all of this causes some work. These empty test wikis can be deleted without further notice. They don't even have to be moved, only two pages ([Wx/xxx/] and [Wx/xxx/Main Page]) have to be deleted. The work on that is minimal.
On the other hand, a lot would be gained. It will make Incubator a lot less messy, and people who don't speak a language and create a content-free test wiki just because they want to see it created are no longer rewarded for their stupidity. Of course if there is even the smallest bit of relevant content, the test wiki should be kept (or at least, deletion should be discussed). But if nothing is lost by deletion, just clean it up. Steinbach (talk) 09:51, 6 March 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Ooswesthoesbes, Steinbach: I have no strong comments but, as Category:Incubator:Test wikis/status/tocreate said: This category usually has about 25–30 entries...

Wp/orv
In fact, the (spoken) language of East Slavic lands was not standartised and was heavily divided into dialects. The literary language of Kievan Rus', the Principality of Moscow, and other East Slavic territories was Church Slavonic, the Wikipedia in this language already exists. The language which could be used in this project, even in the most positive case, will be a sort of language reconstruction and an attempt to create a literary language for people who lived in the 10th-16th centuries (sounds like a nonsense itself).This abandoned project is claiming to be in Old East Slavic language, but actually looks like an ridiculous fantasy on how Proto-Russian(?) might look like. You have not to be a professional linguist to see that the pages are actually written either in modern Russian with archaic spelling and archaic formulating (like Wp/orv/Єстоніѩ, Wp/orv/Їспаніѩ), or in modern Russian with schizophrenic spelling which very roughly imitates the pre-1918 (!) Russian (like Wp/orv/Зѣмлѩ, where "и" replaced with "і", "я" with "ѩ", and "е" with "ѣ", the last one even in the beginning of a word and it was absolutely impossible in any early forms of the Cyrillic orthography), or in modern Russian unchanged (the 'project' policies: Wp/orv/Википедия:Контакты, Wp/orv/Википедия:Крым, Wp/orv/Википедия:К удалению). There are many bold calques from other languages, including modern, especially in country names - from Latin, modern Polish, modern Russian, as well as weird innovations like *Тѣвтоніѩ (*Tevtoniya) for Germany - it's like if you call Ukraine as 'Scythia' or Armenia as 'Urartu'.In the end, I don't know why the Wp/orv is still existing and how can this be justified. --Wolverène (talk) 08:42, 16 September 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
P.S. What a perfect coincidence -- two minutes before I created the request, a brand new article (Wp/orv/Пакистанъ‎ = Pakistan) has been created.

P.S.S. I must clarify a thing - I was a little bit wrong saying that "ѣ" in the beginning of words was absolutely impossible - actually not quite so, in pre-1918 Russian it was in the beginning of just two roots - ѣх-/ѣзд- (meaning "ride"), and ѣд-/ѣм-/ѣс- (meaning "eat").

@Илья Драконов: I have to clarify it to fix the misconception which you probably have - cu: is not in Old East Slavic, it's in Church Slavonic (of the South Slavic branch, actually), we are talking here about the possibility for Wp/orv - the Wikipedia in  Old East Slavic, whose era was ended in 15th century with the division into Ruthenian (ancestor of modern Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn) and dialects of the Principality of Moscow that weren't standardized until the 18th century, thanks to domination of Church Slavonic as literary language and local laws which usually didn't approve even that small number of secular texts in any language but Ch.S..Either Ruthenian, or the dialects that were spoken in the Tsardom of Russia and might be called 'Old Russian' don't have own ISO codes. So anyway, there are only one of two possible choices - the Wp/orv either should be in Old East Slavic language existed until the 14-15th centuries, or there should be nothing to write here, thankfully we have Incubator Plus, where everyone is free to fantasize how a 'Stardard Moscow language' might've looked like in the 17th century.deleting it is quite dum(c) - Just request the help by professional Slavicists, let them evaluate such words as *Тѣвтоніѩ, *Єстоніѩ, *ѩвлѩѣтсѩ, *ѣдiнствѣнноѣ, *насѣлённоѣ, etc. I think they could say much more than just "dum", there's smth more to describe these, like "nonsenseful", "profane", "sacrilegious"...P.S. Can I avoid to comment your statements about the lack of people to edit this stuff, and about the comparison between Latin and Old East Slavic, please? The truth will surely make upset us both.@Liuxinyu970226: I supported the Meta-Wiki RFC proposal, but my idea was not in simple allowance of any ancient/historical languages, I believe there should be special and maybe very strict policy for these languages. I just think that the projects in languages of the past should have a chance, without statements that it's 100% impossible for them to be verified as eligible. However, I'm not sure which else ones can be approved, except Ancient Greek, Coptic (for some reason this one is approved already), and maybe a couple of others. Unfortunately, a project in Old East Slavic will never have same educational or informative purpose which Wikipedias in Church Slavonic, Latin, Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali, Old English, or in Gothic demonstrate. --Wolverène (talk) 13:28, 19 September 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
My opinion is to Delete, as the nominator said, all the contents are not really "Old Russian", and are modern Russian clauses with somewhat a lot of rough code-switches. --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 04:09, 19 September 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
If you ask me, Keep. I have no claim to judge the content there however if it gets deleted, that means that people in the future who might want to create such a test wiki will most likely be discouraged by the fact that one exists and was deleted. -Gifnk dlm 2020 If only Middle English Wikipedia could be saved(talk) 08:15, 2 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
It should be discouraged, not encouraged, because there's really entirely no "Old Russian" speakers, non of the orv contents are maintained by speakers or !voters, rather all the orv contents I found are "maintained" by spammers. Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 07:36, 5 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Delete I’ve only had a cursory look over this project, and I can only speculate on the potential viability of such an encyclopedia. But what I’m seeing in this very tiny start is not optimistic. What first caught my attention is the use of the English name “Old Russian language,” in place of the neutral w:Old East Slavic. The English Wikipedia article tells us that although it still sees use, “Old Russian” is a misnomer for the ancestor of two or three modern languages that are not Russian: Belarusian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian. You’d hope a pilot project that wants to justify its own existence would not completely ignore its black-and-white neutrality policy in defining itself. The language is also blatantly associated with the Russian national tricolour on the Main Page. But that’s not all. The article on the Modern Russian language is titled with what appears to be a made-up name, “Novo-Russian language.” Ukraine is named by not its modern name (attested in 1187 and used specifically for the country by the fifteenth century), not by the Medieval ecclesiastical Mala(ia) Rus’ (equivalent to Latin “Ruthenia minor”), but by the imperial Russian formula Malorussia (“Little-Russia”), its national language Malorusskiĭ (“Little Russian”), and its people referred to as Malorossy, or “Little-Russians,” in Russian with archaic spelling. This terminology is anachronistic, non-neutral colonizers’ names, that many consider outright racist (one commentor says “have you lost it with your ‘Little Russia’?,” and no one has thought to respond or address the problem). Other issues also attest to a non-neutral political bias: Sevastopol appears without comment in a list of cities of Russia, ignoring that it is internationally recognized as annexed or occupied Ukraine, Sukhumi is apparently in the independent state of Abkhazia, without mentioning these are internationally recognized as in Georgia. Finally, to my untrained eye, lots of the writing does look like straight Modern Russian with a text filter applied. So if this project has positive potential as an encyclopedic repository, I don’t see the evidence. My impression is of someone cosplaying the glory days of the “Old Russian” empire on their private website, or worse, using Wikimedia to share their pro-Kremlin views of the world. —Mzajac (talk) 15:15, 5 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Why not to change it to Old East Slavic and add a notice in the articles that exist? -Gifnk dlm 2020 If only Middle English Wikipedia could be saved(talk) 13:49, 7 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Why not? Because there's entirely no benefits to do so at a galance, as said, We should discourage this, not encourage this, otherwise we even don't need the wiki. Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 00:38, 8 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Wy/orv
It's not just useless to try to tell the citizens of Medieval Moscow how to arrive to Constantinopole using the Old East Slavic Wikivoyage - I guess they would've been extremely scared by just one look at computer or any other satan's invention. --Wolverène (talk) 09:31, 16 September 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Delete per above, nothing is in a good "Old Russian" grammar, looks like patchworks. Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 00:35, 8 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Keep this project have only 1 article because articles of NR deblocked was deleted. And, if we restart these articles, we have a good project!

Wp/crf
This project was using wrong language code, and now moved to the correct one, as crf is an extinct language called Caramanta, that is unrelated to crs, I see no reason why Wp/crf redirect should still keep. --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 10:56, 24 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Yes, providing all links are updated. --OWTB (talk) 07:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
