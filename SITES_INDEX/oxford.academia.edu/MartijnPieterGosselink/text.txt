Whether it affects the outcome of sacral neuromodulation is unknown. We compared the functional results of sacral neuromodulation for faecal incontinence in patients with and without a high-grade internal rectal prolapse. One hundred six consecutive patients suffering from faecal incontinence, who were eligible for sacral neuromodulation between 2009 and 2012, were identified from a prospective database. All patients underwent preoperative defaecating proctography, anorectal manometry and ultrasound. Symptoms were assessed preoperatively and at 12 months after operation using a standardized questionnaire incorporating the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI range = 0-61) and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Success was defined as a decrease in the FISI score of 50 % or more. High-grade internal rectal prolapse (HIRP) was found in 36 patients (34%). The patient characteristics were similar in both groups. Temporary test stimulation was successful in 60 patients without HIRP (86%) and in 25 patients with HIRP (69 %) (p = 0.03). A permanent pulse generator was then implanted on these patients. After 1-year follow-up, the median FISI was reduced in patients without HIRP from 37 to 23 (p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.01). No significant change in FISI score was observed in patients with a HIRP (FISI, 38 to 34; p = 0.16). Quality of life (GIQLI) was only improved in patients without HIRP. A successful outcome per protocol was achieved in 31 patients without HIRP (52%) versus 4 patients with HIRP (16%) (p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The presence of a high-grade internal rectal prolapse has a detrimental effect on sacral neuromodulation for faecal incontinence.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Local repair and flap advancement techniques have a high incidence of recurrence with poor functional outcomes. Transperineal repair with anal sphincter reconstruction, when indicated, and placement of a Martius flap (bulbocavernosus pedicled transplant) result in improved rates of repair and better functional outcomes. A consecutive series of patients were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database between 2002 and 2006. Data were gathered from 2 colon- and rectal-specialty practices. Patient demographics and operative and functional outcomes were documented. Sixteen patients with a mean age of 39.5 years (17-62) were treated. Etiology of the fistula was obstetric (9), cryptoglandular (5), and Crohn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s disease (2). They had undergone a mean of 1.5 (0-4) prior repairs, and 6 had a preexisting diverting stoma before repair. Preoperatively, anal sphincter disruption was identified in 11 patients, and fecal incontinence was identified in 5 patients all with anal sphincter disruption. Dyspareunia was identified in 1 of 13 sexually active patients preoperatively. At a mean follow-up of 75 weeks (24-190), 1 recurrent fistula was identified (6.2%). Stomas were reversed in all patients. Two patients complained of fecal incontinence postoperatively. Five patients had dyspareunia postoperatively (5/16, 31%). One patient had a labial wound complication requiring local wound care. Selected complex RVF can be reliably repaired with good functional outcomes using the Martius flap with anal sphincter reconstruction. Persistent or recurrent fecal incontinence and dyspareunia are common sequela of the underlying perineal injury and repair. No acute or delayed morbidity related to the Martius flap was identified.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Biomechanical assessment of the skin may provide further insight into the aetiology of this complex condition. Elastin fibres are an abundant and integral part of many extracellular matrices and are especially critical for providing the property of elastic recoil to tissues. The significance of elastin fibres is clearly reflected by the numerous human conditions in which a skin phenotype occurs as a result of elastin fibre abnormalities. METHOD: Between January and June 2013, skin specimens were obtained prospectively during surgery on 20 patients with rectal prolapse and 21 patients without prolapse undergoing surgery for other indications.

Quality of life (QOL) and functional outcome are important aspects when valuing a new technique. The aim of this prospective study was to assess both functional outcome and QOL after TAMIS. From 2011 to 2013, patients were prospectively studied prior to and at least 6 months after TAMIS for rectal adenomas and low-risk T1 carcinomas using a single-site laparoscopy port. Functional outcome was determined using the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). Quality of life was measured using functional [Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL)] and generic (EuroQol EQ-5D) questionnaires. The study population consisted of 24 patients 13 men, median age 59 (range 42-83) with 24 tumours [median distance from the dentate line 8 cm (range 2-17 cm); median tumour size 6 cm(2) (range 0.25-51 cm(2)); 20 adenomas; 4 low-risk T1 carcinomas]. Post-operative complications occurred in one patient (4 %; grade IIIb according to Clavien Dindo classification). Compared to baseline, FISI remained unaffected (9.8 vs 7.3; P = 0.26), FIQL remained unaffected, and EuroQol EQ-5D improved (EQ-VAS: 77 vs 83; P = 0.04). There was no detrimental effect of TAMIS on anorectal function. Overall QOL was improved after TAMIS, probably due to removal of the tumour, and at 6 months was equal to the general population.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Therefore, sphincter preserving procedures have been developed for the treatment of high transsphincteric fistulas, such as flap repair. In most hospitals, fistulotomy is still the treatment of choice for low transsphincteric fistula, passing through the lower third of the external anal sphincter. Although this procedure is considered simple and effective with a minimal risk of incontinence, data suggest that the risk of diminished fecal continence is not insignificant.

It has been reported that smoking, obesity, and previous attempts at repair adversely affect the outcome of transanal advancement flap repair. Because these findings could not be confirmed by other studies, it is still unclear whether these and other factors have an impact on the outcome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of outcome in a large cohort of patients who underwent transanal advancement flap repair for a high transsphincteric fistula. DESIGN: This study was performed as a retrospective review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Erasmus MC, between 2000 and 2012.

Most of these fistulas have no external opening and they are frequently associated with a high intersphincteric and/or supralevator abscess. Division of a large amount of internal anal sphincter by extended fistulotomy has a potential risk of diminished fecal continence. The aim of this study was to evaluate flap repair combined with drainage of associated abscesses in high intersphincteric fistulas. This study was performed as a retrospective review. The study was conducted at the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Erasmus MC, between March 1995 and February 2011.

Two hundred patients with a high transsphincteric fistula underwent transanal advancement flap repair and 100 patients with a low transsphincteric fistula underwent fistulotomy or ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract(LIFT) at the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam. Various patient and fistula characteristics were assessed. Data were analysed by means of logistic regression. Low transsphincteric fistulae occurred more frequently in females (43% low transsphincteric fistulae vs. 30%high transsphincteric fistulae; P&lt;0.05). The internal opening of these fistulae was predominantly located anteriorly (76% vs. 18% in high transsphincteric fistulae; P&lt;0.001). Mean age at surgery was lo...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Predictors of Outcome After Transanal Advancement Flap Repair for High Transsphincteric FistulasDiseases of the Colon & RectumBACKGROUND: Transanal advancement flap repair fails in 1 of every 3 patients with a high transsph... more BACKGROUND: Transanal advancement flap repair fails in 1 of every 3 patients with a high transsphincteric fistula. It has been reported that smoking, obesity, and previous attempts at repair adversely affect the outcome of transanal advancement flap repair. Because these findings could not be confirmed by other studies, it is still unclear whether these and other factors have an impact on the outcome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of outcome in a large cohort of patients who underwent transanal advancement flap repair for a high transsphincteric fistula. DESIGN: This study was performed as a retrospective review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Erasmus MC, between 2000 and 2012. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 252 patients with a high transsphincteric fistula of cryptoglandular origin were included. Patients with a rectovaginal or Crohn fistula were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent transana...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Treatment of anal fistulas with high intersphincteric extensionDiseases of the Colon & RectumIntersphincteric fistulas with a high upward extension, up to or above the level of the puborecta... more Intersphincteric fistulas with a high upward extension, up to or above the level of the puborectal muscle, in the intersphincteric plane are rare. Most of these fistulas have no external opening and they are frequently associated with a high intersphincteric and/or supralevator abscess. Division of a large amount of internal anal sphincter by extended fistulotomy has a potential risk of diminished fecal continence. The aim of this study was to evaluate flap repair combined with drainage of associated abscesses in high intersphincteric fistulas. This study was performed as a retrospective review. The study was conducted at the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Erasmus MC, between March 1995 and February 2011. Fourteen patients with a cryptoglandular fistula with high intersphincteric extension were included. Transanal advancement flap repair combined with intersphincteric and/or extrasphincteric drainage of associated abscesses was performed. Preoperatively, patients underwent en...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
