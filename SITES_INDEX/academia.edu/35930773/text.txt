Despite the volume of documents, Mesopotamian slavery remains elusive in its general traits. This is partly due to the nature of the sources, but also to the approaches and interpretations of modern scholars. Slavery in ancient Mesopotamia has been the focus of several studies in the 1960s and 1970s that interpreted the sources using comparative approaches and Marxist analyses. Since then, the topic has seldom been revisited. In this article, I present the status quaestionis with an overview of the available sources and related studies, together with a sketch of the different types of bonded and forced labor in the Neo-Sumerian period (21st cent. bce).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Children of Slaves in Early Mesopotamian Laws and Edicts (RA 111)Nicholas  ReidIn recent years, the study of slavery has taken greater interest in the status of children. This article attempts to understand how the social status of the children of slaves was considered in early Mesopotamia by primarily considering laws and inscriptions. Like most slavery studies, much of the information we possess about slaves and slavery in the ancient Near East comes to us through the elites. This study seeks to utilize the textual material to gain insight into life at the bottom. The perspectives offered highlight potential ways in which people could experience downward social movement as well as the more restricted means of upward mobility, exposing not only the vulnerability of the children of slaves but also the vulnerability of the women who bore them. Ces dernières années, les recherches sur l’esclavage se sont de plus en plus intéressées au statut des enfants. Cet article tente de comprendre ce qui constituait le statut social des enfants d’esclaves dans l’ancienne Mésopotamie, essentiellement grâce aux lois et inscriptions. Comme pour la plupart des études sur l’esclavage, la majorité des informations dont nous disposons sur les esclaves dans l’Orient Ancien nous vient des élites. Cette étude cherche à tirer parti du matériel textuel pour percevoir ce qu’était la vie des plus basses classes de la société. Les perspectives ainsi offertes soulignent les risques pour le peuple de connaître une mobilité sociale descendante, de même que les possibilités ascendantes plus limitées, mettant au jour non seulement la vulnérabilité sociale des enfants d’esclaves, mais aussi celle des femmes qui les mettaient au monde.Download Free PDFView PDFA HISTORY OF ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN LAW.

It challenges prevailing assumptions (based on the work of M.I. Finley) that a vast qualitative and quantitative gulf separated the slaveholding practices of the Greeks from those of their eastern neighbours.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Invention of Enterprise: Entrepreneurship from  …(2010) Neo-Babylonian Entrepreneurs2010 • Cornelia WunschDownload Free PDFView PDFEdited by Agnès Garcia-Ventura.

Terminology Related to the Work Force and Job Categories in the Ancient Near East2018 • Agnès Garcia-VenturaThe goal of this volume is to provide researchers and those interested in ancient history and in ancient languages with a useful, updated compendium of the terminology related to the management of the work force, as attested in various ancient Near Eastern written sources. To do so, its 18 chapters cover several periods ranging from the end of the 4th millennium until the end of the 1st millennium BC, in an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the three millennia of cuneiform texts and related sources. The first three papers deal with sources ranging from the end of the 4th millennium until the mid 3rd millennium BC (the volume begins with the article co-authored by Jacob L. Dahl, Laura F. Hawkins and Kathryn Kelley, followed by articles by Vitali Bartash and Camille Lecompte). The next papers deal with sources from the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, namely from the Presargonic (Fumi Karahashi), Sargonic (Massimo Maiocchi) and Ur III (Laura Culberston) periods. These are followed by papers that focus on the 2nd millennium BC, namely those dealing with Old Babylonian (Katrien De Graef), Middle Assyrian (Jaume Llop), and Middle Babylonian sources (Daniel Justel), as well as those on texts from the Hurrian milieu (Josué J. Justel examines a range of diverse archives, and Philippe Abrahami and Brigitte Lion concentrate on texts from Nuzi in a joint paper), texts from Ugarit (Juan-Pablo Vita), and finally Hittite sources (Matteo Vigo). Regarding the 1st millennium BC, the volume includes papers dealing with the Neo-Assyrian work force (papers by Melanie Groß and by Lorenzo Verderame respectively), as well as with Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid sources (with papers by Stefan Zawadzki, Kristin Kleber and Mark Tamerus).Download Free PDFView PDF"Sklave, Sklaverei.
