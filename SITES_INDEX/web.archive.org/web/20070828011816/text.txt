While immigration into the UK has received intense attention in recent years, emigration from the UK has largely been ignored. This groundbreaking report, based on extensive analysis of emigration data and qualitative research in several countries, presents new estimates of how many Britons live abroad, where they live and what emigration patterns will look like in the future.The report shows that, in an increasingly mobile world, the UK is truly at the crossroads of the global movement of people. These large scale movements in and out present some important opportunities for the UK as well as challenges for policymakers.The BBC Online has a special feature on Brits Abroad, with maps, statistical data and case studies. View the feature at: www.bbc.co.uk/britsabroad.Brits Abroad complements ipprs Beyond Black and White, published last year, which focuses on Britains migrant communities. The report is available to order, and more data is available from www.bbc.co.uk/bornabroad.
