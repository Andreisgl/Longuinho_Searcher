It argues that her work questions in productive ways crucial issues like authorship, ethical responsibility, inter- and transmedial textual plurality, reception and oral narration. In Brand New Ancients (2013) in particular, Tempest questions and deconstructs the form and the structure of traditional epics by reversing a number of key features. Set in the contemporary age, Tempest’s poem breaks down sociocultural boundaries such as, for example, those between high and low, Gods or semi-divine figures and lower-class, disenfranchised mortals and, in a metanarrative move, between the figure of the poet and the readers/listeners, who are transformed into potential members of an interactive postmodern dramatic chorus. In this way, Tempest gives voice to a potentially endless spectrum of voiceless and marginalised subjectivities, whose subaltern status is erased in this new poetic hierarchy-free (inter)textual space where opposites can co-exist.Download Free PDFView PDFDiesisThe Utopia of Sameness: Erasure of Hierarchy in the Work of Toni MorrisonKurt FawverDownload Free PDFView PDFWriting Homer: A study based on results from modern fieldwork2011 • Minna  Skafte JensenThe oral-formulaic theory formed by Milman Parry and Albert B. Lord not only revolutionised Homeric studies but also had an impact on anthropology and folklore. It led to increased interest in oral epic traditions, and fieldworkers changed their methods towards a focus on composition in performance. The individual singer and his handling of the tradition gained importance. When possible, more than one performance of the “same” song was recorded, by the same singer on different occasions or by different singers, and interaction with the audience was documented. By now, a wealth of editions and studies of oral epics from various parts of the world is accessible and is used in the present study as an inspiration for achieving a deeper understanding of the methods at work in oral epic, for building a social framework for the Iliad and the Odyssey, and especially for speculating on the circumstances of the writing of the two great poems. Long oral narratives are flexible, and accordingly, the dictation to scribes that must be at the origin of the texts that have been preserved in writing to this day, was a process of the utmost importance as the composition in performance of the Iliad and the Odyssey.Download Free PDFView PDF“New Trends in Homeric Scholarship (NTHS)”, A.

R. Odysseus and a Phoenician tale VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA   Том: 34   Выпуск: 2   Стр.: 233-250   Опубликовано: 2018VESTNIK  FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYAThe question of the authorship of the two Homeric epics - whether there was one Homer, or two - has vexed scholars since the inception of critical literary study. The more bellicose, less inner and mysterious Iliad was by far the more popular poem in antiquity. And although the later Aeneid of Virgil tendentiously fuses together war and nostos (homecoming), it is of arms and a man, not a man of many ways and wiles, that the Roman poet sings. Odysseus is likened, invidiously, to a Canaanite (Phoenician) traveling merchant in his flexibility and adaptability - he, the "rootless cosmopolitan" of his remote age, resonates with the predicament of alienation of modern man and with the psychological depth of the modern literary sensibility, then bellicose, candid, limited Achilles and Aeneas. It is proposed in the article that the Odyssey employs the topos of a man traveling in search of lost members of his family, with a happy resolution, that seems indeed to have been peculiarly popular over many centuries with Phoenicians and Carthaginians. The author suggests indeed that Menaechmus, the name of a character in a play based on this topos with a Punic setting that might even have been performed, in a Northwest Semitic translation in Qart.adast (Newtown, i.e., Carthage) itself, is merely the very common Hebrew name Menachem. And it is noted that the topos recurs, employed in aid of religious propaganda of the Jewish Christians, in the setting of the PseudoClementine Recognitions.Download Free PDFView PDFPostmodernism and Literaturestephen ogeneDownload Free PDFView PDFAARC Digital Library General CollectionGina DominiqueDownload Free PDFView PDFSUBBTOTHE ORTHODOX CHURCH AND POSTMODERNITY: IDENTITY, PLURALISM AND COMMUNION2018 • Cristian S SoneaThe article presents the characteristics of postmodernism and its consequences on issues such as identity, pluralism and communion. As an "unstable" philosophical trend, it interacts with the "stability" and authority of the orthodox teachings, thus resulting in an ideological conflict. The article offers some theological answers to the above-mentioned conflict, as well as to some major issues of the contemporary postmodern society.Download Free PDFView PDFEnglish Literature (Assembly Articles From Wikipedia Free EncyclopediaRealty InvestmentsDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
