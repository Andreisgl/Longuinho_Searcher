Though we may take for granted the role of corporate business and capitalism in our day to day lives and assume it is inescapable, this hasn’t always been the case. Business and Society provides a broad historical analysis of the spread of capitalism and the foundation of the corporate revolution in the late nineteenth century, while examining the challenges of regulation and ethics in contemporary business. In addition, it examines how corporate power and capitalism might be resisted, outlining a range of alternatives, from the social economy to new forms of open access or commons ownership. Written in a clear, accessible style, Business and Society offers an approachable introduction to a variety of perspectives from sociological, geographical, heterodox economic, ethical, political, legal and historical contexts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Tuition Dilemma and the Politics of “Mass ” Higher EducationThe prospect of tuition fee increases for public sector universities has attracted an enormous am... more The prospect of tuition fee increases for public sector universities has attracted an enormous amount of attention in recent years as governments in all industrialized countries have responded to the converging pressures of increased demands for higher education and rising costs of competing areas of social spending. I show that this dilemma is fast approaching a critical point in both Canada and the UK. As contemporary society become “knowledge societies, ” postsecondary systems become “complex,” requiring a sensitive political blending of different institutional goals, such as accessibility, diversity of mission, critical thought, relevance, and social usefulness. This article draws upon the policy model of income contingent repayment (ICR) as a touchstone for debates and larger proposals about addressing the future of higher education reform. My hope is to show the partial shortcomings of the traditional alternatives: reliance on state-provided subsidy on the one hand and deregul...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The package of new initiatives—dubbed the Canada Opportunities Strategy—not only partially re-versed an earlier period of fiscal restraint but also brought a new emphasis on direct forms of student assistance such as grants, bursaries, and tax credits. However, programs such as the Canada Millennium Bursaries and the Cana-da Education Savings Grants, despite their focused approach and innovative structure, came to be regarded as weak policy tools when measured against their ostensible goals of widening access to post-secondary education and effi-ciently targeting student assistance on the basis of need.

Max Weber’s writings on science and the meaning of intellectual activity have been criticized in the light of his apparent willingness to limit the evaluative aims of intellectuals by rejecting the appropriateness of social criticism in their professional work. In response, defenders of Weber have been struck by his insistence that intellectuals must think of their professional activity as a kind of service to ‘moral forces’1 even though they must also- for the sake of intellectual integrity – avoid partisanship itself. Paradoxically, ‘value-free ’ social science itself is portrayed as an enterprise in which confrontation with critical and evaluative stances is indispensable and directive of intellectual interests. This paper is an attempt to find a broader platform for addressing Weber=s seemingly paradoxical attachment to both ‘value-freedom ’ and a model of soc...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The two most well-known developments are open access scholarly publishing and Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), each of which are connected to disruptive innovations enabled by new technologies. Support for these new modes of exchanging knowledge is linked to the expectation that they will promote a number of public interest benefits, including widening the impact, productivity, and format of academic work; reforming higher education and scholarly publishing markets; and relieving some of the cost pressures in academia. This article examines the rapid emergence of policy initiatives in the United Kingdom and the United States to promote open content and to bring about a new relationship between the market and the academic commons. In doing so, I examine controversial forms of academic...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The University Student in a Reflexive Society: Consequences of Consumerism and CompetitionIn what follows I argue that, with the transformation from elite to mass university systems, the ... more In what follows I argue that, with the transformation from elite to mass university systems, the consumer role is ascendant, especially as higher education systems become more institutionally diverse, complex, inclusive and expansive. In this environment, students and their patrons (parents, governments, etc.) demand more responsive and flexible institutional forms, which some sociologists have argued reflects the advent of an increasingly ‘reflexive society.’ In the case of universities, the result of social reflexivity is an inevitable blurring of some important boundaries, especially those between the external and internal values of the academic culture. In this context it is not surprising that students are more directly and exclusively focused on the utilitarian value of education, and its role as a gateway to occupational opportunities and social prestige. However, I propose that student consumerism need not be a threat to academic communities, especially in a public universit...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter probes not the management of universities so much as decision making in government and its impact on university governance. Drawing on a larger study of postsecondary policy making in the federal and Ontario provincial jurisdictions, and relying on primary documents and interviews with individuals directly involved in policy making, this chapter illustrates how certain Canadian PSE policies were made and executed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
