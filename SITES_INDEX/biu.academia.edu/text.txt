Taking into account the popularity of this field over the last forty years, A Time of Change is unique in presenting a fully up-to-date assessment of the area. A major focus of several of the papers is the examination of different aspects of the newly published 'Makkedah ostraca' and their meaning. By collecting this research in a single volume it is possible for the reader to obtain an overview of the situation during these periods in question, which in turn enables ready comparison with preceding and subsequent periods. For clarity, the studies are divided into three categories: archaeological, epigraphic and historical, though many of them operate on a more interdisciplinary level. This enables a thorough yet fresh and concise presentation of thought in this important area of study. The Library of Second temple Studies (LStS) is a premier book series that offers cutting-edge work for a readership of scholars, teachers in the field of Second temple studies, postgraduate students and advanced undergraduates. All the many and diverse aspects of Second temple study are represented and promoted, including innovative work from historical perspectives, studies using social-scientific and literary theory, and developing theological, cultural and contextual approaches.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The anonymous author, often simply called “the Chronicler” by modern scholars, looks back at the old Israelite monarchy, before the Babylonian exile, from his vantage point in the post-exilic early Second Temple Period, and attempts to “update” the older historiographies of Samuel and Kings in order to elucidate their meaning to the people of his own time. In The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, Yigal Levin does the same for the modern reader. He offers a brand-new translation and commentary on 2 Chronicles chapters 10-36, tracing the “sacred history” of the monarchy from the division of Solomon's kingdom to the final exile and return. Each chapter is translated from the original Hebrew into an English that is both faithful to the original and easy for the modern reader to follow. Extensive footnotes provide full explanations of the translator's choices and of linguistic and literary issues, taking note of alternative versions offered by a wide array of ancient and modern versions and translations. The comprehensive commentary on each section provides historical background and explains the text both on a literary and a historical level, making full use of the most up-to-date research on the text, literature, history, geography and on the archaeological background of the biblical world.The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah is to be followed by The Chronicles of David and Solomon on 1 Chronicles 10 – 2 Chronicles 9, and then by The Chronicles of All Israel on the genealogies of 1 Chronicles 1-9 and including comprehensive essays on the book of Chronicles, its time, purposes, methods and meanings. - See more at: http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-chronicles-of-the-kings-of-judah-9780567671714/#sthash.OLxdXhZG.dpufSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

War and Peace in Jewish Tradition: From the Biblical World to the PresentThe transition between the reality of war and a hope for peace has

However, the waysin which both concepts are understood have changed many times over theages, and both have different implications for an independent nationin its own land than they do for a community of exiles living as aminority in foreign countries. This book explores the concepts of war and peace throughout thehistory of Judaism. Combining three branches of learning - classical Jewish sources, from the Bible to modern times; related academic disciplines of Jewish studies, humanities, social and political sciences; and public discussion of these issues on political, military, ideological and moral levels - contributors from Israel and the USA open new vistas of investigation for the future as well as an awareness of the past. Chapters touch on personal and collective morality in warfare, survival though a long and often violent history, and creation of some of the world’s great cultural assets, in literature, philosophy and religion, as well as in the fields of community life and social autonomy. An important addition to the current literature on Jewish thought and philosophy, this book will be of considerable interest to scholars working in the areas of Jewish Studies, theology, modern politics, the Middle East and biblical studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Surveys conducted over the years and recent excavations have shown that it was settled almost continuously from the Early Bronze Age to the Ottoman Period, and that it was a regional centre during Iron Age II. In the past, it was identified with Beth-Shemesh of Naphtali (Josh 19:38; Jdg 1:33). However, in our analysis, all of the towns of Naphtali should be sought east of Mount Meron, while those to its west were in the territory of Asher, and we tentatively propose to identify Tel Rosh with the 'northern' Rehob of Asher, listed in Josh 19:28.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Religion of Idumea and Its Relationship to Early JudaismReligions,  2020For several hundred years, from the late Iron Age to the end of the 2nd century BCE, the southern... more For several hundred years, from the late Iron Age to the end of the 2nd century BCE, the southern neighbor of Judea was "Idumea", populated by descendants of Edomites, together with Qedarite and other Arabs and a mix of additional ethnicities. This paper examines the known data on the identity, especially religious identity, of these Idumeans, using a wide range of written sources and archaeological data. Within the Bible, "Edom" is presented as Israel's twin and its harshest enemy, but there are hints that the Edomites worshipped the God of Israel. While the origins of the "Edomite deity" Qaus remain obscure, as does the process of their migration into southern Judah, the many inscriptions from the Persian period show that Qaus became the most widely worshipped deity in the area, even if other gods, including Yahweh, were also recognized. The Hellenistic period brought heightened Greek and Phoenician influence, but also the stabilization of "Idumea" as an administrative/ethnic unit. Some of the practices of this period, such as male circumcision, show an affinity to the Judaism of the time. This paper also discusses the outcome of the Hasmonean conquest of Idumea and the incorporation of its inhabitants into the Jewish nation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The testimony of Eusebius and other ancient authorities has led many scholars to identify Moresheth-gath with the modern Tell el-]udeida or with other sites in the southern Shephelah. In all if the above-cited sources, however, the site is mentioned in connection with Gath, presumably the well-known Philistine city. The recently excavated site if Tel Harassim,approximately five kilometres to the northwest if Tell es-Safi/Gath, would seem to be the best candidate to date for identification with Moresheth-gath.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Aram and Arameans in ChroniclesAngelika Berlejung and Aren M.

These are compared to the many more appearances in the Chronicler’s earlier biblical “sources.” This comparison is significant in our understanding of the Chronicler’s historiographical methods, as well as in better understanding the ongoing relationship between Jews and Arameans in the Second Temple Period. In the Chronicler’s Second Temple Period world, there was no such “nation” as “Aram,” but “Arameans,” that is speakers of Aramaic, were everywhere. “Aram” is first and foremost a major ethnic-linguistic component of the world. So the ancestor “Aram” was near the top of the genealogy of humanity. In the Chronicler’s world, Aram and Israel do not share a common legacy. But in the Chronicler’s picture of the past, there had been a kingdom of Aram, a fierce enemy of Israel. Geographically, this “Aram” was limited to the region of Damascus, the Chronicler’s contemporary “Darmascus.” To the Chronicler and to his late Persian-Period contemporaries, “Aram” was, in the past, a hostile kingdom beyond the borders of Israel, centered in “Darmascus,” and like all foreign kingdoms, a tool with which God could be able to punish Israel if he so wishes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

All three groups are the successors of Iron-Age states that were conquered and destroyed by the great Mesopotamian empires. All three groups underwent some form and measure of exile/displacement of population, of importation of foreign inhabitants, of destruction of urban centers and of rural settlements, of extreme social and economic changes, and of the disbandment of their former political structures. All three groups were reconstituted and re-formed during the Persian Period, and at least by the early Hellenistic Period were recognized as three specific ethne, each with its own autonomous self-governance within the Ptolemaic and then the Seleucid realms. There were, however, also significant differences between the three. Their specific histories, the time and manner in which the original Iron-Age states were terminated, imperial policy at the time, the fate of their inhabitants and of their land and many additional factors, all contributed to the formation of three very different groups, that emerged from the Persian Period into the Hellenistic world in different ways, and ultimately set out for very different destinies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Why did Zerubbabel’s Adversaries Emphasize their Foreign Origins?in Richard Bautch and Mark Lackowski (eds.), On Dating Biblical Texts to the Persian Period: Discerning Criteria and Establishing Epochs, Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2019, 91-99.,  2019Upon arriving in Jerusalem sometime after 539 BCE, the returnees led by Zerubbabel were approache... more Upon arriving in Jerusalem sometime after 539 BCE, the returnees led by Zerubbabel were approached by a group of people to whom Ezra 4:1 refers as “the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin” who requested, “Let us build with you, for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of King Esarhaddon of Assyria who brought us here” (Ezra 4:2). The answer of the leaders of the returnees was negative. Most of the standard treatments of this passage deal with the following issues:1. Who were these “adversaries”?2. Were they or were they not identical with “the people of the land” who are mentioned in v. 4?3. What were their motives in offering to participate in the construction of the Temple?4. Was their offer genuine, or did they have ulterior motives?5. Why did the returnees reject their offer out of hand?One issue which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been dealt with is the question of the “adversaries’”motives, not for offering to help, but for identifying themselves as foreign deportees in the first place. Why not claim to be genuine Israelites, who have always worshipped Yahweh, and are now happy to welcome their exiled brethren?  So, assuming that they did wish Zerubbabel and his group to give them a role in the new temple, why emphasize their foreign origins? What were they thinking?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mixed Marriages in the Book of Chronicles - A Reflection of Social Attitudes in Persian-Period Yehud (with Iris Marsh)Transeuphratène ,  2018This article examines the attitude seen in the Book of Chronicles

Of the 14 cases of mixed marriages mentioned in Chronicles, 9 are discussed, some of which have parallels in other biblical books, and some of which are unique to Chronicles. Our conclusion is that in general the Chronicler did not consider such marriages to be problematic for the continued existence of the people of Israel or of the Yehud community in his own time. In this he represents an attitude that is very different than that reflected in Ezra-Nehemiah.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Theophoric Names with the Element ‘Baal’ in Early Israel: An Updated View in Light of the ‘Eshbaal’ Inscription from Khirbet Qeiyafa (Hebrew with English abstract)Bible Lands e-Review,  2018This article is an updated version of Yigal Levin, “Baal Worship in Early Israel: An Onomastic Vi... more This article is an updated version of Yigal Levin, “Baal Worship in Early Israel: An Onomastic View in Light of the ‘Eshbaal’ Inscription from Khirbet Qeiyafa”, Maarav 21 (2014), pp. 203-222. It examines the element “Baal”, which appears in several names of Israelite leaders in the Bible, including members of the families of Kings Saul and David, all in the context of the pre-monarchic and early monarchic periods – roughly the 12th-10th centuries B.C.E. These names include Jerubaal (Gideon), Eshbaal son of Saul, Meribaal son of Jonathan, Beeljiada son of David and others. “Baal Shalishah”, “Baal-Hazor”, “Baal-Perazim” and “Baal Tamar” are names of places that are mentioned in Israelite contexts in roughly the same period. The appearance of this element would seem surprising, considering that throughout the Bible, “Baal” is the name of a Canaanite/Phoenician deity, whose worship is considered to be a cardinal sin against the covenant between Israel and its God. Indeed, within the books of the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) most of these names are either “explained away” or changed, Eshbaal and Meribaal becoming “Ish-bosheth” and “Mephi-bosheth”, Beeliada becoming “Eliada” (“God Knows”) and so on, but their “original” form was preserved in the book of Chronicles. Conversely, both the Bible and the epigraphic record show that from the 9th century B.C.E., the vast majority of Israelite and Judahite names were “Yahwistic”, names that include shortened forms of the name of the God of Israel, Yah, Yahu, Yeho, Yaw and so on, while Baal and other “foreign” deities are all but non-existent. The articles suggests that in the early days of Israelite identity, “Baal”, meaning “Lord”, was considered to be a legitimate title for the God of Israel, while in later periods, perhaps following the spread of Phoenician Baal cults in Israel, “Yahwist-purist” circles came to consider “Baal” as inappropriate for loyal Yahwists, and this element disappeared from Israelite and Judahite names. The writers or editors of the biblical Deuteronomistic History changed some of the names of early Israelites in their books accordingly. The later author of Chronicles, no longer concerned with this issue, retained the original names. The discovery of an inscription with the name “Eshbaal” at the early-monarchic site of Khirbet Qeiyafa shows that this name was indeed current at this time, and that it is indeed Chronicles that preserves the “original” form.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Coming on the heels of about fifteen books and countless articles that Dever has authored or edited, ranging from archaeological reports to books that deal with biblical issues in the light of archaeology, this volume can be seen as Dever’s chance to summarize his views on the various issues at hand and to respond to his opponents— and respond he does.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Doak, an Associate Professor of Biblical Studies at George Fox University in Oregon who has written in the past about the Phoenicians, could have the audacity to even attempt to cover all of ancient Israel’s neighbors in one short volume. In most volumes of this sort, such as The World around the Old Testament: The People and Places of the Ancient Near East (ed. Bill T. Arnold and Brent A. Strawn; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2016), each chapter is written by an expert on that particular group or region, and I assumed that no single author would be able to cover so many different topics successfully. Doak proved me wrong. While the volume does have its deficiencies, in the end it can serve as a reasonably good introduction for the beginning student to the world of the Iron Age Levant, perhaps as a complement to Victor H. Matthew’s The History of Bronze and Iron Age Israel (New York: Oxford University Press, 2018), also in the Essentials of Biblical Studies series. In fact, as I read through the introductory chapter on “Israel’s Neighbors and the Problem of the Past” (1–21), I found that its explanations of such subjects as “Nations and Identity in the Ancient World” and “How Do We Know Anything about the Past?” echo many of my own experiences in teaching these subjects in undergraduate settings. Doak manages to lay out the main issues about the study of the biblical world, especially of the problems involved in using the Bible as a source of historical information, in a way that is easy to understand without being overly didactic."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
