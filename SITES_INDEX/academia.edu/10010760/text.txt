To set the scene, section 2 gives an overview of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum as an example the gas oligopoly in today’s market. Section 3 shows the basics of natural gas transportation and shale gas extraction, whereas sections 4 and 5 provide an analysis of how the EU can increase its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to diversify its energy supplies and what the implications of the US shale gas revolution are for EU energy security. Section 6 concludes the chapter.Download Free PDFView PDFTHE FUTURE OF NATURAL GASAgata Łoskot-StrachotaDownload Free PDFView PDFHarvard Belfer CenterThe politics of natural gas development in the European Union2013 • Andreas Goldthau“The Politics of Natural Gas Development in the European Union,” highlights the role of supranational regulation and policies for the future development of the world’s largest import market in natural gas. It also points to the strong repercussions that trends on international gas markets have for large import markets. This study finds that the US “shale gas revolution” has prepared the grounds for a fundamental change in the European gas market and for incumbent pricing models. In this context, as this study shows, the European Commission has an important role to play. The EU’s policy agenda toward more competition, liberalization, and gas market integration, along with its push for decarbonizing the European energy system, neatly dovetail with a favorable international supply environment in natural gas. As pointed out by the scenarios later in this study, the European gas market could therefore see the emergence of a new gas pricing model, away from the incumbent oil price peg. In this case, Europe will become the world’s largest and most attractive gas import market, with suppliers from all world regions competing for market shares—Russia being only one of them. At the same time, this study also shows that the power of Brussels is limited, for reasons of regulatory competences as well as financial capacity. Therefore, much will rest on the EU member states and their policies to allow for more domestic gas-on-gas competition, and also with regards to their regulatory frameworks for the exploration and production of indigenous European shale gas reserves.Download Free PDFView PDFGeopolitics of Energy‘The shale gas revolution and its impacts over global energy geopolitics: A case for single North American Energy Market,’ Geopolitics of Energy, (Vol. 37, Issue 5, May 2015, Canada), pp.5-16. 2015 • Tuncay BABALI, Ph.DThe shale gas revolution is upon North America, it is the major energy development of the 21st century so far, and it can be exported to the rest of the world. These are the conclusions of Dr. Tuncay Babali, former Ambassador of Turkey to Canada, in this month’s GoE. On the third point, that the seeds of the revolution can be planted in other countries, Dr. Babali notes that over 6,000 Tcf of low-carbon shale gas is technically recoverable outside of North America. But certain conditions will need to be met for this to happen. First, nations need to develop production, transportation, and other infrastructure to support shale gas; they also must create an energy industry where landowners and other stakeholders are rewarded fairly for their cooperation and participation. In this sense, the world can look to North America’s successes and failures in building a workable shale gas industry in only a handful of years.Download Free PDFView PDF‘Shale Gas and Energy Security’ (Chapter 7) [In:] T. Hunter (ed) Handbook of Shale Gas Law and Policy, Cambridge: Intersentia, 2016.Shale Gas and Energy Security2016 • Slawomir RaszewskiEnergy security has traditionally been built around three factors: security of supply; price and environmental sustainability. Traditionally linked to crude oil, with change of consumption patterns, rise of geopolitical factors and long-term challenges of climate change, energy security can be seen as a 'healthy' balance of energy mix that developed economies are increasingly longing for. Globally, natural gas is an emerging fuel the economics of which is still largely dependent on trade in crude oil and petroleum products. The link between oil and gas dates to the early days of conventional oil production where gas was a by-product of crude exploration flared on the spot to access the black gold underground. The unique link established a basis for pricing and trading natural gas as a fuel indexed to crude oil and its derivatives. While it is still flared in some remote production regions, for affordability and environmental reasons natural gas is becoming increasingly too precious to be left behind. In particular, environmental concerns, particularly the move towards having a lower carbon footprint and the applicability of natural gas as an affordable source to fuel industry and provide energy and heating source to households, have all caused natural gas to often be described as a fuel of choice, a term that reconciles interests of businesses, the energy industry and communities. While production of natural gas from conventional geology continues, technological and geological progress is now changing the 'old' way of thinking about gas and energy security by adding shale gas to the equation. Despite its trading structure being by all means not yet global and largely confined to regional and international markets in search for demand, shale gas has already managed to change perceptions of the geopolitics of energy security globally. Due to the rise of new technologies of extraction, gas is often presented as a bridging fuel between the 'traditional' high-carbon energy carriers such s coal and crude oil and the future, where low-carbon energy sources, in particular renewable energy, will become more prevalent.Download Free PDFView PDFGeopolitics of Energy'The Geopolitical Impact of the Shale Gas Revolution and a New World Order:  Opportunity for North America.' Geopolitics of Energy, (Vol. 37, Issue 6 & 7, June-July 2015, Canada), pp.2-14.2015 • Tuncay BABALI, Ph.DThe future of energy and its geopolitics can be discussed from many angles, including: advances in innovation and technology, renewable energy, environmentally friendly applications, the impact of climate change, and Arctic and Eurasian promises. However, the shale gas revolution emerges above the rest as the one with the most realistic potential. Yet the realization of this potential greatly depends on North America (namely the US and Canada) becoming a responsible, more integrated and more transparent energy market. Coordination and timely cooperation with strategic vision between the US and Canada have the potential to create the world's largest and most reliable supply chain for hydrocarbon resources. This development might have serious implications over the search for a new world order as well. Failure to develop this potential can possibly lead to greater geopolitical and geoeconomical rivalries and shift alliances in conventional hydrocarbon energy geopolitics with significant implications for the new world (dis)order. With the article, “The Shale Gas Revolution and its Impacts Over Global Energy Geopolitics: A Case for a Single North American Energy Market”, published in the May 2015 edition of Geopolitics of Energy – used as a backdrop and complementary-piece for this article, it has now become possible to better assess and stimulate more discussion on the shale gas revolution and its impact over global energy geopolitics.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean gas market : stakes and perspectivesSilvana MimaDownload Free PDFView PDF2012 9th International Conference on the European Energy MarketA model-based analysis of the implications of shale gas developments for the European gas market2012 • Ozge OzdemirDownload Free PDFView PDFGlobal Natural Gas Market: Reality or Expectation?2009 • Amanda CarlosThe natural gas market all over the world has been suffering tremendous changes for the past decades, not only because of market liberalization, but also due to industry restructuring and the strong expansion of liquefied natural gas market (LNG) which brought the missing ...Download Free PDFView PDFSSRN Electronic JournalThe World Gas Market in 2030: Development Scenarios Using the World Gas Model2000 • Ruud G Egging-BratsethDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
