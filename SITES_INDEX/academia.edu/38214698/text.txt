MullerEUMETSAT&#39;s Meteosat Surface Albedo (MSA) data record is a unique data set encompassing up to 25 years of continuous surface albedo coverage for large areas of the Earth. It is therefore of paramount importance to maintain and further improve the existing MSA data record. The evaluation of the MSA data record has revealed a number of specific strengths and weaknesses as outlined below. While the strengths underlines the already high value of the MSA data record for climate applications, the weaknesses need to be considered for specific applications and should be addressed in the context of a product re-processing. A number of concrete recommendations to improve product quality, usability and sustainability at short, medium and long term have been devised. In combination with other (EUMETSAT and non-EUMETSAT) geostationary satellites, the MSA method should contribute to creating harmonised surface albedo records of quasi global coverage outside the polar zones serving climate appl...Download Free PDFView PDFLand Surface Albedos Computed from BRF Measurements with a Study of Conversion Formulae2010 • Eetu  PuttonenDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentECOCLIMAP-II: An ecosystem classification and land surface parameters database of Western Africa at 1km resolution for the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project2010 • Armel KaptueDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of  …First Operational BRDF, Albedo Nadir Reflectance Products From MODIS2002 • Philip LewisWith the launch of NASA's Terra satellite and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), operational Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo products are now being made available to the scientific community. The MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model and multidate, multispectral data to provide global 1-km gridded and tiled products of the land surface every 16 days. These products include directional hemispherical albedo (black-sky albedo), bihemispherical albedo (white-sky albedo), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted surface Reflectances (MBAR), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The algorithm has been consistently producing albedo and NBAR for the public since July 2000. Initial evaluations indicate a stable BRDF/Albedo Product, where, for example, the spatial and temporal progression of phenological characteristics is easily detected in the NBAR and albedo results. These early beta and provisional products auger well for the routine production of stable MODIS-derived BRDF parameters, nadir reflectances, and albedos for use by the global observation and modeling communities.Download Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentAccuracy assessment of the MODIS 16-day albedo product for snow: comparisons with Greenland in situ measurements2005 • crystal schaafDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Applied Earth Observation and GeoinformationAnalysing the advantages of high temporal resolution geostationary MSG SEVIRI data compared to Polar Operational Environmental Satellite data for land surface monitoring in Africa2011 • rasmus FensholtDownload Free PDFView PDFMeteosat Second Generation opportunities for Land Surface Research and ApplicationsA.
