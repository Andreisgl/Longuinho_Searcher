Here we use ensembles of bidirectional recurrent neural network architectures, PSI-BLAST-derived profiles, and a large nonredundant training set to derive two new predictors: (a) the second version of the SSpro program for secondary structure classification into three categories and (b) the first version of the SSpro8 program for secondary structure classification into the eight classes produced by the DSSP program. We describe the results of three different test sets on which SSpro achieved a sustained performance of about 78% correct prediction. We report confusion matrices, compare PSI-BLAST to BLAST-derived profiles, and assess the corresponding performance improvements. SSpro and SSpro8 are implemented as web servers, available together with other structural feature predictors at: http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/ BRNN-PRED/.

The best methods now reach levels of 74-76% of the residues correctly predicted in one of the three states helix, strand, or other. In context of the EVA/CASP, we experimented with averaging over the best current methods. The resulting jury decision proved significantly more accurate than the best method. Although the&#x27;jury&#x27;seemed the best choice on average, for 60% of all proteins one method was better than the jury.
