There's not much doubt over what ended it in the late 1960s either - the contraceptive pill. In 1964, the "total fertility rate", as the statisticians call it, was 2.95 children per woman. It subsequently steadily declined to a record low of 1.63 in 2001.But the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the rate has climbed year on year in the UK since then to 1.84 children per woman in 2006. That ranges from 1.94 in Northern Ireland to 1.67 in Scotland, with England and Wales around the average. The number of live births has increased steadily over the same time period to reach 669,531 - the highest point since 1993.So it's another baby boom. But this time it's more complicated. One of the long-term trends underlying the rise in birth rates is an increase in the number of women having babies in their 30s and 40s - some of them with the help of fertility treatment. Strangely, though, there has also been an increase in childbirth among young women, in their early and late 20s. The ONS says it is possible that some are choosing not to postpone having a family because of changes in the child support systems, such as tax credits and improved maternity leave.Immigration is another factor. Fertility rates among non-UK born women are higher than among those born here - 2.5 children per woman compared to 1.7 - although there is evidence that the rates tend to converge over a few generations. The rise in the number of babies born between 2006 and 2007 was about 20,000, of which two-thirds were the children of women born outside the UK.TopicsLife and styleThe questionWomenImmigration and asylumBritish identity and societyChildrenHealthRelationshipsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHealth & fitnessHome & gardenWomenMenFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
