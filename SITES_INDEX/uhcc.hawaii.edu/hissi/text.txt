Welcome to Hawaiʻi Student Success Institute!
The 2023 Hawai‘i 
  Student Success Institute is the 
  12th institute bringing together faculty, staff and administrators from 
  the seven colleges and system office of the University of Hawai‘i Community Colleges. 
  Participants engage in best practices, innovations, and strategies 
  that lead to increased student success. In addition to exploring what 
  our colleges are doing, participants work together collaboratively 
  with their peers to improve instruction and student support practices.
