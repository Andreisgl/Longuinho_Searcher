One of these areas is the history and organization of the Ur III military. This dissertation is an investigation of selected issues and the terminology related to the military history of this period. It attempts to rectify the absence of monographic studies on this topic and to clarify problematic issues that recur in the secondary literature. Chapter one introduces the historical background of the Ur III period, focusing on the available sources and their associated biases. Chapter two establishes the framework for a military history of this period by utilizing year-names and textual references to plunder, and teases out some of the problems involved in using this data. This chapter utilizes the vast administrative corpus to build portraits of the enemy toponyms mentioned in year-names and attempts to determine their organizational structure and political relationship to the kingdom of Ur. Chapter three discusses the primary terms for soldiers (eren2, aga3-us2, gar3-du) and the garrison system that was established in the periphery. It demonstrated that the taxes on garrison settlements (gun2 ma-da) exhibited an array of formats and utilized a multiplicity of terms; this aids our understanding of the political statuses of a number of foreign toponyms. Chapter four investigates the context of the messenger text genre and some of the military terminology found within. This resulted in the discovery that different provinces and their messenger text corpora dealt with different regions of the periphery. Additionally, it was discovered that foreign groups from the periphery traveled in greater numbers and with greater frequency than previously assumed. Lastly, selected military terms were investigated and some previous assumptions regarding their meaning were challenged. This dissertation increases and redefines our knowledge of the military and political contexts of the Third Dynasty of Ur and provides a beginning point for further research into this area.Download Free PDFView PDFSeal Impressions on Tablets from Umma2005 • Rudi MayrAn analysis of seals, how they were used, how they were designed, and what information they conveyed, during a period of about 45 years at the Sumerian city of Umma during the Ur III period (ca 2070-2025 BC), complete with a catalog of all those seals, with all I could say about it: drawing, dimension, description of the scene, and brief description of the contents of each tablet it was impressed on. 1770 seals are cataloged, and drawings are provided for 1440 seals, but not all are complete. PLEASE NOTE: This is an unpublished manuscript that contains numerous errors that I was unable to flag. I am currently (2021) preparing a revised and expanded version that will render this one completely obsolete. If you wish to cite any anything in the catalog, either a seal or a tablet, I strongly recommend you check CUSAS 7. If the latter is not yet available, please email me (rudi mayr at gmail &c, add the obvious punctuation, remove the spaces) and I can give you a correct citation if necessary.Download Free PDFView PDF19 Ur III texts in a Private Collection2007 • Jacob DahlDownload Free PDFView PDFRandom Notes on a Recent Ur III Volume -JAOS 108 1988.pdfDavid I OwenDownload Free PDFView PDFOrient 55Ur III Economy and Bureaucracy: The Neo-Sumerian Cuneiform Tablets in the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College (I)2020 • Magnus WidellThis article examines 15 cuneiform tablets from the late 3rd millennium BC from southern Mesopotamia. As administrative tools of the Ur III state bureaucracy, the texts are primarily concerned with the administrative and economic affairs of the central authority, but they also offer important information on the individuals living in the Ur III state and their different roles within the state's bureaucratic structures.
