Fairfield Cycles, the bike shop that Mike started around six years ago, is experiencing its biggest sales slump to date. Revenue is down 70% from the same period last year. Mike is sitting in front of his computer feeling stumped, so he pulls up Google and starts searching for a solution. A few minutes later, he finds himself watching a YouTube video that explains how Instagram Ads can help attract new customers to local businesses. Excited by the possibilities, Mike starts posting on Facebook asking for referrals to people who can help him build an Instagram ad campaign. He gets dozens of responses from marketing consultants offering to help him. A little overwhelmed, yet committed to finding a solution, Mike books a few calls. Most of the calls end with a big price tag and a long-term commitment, but one call with a young marketer named Shilo seemed promising. Shilo explains his approach to advertising, throwing out terms like conversion rate and CPM. Mike could swear these were the same terms he heard in that video he watched. Shilo must know what he’s doing. And his price point was within Mike’s budget. So, Mike hires Shilo to build him an Instagram ad campaign. There are two things that Mike isn’t aware of at this point, even after hiring Shilo. The first thing Mike doesn’t know is that the cause of his sales problem isn’t his lack of ads—it’s his website. The site is outdated, not user-friendly, and doesn’t have a way of converting visitors into leads. There’s no form, his address and phone number aren’t clickable, and the site isn’t even mobile-friendly. The second thing Mike doesn’t know is that Shilo is what we call a MINO: a Marketer In Name Only. (think of a minnow, the baby fish of the marketing industry) Shilo, having recently completed an Instagram Ads training program, is naturally excited to have Mike as a client. This contract is the beginning of what Shilo hopes is a successful marketing agency. But that doesn’t change the fact that Shilo is a MINO and has few marketing skills outside the realm of running Instagram Ads. That means when he’s hired, Shilo is paying attention to only one thing: Instagram Ads. He has little experience with websites, so he doesn’t pay any attention to how Mike’s website is performing. Mike, meanwhile, has never hired an Instagram ads expert, much less a marketer. He didn’t take a class on hiring a marketer. He’s a bike lover who started a business around something he loves. He doesn’t know that MINOs exist. Shilo begins building a beautiful Instagram ad campaign. Upon launch, the ads actually perform quite well. They receive a high click-through rate and send tons of people to Mike’s website. Shilo is proud of his work and starts to tell his friends that his marketing agency is off to a great start. But, as Mike will soon point out to Shilo, nobody is buying. Mike’s website is still performing badly, which means when people click on Shilo’s ads, they leave the website a few seconds later. Mike may as well be lighting his cash on fire. But neither Mike nor Shilo know this. So, after a few stressful weeks, Mike fires Shilo. From Mike’s perspective, Shilo was there to do one thing—make sales go up. Clearly, Shilo just wasn’t cutting it. So Mike starts searching for a new solution while telling his entrepreneur friends that Instagram ads don’t actually work that well. Shilo, meanwhile, is blindsided by the firing. From his perspective, he was there to run Instagram ads—which he did. Successfully. So he takes a few screenshots of his ad campaign for his portfolio and continues trying to find clients who will hire him. End scene. Who exactly is at fault in this scenario? Is it Shilo? Whose ignorance of a problem beyond the scope of his expertise led to the wasted time and money? Or is it Mike, the business owner with a limited budget who assumed Shilo had marketing skills he never claimed to possess? The answer is not a popular one—especially if you’re a business owner: The fault lies with Mike. Let’s simplify: if your car broke down on the side of the road, unless you’re experienced in these matters, you wouldn’t burst into the mechanic’s shop and demand that they replace a specific part of your car. You don’t know which part is broken. And if you did do that, you can’t hold the mechanic responsible for throwing his tools down, yelling you got it! and charging you for something you were sure you needed. It would take an experienced and honest mechanic to tell you to pump the brakes (pun intended) and figure out what the real problem is. And yet, Mike did exactly that. He burst into the mechanic’s shop yelling give me some of those Instagram Ads! and Shilo was there to reply: you got it. It was Mike who spent money solving the wrong problem. It was Mike who ultimately made the decision to hire Shilo. Shilo wasn’t experienced enough in the services industry to say, pump the brakes, so a contract was signed and payment was made. Okay—now for a little perspective. Mike may have been at fault in this instance, but it wasn’t his fault that it was his fault. Mike was the victim of authority bias. When we encounter an expert or figure of authority, we are more likely to respect their opinion and follow their instructions—that’s authority bias. The power of this bias is compounded when someone is in a state of desperation, which is how Mike felt when he began reaching out for marketing help. He was out of his depth, and he knew it. So the first person he saw who fit into his budget and seemed able to fix the problem (in the way he defined it) became the expert in his eyes. Not just the expert on Instagram ads, but the marketing expert. See the difference? At that exact moment, Mike implicitly, unconsciously, and without communication placed the responsibility for his company’s marketing on Shilo’s shoulders. Shilo didn’t have a clue. There was nobody at the wheel. Mike lost control of his business in a split second—and he paid for it. Not just metaphorically, either. He actually paid Shilo. Stories like Mike’s are becoming more common in the business world— including in the big business world of corporate contracts. MINOs, and even con artists, exist in those realms, too—the numbers just get bigger. The stories and lessons contained in this book will help you understand why stories like Mike’s are so common, how to avoid falling into other common marketing traps of the 21st Century, and the strategies to build a marketing system that can help you strike a profit in the wild west of modern marketing. If you’re a business owner or marketing executive, this book will show you how to evaluate the marketers you hire and build a marketing operating system. With the right people and systems in place, your marketing will scale and support the growth of your business without ever being deemed a cost center. The lessons that follow have, at the time of writing this, unlocked over $50 million in incremental annual sales for the businesses I’ve worked with through my marketing agency. If you’re a marketer, this book will show you the hard-won insights from hundreds of my conversion rate optimization campaigns. It will give you the right steps to reinforce your knowledge base of marketing and conversion principles. This includes neuromarketing conversion tactics, campaign planning processes, and critical audience segmentation techniques. If you’re a MINO and you’re reading this book, I tip my hat to you and offer this: every time I take a step back to get into marketing learning mode, I emerge a better marketer, even after all these years. Thank you for taking the time to invest in yourself through this book. Inside the pages that follow are the highly tested techniques and strategies that were behind those results. I invite you to use them to build your own portfolio of marketing successes. What To Expect From This Book Part One of this book will feel like you’ve fallen down a rabbit hole—this is on purpose. I want you to enter the same space an artist goes when starting a new painting. It’s uncomfortable. It can seem chaotic at times. But once you emerge on the other side, you’ll have something truly remarkable. Something you’ll be able to call yours and yours alone. I’m going to share a little history, help you gain some perspective on what’s actually important in marketing, and help give you a clear idea of why your customers will pay attention to you. Part Two will show you how to plan and carry out a marketing campaign, how to leverage scientific marketing principles, and how to build a highly scalable marketing operating system. This is all technical knowledge, and I’ll only be sharing it with you after I teach you about strategy in Part One. This is a backward approach to how most people learn marketing, and again, this is on purpose. I’ve given a lot of thought over the years to how my training programs are organized. If I taught you technical marketing skills before anything else, you’d end up putting those technical skills to use without a strategy. One more thing: remember that a lot of other people are facing the same marketing challenges as you. There are tens of millions of businesses out there. If you feel like you’re the only one who doesn’t get something, the truth is that there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who are facing the same challenge. No matter the size or type of business you are in, whether you’re a first-time entrepreneur or a seasoned executive, the lessons contained in this book are sure to give you a fresh and renewed perspective on the craft of marketing. PART ONE Despite its bad reputation all these years later, snake oil started as a legitimate product. In the late 1800s, during the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, thousands of Chinese immigrants came to the United States to fill the need for manual labor. They would spend their days swinging a hammer and, as you might expect, it took a toll on their bodies. Thankfully, they brought along all kinds of traditional Chinese treatments. One of those treatments was an ointment derived from the fat sack of a water snake commonly found in China. This particular water snake had an exceptionally high level of Omega-3 fatty acids—higher than that of wild-caught salmon. When applied to the skin, it quickly brought down inflammation and reduced pain. Snake oil was basically like 19th-Century Icy Hot. And it really worked. That is, until a man named Clark Stanley came along. Stanley found out about the magical properties of this snake oil and wanted in on the action. He started to figure out ways to sell his own. The only problem was that Chinese water snakes weren’t very common in the deserts of the western US. But you know what were? Rattlesnakes. Clark began concocting his own version of snake oil based on rattlesnake fat. It would have worked, too, if rattlesnake fat had an equally high concentration of Omega-3 fatty acids. But it didn’t, which meant that Clark Stanley’s Snake Oil Liniment, for lack of a better term, sucked. That didn’t stop old Clark, though. He started selling his fake ointment to as many people as he could find. As time passed, he realized he had to keep things fresh and innovative. Being a savvy marketer, he started adding ingredients like mineral oil, chili peppers, paint thinner, insecticide, and cooking grease. Hardly the kind of treatment the Chinese had originally intended. Before long, despite the real snake oil being an honest product, the popularized Snake Oil was diluted and twisted into a version that had no resemblance to the original. And since genuine snake oil was never widely produced by the Chinese, with no fancy labels or covered wagons to ship it across the country, snake oil began securing a reputation as a scam. But the damage didn’t stop there. Before long, other enterprising doctors came along with their own inventions, from Dalby’s Carminative (originally an opiate given to babies) to Dr. Pierce’s Medicines (which ended up containing high doses of morphine, cocaine, and opium). These fake cure-alls became known as patent medicines, and they began selling faster than actual medicine. The ingredients inside these patent medicines weren’t regulated. Most of them were dangerous and are still illegal to this day. Patent medicines promised relief to people in pain, hair to those who were bald, and all kinds of other miracle cures. The result of all of them, however, was nothing but frustration, addiction, sickness, and even death. The growth of these scams became such a crisis that, in 1906, the United States passed the Pure Food and Drug Act to curb the rampant sale of fake treatments. This act was a precursor to the creation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), which was established in 1916 and today strictly controls pharmaceutical testing and sales. Without this oversight and enforcement of health standards, the patent medicine crisis of the late 19th Century would have lasted much longer and led to even more problems. The enforcement of standards helps industries grow at a rate that benefits the consumer, not the industry. Standards are a necessary element of any product or service that strives to be of high quality. Healthcare has standards. Financial services have standards. Food and transportation have standards. Almost every major industry has standards that protect the customers from businesses taking advantage of them or mistakes being made. Even the marketing industry has standards. The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) is in place to protect consumers from illicit or misleading marketing. The CAN-SPAM act protects consumers from unwanted or abusive advertising practices. These and other organizations and acts of legislation are all productive components of the marketing industry—but there is a limit to their reach. The same benefits that the FTC offers to consumers like you and me are not extended to the Business-to-Business (B2B) Marketing industry which is filled with entrepreneurs and businesses who are trying to find marketing support from other companies, such as consultancies, apps, and agencies. And this, my friend, is the recipe for history repeating itself. In the B2B marketing industry, innovation is so ripe, and regulation is so weak that hucksters have become indiscernible from professionals and the pressure to keep up with the new has caused businesses to make short-term decisions at their own peril. The true craft of marketing, like the original snake oil, is starting to become eclipsed by hype. Left unchecked, these forces will eventually land on your doorstep—if they haven’t already. I’ll never forget the look on peoples’ faces at networking events when I said that I ran a marketing agency. Everything about their faces would change. Maybe you wouldn’t notice it if you were in the conversation, but I did. I saw the subtle changes in their eyebrows, the angle of their lips, their forehead wrinkles, and their eyes darting around the room, looking for an exit. All were signs that I had immediately transformed into someone who couldn’t be trusted. Nor should I have been—after all, I was in marketing. Professional marketers are among the least-trusted people in existence. According to a 2019 Gallup survey, the only professionals that are less trusted by consumers are car salespeople and members of Congress. When I was at those networking events, I felt like a snake oil salesman who accidentally wandered into a town he had already ripped off. Like the people I was talking to were afraid that at any point, I would pull out a contract, shove a pen in their hands, and yell Sign here! Or your business will PERISH!! I knew this. The marketing industry has developed a habit of spitting out a special breed of scam artists in recent years. Not only did I know it, but other entrepreneurs knew it, and executives who hired guys like me knew it. For me, marketing’s bad reputation was an occupational hazard, like an honest car mechanic trying to convince a customer that he’s not trying to pull a fast one and the transmission actually does need to be replaced. But things have been getting worse. One of the reasons the marketing industry has achieved such a high concentration of scam artists is that it’s moving so quickly—much like patent medicines in the 1800s. It’s commonplace to hire a marketer whose specialty makes absolutely NO sense to you—because they’re the only ones who have the time to stay on the cutting edge. When you are paying someone for skills that you can’t verify, all inside an industry with little to no regulation, the chances are higher than ever that the bad apples will get away with their schemes. So why isn’t there regulation? If this is such a problem, wouldn’t you think there would be governing institutions in place already? Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Regulation in the B2B marketing industry is impractical. Marketing moves and evolves too quickly. Regulations are built on a static and unmoving standard of how an industry operates, and they serve to provide a rulebook for everyone to follow. This works great in industries like dentistry, medicine, and finance where there are strict rules around what you can and can’t do. If you rip off a patient at your dental practice, you can lose your license. But there are no licenses in B2B marketing. There are no standardized exams, board certifications, or ethics committees. Which means if you rip someone off in the B2B marketing world, you can get away with it. In B2B marketing, new platforms and strategies rise and fall on a weekly basis, which means it would take longer to set up regulations than it would for innovations to hit the market. If an industry innovates too fast for the laws to keep up, the laws have no point. And the marketing industry has been innovating like crazy—there’s been a 52-times increase in marketing software platforms in the last ten years and it’s not slowing down. No amount of regulation can keep that level of innovation under control. Even if the regulations could keep up, there’s still no guarantee that they would be enforced. Imagine a lawsuit brought by an e-commerce company against a malicious unskilled marketer who ripped them off. What would the lawsuit say? That the marketer couldn’t achieve what was promised? There are no promises in marketing. It’s like any other investment—there’s a chance you’ll lose. Just for the sake of it, though, let’s consider the e-commerce company’s case. The prosecutor would have to demonstrate malicious intent, or at the very least, incompetence. Incompetence for a marketer would look something like selling an expensive marketing service without the knowledge of how to deliver the intended result. Two problems arise, though, at this point. First, it’s no guarantee that the marketer and the client were aligned on the intended result at the outset of the relationship. Second, marketing skills are hard to verify, making it difficult to make a good hiring decision. Remember the story of Mike and Shilo? Let’s say Mike wanted to sue Shilo for incompetence. He would have to prove that Shilo made promises he couldn’t keep. But Shilo did no such thing—he promised to carry out an Instagram ad campaign, and he succeeded. The numbers don’t lie. It would be clear to the court that Mike hired the wrong person—not that Shilo ripped him off. But, for the sake of our thought experiment here, let’s say that Shilo had a twin brother named Riley, and Riley was the malicious marketer behind the e-commerce company’s lawsuit. Riley took the same Instagram ads course as Shilo, but he started pounding his chest toward prospective clients, explaining that he was an expert in all things marketing. He presented the e-commerce company with a proposal that went way beyond the scope of Instagram ads, and in doing so began selling services that he wasn’t able to provide. If the e-commerce company wanted to get its money back and punish Riley, they’d have to demonstrate the same thing Mike would have had to demonstrate: incompetence. How do you think they would do that? By rifling through the textbooks in Riley’s apartment? By opening up Riley’s computer and seeing how many online courses he’d taken? The burden of proof would be on the e-commerce company—and the cost of acquiring the evidence to prove their case would, in all likelihood, be higher than just dropping the case. Without a method to determine whether Riley was innocent or guilty of being incompetent, the courts wouldn’t be able to dole out a punishment or help the e-commerce company recoup their investment (and that’s assuming Riley isn’t broke and hasn’t already spent the money, which is a long shot). So the e-commerce company drops the case and moves on. Now its priority is to avoid encountering the same situation in the future, which means addressing the same challenge we’ve been circling this whole time: verifying the skills of new specialists whose technical skills can neither be explained nor verified by the person making the hire. And the vicious cycle continues. This is the same cycle that makes it easy for a college dropout to slap a marketing title on their LinkedIn Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksMarketingFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
