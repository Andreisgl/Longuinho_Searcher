The essay proposes a socio-communicative analysis of the relationship between censorship, art and power, inspired by the imaginary interpretation of immoral representations probed by Vilfredo Pareto in the Virtuist myth and the immoral literature (1914). In particular, this essay is inspired by the visit in Rome of the Iranian President Rohani, made in January 2016. In that occasion the museum officials decided to cover up some old statues with plywood panels. The backdrop is the fast development of the possibilities of technical reproducibility of information, images, contents. This phenomenon engenders some relevant issues regarding the strategies of message sharing, in the era of permanent connectivity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To the fore is the progressive weakening of the didactic requirements, so as to introduce so-called “responsible autonomy” into our universities. The theoretical reflection on the current reformist process is developed in compliance with the European guidelines regarding the rationalization of the higher education systems (remarked in the communiqué of the Yerevan conference) and the sociological reflection on the post-modern universities. According to Vico, Habermas, Derrida and Bauman, universities should pose as cognitive, modern and inclusive spaces.

The Canadian sociologist considers the latter, fundamental in the definition of the Twentieth century’s modernity (Pound, Joyce, Eliot). McLuhan underlines «the exotic visual experience» generated by the female portraits by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, while the first modernity spread out: in the essay Culture without literacy (1953), McLuhan deals with the «grammar of the gesture» provided by the cine-camera in comparison with the «abstract medium of the printed word», renewed by the Pre-Raphaelites according to precise iconographic codes. He doesn’t ignore the social and cultural impact that the Pre-Raphaelite art has on the aesthetic sensitivity of the Nineteenth century, claiming the importance of the connection between art and society asserted by Ruskin and Pater. The Pre-Raphaelite experience allows McLuhan to explain the communicative revolution made by the symbolist writers in the way to represent the mental states of the mechanized society: they are the first to understand that poetry implies the meaning of the origins of things and it can reveal the core of the inner spaces of mind. Myth, symbol and metaphor interlace in an aesthetic tangle inspired by the need of dream: as a matter of fact, the invention of the symbolist way of communicating meant «the rediscovery of the inner space which, from a different perspective, Dante Alighieri mastered». This is a poetic principle that assumes communicative instances well known to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose creative involvement takes inspiration from Dante Alighieri’s poetry, conceived as an interior space renewed in the wake of the communicative changes peculiar of the electric era. According to McLuhan, this historical moment is a decisive phase for the development of the synesthetic communication of reality revisited by the Pre-Raphaelites in accordance with the allegorical pattern of Dante Alighieri’s poetry.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The purpose is to emphasize the restricted relationship between the human body, daily life and communicative efforts, in a time lacking in electric media and amplification devices. The concept of cities as a «work of metaphor» inspiring Flesh and Stone (1994) stems from the human effort to mould urban systems in line with the idea of social functionality and linguistic efficiency. The endeavor of collective sociality matches the target of shared communication, in accordance with specific rhetoric strategies and symbolic paradigms: the Adonia festival in Athens, public orations in the Romanum Comitium, lectiones and disputationes in medieval Paris are three different kinds of institutionalized communication having been developed through the definition of thorough verbal rituals and behavioral gestures. Therefore, it is possible to interpret urban environments as the reflection of this oral sociability, insofar as the power of language may influence urban planning both for lay and religious matters. Cities can be considered as an astonishing process of metaphor referring to the connection between “flesh and words”: this is what Sennett’s socio-historical survey points out about public speaking across the centuries, in line with significant expressive and aesthetic processes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Workshop ‒ within the course of Sociology of Education – suggested a double-analysis perspective, both ministerial and academic, which was developed thanks to the work previously carried out by the author at the Ministry of Education, University and Research. More specifically the analysis of university legislation dealt with the accreditation of degree courses started by the so-called “Pacchetto serietà” (2007) and strengthened by Law no. 240/2010 introducing (art. 5) the so called AVA system (self-evaluation, evaluation and accreditation). This essay emphasizes the programmatic priorities inspiring the process of teaching rationalization, by focusing on some keywords featuring not only ministerial decrees no. 506/2007 and 544/2007, but also Law no. 240/2010 (art. 5) and ministerial decrees no. 47/2013 and 6/2019. The analysis of keywords ought to highlight the most important reformist tendencies and programmatic priorities. In conclusion, the essay is supported by the survey of the latest Eurostudent report concerning the quality of university students’ lives, so as to test the effects of Italian university innovation on higher education accessibility.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, Cambridge University recorded the highest number of incidents, after introducing a new reporting system. Thanks to its communicative impact, The Guardian investigation allows a further analysis into the reasons why universities failed to tackle sexual misconduct and did not succeed in enacting reforms to support and protect victims. This could be one of the most significant aspectsof post-modern universities, partly enhanced by the perception of danger, both psychological and physical. Thanks to The Guardian’s investigation, and media emphasis on those figures, it is possible to interpret universities as places of risk in an era marked both by connected knowledge and relationships and by mass slaughters and the collective risks sometimes stemming from the involvement in research activities in unsafe countries. Sexual harassment in universities –perpetrated especially by students, as The Guardian inquiry emphasizes – sheds a light on the silent but painfully awkward situation of victims, usually unable to denounce the misconduct perpetrated by both students and staff.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Nascita della terza pagina. D'Annunzio, Sighele e il mito di Francesca da RiminiRassegna dannunziana,  2018Il saggio si focalizza sull’eco giornalistica che Francesca da Rimini ebbe alla sua prima rappres... more Il saggio si focalizza sull’eco giornalistica che Francesca da Rimini ebbe alla sua prima rappresentazione, avvenuta al Teatro Costanzi di Roma il 9 dicembre 1902. Un dramma, quello dannunziano, oggi probabilmente più noto tra gli storici del giornalismo che tra gli studiosi di letteratura, musica o teatro.Questo perché le quattro recensioni commissionate da Alberto Bergamini sul «Giornale d’Italia» l’11 dicembre 1901 hanno sancito la nascita della Terza pagina, destinata a caratterizzare la storia del giornalismo italiano. Rielaborando il celebre episodio del quinto canto dell’Inferno, d’Annunzio portò in scena – con pathos e originalità – il dissidio tra violenza, passione e tradimento, sulla scorta di un modello, quello dantesco, risemantizzato nel segno del connubio tra arcaismo e innovazione.Si tratta di un aspetto colto dai recensori della prima ora e, in particolare, da Scipio Sighele, che sulla «Nuova Antologia» (16 maggio 1902) constatava l’abilità del poeta nel plasmare personaggi malati, violenti ed efferati (nel caso di Gianciotto e Malatestino), meglio riusciti rispetto alle figure di Paolo e Francesca. D’Annunzio rielabora così un mito letterario, ma anche umano e psicologico, fondato su un’attenta strategia promozionale e comunicativa, come dimostrano anche i tagli apportati anni dopo al testo dell’opera dal giovane Riccardo Zandonai, autore della riduzione in musica dell’opera (rappresentata al teatro Regio di Torino il 19 febbraio 1914).Il ritorno di Francesca al teatro alla Scala nella primavera 2018, ben 39 anni dopo l’ultima rappresentazione al Piermarini, segna la rivalutazione di un’opera a lungo trascurata, ma modernissima nella definizione di temi di attualità come il femminicidio e la violenza in famiglia, in una chiave lirica e psicologica.  Aspetti colti dalla stampa nazionale, pressoché unanime nel rilevare la complessità drammatica del testo dannunziano, all’epoca “levigato” da Zandonai e oggi re-interpretato dal regista David Pountney. Un adattamento comunicativo in piena regola, funzionale amantenere in vita la vicenda tragica di Francesca da Rimini, interpretabile come mito non solo artistico, ma anche giornalistico del nostro tempo.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Roland Barthes and the " beauty of speed " : sports as a Futurist mythThe paper deals with Roland Barthes' interpretation of sports as a contemporary myth, becoming a ... more The paper deals with Roland Barthes' interpretation of sports as a contemporary myth, becoming a semiotic and communicative medium with the approach of consumer society. In particular, the paper dwells on the transformation of motor racing into a collective myth, in accordance with Marinetti's celebration of speed. The texts arranged by Barthes for the documentary directed by Aubert Aquin (Les sport et les hommes, 1960-1961) enable an analysis of the diffusion of sports as a mere collective business. Therefore, the paper revolves around Barthes' ability to elaborate a theoretical framework suitable for the study of contemporary myths, in line with the Futurist " beauty of speed ". Juan Manuel Fangio embodied the real social myth, nowadays enhanced by Luis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. The latter won the 2018 edition of the F1 Canadian Gp forty years after Gilles Villeneuve reached his first victory. The deaths of Villeneuve and Senna and Schumacher's serious injury attest that speed has become an effective social myth, suspended between risks and immortality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In primo piano, il processo di drammatizzazione mediale e la tendenza all'enfatizzazione comunicativa legata ai " rischi " della mobilità universitaria, con particolare riguardo per l'impegno di ricercatori italiani impegnati all'estero. Parole chiave: formazione universitaria, mobilità internazionale, spazio del rischio The focus of this paper is to define the academic space as a " place of insecurity " , starting from the analysis of the news reports on the circumstances regarding the death of Valeria Solesin and Giulio Regeni. The two Italian researchers died in November 2015 and February 2016 respectively, Valeria in Paris and Giulio in Cairo. To the fore is the process of media dramatization and the tendency to accentuate facts connected to the " risks " of university mobility, with specific reference to the Italian researchers traveling abroad.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To the fore is the progressive weakening of the didactic requirements, so as to introduce so-called “responsible autonomy” into our universities. The theoretical reflection on the current reformist process is developed in compliance with the European guidelines regarding the rationalization of the higher education systems (remarked in the communiqué of the Yerevan conference) and the sociological reflection on the post-modern universities. According to Vico, Habermas, Derrida and Bauman, universities should pose as cognitive, modern and inclusive spaces. In particular, Bauman’s metaphor at the beginning of the BolognaProcess on universities’ meta-change provides interesting interpretative keys. The metaphor of meta-change, referred to post-modern education institutions, allows a better understanding of the difficulties that universities face such as the functional and cultural shifts peculiar to the liquid society. As a matter of fact, the revision of didactic parameters implies the need to satisfy the educational instances of the post-modern actors, submerged in the fluctuating complexity of our times.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
" The meta-language of an absent world " . Baudrillard, McLuhan and the media consumptionThis essay aims to delve into the reflections upon the media consumption developed by Baudrillard... more This essay aims to delve into the reflections upon the media consumption developed by Baudrillard in one of the central paragraphs of The Consumer Society (1970), focused on Marshall McLuhan's theory of media. The purpose is to dwell on those factors that, according to Baudrillard, determined the functional transformation of the mainstream medium into a denotative medium, founded on the construction and diffusion of particular signs and social meanings. In the aforementioned paragraph, titled " medium is message " , Baudrillard further investigates some insights developed by McLuhan in Understanding media (1964). He extends his semiotic approach to the world of media (and in particular to television) and focuses on the new literacy of mainstream culture. His plan is to support the interpretation of social consumption as a communication process. In particular, Baudrillard dwells on two of McLuhan's insights, referred to the appearance of the media society. On the one hand, he analyzes the power that media have to alter " deep down and unconsciously " (Baudrillard, 1970, p. 123) the sensitive relationships and the perceptive models of the social actors. On the other he deals with the power of mass media to " neutralize the lived, unique, eventual character of the world and substitute for it a multiple universe of media which, as such, are homogeneous one with another, signifying each other reciprocally and referring back and forth to each other " (Baudrillard, 1970, p. 124). The replacement of experiences with objects and symbols expresses one of the trademarks of the consumer society that Baudrillard probes starting from the correspondence between the medium and the message pointed out by McLuhan. Baudrillard exploits the topic of the tribalization peculiar to homo tecnologicus, just to understand the symbolic distance between the old manuscript or typographic civilization and the new era of images, shaped by cinema and television. Baudrillard provides a stimulating interpretation of media as advice able to modify our perceptive faculties. This is one of the most interesting aspects of his analysis of the television consumption, destined to convey the ideology of omnipotence of a system and superimposable symbols. Hence, the interpretation of TV images (applicable to the contemporary digital world too), as a " metalanguage of an absent world " influencing the cultural, value and symbolic dimension, observed by means of the magnifying glass of McLuhan's telescope.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Baudrillard between Benjamin and McLuhan: 'the Narcissistic Seduction' of the Media SocietyThis paper aims to further investigate some aspects of Baudrillard’s analysis of the media societ... more This paper aims to further investigate some aspects of Baudrillard’s analysis of the media society, influenced by Benjamin’s aesthetic teaching and McLuhan’s mediological legacy. His purpose is to probe the effects of the symbolic speedup fueled by the repeatability of messages and contents, constantly substituted by their immanent abstractions. The dominion of the signifier upon the signified, the replacement of the referendum with its referential highlights, the emphasis on the semiotic complexity of contemporary myths (as already remarked by Barthes), all this is destined to turn media into body extensions. Hence follows the ‘narcissistic seduction’ of television, as McLuhan outlines in reference to the tautological nature of mainstream media. In this sense, Baudrillard does not neglect the heuristic relevance of daily experience, conceived as an ‘open work’ by Eco. To the fore are the expressive shifts engendered by the cultural industry in the age of consumer fever. The result is Baudrillard’s syncretistic analysis of our communicative uncertainty. The latter stems from the meaningful and repeatable objects permeating the social act, increasingly influenced by the ‘narcissistic seduction’ of media.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The ʽvirtuistʼ society. Pareto and the myth of immoral representationsThe paper aims at actualizing the metaphor of the ʽvertuistʾ society drawn by Vilfredo Pareto in ... more The paper aims at actualizing the metaphor of the ʽvertuistʾ society drawn by Vilfredo Pareto in his famous essay The Vertuist Myth and Immoral Literature (1914), in reference to the allegedly ʽimmoralʾ representations in literature, by highlighting the hypocrisies and moralism peculiar of the conservative thought. In particular, the paper takes one’s cue from the strong criticism provoked by the decision of the Italian Government to cover up some of the statues exposed in the Capitoline Museums, during the official visit of the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on January 25th 2016. According to government officials, the statues have been covered with the purpose to ʽshow respect to Iranian culture and sensitivityʾ. The case of the covered statues allows us to reflect on the myth of the ʽvertuistʾ myth pointed out by Vilfredo Pareto in his essay, aimed at dissociating himself from the attempts to censor or stigmatize the ʽimmoralʾ representations proposed by the classical, modern and contemporary literature. Pareto can still provide the sociological tools to interpret the appearance of the new ʽvertuistʾ society, generated not only by the advance of integralism, but also by the decay of cultural identity, bolstered by the globalized interactions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Giambattista Vico and the criticality of University: a (symbolic) lesson for the modern worldby Andrea Lombardinilo and Carlo CappaThis paper is focused on Vico’s reflections about the incoming shifts in  the University of his t... more This paper is focused on Vico’s reflections about the incoming shifts in  the University of his time, involved in the didactic changes fostered by the Cartesian method. The purpose of this study is to point out the possible suggestions between the old and the new criticalities which characterize the process of modernization of the  current Universities, projected towards the functional complexity of post-modernity.Vico’s insights on the need to define a new method of the studies and enhance a better convergence among the different disciplines will be one of the main foci of this paper. Some of the criticalities highlighted by Vico are connected to the scientific rationalism and the diffusion of printing books and texts. From this perspective, the advent of the press seems to stimulate the superficial knowledge and the oblivion of classical authors burdened by the anxiety of modernization. For this reason, in the inaugural speech De nostri temporis studiorum ratione (1708), Vico complains about the disadvantages generated by typefaces, bound to facilitate the access to knowledge and education. The focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the press in the educational practices is related to the analysis of fragmentation and specialization peculiar of the Cartesian University. The latter has been criticized by Vico in reference to the advance of scientific progress, social changes and interactional shifts. The solution to the didactic fragmentation of the typographic universities can be noticed in the creation of a different method of studies, bound to exalt and enhance the cognitive skills of youth. This is what Vico hopes for in De mente heroica (1732) in which he  deals with an innovative educational proposal. In this perspective, the dichotomy between advantages and disadvantages is significant to interpret the path towards the  the University as a market square featured in McLuhan’s writings. Furthermore, it seems to foreshadow the idea of University in a democracy as suggested by Habermas. This is the reason why Vico’s criticism may conjure up a different conception of the University reformism, based on the social and cultural function of knowledge to the extent of being more meaningful than governance and management issues. As a matter of fact, the challenge of rationalization cannot be separated from the analysis of the cognitive and disciplinary priorities often disconnected from the professional and economic contingencies. Vico’s speech is addressed to the students of his University. Thus he can remark the educational rights claimed by the stakeholders in the presence of the academic actors. It is not a case that the same issues are underlined by the prophet of the global village of information, Marshall McLuhan. The latter is aware of Vico’s importance in the definition of historical recourses - basically - the vision of University as «a market square» inherits the criticism of the cognitive fragmentation stated by Vico. The convergence between the disciplines looms as a programmatic reform process, well ahead of the multidisciplinary eagerness of the globalized Universities to come.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Workshop ‒ within the course of Sociology of Education – suggested a double-analysis perspective, both ministerial and academic, which was developed thanks to the work previously carried out by the author at the Ministry of Education, University and Research. More specifically the analysis of university legislation dealt with the accreditation of degree courses started by the so-called “Pacchetto serietà” (2007) and strengthened by Law no. 240/2010 introducing (art. 5) the so called AVA system (self-evaluation, evaluation and accreditation). This essay emphasizes the programmatic priorities inspiring the process of teaching rationalization, by focusing on some keywords featuring not only ministerial decrees no. 506/2007 and 544/2007, but also Law no. 240/2010 (art. 5) and ministerial decrees no. 47/2013 and 6/2019. The analysis of keywords ought to highlight the most important reformist tendencies and programmatic priorities. In conclusion, the essay is supported by the survey of the latest Eurostudent report concerning the quality of university students’ lives, so as to test the effects of Italian university innovation on higher education accessibility.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Unsafe Education": Misconduct and Abuse in the Risk UniversityItalian Journal of Sociology of Education,  2019The paper deals with the increasing phenomenon of sexual harassment
in the academic environment, ... more The paper deals with the increasing phenomenon of sexual harassmentin the academic environment, according to the figures of The Guardianinvestigation concerning sexual misconduct in UK Universities. In particular, Cambridge University recorded the highest number of incidents, after introducing a new reporting system. Thanks to its communicative impact, The Guardian investigation allows a further analysis into the reasons why universities failed to tackle sexual misconduct and did not succeed in enacting reforms to support and protect victims. This could be one of the most significant aspectsof post-modern universities, partly enhanced by the perception of danger, both psychological and physical. Thanks to The Guardian’s investigation, and media emphasis on those figures, it is possible to interpret universities as places of risk in an era marked both by connected knowledge and relationships and by mass slaughters and the collective risks sometimes stemming from the involvement in research activities in unsafe countries. Sexual harassment in universities –perpetrated especially by students, as The Guardian inquiry emphasizes – sheds a light on the silent but painfully awkward situation of victims, usually unable to denounce the misconduct perpetrated by both students and staff.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Nascita della terza pagina. D'Annunzio, Sighele e il mito di Francesca da RiminiRassegna dannunziana,  2018Il saggio si focalizza sull’eco giornalistica che Francesca da Rimini ebbe alla sua prima rappres... more Il saggio si focalizza sull’eco giornalistica che Francesca da Rimini ebbe alla sua prima rappresentazione, avvenuta al Teatro Costanzi di Roma il 9 dicembre 1902. Un dramma, quello dannunziano, oggi probabilmente più noto tra gli storici del giornalismo che tra gli studiosi di letteratura, musica o teatro.Questo perché le quattro recensioni commissionate da Alberto Bergamini sul «Giornale d’Italia» l’11 dicembre 1901 hanno sancito la nascita della Terza pagina, destinata a caratterizzare la storia del giornalismo italiano. Rielaborando il celebre episodio del quinto canto dell’Inferno, d’Annunzio portò in scena – con pathos e originalità – il dissidio tra violenza, passione e tradimento, sulla scorta di un modello, quello dantesco, risemantizzato nel segno del connubio tra arcaismo e innovazione.Si tratta di un aspetto colto dai recensori della prima ora e, in particolare, da Scipio Sighele, che sulla «Nuova Antologia» (16 maggio 1902) constatava l’abilità del poeta nel plasmare personaggi malati, violenti ed efferati (nel caso di Gianciotto e Malatestino), meglio riusciti rispetto alle figure di Paolo e Francesca. D’Annunzio rielabora così un mito letterario, ma anche umano e psicologico, fondato su un’attenta strategia promozionale e comunicativa, come dimostrano anche i tagli apportati anni dopo al testo dell’opera dal giovane Riccardo Zandonai, autore della riduzione in musica dell’opera (rappresentata al teatro Regio di Torino il 19 febbraio 1914).Il ritorno di Francesca al teatro alla Scala nella primavera 2018, ben 39 anni dopo l’ultima rappresentazione al Piermarini, segna la rivalutazione di un’opera a lungo trascurata, ma modernissima nella definizione di temi di attualità come il femminicidio e la violenza in famiglia, in una chiave lirica e psicologica.  Aspetti colti dalla stampa nazionale, pressoché unanime nel rilevare la complessità drammatica del testo dannunziano, all’epoca “levigato” da Zandonai e oggi re-interpretato dal regista David Pountney. Un adattamento comunicativo in piena regola, funzionale amantenere in vita la vicenda tragica di Francesca da Rimini, interpretabile come mito non solo artistico, ma anche giornalistico del nostro tempo.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Roland Barthes and the " beauty of speed " : sports as a Futurist mythThe paper deals with Roland Barthes' interpretation of sports as a contemporary myth, becoming a ... more The paper deals with Roland Barthes' interpretation of sports as a contemporary myth, becoming a semiotic and communicative medium with the approach of consumer society. In particular, the paper dwells on the transformation of motor racing into a collective myth, in accordance with Marinetti's celebration of speed. The texts arranged by Barthes for the documentary directed by Aubert Aquin (Les sport et les hommes, 1960-1961) enable an analysis of the diffusion of sports as a mere collective business. Therefore, the paper revolves around Barthes' ability to elaborate a theoretical framework suitable for the study of contemporary myths, in line with the Futurist " beauty of speed ". Juan Manuel Fangio embodied the real social myth, nowadays enhanced by Luis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. The latter won the 2018 edition of the F1 Canadian Gp forty years after Gilles Villeneuve reached his first victory. The deaths of Villeneuve and Senna and Schumacher's serious injury attest that speed has become an effective social myth, suspended between risks and immortality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In primo piano, il processo di drammatizzazione mediale e la tendenza all'enfatizzazione comunicativa legata ai " rischi " della mobilità universitaria, con particolare riguardo per l'impegno di ricercatori italiani impegnati all'estero. Parole chiave: formazione universitaria, mobilità internazionale, spazio del rischio The focus of this paper is to define the academic space as a " place of insecurity " , starting from the analysis of the news reports on the circumstances regarding the death of Valeria Solesin and Giulio Regeni. The two Italian researchers died in November 2015 and February 2016 respectively, Valeria in Paris and Giulio in Cairo. To the fore is the process of media dramatization and the tendency to accentuate facts connected to the " risks " of university mobility, with specific reference to the Italian researchers traveling abroad.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, this essay is inspired by the visit in Rome of the Iranian President Rohani, made in January 2016. In that occasion the museum officials decided to cover up some old statues with plywood panels. The backdrop is the fast development of the possibilities of technical reproducibility of information, images, contents. This phenomenon engenders some relevant issues regarding the strategies of message sharing, in the era of permanent connectivity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Delayed " Meta-Change " of the Italian University: the Way to Rationalization And The Challenge of Didactic RequirementsThis essay focuses on the ongoing reformist process involving the Italian Universities and most i... more This essay focuses on the ongoing reformist process involving the Italian Universities and most importantly, the accreditation and evaluation of the didactic courses. To the fore is the progressive weakening of the didactic requirements, so as to introduce so-called “responsible autonomy” into our universities. The theoretical reflection on the current reformist process is developed in compliance with the European guidelines regarding the rationalization of the higher education systems (remarked in the communiqué of the Yerevan conference) and the sociological reflection on the post-modern universities. According to Vico, Habermas, Derrida and Bauman, universities should pose as cognitive, modern and inclusive spaces. In particular, Bauman’s metaphor at the beginning of the BolognaProcess on universities’ meta-change provides interesting interpretative keys. The metaphor of meta-change, referred to post-modern education institutions, allows a better understanding of the difficulties that universities face such as the functional and cultural shifts peculiar to the liquid society. As a matter of fact, the revision of didactic parameters implies the need to satisfy the educational instances of the post-modern actors, submerged in the fluctuating complexity of our times.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
" The meta-language of an absent world " . Baudrillard, McLuhan and the media consumptionThis essay aims to delve into the reflections upon the media consumption developed by Baudrillard... more This essay aims to delve into the reflections upon the media consumption developed by Baudrillard in one of the central paragraphs of The Consumer Society (1970), focused on Marshall McLuhan's theory of media. The purpose is to dwell on those factors that, according to Baudrillard, determined the functional transformation of the mainstream medium into a denotative medium, founded on the construction and diffusion of particular signs and social meanings. In the aforementioned paragraph, titled " medium is message " , Baudrillard further investigates some insights developed by McLuhan in Understanding media (1964). He extends his semiotic approach to the world of media (and in particular to television) and focuses on the new literacy of mainstream culture. His plan is to support the interpretation of social consumption as a communication process. In particular, Baudrillard dwells on two of McLuhan's insights, referred to the appearance of the media society. On the one hand, he analyzes the power that media have to alter " deep down and unconsciously " (Baudrillard, 1970, p. 123) the sensitive relationships and the perceptive models of the social actors. On the other he deals with the power of mass media to " neutralize the lived, unique, eventual character of the world and substitute for it a multiple universe of media which, as such, are homogeneous one with another, signifying each other reciprocally and referring back and forth to each other " (Baudrillard, 1970, p. 124). The replacement of experiences with objects and symbols expresses one of the trademarks of the consumer society that Baudrillard probes starting from the correspondence between the medium and the message pointed out by McLuhan. Baudrillard exploits the topic of the tribalization peculiar to homo tecnologicus, just to understand the symbolic distance between the old manuscript or typographic civilization and the new era of images, shaped by cinema and television. Baudrillard provides a stimulating interpretation of media as advice able to modify our perceptive faculties. This is one of the most interesting aspects of his analysis of the television consumption, destined to convey the ideology of omnipotence of a system and superimposable symbols. Hence, the interpretation of TV images (applicable to the contemporary digital world too), as a " metalanguage of an absent world " influencing the cultural, value and symbolic dimension, observed by means of the magnifying glass of McLuhan's telescope.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Baudrillard between Benjamin and McLuhan: 'the Narcissistic Seduction' of the Media SocietyThis paper aims to further investigate some aspects of Baudrillard’s analysis of the media societ... more This paper aims to further investigate some aspects of Baudrillard’s analysis of the media society, influenced by Benjamin’s aesthetic teaching and McLuhan’s mediological legacy. His purpose is to probe the effects of the symbolic speedup fueled by the repeatability of messages and contents, constantly substituted by their immanent abstractions. The dominion of the signifier upon the signified, the replacement of the referendum with its referential highlights, the emphasis on the semiotic complexity of contemporary myths (as already remarked by Barthes), all this is destined to turn media into body extensions. Hence follows the ‘narcissistic seduction’ of television, as McLuhan outlines in reference to the tautological nature of mainstream media. In this sense, Baudrillard does not neglect the heuristic relevance of daily experience, conceived as an ‘open work’ by Eco. To the fore are the expressive shifts engendered by the cultural industry in the age of consumer fever. The result is Baudrillard’s syncretistic analysis of our communicative uncertainty. The latter stems from the meaningful and repeatable objects permeating the social act, increasingly influenced by the ‘narcissistic seduction’ of media.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The ʽvirtuistʼ society. Pareto and the myth of immoral representationsThe paper aims at actualizing the metaphor of the ʽvertuistʾ society drawn by Vilfredo Pareto in ... more The paper aims at actualizing the metaphor of the ʽvertuistʾ society drawn by Vilfredo Pareto in his famous essay The Vertuist Myth and Immoral Literature (1914), in reference to the allegedly ʽimmoralʾ representations in literature, by highlighting the hypocrisies and moralism peculiar of the conservative thought. In particular, the paper takes one’s cue from the strong criticism provoked by the decision of the Italian Government to cover up some of the statues exposed in the Capitoline Museums, during the official visit of the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on January 25th 2016. According to government officials, the statues have been covered with the purpose to ʽshow respect to Iranian culture and sensitivityʾ. The case of the covered statues allows us to reflect on the myth of the ʽvertuistʾ myth pointed out by Vilfredo Pareto in his essay, aimed at dissociating himself from the attempts to censor or stigmatize the ʽimmoralʾ representations proposed by the classical, modern and contemporary literature. Pareto can still provide the sociological tools to interpret the appearance of the new ʽvertuistʾ society, generated not only by the advance of integralism, but also by the decay of cultural identity, bolstered by the globalized interactions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Giambattista Vico and the criticality of University: a (symbolic) lesson for the modern worldby Andrea Lombardinilo and Carlo CappaThis paper is focused on Vico’s reflections about the incoming shifts in  the University of his t... more This paper is focused on Vico’s reflections about the incoming shifts in  the University of his time, involved in the didactic changes fostered by the Cartesian method. The purpose of this study is to point out the possible suggestions between the old and the new criticalities which characterize the process of modernization of the  current Universities, projected towards the functional complexity of post-modernity.Vico’s insights on the need to define a new method of the studies and enhance a better convergence among the different disciplines will be one of the main foci of this paper. Some of the criticalities highlighted by Vico are connected to the scientific rationalism and the diffusion of printing books and texts. From this perspective, the advent of the press seems to stimulate the superficial knowledge and the oblivion of classical authors burdened by the anxiety of modernization. For this reason, in the inaugural speech De nostri temporis studiorum ratione (1708), Vico complains about the disadvantages generated by typefaces, bound to facilitate the access to knowledge and education. The focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the press in the educational practices is related to the analysis of fragmentation and specialization peculiar of the Cartesian University. The latter has been criticized by Vico in reference to the advance of scientific progress, social changes and interactional shifts. The solution to the didactic fragmentation of the typographic universities can be noticed in the creation of a different method of studies, bound to exalt and enhance the cognitive skills of youth. This is what Vico hopes for in De mente heroica (1732) in which he  deals with an innovative educational proposal. In this perspective, the dichotomy between advantages and disadvantages is significant to interpret the path towards the  the University as a market square featured in McLuhan’s writings. Furthermore, it seems to foreshadow the idea of University in a democracy as suggested by Habermas. This is the reason why Vico’s criticism may conjure up a different conception of the University reformism, based on the social and cultural function of knowledge to the extent of being more meaningful than governance and management issues. As a matter of fact, the challenge of rationalization cannot be separated from the analysis of the cognitive and disciplinary priorities often disconnected from the professional and economic contingencies. Vico’s speech is addressed to the students of his University. Thus he can remark the educational rights claimed by the stakeholders in the presence of the academic actors. It is not a case that the same issues are underlined by the prophet of the global village of information, Marshall McLuhan. The latter is aware of Vico’s importance in the definition of historical recourses - basically - the vision of University as «a market square» inherits the criticism of the cognitive fragmentation stated by Vico. The convergence between the disciplines looms as a programmatic reform process, well ahead of the multidisciplinary eagerness of the globalized Universities to come.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
