December[edit]
cs.wikisource ended 2006 1410 pages late in the evening of the Dezember 31th 2006 being in contact on IRC
cs.wikisource: in the evening we have 1000 pages (congratulations will be accepted on our Scriptorium - thx. -jkb- 20:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC) and the teamReply[reply]
8: en.wikisource: After a copyright inquiry to the Judicial Yuan of the Republic of China based in Taiwan, a reply has explained that English translations of the Judicial Yuan Interpretations have been translated by governmentally contracted outside translators whose names have been indicated, so as the Judicial Yuan website allows personal noncommercial reproduction only, the English translations of its interpretations hosted at its website cannot be freely copied to English Wikisource. However, as the original Chinese interpretations are in the public domain, Wikisource users may make their own translations to be released under the GNU Free Documentation License.--Jusjih 17:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
ca.wikisource had 200 pages
November[edit]
After English Wikisource has finally found that the United Nations has released its resolutions into the public domain, French Wikisource has followed this finding and undeleted previously deleted resolutions.--Jusjih 17:08, 16 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
12: French started a serious effort of quality and promotion. Most works are not categorized, many new portals have been created. An ongoing debate is taking place about the inclusion of Gaston Leroux's works because of their copyright status. Yann 00:32, 12 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
11: en.wikisource: For much of this year, the copyright disputes (archived in April and May) of the United Nations works have bothered the users there. Chinese and French Wikisource with some UN works have also been affected. Fortunately, Administrative_Instruction_ST/AI/189/Add.9/Rev.2 has been discovered in November to release many, though not all, UN works into the public domain. This major discovery has allowed Wikisource to resume collecting UN resolutions.--Jusjih 12:12, 11 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
October[edit]
All content in Catalan languague migrated to ca.wikisource
September[edit]
fr.wikisource: In September, a new namespace was created for proofreading (Page:), together with a very nice feature developed by ThomasV. Now we have about the same functionalities of other projects like Distributed Proofreaders. Yann 19:42, 15 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
fr.wikisource: After a discussion at fr:Wikisource:Pages soupçonnées de copyright, it has been agreed that all United Nations works published after 1 March 1989 are automatically copyrighted pursuant to the United States law, so they may not be posted while they are not GFDL-compliant.--Jusjih 14:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
August[edit]
25: en.wikisource: The revamp of policy and help pages has been completed for some time.  Categories still need work.  We have also nearly complete the migration all chapters to subpages.  Along with that there has been a massive effort to add a standardized header with title, author, etc. to ALL pages.  Currently only 2,000 pages out of over 20,000 are left without headers.  We have found these headers very useful for navigation as well standardizing the look of the website.  I encourage all other subdomains think about using a similar template before reaching 20,000 pages.--BirgitteSB 19:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
July and August have seen great changes for the French language Wikisource. Many new contributors are active. Three important and voluminous works are in the making, all with a complete set of scans of the original: Montaigne's Essays, the complete work of Pierre de Fermat and the Encyclopedy of the Enlighment, from Diderot and d'Alembert. We started to have a weekly renewable extract of a work on the Main Page, and we expect that it will attract new readers and contributors. We also started to discuss a validation procedure. Yann 18:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
9: The Arabic Wikisource began with a flurry of activity by several of the most active contributors to Arabic Wikipedia (such as Chaos). The activity then died down for a while after the Main Page was set up. It seems that the Arabic contibutors are juggling several projects with a limited amount of manpower. But activity has recently picked up again.

Digitization of a precious 16th-century handwritten mathematical schoolbook[edit]
In may 2006 Wikimedia Germany (the "Verein") financed the digitizing of 
a handwritten mathematical schoolbook called "Drei Register 
Arithmetischer ahnfeng zur Practic". The precious 16th-century 
manuscript has been scanned at the Center for Retrospective Digitization 
of the Lower Saxony State and University Library in Goettingen. Today 
about a quarter of the 210 pages has been transcribed and annotated in 
the German Wikisource. Actually a project in the German Wikiversity is 
dealing with the analysis of the book.

Third volume of the "Zimmerische Chronik" transcribed[edit]
At the beginning of September 2006 the third volume of the so called 
"Zimmerische Chronik" (a chronicle written by count Froben Christoph von 
Zimmern in the 16th century and published 1881 by the german historian 
Karl August Barack) had been transcribed. The transcription of the 
4-volume work is one of the biggest projects in the German Wikisource. 
The e-text-edition was initiated by a historian of the University of 
Freiburg im Breisgau, who actually acts as a scientific advisor for the 
project.

Update: In December 2006, the last pages were proofreaded and the whole project - containing 4 volumes with more than 600 pages each - was finished.
First publication of a handwritten letter of Fredrick Accum[edit]
Today German Wikisource announces the first publication of a handwritten 
letter of the german chemist Fredrick Accum to his brother Philip (April 
26th 1816). Accum emigrated to London in 1793 and became professor of 
chemistry and mineralogy at the Surrey Institute around 1803. Fredrick 
Accum, who is largely forgotten today, is one of the pioneers of the 
commercial production of coal gas for gas lighting. In his letter he 
gives a lively picture of the economic condition in London after the end 
of the napoleonic wars.

To faciliate the work of the german Wikisource community in the future, 
the german "Verein" provided a budget of 1.500 EUR (about 1.900 USD) for 
the digitizing of old books and manuscripts. The members of the 
community themselves will decide conjointly how to spend this money on 
new projects.

Automatic Chinese converter, also used at Chinese Wikipedia and Wiktionary, accommmodates both traditional and simplified Chinese at one Chinese site. It is a major benefit for Chinese users after splitting from the multilingual Wikisource. However, as Chinese simplification started in 1956 in Communist China and 1969 in Singapore, more users have agreed that earlier source texts should be posted in traditional Chinese. Older texts in simplified characters are being tagged to catch anyone's attention to revert them to their original forms in traditional Chinese.--Jusjih 15:06, 10 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Chinese Wikisource had just more than 1400 articles in January 2006, but as of September 2006, the articles increased to 5500.--Jusjih 15:06, 10 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
