Abby  WheatleyArizona State University,  Barrett, the Honors College,  Faculty MemberMobility+9Abby C. Wheatley is a cultural anthropologist with research and teaching interests in international migration and mobility, human rights, and transnational community regeneration. Spanning two regions, the US-Mexico and EU-Africa borders, her research considers the mechanisms through which migration becomes a dangerous and deadly endeavor, the strategies developed by people in transit to survive precarious crossings, and local efforts to circumvent failed immigration and refugee policies. Since 2013 she has been working closely with people in transit, community groups, and migrant justice activists on the Arizona-Sonora border, and in Lampedusa, Italy, since 2016. Before coming to Barrett, Abby taught courses on international migration, Latino experiences in the U.S., and Cultural Anthropology. In recent years, she has led more than fifteen field courses on Mexican and Central American migration through BorderLinks, an immersion program situated on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border that lays the foundation for understanding the intertwined processes of militarization, securitization, and criminalization. Abby received her B.A., magna cum laude, from Occidental College in 2004 and her Ph.D. in Social and Cultural Anthropology from the California Institute of Integral Studies in 2015, where she also earned an M.A. in Cultural Anthropology and Social Transformation.less9 Followers3 Following2 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingCVArticlesKeep Moving: collective agency along the migrant trailby Ruth  Gomberg-Munoz and Abby  WheatleyRecent scholarship has shown how aggressive policing along the US–Mexico border and in the interi... more Recent scholarship has shown how aggressive policing along the US–Mexico border and in the interiors of the United States and Mexico has heightened migrants’ vulnerability to violence, death, displacement, and exploitation. Here, we explore how migrants engage in social practices to respond to state violence along an extended and militarized migrant trail. We show how migrants form part of a broader landscape of sociopolitical contestation with organizations, cartels, local communities, and state agencies, wherein they generate new forms of sociality and strategic cooperation to promote their survival and well-being. Migrants’ social practices illustrate that, far from eroding migrant agency, heightened state violence has generated new and creative social strategies to survive, and at times resist, aggressive policing measures.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
