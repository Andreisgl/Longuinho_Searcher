The work includes a study of the lists of workers and the different professions and occupations of the personnel, and establishes the possible context of the tablets. An analysis of the rich onomastic material recorded in the texts is also provided, as well as a prosopographical evaluation of each individual.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersOld Sumerian Occupations.

The archaeological and epigraphic analysis of a specific typology of texts, i.e. labels, has allowed to understand how a part of the central administration of the Umma province worked. Il presente contributo è teso ad una più corretta valutazione dei testi neo-sumerici come documenti archeologici. L’analisi archeologica ed epigrafica di una specifica tipologia di testi, le etichette, ha permesso di evidenziare le relazioni con altri tipi di documenti e ricostruire il funzionamento di una parte dell’amministrazione centrale della provincia di Umma.

It was published in Georgian in 2011. Although it is connected with the previous four parts of the book, it can still be read as an independent piece. This section of the book, Mesopotamian Symbols and Kartuli Asomtavruli Doni, deciphers both the graphics and semantics of Sumerian divine and royal insignia avoiding decipherment for centuries. They include ‘the Rod and Ring’, ‘the Ring-Poles’, ‘the Fertility Vase’ and various pieces of jewelry intimately connected with the mentioned symbols. Graphically, all these items originate from Letter Doni (#4) of the first Kartuli Asomtavruli alphabet. This letter is one of the divinity letter-signs of the alphabet and symbolizes not only the Sun-God, but the entire solar astronomy. Being the derivatives of the Kartuli Asomtavruli Doni, the Sumerian divine and royal insignia and divine and royal accessories acquire the astronomical knowledge hidden in the Kartvelian letter. Sections of this work were presented at five RAI-s: RAI-51, Chicago 2005; RAI-52, Munster 2006; RAI-53, Mocow-St. Petersburg 2007; RAI-57, Rome 2011. Currently, the rest of the book is being translated into English, and each part will be uploaded upon completion.Download Free PDFView PDFSome Reflections on the Transposition of Sumerian Sound Values into Akkadian ...

The first Old Persian and Neo-Assyrian monumental findings triggered the compilation of several sign lists, some of them still in use today. The discovery of older cuneiform archives, some of them dating to the end of the fourth and to the first half of the third millennium, made new approaches to cuneiform epigraphy and the compilation of new repertoires of signs necessary. After almost a century and in spite of its limited chronological and geographical scope, Deimel’s Liste der Archaischen Keilschriftzeichen (LAK, 1922) is still the standard sign list used for the Early Mesopotamian texts. In recent years the discovery of hundreds of new texts in several southern Mesopotamian regions compelled cuneiformists to create new tools for the epigraphic study of this material. In this talk I will present the ongoing work and the preliminary results of my current research project on the paleography of the Early Dynastic Umma Region, showing its potentialities and highlighting the critical issues in the creation from scratch of a cuneiform syllabary and sign list. La lingua dei sumeri by Franco D’Agostino, Gabriella Spada, Angela Greco, Armando Bramanti XIV + 338 pages (Italian) Hoepli, Milan (March, 2019) ISBN: 978-88-203-8073-1 34,90€ www.hoeplieditore.it/8073-1 Third volume of the series “Lingue antiche del Vicino Oriente e del Mediterraneo” (directed by Franco D’Agostino) after La lingua di Babilonia (Franco D’Agostino, Maria Stella Cingolo, Gabriella Spada) and La lingua dell’antico Egitto (Emanuele M. Ciampini). La lingua dei Sumeri is the first grammar of Sumerian written in Italian. It is designed as a companion both for the classroom and for self-tuition. The grammatical reconstruction is mostly based on documents from the Second Dynasty of Lagash and the Third Dynasty of Ur (ca. 2140 – 2000 BCE) and is preceded by a thorough description of the historical context, cuneiform script, and phonology. The description of morphology and syntax is followed by an extensive chrestomathy of 31 texts, giving the reader copies, transliterations, translations, and commentary of historical and royal inscriptions, legal texts, and administrative documents. The grammar is enriched by a syllabary and a sign list offering the readings and the Neo-Sumerian sign forms of the 243 signs attested in the chrestomathy and 30 noteworthy variants. An excursus on how Babylonians learnt Sumerian and a glossary conclude the volume.
