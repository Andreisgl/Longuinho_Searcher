SOJAS 2015 – 2018: A Résumé of Four Seasons of Archaeological Survey South of Jiroft (2019)Archaeology. Journal of the Iranian Center for Archeological Research, Vol. 2.2,  2019The SOJAS (South-of-Jiroft Archaeological Survey) project aims at investigating the relations bet... more The SOJAS (South-of-Jiroft Archaeological Survey) project aims at investigating the relations between the Jiroft region and the shores of the Persian Gulf by investigating settlements, routes, and natural resources in the plains und valleys south of Jiroft, within the limits of the province of Kerman. 209 archaeological sites have been discovered in the seasons of 2015–2018, located in several survey zones, among which the plains of Boluk and Faryab are the most prominent. Furthermore, the Varamin strip of the Middle Halil Rud Valley and the Lower Halil Rud Valley proved to be important settlement zones. Large-scale occupation in the region starts in the Early and Middle Chalcolithic periods, with a first marked increase in the Late Chalcolithic. During the Early Bronze Age, dense settlement patterns develop in nearly all parts of the region. Several sites seem to be related to the procurement and exchange of chlorite artefacts. Of special importance is a probable miner’s site within the Bagh-e Borj Mountains, an area where natural chlorite outcrops are most abundant. The end of the Early Bronze Age is characterized by a collapse of settlement systems. Only very few sites exist during the 2nd millennium and the first half of the 1st millennium BC. A full-scale re-occupation of the whole region takes place during the Achaemenid period. This trend continues into the Arsacid period, when the number of sites was doubled compared to the previous period. This is the period with the largest number of sites in the region. Further continuity of dense occupation can be witnessed during the Sasanian and the Early Islamic to Seljuk periods. After the Seljuk period, a second settlement collapse takes place, which left the region only sparsely occupied until modern times, when cities and villages in the region expanded as a consequence of agricultural intensification.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A systematic archaeological, geographical and geological survey is carried out in a vast region to the south of Jiroft, comprising the Halil Rud Basin and several plains to the south of it. Settlement patterns from the Neolithic to the Islamic periods and natural deposits of stone materials, such as chlorite and diorite, are a particular focus of the project. The results will contribute to a better understanding of interregional exchange and communication routes between the Halil Rud Basin and neighbouring regions, especially during the Bronze Age.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Report on the first season of German-Kurdish excavations at Muqable in 2015 (2017)by Peter Pfälzner, Paola Sconzo, Ivana Puljiz, and Dr. HASAN A H M E D QASIMZOrA 10,  2017The two settlements of Muqable I and III, located 5 km to the south-east of Bassetki in the Dohuk... more The two settlements of Muqable I and III, located 5 km to the south-east of Bassetki in the Dohuk province of Iraq-Kurdistan, are being excavated since 2015 in the frame of the cooperation project KUGAMID of the University of Tübingen and die Directorate of Antiquities at Dohuk. The aim of the excavations is, on the one hand, to investigate the pre-stages in the Late Chalcolithic period of the Northern Mesopotamian urbanisation and, on the other hand, to study a subordinate settlement in the environs of a Bronze Age urban centre. During the first season of 2015, the stratigraphy of both sites could be determined, and well-dated chronological-stratigraphic units of the Late Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age could be defined on the basis of pottery repertories and connected C14 datings, in one instance complemented by a group of sealings of the Ninevite V period. They are important components of a detailed chronology of the region in the mentioned periods.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The major aim of the excavations is to investigate the importance and urban development of the site from the Early through the Middle to the Late Bronze Age. During the first two seasons of 2015 and 2016 the stratigraphy and chronology of the upper town were explored, as well as the settlement organisation of the extended lower town, and an extra-urban area to the south of the city, where a street and several cremation burials of the Middle Bronze Age were found.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The preliminary data on settlementpatterns suggest a first settlement in the Neolithicperiod, a continuous albeit sparse occupation in theChalcolithic, an intensive Early Bronze Age occupation,continuous settlement during the Middle and LateBronze Age, the latter represented by both the Mittaniand the Middle Assyrian pottery tradition, and a slightdecline of settlement intensity during the Iron Age.The later periods, from Hellenistic through Parthianand Sassanian to the Islamic periods, are equally wellattested. Future field-work will be aimed at intensifyingthe archaeological survey in Zones B and C and alsoin the other survey areas (Zones A, D-E). The GISmapping of the settlement system, as well as theidentification of available resources, ecological factorsand communication routes will hopefully contribute to abetter understanding of the impact of the Mesopotamianempires upon the local cultures and societies throughtime.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
