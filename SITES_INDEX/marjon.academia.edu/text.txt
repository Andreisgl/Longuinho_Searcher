There are a number of mentoring models which a mentor could adopt in order to support the growth and development of a beginning teacher. Attempts have been made to categorise different approaches to mentoring; for example, Maynard and Furlong suggested that there are three categories of mentoring: the apprentice model, the competence model and the reflective model. The apprenticeship model argues that the skills of being a teacher are best learned by supervised practice, with guidance from imitation of experienced practitioners. David Clutterbuck&#39;s model of developmental mentoring suggests that an effective mentor wants to draw on all four of the &#39;helping to learn&#39; styles. Daloz argues that a combination of high challenge and high support needs to be offered by one as the mentor for a beginning teacher to learn effectively and to &#39;grow&#39;Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses on two perspectives. The first considers universities as not just centres for knowledge production but also as focal points for promoting a critical pedagogy, forming the basis for developing disability sports coaches, scientists and administrators as critically reflective practitioners. The second relates to ways in which university portfolios can contribute to disabled athlete development through, for example, expanding the disability sport coaching base, adaptive strength and conditioning programmes, supporting the work of federations and engagement with research and development. The chapter closes by arguing that if universities are to serve the public good locally, regionally and globally, challenging neoliberal individualism at an institutional level and sharing information and ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This criticality should inform approaches to programming and promotion of inclusive practice both as part of the university physical activity portfolio and in the practitioner’s subsequent work with local, regional and international stakeholders. It should also equip students to challenge the systemic inequities increasingly characteristic of competitive disability sport in local and global settings.4-6 This paper reports on a small scale action research project, which sought to explore the impact of one University’s adopti...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
