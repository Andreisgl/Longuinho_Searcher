The basic aim of present study is to elucidate the hydro-geomorphic characteristics of terrain through landforms mapping, geological mapping and LULC of the catchment. Beside this, the corresponding terrain attributes has been analyzed following recent geospatial techniques. It revealed that catchment has seventh order stream network with elongated shape from north to south and different homogeneous geological attributes, moderate to very steep slope and strong structural control. Bifurcation ratio between different successive orders varies very few but mean ratio (4.56) indicates that the strong structural control and less permeability of rocks. Moderate to moderate course drainage density, moderate to moderately high drainage frequency and very high texture ratio suggests that terrain has steep slopes, complex deformed lithology. Local relief of the catchment ranges from 219 m. to737 m. whereas absolute relief extent from 698 m. is in the southern part to the maximum 3770 m, in the northern part of catchment represents moderate to very high relief, less infiltration capacity and longer duration of water flow in the catchment. The morphometric indicators, existing landforms and geological formations indicate youth stage development of topography in the catchment area. Geospatial techniques and remote sensing data provide a significant help in assessing geo-hydrological studies in such terrains.

Every year forest fires in Uttrakhand causes great loss to the forest ecosystem, diversity of flora and fauna and economic wealth. Forest fire is one of the major disasters in the forests of Uttarakhand. High temperatures with no atmospheric moisture were one of the important reason for forest fires in Uttrakhand. Remote sensing and GIS technology that has been used to detect forest fires and recent technology can send an early warning to prevent forest fires. Remote sensing has also been effectively used in the study monitoring, detection of forest fire and future planning. Thus the main aim of this study is the causes and where the forest fire takes place by preparing fire events density map on the bases of using Remote Sensing real time forest fire data from EOSDIS NASA and GIS techniques. The various parameters are taken in to account land use from BHUVN, forest type map, relief and slope. Later on to analyze the causes these aspects were compared with fire density map. Topography, slope and types of vegetation play important role in the spread of forest fire. Outcome of the study demonstrate that the proximity to inhabited places, dry climatic conditions and dry Chir pine forest cover are mainly responsible forest fire in the state. These types of studies are helpful to suggest preventive measures in different risk areas of Uttrakhand. Forest is one of the most important precious natural resource and play significant role in the human life and environment. Forests are socially and environmentally inter-linked with the people in the hilly areas and play important role in the economic welfare and development of the region. Forest fire is one of the major disasters in the forests of Uttarakhand. These are many indigenous and endangered species which are adversely affected due to forest fires. Basically forest fires have been categorized into three types, ground fires, surface fire and crown fires. Ground fires are not easily predictable as it spread within rather than top of organic matter. It consumes organic matter like duff, musk or peat present beneath the surface litter of the forest floor. Second is surface fire characterized by the fast moving fire which consumes small vegetation and surface litter along with loss debris and third one is crown fire that burnt top trees or shrubs without any close link with surface fire. Current trend of increasing day by day rate of forest fire events in state, there is an urgent need to generate a geo-spatial fire events data base that help in planning, decision making measures. Remote sensing techniques and GIS techniques with satellite can contribute to a variety of natural resources applications.

In the present study SP-B is shown to possess antifungal activity when challenged with strains of Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, while only negligible antibacterial activity was detected. Furthermore, SP-B was found to be non-cytotoxic when tested on fibroblast cell lines. To obtain information regarding its structure affinity, capillary electrophoresis (CE), circular dichroism (CD) and attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FT/IR experiments were performed. CE revealed a pH dependence of the hydrodynamic radial dimensions both in aqueous and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol solutions. CD and ATR-FT/IR measurements confirmed the structure-pH relationship, revealing a secondary structure composed of mixed proportions of pol...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An automated hybrid technique for detecting the stage of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathyProceedings of the First International Conference on Intelligent Interactive Technologies and Multimedia - IITM '10,  2010Diabetes is fast becoming a scourge in the modern day society both in the developing and the deve... more Diabetes is fast becoming a scourge in the modern day society both in the developing and the developed societies. Diabetes related complications lead to a lot of morbidity and Diabetic Retinopathy is fast becoming the cause of preventable blindness. Early detection and treatment with Laser will go a long way in checking this disease. Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) is the set of early changes that take place in the Retina. It is divided into 3 categories into mild, moderate and severe. Initial changes when the microaneurysms (MA) start appearing. Then it is followed by hemorrhages. Finally appearance of cotton wool spots and hard exudates categorize it into severe NPDR. The stage of neo vascularization (NV) when new blood vessels begin to appear (to compensate for the reduced blood supply and nutrition to the retina) finally qualifies for proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. The idea is to extract the features of NPDR and depending on their intensity and frequency they can be graded into mild, moderate and severe. This automated grading can be matched with the specialist&amp;#x27;s perception and its accuracy can be tested. In this work, we have proposed a computer based automated hybrid technique for the detection of stages of Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) retinopathy stage using the color fundus images. The features are extracted from the Sample images using the image processing techniques and fed to the support vector machine (SVM). After color normalization preprocessing stage, an evidence value for every pixel is calculated by SVM. Then a mathematical morphological technique, a fuzzy c-means clustering technique, PCA, a support vector machine and a nearest neighbor classifier for further processing. The SVM classifier uses features extracted by combined 2DPCA instead of explicit image features as the input vector Combined 2DPCA is proposed and virtual SVM is applied to achieve the higher accuracy of classification. We demonstrate a Sensitivity of 97.1% for the classifier with the Specificity of 98.3%. Thus, an automated system for diagnosis of NPDR can be a useful tool for the Specialist to support in screening an detection of early Diabetic Retinopathy changes and hence timely intervention leading to reduced DR(Diabetic retinopathy) related blindness.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The challenges for tomorrow&amp;#39;s automation systems need software architectures of today&amp;#39;s real-time controllers to evolve. This article presents FASA, a modern software architecture for next-generation automation systems. FASA provides concepts for scalable, flexible, and platform-independent real-time execution frameworks, which also provide advanced features such as software-based fault tolerance and high degrees of isolation and security. We show that FASA caters for robust execution of time-critical applications even in parallel execution environments such as multi-core processors. We present a reference implementation of FASA that controls a magnetic levitation device. This device is sensitive to any disturbance in its real-time control and thus, provides a suitable validation scenario. Our results show that FASA can sustain its advanced features even in high-speed control scenarios at 1 kHz.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
