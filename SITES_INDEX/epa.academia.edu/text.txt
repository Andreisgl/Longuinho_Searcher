Reference libraries are generated from chemical standards and are therefore limited in size relative to known chemical space. To address this limitation, in silico spectra (i.e., MS/MS or MS2 spectra), predicted via Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) algorithms, were generated for compounds within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database (totaling, at the time of analysis, ~ 765,000 substances). Experimental spectra from EPA’s Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) mixtures (n = 10) were then used to evaluate the performance of the in silico spectra. Overall, MS2 spectra were acquired for 377 unique compounds from the ENTACT mixtures. Approximately 53% of these compounds were correctly identified using a commercial ref...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This concern has catalyzed a need to aggregate data to support research efforts that can, in turn, inform regulatory and statutory actions. An ongoing challenge regarding PFAS has been the shifting definition of what qualifies a substance to be a member of the PFAS class. There is no single definition for a PFAS, but various attempts have been made to utilize substructural definitions that either encompass broad working scopes or satisfy narrower regulatory guidelines. Depending on the size and specificity of PFAS substructural filters applied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) DSSTox database, currently exceeding 900,000 unique substances, PFAS substructure-defined space can span hundreds to tens of thousands of com...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Thus, pKa affects chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties. Multiple proprietary software packages exist for the prediction of pKa, but to the best of our knowledge no free and open-source programs exist for this purpose. Using a freely available data set and three machine learning approaches, we developed open-source models for pKa prediction. Methods The experimental strongest acidic and strongest basic pKa values in water for 7912 chemicals were obtained from DataWarrior, a freely available software package. Chemical structures were curated and standardized for quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling using KNIME, and a subset comprising 79% of the initial set was used for modeling.

These expert systems dramatically reduce the time associated with structure elucidation and improve the reliability of the results. Contemporary Computer-Assisted Approaches to Molecular Structure Elucidation describes the principles on which these expert systems for spectroscopic structure elucidation are based and concisely explains the algorithmic concepts behind the programs. The authors use their own personal experiences in the development of the Structure Elucidator (StrucEluc) CASE software system to discuss the present state-of-the-art in computer-assisted structure elucidation. Scientists that are presently using CASE systems will be interested in the algorithms and modern approaches and for organizations that are currently using the StrucEluc platform the book is designed to help researchers understand the strategies behind CASE as well as details regarding the StrucEluc platform. For scientists that have never used CASE systems they will now have access to all necessary information to understand CASE systems for mastering this new and very effective approach to structure elucidation. The authors overall goal is writing this book is to produce the 'must read' definitive text that will represent the results of decades of work to develop computer-assisted structure elucidation software systems. CASE systems are now powerful software tools commonly outperforming and correcting human interpretations of data. This book will also provide an historical perspective of the work of the founding fathers of the technique and identify the challenges that have been overcome to produce modern CASE systems.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Practical Interpretation of P-31 NMR Spectra and Computer-Assisted Structure VerificationOrganophosphorus chemistry is of increasing importance as a field that can provide new compounds ... more Organophosphorus chemistry is of increasing importance as a field that can provide new compounds with practical value in agriculture, medicine, catalysis, etc. Furthermore, natural phosphorus compounds are well recognized to play vital roles in living systems. Chemists and biochemists working with these compounds are very fortunate to be dealing with a central atom that has outstanding properties for nuclear magnetic resonance spectral characterization. The 31P isotope is 100% naturally abundant, and has a spin quantum number of 1/2. It is a simple matter to record a 31P NMR spectrum with modern spectrometers, and many thousands of phosphorus compounds have been characterized by their chemical shifts. Indeed, a great majority of the research papers now being published on phosphorus compounds include 31P NMR shift data. The 31P shift is not just a physical constant like a melting point, however; it is a definite statement about the bonding at phosphorus and the nature of the groups attached to this nucleus. Anyone reporting 31P chemical shifts should rationalize the data with the structure at phosphorus and avoid assignment errors, and they should be observant about any unusual effects that might be operating on the shielding phenomenon. This book is designed to aid the researcher, especially students or newcomers to the field, in these tasks, and to help in developing an understanding of the factors that lead to a certain shift. Chemists no longer find themselves isolated to the bench. Modern chemists more frequently find themselves in front of a computer screen performing online searches, computer-based structure design, processing and analyzing their analytical data or compiling their research into an appropriate report or publication. Software tools which were once only the domain of a specialist are now available to the masses. Content databases and, in relation to this text, NMR prediction tools are starting to play a more influential role in the structural verification and elucidation processes of the chemist.While the existing literature contains many fine reviews on 31P NMR, an introductory yet comprehensive survey of the chemical shift effects for the various functional groups, written in an instructional mode, is not available. In this text one of us applies our through knowledge of phosphorus chemistry to provide a through grounding for the chemist in the NMR properties of the nucleus (Chapters 1 to 15, LQ). Coupling this capability with a review and validation of the value of software tools to aid in the interpretation of 31P NMR (Chapter 16, AW), we hope that this book will fulfill this need.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prediction of pKa from chemical structure using free and open-source tools_KM_AJW.pptxThe ionization state of a chemical, reflected in pKa values, affects lipophilicity, solubility, p... more The ionization state of a chemical, reflected in pKa values, affects lipophilicity, solubility, protein binding and the ability of a chemical to cross the plasma membrane. These properties govern the pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity and thus pKa is a fundamental chemical property and is used in many models of chemical toxicity.  Experimentally determining pKa is not feasible for high-throughput assays.  Predicting pKa is challenging and existing models have been developed only using restricted chemical space (e.g., anilines, phenols, benzoic acids, primary amines) and lack of a generalized model impedes ADME modeling.  No free and open source models exist for heterogeneous chemical classes, however, several proprietary programs exist.  In this work, pKa open data bundled with DataWarrior (http://www.openmolecules.org/) were used to develop predictive models for pKa. After data cleaning, there were ~3100 and ~3900 monoprotic chemicals with an acidic or basic pKa, respectively. 1D and 2D chemical descriptors (AlogP, Topological polar surface area, etc) in addition to 12 fingerprints (presence or absence of a chemical group) were generated using PaDEL software. Three datasets were used: acidic, basic and acidic and basic combined. 13 datasets were examined, the 1D/2D descriptors and 12 fingerprints.  Using the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm showed that the MACCS and Substructure Count fingerprints yielded the best results, with models showing an R-Squared of ~0.78 and a RMSE of 1.42.  Recently, Deep Learning models have showed remarkable progress in image recognition and natural language processing.   To determine if the Deep Learning algorithms would increase model performance we examined the datasets and found that the Deep Learning models were somewhat superior than Extreme Gradient Boosting with an R-Squared of ~0.80 and an RMSE of ~1.38.

The US EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard is a publicly accessible web-based application providing access to various data streams on ~760,000 chemical substances. These data include experimental and predicted physicochemical property data, bioassay screening data associated with the ToxCast program, consumer product and functional use information and a myriad of related data of value to environmental scientists and toxicologists. At this stage of development, the public dashboard provides access to almost 20 predicted physicochemical and environmental fate and transport endpoints with full transparency in terms of model performance. Experimental and predicted human and ecological toxicity data are also available, as are in vitro to in vivo extrapolation dosimetry predictions and predicted exposure and functional use. In parallel to the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard we are developing RapidTox, a web-based application that enables a rapid, flexible and transparent prioritization process for sets of chemicals using several previously used workflows focused on scoring of traditional risk metrics and the inclusion of alternative hazard and exposure estimates. This presentation will give an overview of the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard, RapidTox, our approaches to building transparent and open prediction models, and our efforts to provide access to real time predictions.

The web application delivers a wide array of computed and measured physicochemical properties, in vitro high-throughput screening data and in vivo toxicity data as well as integrated chemical linkages to a growing list of literature, toxicology, and analytical chemistry websites. In addition, several specific search types are in development to directly support the mass spectroscopy non-targeted screening community, who are generating important data for detecting and assessing environmental exposures to chemicals contained within DSSTox.  The application provides access to segregated lists of chemicals that are of specific interests to relevant stakeholders including, for example, scientists interested in algal toxins and hydraulic fracturing chemicals.  This presentation will provide an overview of the challenges associated with the curation of data from EPA’s December 2016 Hydraulic Fracturing Drinking Water Assessment Report that represented chemicals reported to be used in hydraulic fracturing fluids and those found in produced water. The data have been integrated into the dashboard with a number of resulting benefits: a searchable database of chemical properties, with hazard and exposure predictions, and open literature. The application of the dashboard to support mass spectrometry non-targeted analysis studies will also be reviewed.

These prioritization efforts are in response to regulatory mandates to identify chemicals for further assessment. We have developed a web-based application that enables a rapid, flexible and transparent prioritization process. The tool includes multiple data streams related to human and ecological hazard, exposure, and physicochemical properties (persistence and bioaccumulation). For human hazard, the data streams include quantitative points of departure (PODs) that are compiled from multiple sources such as EPA ToxRefDB, ECHA, COSMOS; estimated PODs from high-throughput in vitro screening assays and computational models; and qualitative measurements and predictions of specific endpoints (e.g., genotoxicity, endocrine activity). For ecological hazard, quantitative PODs are taken from the EPA ECOTOX database. Exposure information includes production volume, quantitative predictions using the EPA ExpoCast and SHEDS models, biomonitoring data, and qualitative information such as media occurrence, use profiles and likelihood of consumer and childhood exposures. The use of the tool is illustrated by prioritizing chemicals related to TSCA and the Safer Choice Ingredient List. The underpinning data streams for this application are already available in the EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard and have been repurposed to deliver this application. This is in keeping with our overarching software development methodology of providing multiple “building blocks” in the form of databases, web services and visualization components to deliver fit-for purpose applications to the relevant audiences.

The goal of this research program is to quickly evaluate thousands of chemicals, but at a much reduced cost and shorter time frame relative to traditional approaches.  The data generated by the Center includes characterization of thousands of chemicals across hundreds of high-throughput screening assays, consumer use and production information, pharmacokinetic properties, literature data, physical-chemical properties as well as the predictive computational modeling of toxicity and exposure. We have developed a number of databases and applications to deliver the data to the public, academic community, industry stakeholders, and regulators. This presentation will provide an overview of our work to develop an architecture that integrates diverse large-scale data from the chemical and biological domains, our approaches to disseminate these data, and the delivery of models supporting predictive computational toxicology. In particular, this presentation will review our new CompTox Chemistry Dashboard and the developing architecture to support real-time property and toxicity endpoint prediction.  This abstract does not reflect U.S. EPA policy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unfortunately, the vast majority of chemical structure data associated with scientific publications remain locked up in document form, primarily in PDF files or trapped on webpages. Despite the explosive growth of online chemical databases and the overall maturity of cheminformatics platforms, many barriers stifle the exchange of chemical structures via publications. These challenges include incomplete support by accepted standards (especially InChI) for advanced stereochemistry, organometallic compounds and generic “Markush” representations, the difference between human-readable and computer-readable forms of data, and challenges with the computer representation of chemical structures. To address these obstacles to chemical structure sharing, US EPA National Center for Computational Toxicology scientists are using a combination of cheminformatics applications and online repositories to distribute chemical structure data associated with their publications. This presentation will describe how EPA-NCCT chemical structure data that is amenable to indexing and distribution are shared and highlight the benefit of open data sharing for modeling, data integration, and increasing research impact.

Adding Complex Expert Knowledge into Chemical Database and Transforming Surfactants in Wastewater.pptThe increasing popularity of high mass accuracy non-target mass spectrometry methods has yielded ... more The increasing popularity of high mass accuracy non-target mass spectrometry methods has yielded extensive identification efforts based on chemical compound databases. Candidate structures are often retrieved with either exact mass or molecular formula from large resources such as PubChem, ChemSpider or the EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard. Additional data (e.g. fragmentation, physicochemical properties, reference and data source information) is then used to select potential candidates, depending on the experimental context. However, these strategies require the presence of substances of interest in these compound databases, which is often not the case as no database can be fully inclusive. A prominent example with clear data gaps are surfactants, used in many products in our daily lives, yet often absent as discrete structures in compound databases. Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) are a common, high use and high priority surfactant class that have highly complex transformation behaviour in wastewater. Despite extensive reports in the environmental literature, few of the LAS and none of the related transformation products were reported in any compound databases during an investigation into Swiss wastewater effluents, despite these forming the most intense signals. The LAS surfactant class will be used to demonstrate how the coupling of environmental observations with high resolution mass spectrometry and detailed literature data (expert knowledge) on the transformation of these species can be used to progressively “fill the gaps” in compound databases. The LAS and their transformation products have been added to the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard (https://comptox.epa.gov/) using a combination of “representative structures” and “related structures” starting from the structural information contained in the literature. By adding this information into a centralized open resource, future environmental investigations can now profit from the expert knowledge previously scattered throughout the literature.

Key activities of the network include prioritization of emerging substances and non-target screening. A recent collaborative trial revealed that suspect screening (using specific lists of chemicals to find “known unknowns”) was a very common and efficient way to expedite non-target screening (Schymanski et al. 2015, DOI: 10.1007/s00216-015-8681-7). As a result, the NORMAN Suspect Exchange was founded (http://www.norman-network.com/?q=node/236) and members were encouraged to submit their suspect lists. To date 20 lists of highly varying substance numbers (between 52 and 30,418), quality and information content have been uploaded, including valuable information previously unavailable to the public. All preparation and curation was done within the network using open access cheminformatics toolkits. Additionally, members expressed a desire for one merged list (“SusDat”). However, as a small network with very limited resources (member contributions only), the burden of curating and merging these lists into a high quality, curated dataset went beyond the capacity and expertise of the network. In 2017 the NORMAN Suspect Exchange and US EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard (https://comptox.epa.gov/) pooled resources in curating and uploading these lists to the Dashboard (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists). This talk will cover the curation and annotation of the lists with unique identifiers (known as DTXSIDs), plus the advantages and drawbacks of these for NORMAN (e.g. creating a registration/resource inter-dependence). It will cover the use of “MS-ready structure forms” with chemical substances provided in the form observed by the mass spectrometer (e.g. desalted, as separate components of mixtures) and how these efforts will support other NORMAN activities. Finally, limitations of existing cheminformatics approaches and future ideas for extending this work will be covered.

Curating and sharing structures and spectra for the environmental communityby Antony J Williams and Emma SchymanskiThe increasing popularity of high mass accuracy non-target mass spectrometry methods has yielded ... more The increasing popularity of high mass accuracy non-target mass spectrometry methods has yielded extensive identification efforts based on spectral and chemical compound databases in the environmental community and beyond. Increasingly, new methods are relying on open data resources. Candidate structures are often retrieved with either exact mass or molecular formula from large resources such as PubChem, ChemSpider or the EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard. Smaller, selective lists of chemicals (also called “suspect lists”) can be used to perform more efficient annotation. Mass spectral libraries can then be used to increase the confidence in tentative identification. Additional metadata (e.g. exposure and hazard information, reference and data source information) can be extremely useful to prioritize substances of high environmental interest. Exchanging information and “sharing structural linkages” between these resources requires extensive curation to ensure that the correct information is shared correctly, yet many valuable datasets arise from scientists and regulators with little official cheminformatics training. This talk will cover curation efforts undertaken to map spectral libraries (e.g. MassBank.EU, mzCloud) and suspect lists from the NORMAN Suspect Exchange (http://www.norman-network.com/?q=node/236) to unique chemical identifiers associated with the US EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard. The curation workflow takes advantage of years of experience, as well as contact with the original data providers, to enable open access to valuable, curated datasets to support environmental scientists and the broader research community (e.g. https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists).  Note: This abstract does not reflect US EPA policy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Automated Structure Annotation and Curation for MassBank: Potential and Pitfallsby Antony J Williams and Emma SchymanskiThe European MassBank server (www.massbank.eu) was founded in 2012 by the NORMAN Network (www.nor... more The European MassBank server (www.massbank.eu) was founded in 2012 by the NORMAN Network (www.norman-network.net) to provide open access to mass spectra of substances of environmental interest contributed by NORMAN members. The automated workflow RMassBank was developed as a part of this effort (https://github.com/MassBank/RMassBank/). This workflow included automated processing of the mass spectral data, as well as automated annotation using the SMILES, Names and CAS numbers provided by the user. Cheminformatics toolkits (e.g. Open Babel, rcdk) and web services (e.g. the CACTUS Chemical Identifier Resolver, Chemical Translation Services (CTS), ChemSpider, PubChem) were then used to convert and/or retrieve the remaining information for completion of the MassBank records (additional names, InChIs, InChIKeys, several database identifiers, mol files), to avoid excessive burden on the users and reduce the chance of errors. To date, approximately 16,000 MS/MS spectra (61 % of all open data as of Nov. 2016) corresponding with 1,269 (18 %) unique chemicals have been uploaded to MassBank.EU via RMassBank. Curating the MassBank.EU records, as part of efforts to provide EPA CompTox Dashboard identifiers (DTXSIDs) for each record, revealed several conflicts in the chemical metadata arising from varying sources. In addition, the representation of “ambiguous substances”, for example complex surfactant mixtures of various chain lengths and branching or incompletely-defined structures of transformaton products, is an ongoing challenge. In this work, we report on proof-of-concept solutions for “ambiguous structure” representation, currently unavailable in the majority of cheminformatics tools. This presentation reflects on the effectiveness of the original RMassBank concept but also identifies pitfalls that automated structure annotation with open resources offers to streamline spectra contributions from external laboratories and users with widely ranging cheminformatics experience.

However, the performance of QSAR models is highly dependent not only on the modeling methodology but also the quality of the data used. In this study we developed robust QSAR models for endpoints of environmental interest with the aim of helping the regulatory process. We used the publicly available PHYSPROP database that includes a set of thirteen common physicochemical and environmental fate properties, including logP, melting point, Henry’s coefficient, and biodegradability among others. Curation and standardization workflows have been applied to use the highest quality data and generate QSAR-ready structures. The developed models are in agreement with the five OECD principles that requires QSARs to be simple and reliable. These models were applied were applied to a set of ~700k chemicals to produce predictions for display on the EPA CompTox Chemistry Dashboard. In addition to the predictions, this free web and mobile application provides access to the experimental data used for training as well as detailed reports including general model performances, specific applicability domain and prediction accuracy, and the nearest neighboring structures used for prediction. The dashboard also provides access to model QMRFs (QSAR modeling report format) which is a downloadable pdf containing additional details about the modeling approaches, the data, and molecular descriptor interpretation.

The preferable form of communication for a chemist is via a depiction of the chemical structure with an electronic molecular connection table as its basis.  Electronic representations of chemical structures are one of the informatics underpinnings for any organization operating in the domain of chemistry or biology and enable the creation of a structure/substructure searchable database of chemical structures and associated data and knowledge. There is an enormous wealth of information embedded inside both print and electronic documents in the form of chemical names and a means by which to convert those alphanumeric text descriptors into a more rich chemical structure representation has long been the mission of a large group of investigators. The challenges and hurdles to success are quite profound in their nature. We will review the present state of this research and the efforts underway to recover the value of information textually trapped in publications, patents, databases and Internet pages across the multiple domains of chemistry.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Following the appropriation of NMR techniques from the physicists by the chemical research community, 15N studies were few in number owing to the intrinsic properties of this chemically important nuclide. Specifically, 15N is a relatively low natural abundance nuclide, present in nature at only 0.13 %. The low relative abundance is further exacerbated by a low gyromagnetic ratio, gN (the observation frequency of 15N is 10% that of 1H), which served to make 15N a difficult nuclide to observe directly. Nevertheless, the early literature still contains numerous citations that provide a wealth of information about 15N chemical shift behavior. The development of pulsed Fourier transform NMR instruments in the early 1970s has ameliorated some of the difficulties associated with measuring 15N spectra, as did the development of much stronger field magnets. Probably the biggest single factor in enhancing experimental access to 15N data has been the development of indirect (sometimes referred to as ‘‘inverse’’) detection NMR pulse sequences and probes whereby an insensitive nucleus such as 15N can be detected via a much more sensitive, high abundance nuclide such as 1H, 19F, or 31P. Proton-detected measurement of 15N spectra is 300 times more sensitive than direct 15N excitation and observation. Through the use of indirect detection techniques, it is possible to acquire direct (one-bond) or long-range nJHN 1H–15N heteronuclear shift correlation information for even submilligram quantities of material in a few hours or overnight.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter discusses the use of chemical structures; the related reactions, charts, and schemes, in a scientific manuscript; and methods of preparing and submitting structures for publication. The chapter presents general guidelines; authors should consult with their publishers for specific instructions.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Software for interactive curve resolution using SIMPLISMAProgress in Chemometrics Research, Chapter 10, 119-135,  2005Self-modeling curve resolution is one of the most sophisticated methods of multivariate data anal... more Self-modeling curve resolution is one of the most sophisticated methods of multivariate data analysis. The approach can be applied to a wide range of practical problems facing the modern analytical laboratory and has proven to be a powerful tool for qualitative mixture analysis and characterization. However, in spite of the widespread applicability of the approach, curve resolution algorithms mostly remain an advanced theory rather than a practical tool in the hands of chemists. One reason for this situation is the lack of a convenient interface for routine use that can be applied by chemists and spectroscopists without requiring an extensive statistical expertise. The creation of user-friendly and intuitive software tools provides a bridge between statistics and chemistry, theory and practice. Software for interactive curve resolution based on our implementation of the SIMPLISMA algorithm (SIMPLe-to-use Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis) has been developed. Two practical mixture samples taken from the available literature were used to demonstrate how curve resolution can be easily and responsibly employed by a non-expert operator through an interactive interface. The advantages of SIMPLISMA compared to other curve resolution techniques are discussed. Method limitations are considered and possible workarounds suggested for complex analytical cases.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This work involves computational and data driven approaches that integrate chemistry, exposure and biological data. These efforts have produced rich data collections of chemical and bioassay data and resulted in the development of numerous software tools for delivering the data to the community. Much has been learned from the development of a disparate suite of software applications and recent work has focused on the integration of the various data sources into a new software architecture. This is intended to reduce the learning curve for multiple applications, uses curated data sources to improve data integration and recall and ultimately delivers better data in a more consumable form for both the user visiting a website and to computers visiting web services. The resulting application has been used to deliver the CompTox chemistry dashboard. This application provides access to ~720,000 chemicals and associated experimental and predicted properties, high-throughput screening data from the ToxCast project and product and functional use data for thousands of chemicals. Flexible searching supports simple chemical identifier look-up based on chemical name and CAS registry number (CASRN) and structure identification is feasible using mass and formula based searching to support mass spectrometrists performing non-targeted analysis. Batch-based searching provides the user with the ability to look up large collections of chemical data using inputs based on name, CASRN, InChIkeys and other identifiers and to export associated information in a series of standard file formats. The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard architecture and development approach has delivered a foundation architecture on which to build new applications for use within the Agency and for use by the research community. This poster will review the software architecture, data streams and the present capabilities of the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard.     This abstract does not reflect U.S. EPA policy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Mobilizing EPA’s Comptox Chemistry Dashboard Data on Mobile DevicesThe EPA’s National Center of Computational Toxicology (NCCT) Chemistry Dashboard provides access ... more The EPA’s National Center of Computational Toxicology (NCCT) Chemistry Dashboard provides access to chemistry data for about 720,000 chemical substances. The application is used to source, for example, physicochemical property data, bioassay screening data and functional use and product composition data. The dashboard provides access to a number of flexible searches including chemical names, CAS numbers and mass and formula-based searches to support non-targeted screening research for mass spectrometry. Since NCCT provides Open Data to the community it is therefore available for reuse and redistribution in other forms of software. Free access to these data has resulted in the provision of mobile applications supporting identifier and mass-based searching of the data. These software applications provide access to hundreds of thousands of chemical structures on a mobile device to support compound identification (the m/z Comptox mobile app) and to provide access to chemistry data via a chemical search on a handheld device and direct connection to a web-based dashboard.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This includes: approaches to validate different chemical structure representations (e.g. molfile and SMILES), identifiers (chemical names and registry numbers), and methods to standardize the data into QSAR-consumable formats for modeling. Our efforts to quantify and segregate data into various quality categories has allowed us to thoroughly investigate the resulting models developed from these data slices, as well as allowing us to examine whether or not efforts into the development of large high-quality datasets has the expected pay-off in terms of prediction performance. Machine-learning approaches have been applied to create a series of models that have been used to generate predicted physicochemical and environmental parameters for over 700,000 chemicals. These data are available online via the EPA’s iCSS Chemistry Dashboard.

Particularly, NMR spectra are predicted by a variety of software packages. Two main approaches are used: •Database-based. Compounds are compared against a database, the result is calculated using data for close structural relatives found in the dataset. •Regression-based. Experimental database is used to calculate parameters of non-linear regression. Chemical shift is represented as a non-linear function of some variables which describe characteristic features of a molecule of interest.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a result it is possible to contribute to the community while developing a social profile as a scientist. While research scientists are primarily still measured by their contributions to science using the classical method of citation statistics, a number of freely available online tools are now available for scientists to develop their online profile. This is particularly important at a time when alternative measures of contributions to science are being developed – the so-called world of Alternative Metrics. The concept of “rewards and recognition” for participation will be discussed in terms of how the Royal Society of Chemistry intends to add to the alternative metrics data flow to acknowledge scientists for their contributions. This presentation will provide an overview of the myriad of tools available to you at any stage of your career and will hopefully encourage you to actively manage your profile as a scientist as the resume of the future will likely be summarized by your activities and profiles online. I will highlight how to ensure that your personal social media profiles can be made engaging to potential collaborators and employers, how social media can be utilized to engage people into events and how to drive traffic to your own sites should you choose to set them up. I will review how my own profiles cover my diverse career in chemistry from “lab-rat” to software product manager, to entrepreneur and into the publishing world and my personal efforts to try and popularize science using some of the social media tools.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
