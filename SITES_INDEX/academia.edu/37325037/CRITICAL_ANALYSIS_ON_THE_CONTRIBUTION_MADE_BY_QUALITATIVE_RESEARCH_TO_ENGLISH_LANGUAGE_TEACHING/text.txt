This paper has presented qualitative theories and features advantages and limitations, the criteria of good qualitative research, and analysis of two articles based on Tracy " s model. The analysis result showed that both articles have some limitations such as the uncovering of potential resources and perspectives on how effective extensive reading programs should be implemented in tertiary education in Indonesia. However, most of the criteria that Tracy established were found in these articles, such as relevance of the area of study, timeliness and significance; sufficient, abundant, appropriate and complex use of theoretical constructs, as well as data collection and analysis processes.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEmpowering the Teacher-Researcher: Adopting a Tool from Biochemist-Researcher Training2005 • Yen-Ling Teresa TingAs teachers are probably the most invaluable source of field-based informants regarding (in)effective classroom practices, teacher-training should equip teachers with tools for classroom-based teacher-led research. More importantly, these tools should sustain trainees&#39; research-eagerness as well as autonomous professional development beyond teacher-training courses. However, if research is not the raison d&#39;etre of teaching and with educational evaluators criticising small-scale teacher-friendly research findings for their non-generalisablility, how can teacher-educators instil their trainees with the research spirit? Here, I suggest that teacher-trainers examine a simple tool used to train biochemistry graduate students towards autonomous scientific research: The extensive reading of journal articles. It is in fact the simplicity of this suggestion which makes it worthy of consideration. Quantitative data is used to demonstrate that educators and scientists rely on dimension...Download Free PDFView PDFAdapted Physical Activity Quarterly ApaqGauging the Quality of Qualitative Research in Adapted Physical Activity2014 • Donna GoodwinDownload Free PDFView PDFContents | TESL-EJ Top Empowering the Teacher-researcher: Adopting a Tool from Biochemist-Researcher Training2014 • Yen-Ling Teresa TingDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Language Teaching and ResearchIn the Labyrinth of Research: Critiquing Research Studies Conducted in Contrasting Paradigms2015 • Muhammad Athar H. ShahWith the growing diversity of ideas related to complex research paradigms, multiple methodologies, and emerging theoretical frameworks underpinning various research studies, research appears an increasingly difficult terrain. The seemingly complex nature of research is not only daunting for the fledglings, but also challenging for more experienced researchers. The current paper is an attempt to offer reader-friendly guidance for a deep and critical reading of research studies conducted in major research paradigms. In part one, the paper presents brief definitions of major research paradigms and relevant key terminology, which is, in part two, followed by fairly detailed critiques of two research studies conducted in contrasting paradigms.Download Free PDFView PDFListening Instruction and Teacher Cognition Underpinning the Skill in Iranian Private English Institutes2019 • Morteza BagheriDownload Free PDFView PDFKnEPublishingSelection of Research Paradigms in English Language Teaching: Personal Reflections and Future Directions2019 • Thi Thuy Loan NguyenLearning and teaching English in the age of globalization, digitalization and diversifications has constantly challenged our current understanding about the learners. In order to maximize the effectiveness of education, we need to continuously innovate our curriculum, pedagogy, assessments and evaluation. Research has helped this continuous innovation by providing key insights about students and teachers' demands and needs and then shaping the strategies, policies and innovations in education. This paper attempts to explain this phenomenon from my perspective. First, I will provide a brief review of research paradigms and dominant research paradigms in English Language Teaching (ELT), followed by my personal reflections on what research approaches I followed, why I selected them and what procedures I followed. The discussion on my selected approaches and what I learned from my research will also be shared together with my opinion on the possible directions for future research in ELT.Download Free PDFView PDFGrounded narrative inquiry into language teacher cognition: Stories and case studies on English language teaching in South Korea (Thesis, Doctor of Philosophy)Ian MoodieThis thesis contributes to the field of language teacher cognition (LTC) research by investigating LTC and development in South Korea (Korea, hereafter), where English is taught by non-native English speaking teachers (NNEST) as a mandatory foreign language in the national curriculum. English education in Korea is often described as a fever: Curricular reforms in the 1990s raised the stakes for learning English and challenged the status quo of teacher-centered instruction, but reforms were met with resistance from teachers, and Korea’s shadow English education industry has become a multi-billion dollar sector and a socioeconomic malady. Understanding LTC is important for understanding what language teachers do; however, LTC has received little attention from researchers in Korea and this thesis addresses the need for in-depth qualitative research with prolonged engagement and persistent observations. The aim of this exploratory thesis is to problematize key issues related to LTC and English language teacher development in Korea. The scope covers initial commitments to English language teaching (ELT), stated cognitions, observed practices, and the influences of experience on the cognitions and practices of Korean public school English teachers. The theoretical framework is defined as grounded narrative inquiry, an approach that combines narrative research and grounded theory methods. Critical incident (CI) theory and case study methods also influenced the design. The thesis comprises two studies. Study 1 was a background study using narrative frames to prompt four stories from 27 Korean English teacher participants regarding their (1) reasons for teaching English, (2) prior language learning experience, (3) pre-service education, and (4) first year teaching English. Narrative content was coded and categorized to uncover patterns and themes in participant stories. Findings from Study 1 influenced the design of Study 2, which consisted of four in-depth case studies, two with experienced primary school teachers and two with novice primary school teachers. Data collection occurred over 18 months and included reflective writing, CI logs, semi-structured interviews, and observations. This thesis contributes to the field in the following ways: 1. Using workplace commitment theory to discuss the issue of ELT turnover in Korean primary schools; 2. defining a professional knowledge base (PKB) that provided a context-sensitive, locally-appropriate framework for discussing ELT expertise; 3. discussing the stated influences of experience on LTC, including the anti-apprenticeship of observation; 4. mixed-methods analysis showing that experienced teachers were more aligned with curricular aims than were novice teachers, for example, regarding the communicativeness of lessons, teaching English through English, collaborative learning, and meaning-focused instruction; and 5. a CI model for interpreting LTC change with in-service teachers, grounded in the practice of teaching. The findings question the status quo of second language teacher education (SLTE) in Korea by drawing attention to participant knowledge gaps regarding ELT methodology and second language acquisition (SLA). This research implies that a more situated view of learning to teach is necessary in Korea in order to increase the efficacy of SLTE. Recommendations for future studies include further research on ELT turnover in Korea, applying the PKB to materials development and to discussing locally effective practices, and looking for practical applications of the CI model for developing SLTE programs.Download Free PDFView PDFQualitative Research-2009-Denzin-139-60Makgwale Precious RadingoanaDownload Free PDFView PDFAsia Pacific Journal of EducationLinking critical pedagogy practice to higher education in Malaysia: insights from English language teachersTony HarlandDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Qualitative Report“Now as a teacher”: Novice Teachers Reflect on English Language Teacher Education in Iran2019 • Leila TajikThis study relied on the reflections of 12 novice English language teachers and 3 supervisors to explore the status quo of teacher training in 3 private language institutes with headquarters in Tehran and about 420 language schools throughout the country. Extensive data collection was done through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and teacher diaries as well as informal peer interviews and observation of occasional meetings of supervisors and teachers. To analyze data, an inductive analysis procedure was used. Findings revealed that current language teacher training courses in the context of concern may require different types of improvements with regard to theory-practice gap, supervised in-service workshops, reflective teaching skills, use of technology, and teachers&#39; experiential learning.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
