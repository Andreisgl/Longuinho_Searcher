Forest treatment strategies for Phytophthora ramorumAlthough there is no known cure or preventative on a landscape scale for sudden oak death (SOD), ... more Although there is no known cure or preventative on a landscape scale for sudden oak death (SOD), the plant disease caused by Phytophthora ramorum, a variety of management options has been tested with the goal of developing an integrated program of treatment for the pathogen. This paper presents a first attempt to gather together individual management trials into an overall decision-making tool for landowners contemplating treatments for the disease. It conceptualizes these treatments as a matrix that matches available strategies—some of which are still substantially untested—to management goals for properties or landscapes of varying sizes. The major goals we envision for landowners who are making decisions about P. ramorum treatments include 1) minimizing property impacts from the pathogen when it is already established on a property; 2) strategically protecting particular geographic locations, areas of high-quality oak and tanoak resources, or “islands” of old-growth oak and tanoa...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We studied the impact of P. ramorum infestation on surface fuel loading, potential fire hazard, and potential fire behavior in Douglas-fir- (Pseudotsuga menziesii) dominated forest stands with a significant tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) component in Sonoma, Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte Counties in northern coastal California. We also tested the feasibility of using stands in which tanoaks were treated with herbicides as a proxy for stands that have been heavily impacted by P. ramorum over a long time period, especially in areas where stands have not been impacted by the pathogen over the desired timeframe. In each county, plots were established to assess surface fuel loadings in both P. ramorum-infested and uninfested forest stands. Plots were stratified by (1) whether tanoaks were killed by P. ramorum or by herbicid...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One treatment, consisting of removal of all California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica (Hook. & Arn.) Nutt.) and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) Manos, Cannon & S.H. Oh) trees, was applied at all three sites, and other treatments were applied as case studies at single sites. The sites were monitored for 6 years. Results to date suggest that the treatments that involved the cutting of California bay laurel and tanoak substantially reduced P. ramorum inoculum levels. However, in treatment areas where scattered California bay laurel trees were inadvertently missed because of a restricted time window for operations, a relatively minor component of residual California bay laurel trees may have become infected following treatment and/or harbored prior cryptic infection...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USDA FS) has, since 2006, supported the national early detection stream baiting survey of forests and urban areas to monitor the potential spread of this pathogen from nurseries and other high-risk settings. These surveys have been conducted in cooperation with universities and state forestry agencies. As a result of these activities, P. ramorum has been detected in waterways at 10 sites in six states between 2006 and June 2009 (fig. 1). Below is a brief overview of these positive sites. Florida - In 2006 and 2007, P. ramorum was recovered from standing and flowing water inside, but not outside, a retail garden center where P. ramorum-positive plant...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since most problem-causing non-native pests are innocuous in their home ranges, where they have coevolved with their host trees, experts cannot predict which pathogens or insects will have lethal effect on other continents. Many non-native pests are unknown to science until they cause problems in their new homes. One common response to the threat of non-native insects and diseases in our forests is to appeal to science to develop technical means for management or eradication, yet common sense tells us that it would be more cost-effective and ecologically efficient to prevent pest introductions in the first place. The discipline of political ecology explores the ways in which many environmental issues that are usually presented as scientific or technical problems are actually policy issues that have been redirected into scientific discussion ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

How well has the spread of sudden oak death been predicted by the models in northern CaliforniaSince Phytophthora ramorum established in the wildlands of California during the 1990s, the disea... more Since Phytophthora ramorum established in the wildlands of California during the 1990s, the disease has spread rapidly throughout the state’s coastal and adjacent counties, likely by a combination of human-aided events (e.g., nursery plant introductions) and natural dispersal. While human-aided events are almost impossible to predict, dedicated efforts have been made to model the natural spread of the disease throughout California. These models have been built upon aerial survey mortality data and/or extensive plot-level data gathered for infested and non-infested locations throughout the range of the disease in California and beyond, plus broader vegetation and weather data that dictate the pathogen’s ability to infect hosts and further disperse. Some of these models have also sought to predict disease spread and intensity under various management scenarios. While remaining cautious about model predictions, we find that the geographically explicit modeling efforts to date have been...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nutt.) and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) Manos, Cannon & S.H. Oh), also develop prolific basal sprouts following mortality, injury, or tree harvest. Assessing long-term silvicultural treatment effectiveness for P. ramorum control is complicated by this stimulation of basal sprouting following tree removals. To better design P. ramorum treatments, we need to know how sprouts regenerating from cut host tree stumps are involved in local persistence of P. ramorum. These sprouts could act as reservoirs to maintain inoculum levels as forests regenerate and/or serve as points of re-invasion from vegetation surrounding treatment areas. Following host tree removal treatments of infested stands in 2006, stump sprouts showed little infection for at least 3 years, suggesting that younger sprouts were less likely to become in...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In an on-going field experiment, we are examining the prevalence of infection and the development of symptoms on coast redwood seedlings in naturally infested sites in southern Humboldt Co., California. In November 2006, healthy redwood seedlings were placed amid tanoak and bay trees naturally infected with P. ramorum. Disease incidence and symptom development are being observed monthly, and every two months, a subset of redwood seedlings is destructively sampled to investigate the location and extent of tissue colonization by P. ramorum. In order to correlate inoculum levels across field sites with disease development, rainwater is being collected and baited with rhododendron leaves to determine presence and frequency of positive P. ramorum rain traps. Results of this study will help evaluate the risk of P. ramorum to ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
