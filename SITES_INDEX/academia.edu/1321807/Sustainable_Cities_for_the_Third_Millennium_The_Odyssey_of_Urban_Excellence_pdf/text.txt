The report has been created using both literature sources as well as analyses of case studies from European cites. The main issues dealt with are how the concept of climate neutrality applies to cities, what experiences cities have in planning carbon neutral urban districts and the tools that could be used such as indicators, scenarios and benchmarking. As the world's population increases along with higher living standards more greenhouse gases (GHG) are emitted. The migration of the majority of the population into cities creates a possible opportunity to fight these pressures in a more efficient way. This is because cities are large and concentrated emitters of GHG and therefore also a good platform to cut emission. They are also expanding which means that new and modern technology can be introduced in new built districts. Moreover, cities are generally nodes for societal systems, facilitating the production and implementation of innovations.Download Free PDFView PDFFinal report cof CLUE projectParticipation, Indicators and Benchmarking, European Cities Moving Towards Climate NeutralityKarel  Mulder, Nils  BrandtThis report aims at analyzing the state of today’s knowledge and tools that is relevant for moving European cities towards climate neutrality. The report has been created using both literature sources as well as analyses of case studies from European cites. The main issues dealt with are how the concept of climate neutrality applies to cities, what experiences cities have in planning carbon neutral urban districts and the tools that could be used such as indicators, scenarios and benchmarking. As the world’s population increases along with higher living standards more greenhouse gases (GHG) are emitted. The migration of the majority of the population into cities creates a possible opportunity to fight these pressures in a more efficient way. This is because cities are large and concentrated emitters of GHG and therefore also a good platform to cut emission. They are also expanding which means that new and modern technology can be introduced in new built districts. Moreover, cities are generally nodes for societal systems, facilitating the production and implementation of innovations. The concept of climate neutral urban districts is a way to approach the issue of carbon emissions in a smaller more controlled way, creating test beds where new ideas and technologies can be introduced. Climate neutrality aims at developing strategies and actions that avoid global climate change by elimination of carbon emissions arising from anthropogenic activities. However caution should be taken as the concept is not fully developed. Climate neutrality can be seen in many ways and a unified definition cannot be presented yet. However several projects can be identified that experimented with sustainable neighbourhood developments. These projects were amongst the first to directly apply the vision of sustainable development emerging from the UNCED Rio Summit in 1992 and the consequent Agenda 21 action plan. The knowledge and experience gained from these early projects is considerable, and their influence can be seen in a number of CLUEs. The CLUE case studies show that cities are increasingly moving towards the integration of renewable energy sources and a closed loop metabolism with instruments of planning, design and construction. At present, it can be said that the CLUE project cases show a range of initiatives currently applied in cities across Europe but, for the most part, do not show the application of holistic long term climate change mitigation strategies. Three main issues are considered in this report: frameworks for determining urban GHG emissions, scenario planning for stakeholder participation, and benchmarking the results that are achieved. In chapter 3 an overview of frameworks is sketched to calculate urban district GHG emissions. One of the main issues is the lack of clarity on what should be accounted for on an urban scale: the imported goods and services as well? The issue about setting the system boundary in a way that the results get trustworthy and transparent is challenging and is still internationally debated. In chapter 4, the necessity of stakeholder participation is sketched, and what could be achieved by it. In chapter 5, scenario methods are reviewed. It is argued that it is important to distinguish external scenarios (sketching the uncertainties emerging from the outside world) from internal scenarios that are aiming at evaluating longer term impacts of courses of action. It is argued that scenarios are a good tool for providing stakeholders with expertise that is required for participation. Chapter 6 considers evaluation and benchmarking of CLUEs. Evaluation is valuable and necessary both to secure goal fulfilment and/or to define targets for further progress. The theoretical work within the area of evaluating GHG reduction measures is comprehensive both within general theory of evaluation guidelines but also for environmental and sustainability follow-up. The main function of indicators is the representation of information regarding the complex issues they address. They decrease the number of parameters that are usually necessary to present the situation and simplify the communication of results to the users. New sets of urban indicators are developed for benchmarking best practice in the search for climate neutrality, which are specified in terms of the fabric that serves the city-districts, neighbourhoods and blocks. Based on this approach, new mathematical formulas are used to generate urban sustainability indicators. The pros and cons of this approach are discussed. Using this approach it is possible to compare the performance of city-districts in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emission. This in turn allows each of their respective performances to be benchmarked against one another in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. Finally, chapter 7 discusses the outcomes of this study, and the challenges for further research and development. It develops 7 characteristics that are of key importance for a successful approach in planning, decision making and operation of a CLUE: 1. A long term future orientation 2. Participation of stakeholders 3. Measuring progress 4. Benchmarking 5. Be sensitive non-climate related impacts of urban planning 6. Being equity sensitive 7.

Tools based on a vast amount of background materials: The elaboration of this book was preceded by the formulation of nine position papers on the same sectors. These position papers do have a very broad coverage and large amounts of detail. This book is an exercise to distill primary tools from the vast scope of topics and instruments available for each sector.Download Free PDFView PDFEcological approaches in planning for sustainable cities A review of the literatureGlobal Journal of Environmental Science and Management PublicationRapid urbanization has brought environmentally, socially, and economically great challenges to cities and societies. To build a sustainable city, these challenges need to be faced efficiently and successfully. This paper focuses on the environmental issues and investigates the ecological approaches for planning sustainable cities through a comprehensive review of the relevant literature. The review focuses on several differing aspects of sustainable city formation. The paper provides insights on the interaction between the natural environment and human activities by identifying environmental effects resulting from this interaction; provides an introduction to the concept of sustainable urban development by underlining the important role of ecological planning in achieving sustainable cities; introduces the notion of urban ecosystems by establishing principles for the management of their sustainability; describes urban ecosystem sustainability assessment by introducing a review of current assessment methods, and; offers an outline of indexing urban environmental sustainability. The paper concludes with a summary of the findings.Download Free PDFView PDFSustainable Resource Efficient Cities: Making it Happen!Camaren PeterUNEP document, served as UNEP position paper on cities at Rio+20: Details sustainability challenges in developing world countries and discusses possible solutions under a set of themes.Download Free PDFView PDFEco-Cities in China – Building the Chinese DreamFlorian  SteinbergChina is considered as one of the world’s top three leaders in green development, besides Europe and California. With the United States of America reducing its commitment to combat climate change through low-carbon development, China’s leadership role has become the more important. In many sectors, does China provide good practice examples. This leadership which can be seen in the energy and transportation sectors, and is now likely to extend to green city development.Download Free PDFView PDFCompact Urban Development: Urban Planning for Eco-Cities EC-Link Position PaperFlorian  SteinbergEco-city characteristics in China. The research on defining, designing, developing, managing and measuring the performance of eco-cities and sustainable cities has experienced explosive growth in recent years. The term “eco-city” now appears as a catch-all phrase for a variety of new urban development models. Though there is a proliferation of eco-city research in recent years, there has been comparatively little research on the practical aspects of urban planning in eco-city development. China’s low Carbon Eco City Development Report of 2010 describes a low-carbon eco-city as an innovative type of urban development model based on the principle of balance with the natural environment. Here, it is defined as a low carbon eco-city aimed to minimize resource consumption and emissions generation, while conserving energy and focusing on environmental protection. An assessment of low carbon cities in China also identified three types of low carbon eco-cities: technologically innovative eco-city model (which is usually neither replicable nor scalable and tends to require substantial funding); liveable eco-city model (which is replicable and sustainable, typically designed for population of up to 300,000, employs green building technologies, focuses on developing services industries, emphasizes urban planning is based on transit-oriented development (TOD) model and green transport modes (e.g. walking, cycling, public transport); and progressive evolution of the eco-city model (or “retrofit” model), which refers to rehabilitation and renewal of “old cities” towards more sustainable urban development.Download Free PDFView PDFLifestyleMartin ScherflerDownload Free PDFView PDFSustainability and resilience assessment of urban energy systems: Analysis from four selected Asian and European cities Minci AhmetovicThe aim of this thesis is to provide an exploratory assessment and analysis that quantifies and qualifies the level of sustainability and resilience of urban energy systems in four selected cities: Amsterdam, Hamburg, Kawasaki and Tokyo. The assessment was conducted using a combined rather than a single approach in order to better understand local energy systems of these four cities. Combined approach is determined using integrally sustainability and resilience concepts rather than one concept only. Concepts of sustainability and resilience were developed using a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. DPSIR framework was applied in order to select appropriate indicators, i.e. criteria against which performances of local urban energy systems were determined. The study included a feedback on relevant theoretical knowledge which explores as a foundation, concepts of sustainability and resilience, urban energy systems, combined sustainability and resilience assessment, theoretical knowledge on development of sustainability and resilience indicators and a DPSIR model. The theoretical knowledge provided the setting for further development of conceptual framework for this thesis, defining main features as central to exploration study. As the research was developed, new findings were added and incorporated into the study i.e. theoretical knowledge. The study proceeded with descriptive statistics to provide understanding of detailed economic, environmental, institutional performance of urban energy system in four cities, as well as resilience performance of the national energy system. Observing the values of different indicators, it was found that sustainability performance is differently distributed among cities and strongly linked with local context, i.e. measures and technologies used in the energy sector. It was also observed that funding programmes, energy strategy and low carbon development in an urban area play a crucial role for increased sustainability performance. Expansion in the field of energy vision for the city and country is an important element for enhanced resilience performance. In the power sector of three countries, analyzed improvement of existing power generation units and switching to cleaner types of coals brings added value to sustainability and resilience. Furthermore, it was found that a profitable margin for renewable technologies is lower compared to traditional technologies. The study concluded that integration of DPSIR framework and integrated approach to sustainability and resilience assessment may add real benefit to local energy systems` planning and functioning.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
