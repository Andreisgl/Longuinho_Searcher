These include scientific positivism, the inevitability of human progress, and the potential of human reason to address any essential truth of physical and social conditions and thereby make them amenable to rational control (Boyne and Rattansi 1990). The primary tenets of the postmodern movement include: (1) an elevation of text and language as the fundamental phenomena of existence, (2) the application of literary analysis to all phenomena, (3) a questioning of reality and representation, (4) a critique of metanarratives, (5) an argument against method and evaluation, (6) a focus upon power relations and hegemony, (7) and a general critique of Western institutions and knowledge (Kuznar 2008:78). For his part, Lawrence Kuznar labels postmodern anyone whose thinking includes most or all of these elements. Importantly, the term postmodernism refers to a broad range of artists, academic critics, philosophers, and social scientists that Christopher Butler (2003:2) has only half-jokingly alluded to as like “a loosely constituted and quarrelsome political party.” The anthropologist Melford Spiro defines postmodernism thusly:The postmodernist critique of science consists of two interrelated arguments, epistemological and ideological. Both are based on subjectivity. First, because of the subjectivity of the human object, anthropology, according to the epistemological argument cannot be a science; and in any event the subjectivity of the human subject precludes the possibility of science discovering objective truth. Second, since objectivity is an illusion, science according to the ideological argument, subverts oppressed groups, females, ethnics, third-world peoples. [Spiro 1996: 759]Postmodernism has its origins as an eclectic social movement originating in aesthetics, architecture and philosophy (Bishop 1996). In architecture and art, fields which are distinguished as the oldest claimants to the name, postmodernism originated in the reaction against abstraction in painting and the International Style in architecture (Callinicos 1990: 101). However, postmodern thinking arguably began in the nineteenth century with Nietzsche’s assertions regarding truth, language, and society, which opened the door for all later postmodern and late modern critiques about the foundations of knowledge (Kuznar 2008: 78). Nietzsche asserted that truth was simply:a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms – in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are. [Nietzsche 1954: 46-47]According to Kuznar, postmodernists trace this skepticism about truth and the resulting relativism it engenders from Nietzsche to Max Weber and Sigmund Freud, and finally to Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and other contemporary postmodernists (2008:78).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although anger is supposedly an emotion used in an open and demonstrative manner by the powerful as a means to enact their domination, the Dalit movement engaged in acts of ‘emotion work’ that upset such a social mapping of emotions. The paper engages critically with the sterile and biased concept of ‘axiological neutrality’ and advocates instead the heuristic possibilities enabled by the ethnographers’ personal exposure to the emotion work performed by social movements. The protest’s ideological stance illustrates the politically marginalised Dalits’ appropriation of democratic conceptions through the language of injustice and outrage. Two different sets of actors involved in the protest are distinguished: human rights and progressive activists of the peasant NGO movement on the one hand, and the local anti-caste movement of Dalits on the other. The distinct kinds of emotion work each set of actors performed, and the framing of the massacre as an outrage to moral values, highlights how, in the mobilisation for Dalit rights, the popular language of communal outrage and the language of democratic rights articulate with and support one another.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The legislative prohibition of sati was the culmination of a debate during which 8,134 instances of sati had been recorded mainly, though not exclusively, among upper caste Hindus, with a high concentration-63 percent-in the area around Calcutta City.2 The debate, initiated primarilyby colonial officials, is regarded as signifying the concern for the status of women that emerges in the nineteenth century.

The persistent presenceof deliberately empty spaces in urban areas both past and present signals theconscious creation and maintenance of those locales at various levels: household,neighbourhood and civic/centralizing. Domestic empty space, in particular the spacebetween and among habitations, was likely to have been curated and managed atthe household level. However, neighbourhood-level and urban-level empty spaces weresubject to multiple demands and levels of oversight; as a result, this publicly availableemptiness was flexible in its use but also potentially ‘expensive’ to govern. Thepresence of empty spaces in an urban setting may serve as a proxy for understandingthe relationship between different levels of urban interaction, from the relativeautonomy of the household that used its nearby spaces idiosyncratically, to the largerimpositions of authority through urban design in the form of streets and open plazas.Specific examples of empty space are assessed for the ancient city of Sisupalgarh ineastern India, where geophysical surveys and excavations have enabled us to discussthe multiple meanings of nothingness at the household, neighbourhood and urbanscales.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
