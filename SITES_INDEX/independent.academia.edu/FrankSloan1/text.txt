Criminally Involved Parents Who Misuse Substances and Children’s Odds of Being Arrested as a Young Adult: Do Drug Treatment Courts Mitigate the Risk?Journal of Child and Family Studies,  2016This paper examined (1) the association between parents who are convicted of a substance-related ... more This paper examined (1) the association between parents who are convicted of a substance-related offense and their children&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s probability of being arrested as a young adult and (2) whether or not parental participation in an adult drug treatment court program mitigated this risk. The analysis relied on state administrative data from North Carolina courts (2005-2013) and from birth records (1988-2003). The dependent variable was the probability that a child was arrested as a young adult (16-21). Logistic regression was used to compare groups and models accounted for the clustering of multiple children with the same mother. Findings revealed that children whose parents were convicted on either a substance-related charge on a non-substance-related charge had twice the odds of being arrested as young adult, relative to children whose parents had not been observed having a conviction. While a quarter of children whose parents participated in a drug treatment court program were arrested as young adults, parental completion this program did not reduce this risk. In conclusion, children whose parents were convicted had an increased risk of being arrested as young adults, irrespective of whether or not the conviction was on a substance-related charge. However, drug treatment courts did not reduce this risk. Reducing intergenerational links in the probability of arrest remains a societal challenge.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Most disabled elderly in the community were either Medicaid eligible, or would have been soon after entering a nursing home. Variations in state Medicaid eligibility rules do not explain differences in the spenddown process: the amount of nonhousing wealth of most disabled elderly seldom warranted its transfer to relatives in order to secure Medicaid benefits, nor would their housing wealth have offered more than limited revenue for Medicaid.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Families were interviewed by telephone using a questionnaire that contained structured and open-ended questions. Mothers of infants who had experienced permanent injuries or deaths and had closed malpractice claims in Florida between 1986 and August 1989 were interviewed. Questionnaires were completed by 127 (35%) of a total of 368 such families. Reasons prompting families to file and families&amp;#39; descriptions of medical events, advice from acquaintances, and the quality of physician-family communication. Families volunteered numerous reasons for filing: advised by knowledgeable acquaintances (33% of respondents), recognized cover-up (24%), needed money (24%), recognized that their child would have no future (23%), needed information (20%), and decided to seek revenge or protect others from harm (19%). Over one third of all families indicated that they were told by medical personnel prior to filing that the care provided had caused their children&amp;#39;s injuries. Families expressed dissatisfaction with physician-patient communication. Families believed that physicians would not listen (13% of sample), would not talk openly (32%), attempted to mislead them (48%), or did not warn about long-term neurodevelopmental problems (70%). Families give many reasons for filing a claim. Obtaining money may not be the only goal for some families who file suit.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
