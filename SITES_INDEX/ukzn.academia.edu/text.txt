It draws on the findings from a recently completed community engagement and service learning action research project, where students responded to NGO community requests for assistance to work in small teams with grass roots communities. The methodology included initial consultations between NGO communities and the participating students, with follow-up observations and interviews with students, the NGOs and, where possible, their grass roots community participants. This paper reports on three case studies of the action research project and compares the student, NGO and community reflections of the community engagement experience. The findings suggest that the learning spaces and environments enabled students and community members to engage in mutual learning, through a dialogic and reflec...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Gender, gender difference, gender essentialism, mothering and motherhood are individual fields of study however this thesis provides a sociological exploration of the intersections between these different fields. A selection was made of gender theorists: Simone de Beauvoir (1972), Shulamith Firestone (1970), Nancy Chodorow (1978, 1989, 1994) and Sara Ruddick (1989). I characterise these theorists as essentialist and analysed their contributions to explore their notions of gender difference. All four theorists commonly located gender difference in a maternal essence residing in individual women and their experiences. This essence was characterised as being biological, social or psychological. I came to the conclusion that women’s maternity was seen to be determined and reduced to biological essence (...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Impact of COVID-19 ‘Hard’ Lockdown Disaster Management Regulations on Smallscale Farmers: The Case of Central and Southern KZN Small-scale Farmers Employing Climate Resilient Agriculture ProductionSouth Africa remains a highly unequal and divided society and the disaster measures of lockdown, ... more South Africa remains a highly unequal and divided society and the disaster measures of lockdown, designed to contain the spread of COVID-19, are being implemented within a context where people have vastly different abilities to access crucial food resources and health facilities. Small-scale farmers play an important role in providing food to their local communities and families. The fresh produce they provide is crucial to their own and their communities’ nutritional health, as well as to the sustainability of their livelihoods. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of South Africa’s food system through the widespread hunger and food shortages, which have been reported as some of the dire consequences of the lockdown. This article discusses the experiences of small-scale farmers under the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, in terms of their resilience and food security. Data for the research were drawn from the findings of a small qualitative structured survey that was ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In South Africa, Sectoral Determination 7 (S.D.7) was specifically promulgated to protect domestic workers‟ rights and provide them with the means to negotiate with and hold employers to account. However, research over the past decade has demonstrated that while some areas of domestic labour have improved, many workers are still locked in exploitative labour relationships. This article explores the dynamics of the domestic labour relationship using extracts from interviews with domestic workers. It argues that paternalistic relationships can have as limiting an effect on workers‟ ability to exercise their rights, as fear and exploitation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The CRG research programme aims to explore the development of consciousness in South Africa, to understand how we come to be the black and white, rural and urban, rich and poor and men and women who make up our stratified and differentiated society and to identify and assess the impact of changes over time. This complex problem is being investigated through a study of class, race and gender identity formation in the first generation of children entering the new, compulsory education system. This article specifically tries to document the research process; its methodology and the instruments which were used and developed in order to engage with the issues under investigation.
