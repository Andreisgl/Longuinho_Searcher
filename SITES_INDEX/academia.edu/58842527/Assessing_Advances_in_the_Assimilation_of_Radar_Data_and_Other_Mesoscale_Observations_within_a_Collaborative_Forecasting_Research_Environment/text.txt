Brewster2010, Weather and ForecastingNumerical weather prediction has advanced to higher and higher resolutions since its inception and in recent years numerous operational prediction centers have implemented convection-allowing configurations (i.e., configurations with fine enough resolution to obviate convective parameterization) in their forecast models (e.g., . This latest generation of operational models appears to have numerous advantages over traditional approaches, most notably an improved ability to provide information on convective morphology and evolution (e.g., ). Yet, the resolution of convection-allowing models (CAMs) is considerably higher than that provided by traditional observational data sources, so current CAM-based forecast systems typically use relatively coarse-resolution initial and lateral boundary conditions (ICs/LBCs) and rely on the ''spinup'' process to develop smaller-scale circulations, such as those associated with convective overturning . The spinup process typically requires 3-6 h of...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAdvances in MeteorologyPrediction of Convective Storms at Convection-Resolving 1 km Resolution over Continental United States with Radar Data Assimilation: An Example Case of 26 May 2008 and Precipitation Forecasts from Spring 20092013 • Yunheng WangFor the first time ever, convection-resolving forecasts at 1 km grid spacing were produced in realtime in spring 2009 by the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS) at the University of Oklahoma. The forecasts assimilated both radial velocity and reflectivity data from all operational WSR-88D radars within a domain covering most of the continental United States. In preparation for the realtime forecasts, 1 km forecast tests were carried out using a case from spring 2008 and the forecasts with and without assimilating radar data are compared with corresponding 4 km forecasts produced in realtime. Significant positive impact of radar data assimilation is found to last at least 24 hours. The 1 km grid produced a more accurate forecast of organized convection, especially in structure and intensity details. It successfully predicted an isolated severe-weather-producing storm nearly 24 hours into the forecast, which all ten members of the 4 km real time ensemble forecasts fail...Download Free PDFView PDFMonthly Weather ReviewAssessing Impacts of the High-Frequency Assimilation of Surface Observations for the Forecast of Convection Initiation on 3 April 2014 within the Dallas–Fort Worth Test Bed2018 • Keith  BrewsterThe Nationwide Network of Networks (NNoN) concept was introduced by the National Research Council to address the growing need for a national mesoscale observing system and the continued advancement toward accurate high-resolution numerical weather prediction. The research test bed known as the Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) Urban Demonstration Network was created to experiment with many kinds of mesoscale observations that could be used in a data assimilation system. Many nonconventional observations, including Earth Networks and Citizen Weather Observer Program surface stations, are combined with conventional operational data to form the test bed network. A principal component of the NNoN effort is the quantification of observation impact from several different sources of information. In this study, the GSI-based EnKF system was used together with the WRF-ARW Model to examine impacts of observations assimilated for forecasting convection initiation (CI) in the 3 April 2014 hail storm case...Download Free PDFView PDFAssimilation of radar data in the Met Office mesoscale and convective scale forecast systemsF.

The system has been improved during its implementation at NRL to further enhance its capability of assimilating various types of meteorological data. A parallel algorithm was also developed to increase the system’s computational efficiency on multiprocessor computers. The EnKF has been integrated into the NRL mesoscale data assimilation system and extensively tested to ensure that the system works appropriately with new observational data stream and forecast systems. An innovative procedure was developed to evaluate the impact of assimilated observations on ensemble analyses with no need to exclude any observations for independent validation (as required by the conventional evaluation based on data-...Download Free PDFView PDFMonthly Weather ReviewImportance of Horizontally Inhomogeneous Environmental Initial Conditions to Ensemble Storm-Scale Radar Data Assimilation and Very Short-Range Forecasts2010 • Jidong GaoThe assimilation of operational Doppler radar observations into convection-resolving numerical weather prediction models for very short-range forecasting represents a significant scientific and technological challenge. Numerical experiments over the past few years indicate that convective-scale forecasts are sensitive to the details of the data assimilation methodology, the quality of the radar data, the parameterized microphysics, and the storm environment. In this study, the importance of horizontal environmental variability to very short-range (0–1 h) convective-scale ensemble forecasts initialized using Doppler radar observations is investigated for the 4–5 May 2007 Greensburg, Kansas, tornadic thunderstorm event. Radar observations of reflectivity and radial velocity from the operational Doppler radar network at 0230 UTC 5 May 2007, during the time of the first large tornado, are assimilated into each ensemble member using a three-dimensional variational data assimilation syste...Download Free PDFView PDFImpact of Radar Data Assimilation on the Analysis and Prediction of the 8-9 May 2007 Oklahoma Tornadic Mesoscale Convective System, Part II: Sub-storm-scale Mesovortices on a 400 m GridK.
