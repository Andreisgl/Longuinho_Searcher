Sometimes it seemed that more came than went. In my storytelling I have never nor would I ever use the real names of the soldiers. And here is another truth: I . . do . . not . . remember . . the soldiers' names. But I remember them.Jim Karantonis, Medic and Psych Tech, 1966-1969.(Crazy Eights was the favorite card game of the soldiers on the psych wards.)SynopsisIt's October 1967 during the Vietnam War. Zack Tonakis (White) is a young medic/psych tech, who along with his buddy, Robert Turner, (Black), is assigned to the psychiatric ward of an Army hospital in the hills of Pennsylvania. The ward houses young soldiers who are depressed; paranoid; obsessive-compulsive; a sociopath; and even a catatonic. Others, like Joker Berkowski who's described as "crazy funny," are there for a "failure to adjust" to Army life.A major, not of the medical profession, was brought in on temporary assignment while a qualified replacement is sought. The major, a short-timer, wants nothing to jeopardize his coming retirement. His right hand, Sergeant Helms, views patients as cowards and phonies. An inept ward psychiatrist is of little help to the patients.An escape by a patient during a ball game prompts the major to shut down all outdoor activities. His mantra becomes: "Keep them invisible."The refusal of the major to allow outdoor activities causes the patients to act out. A sympathetic ward sergeant compensates for the restrictions by sending the soldiers to indoor activities. But following a second escape the major expands the off-limits to include even the base chapel.The first short story "The Ball Game" introduces the soldiers who will have their own stories told in the collection. The main protagonist, psych tech Zack Tonakis, will follow the soldiers throughout the novel. Zack carries his own demons from the past: a violent alcoholic father.Stories include a trip to the mess hall and a food protest; a beer truck hijacking; a trip to the base bowling alley; an escape from the chapel; a Red Cross dance; ECT shock treatment; a pool game that goes awry: family room flashbacks; a suicide, and more. The novel's holiday conclusion delivers a message of hope and recovery for the patients, soldiers still.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextLiterary FictionLanguageEnglishPublisherBookBabyRelease dateMay 30, 2023ISBN9781667888309Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated categoriesSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextStudy Aids & Test PrepIdentity & Culture FictionPsychologicalCultural HeritageJewishReviews for Crazy 8'sRating: 3.1666666666666665 out of 5 stars3/56 ratings3 reviewsWhat did you think?Rate as 1 out of 5, 1 stars.

A med tech, Zach and his friend Robert collect the stories and antics of a large group of men.  Overall, I thought this book was ok.  It felt like the author was making fun of these men, or at a minimum using them as a punch line to a badly made joke.  Overall, not a book I would re-read or recommend.Read morecherylgwRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5This book is fantastic! I love how he goes through how the workers react to the patients and how the patients ended up at the ward. His notations of life in the ward and outside is extremely factual based off of others experiences I have heard as well as a psych counselor myself. The Vietnam War is the forgotten war but the experiences that those men went through and the people that took care of them need to be remembered in the minds of all U.S. citizens.Read morecaslater83Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5*special note* This is an ARC book given to me. I was awarded this book in January, but it never arrived until mid-March, so I must apologize for the lateness of this review.)I can't say that I hated this book because I obviously didn't. I just didn't love the book. It's sobering to read these pages. Soldiers suffered so much on and off the battlefield.  And then there were some who were broken long before they ever joined the military. I can't tell you how much I wish we had better resources for our soldiers, their families, and the staff employed to treat and care for them. Looking at these pages, it feels like a living death of sorts. I have limited experience in mental health, but I never had to deal with anyone of this severity. I think I'd be terrified to witness some of the things described in the book. This is a good book to read if you want to understand the mental battles that some soldiers endure long after their tours have ended.Read moreBook previewCrazy 8's - James KarantonisText Description automatically generatedGraphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated©2020 by James Karantonis All rights reserved.

Crazy 8’s: Soldiers Still is printed in Calluna ISBN: 978-1-66788830-9 Over a decade ago, I wrote a screenplay about soldiers on the psych wards during the Vietnam War. The screenplay was never produced. My agent, the late Lew Weitzman, told me to write the stories. So I showed up for a creative writing course at Howard Community College. And never left. Thank you to Lee Hartman, my first writing instructor, and Professors Ryna May and Tara Hart. And thank you Lew. A special acknowledgement to Stephanie May, cover artist and book design consultant. But even with all this support there would be no novel without my muse, Mary Lou. The names used in the novel are fictitious, all except one: Sergeant McCabe. He was the most honorable soldier I ever knew. Several short stories in the novel previously appeared in The Muse, a literary publication of Howard Community College in Columbia, Maryland. Dedication The longer the war went on, the more soldiers came to the psych wards. Sometimes it seemed that more came than went. In my storytelling I have never, nor would I ever use the real names of the soldiers. And here is another truth … I—do—not—remember—the—soldiers’—names.  But I remember them.

A Private Matter A Crazy 8’s Christmas – Soldiers Still ABOUT THE AUTHOR Bits and Pieces - Prologue I was twenty-two years old, a medic and a psychiatric technician during the Vietnam War. I remember what I believed when I entered the Army―that the war was the sole cause for the physically and mentally wounded soldiers. On my first day at an Army hospital in the hills of Pennsylvania, I walked through the corridor past rooms filled with the physically wounded. Some soldiers in or next to their beds were connected by tubes to intravenous stands, with solutions drip, drip, dripping into the patient. One soldier was in a clear plastic tent, and I could hear the rhythmic, swooshing sound of oxygen pumping in place of lungs. A burn patient was enclosed in a hammock while a medic turned a handle as if the soldier were on a barbecue spit. Another soldier had his neck wrapped in white gauze, except for the dime-sized metal opening below his Adam’s apple. His chest rose as the hole sucked air inward and made pfffff sound as he exhaled. I could see that bits and pieces of the soldiers were missing: a gauze bandage over an eye or ear; an empty sleeve stapled to a shirt’s shoulder; crutches for a missing foot or leg. Wheelchairs were everywhere. It seemed obvious to me. It was the war; the war was responsible for these wounded soldiers. I exited the main hospital, crossed the narrow base road, and followed a mulched pathway over a grassy knoll to a two-story, faded red brick building that hid secrets; the place where the Army kept the psychologically wounded. I saw young men watching me from the second floor through windows with thick wired grids. On the psych ward I saw soldiers with every type of behavior and illness: Paranoid schizophrenia; manic-depressives; obsessive-compulsives; even catatonia; soldiers with delusions and hallucinations; drug and alcohol abuse; and antisocial personality disorders―a person who disregards and violates the rights of others. I had known guys like that in high school. Here on the psych wards, the damaged part of the soldier was on the inside. No bandage marked the entrance wound. The war had injured the mind. During those years on the ward, I caught glimpses of the soldiers’ past: a visit from the fathers and mothers, wives, girlfriends, rabbis and priests; contributors to the healing process to repair the broken part caused by the war. But I also learned during that time there were soldiers who had psychological problems before the war; before the firefights; the battles; the explosions; the fire and smoke, the death. For some the illness had shown itself from the first day of basic training with the constant yelling, Out of your bunks, Now! Now! Give me twenty. Now! Now! Crawl faster. Now! Now! the marches, the physical exhaustion, the separation from home, the fear of the unknown. Damage to some soldiers had been done years before by an abusive father; a smothering mother; having no friends; or bullied by classmates. Whatever defense mechanism that had kept their illness in check in civilian life had now failed. War was not the cause but instead the catalyst. I learned that each of them, each of us, takes something from all of the visitors in our life, the good, the bad and the indifferent. We are all bits and pieces, bits and pieces.

Abbott: I said Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know’s on third. The psychiatric unit’s ballfield was exclusive. To become a member, a soldier had to lose his mind, or at least have the Army believe he had. The ballfield was across the narrow base road from the main hospital and connected to the psych building. Two medics, officially psychiatric technicians, were enjoying the warmth of an autumn sun as they sat in the grass leaning back against the keep-them-in-here and do-not-let-them-out-there, fifteen-foot-high chain-link fence. The fence surrounded three quarters of the field and abutted the two-story psych building that defended the rest of the perimeter. A side door of the building opened directly to the ballfield. The building was last used during World War II, then Korea, but now reopened for the new war, Vietnam. The two techs, Zack Tonakis and Robert Turner, were careful not to get grass stains on their white pants and white smocks that announced they were the caring side of the military. Buddies and bunkmates since both were inducted into the Army, and then months of training as medics and then more training as psychiatric techs, and now by luck of the draw here they were a year later at the same Army hospital, bunk mates. Bad times encouraged making friends quickly, even for the short term. To impress women, the psych techs emphasized that they were psychiatric techs believing it made them sound more intelligent than the average medic. Zack thought it sounded as if they repaired TVs, as if the horizontal and the vertical holds of the soldiers were on the blink. And today the psych techs responsibility was to monitor these patients, soldiers still, as they enjoyed a game of softball. Zack, older at twenty-two; Turner was twenty. There was one obvious difference between the two techs, information the Army considered necessary by including the question of Race on the first form. Tech Zack Tonakis checked Caucasian. Tech Robert Turner, Negro. Zack with his Greek ethnic background on display had olive skin, dark hair, and thick eyebrows. Turner had tightly curled black hair and thin eyebrows almost invisible against his brown skin. For Zack, not only the current situation but his deep-seated rebelliousness may have served as an added incentive as to why he took to the Negro Turner so easily. For Turner it was the young man’s faith in the goodness of people that made it easier to bond with Zack the "Caucasian. Robert Turner preferred to be called by his last name, that’s why the neighbors back home referred to him as, Turner’s boy. Say hello to your dad, Turner. This may have sounded strange to strangers but seemed okay to him since he respected his father. That was unlike what Zack told Turner he felt about his own father. Robert Turner’s father was somewhat of a leader in speaking out and organizing for better treatment in the community now that new laws had been passed, civil rights laws. Also, unlike Zack, Turner never had the college opportunity. He went to work straight from high school. He had two younger brothers and a younger sister, and it was expected by his parents that he, being the first-born, would work to help the others. For the patients in the field, there were similarities in age and uniform. Most were nineteen or early twenties, with a few in their thirties, the Army lifers. They all wore dark blue cotton shirts and pants over thinner and lighter blue scrubs. Their dark blue outfit was referred to as patient blues. White plastic wristbands and nametags pinned to their shirts personally announced who they were. Almost all wore black shoes, polished or unpolished. A few wore white cotton open-back slippers, which made it difficult to run to catch fly balls even if they made the attempt. Ball games for the psych wards were reminiscent of pre-little league games, peewee leagues, where boredom overtakes a five or six-year-old and he sits down in the field, picks at the grass, plays with ants, or moseys over and talks to a friend. And like peewee ball, a psych ward game could have as many patients on a side as could walk out on the field and stand. Okay, two outs, two outs, get one more. Pacing the sideline was Tech Krupp, the self-appointed manager of ward 2A’s team. Krupp always saw himself as a manager, director, boss, the top dog. It could have been overcompensation for all the early years when he was the shortest kid in class, and now, still was the shortest. As far back as elementary school, the boy Krupp was usually overlooked when the other boys chose sides for baseball, football, or any of the sports. It wasn’t until he watched an old film on late night TV of Edgar G. Robinson playing the famous hoodlum, Little Caesar, that the boy saw how intimidation of others didn’t depend on how big you were. You had to act as if you were in charge and be tough about it. And Krupp got away with acting tough because so few boys were willing to challenge him, to fight about it knowing he was more than willing to fight, no matter how much bigger they were. Soon Krupp’s demeanor and personality became one and the same, a bully. On the ward Krupp was the senior tech, proof that not all those dressed in white cared about the patients. How he got to be a medic and tech in the first place is one of those ‘Hey It’s a war and it’s the Army.’ Every aspect of life for Tech Krupp was a game. But a game where there was one winner and all those others: the losers. Whatever got you the prize was justified. Even as a young boy when the neighborhood kids got together to play monopoly Krupp would stuff his pockets with play money from his own board game so he could slip in an extra hundred or a twenty when he needed it, anything for an edge. Anyone can do it was the boy’s reasoning, so why not him? One more out, one more. Krupp barked instructions. Be ready! Be ready! He suddenly pointed emphatically to the first baseman and yelled, Hey, First Base! Catch the damn ball if they throw it to you. Catch the damn ball! The first baseman was a patient that Zack and Turner and other techs referred to as Cherry Pie Stover. He was Private Stover when he came here, but rank was left behind when soldiers entered this building. And as for officers, the Army sent them elsewhere for treatment. Stover with his long arms and legs and well over six-foot frame belonged on a basketball court instead of a ball field. For softball games, the psych patients weren’t issued ball gloves, but Stover didn’t need one, not with hands the size of catchers’ mitts. The soldier was tall enough to catch an errant throw before it reached the clouds. As for the cherry pie in front of Stover’s name, Zack gave him that moniker after an incident at the mess hall where the soldier showed an exaggerated enthusiasm for a single subject. The Greek word is monomania. For Stover it was for cherry pies. But that wasn’t why he was on the psych wards. Hey, Greek. Tech Turner nudged Tonakis. Do you see the patient standing a little behind Cherry Pie Stover? Zack tried to focus on the guy who was partially hidden by Stover’s large frame at first base. Name game! Turner said. Damn. Zack was caught. Okay, give me a minute. He searched for the name of the patient Turner had pointed out. Previous psych techs had invented the name game and passed it on to newcomers who readily adopted it. The game was modeled after the comic duo Abbott and Costello’s Who’s on first routine. For the techs, it seemed more new patients came to the wards than old ones left, and unless the techs were standing next to the patients their nametags were of no help. To recall a patient’s name, the techs used a crutch that tied the soldier to a behavior or an incident. The pet names weren’t cute sounding in the same way Grumpy, Bashful and Sneezy were, but the names worked. The game was only played by the techs; they knew it wouldn’t be a good thing if the patients heard their nicknames. Zack Tonakis was certainly used to nicknames. He was called Greek by almost every student throughout high school. Hey Greek; How’s it going, Greek; Where you going, Greek? There was also an indirect benefit for Zack. When a friend called his home and asked, Is Greek home? it really pissed-off Zack’s dad that they didn’t use his son’s first name. More than once Zack’s father told him and told him loudly, It’s a lack of respect for me, not using the name I gave you, my name! This lack of respect for the father was okay by Zack the son. Zack also knew being called Greek was an uncomfortable reminder to his dad that he couldn’t run away from his ethnic background. His father had shortened his original surname from Karantonakis so as not to sound so foreign. As if the name Tonakis didn’t get Zack the question, What are you, Greek or Italian? It wouldn’t have surprised Zack if his father had taken the last name Jones or Smith leaving no clue of Mediterranean roots. Zack figured his dad had issues with his own father in the same way Zack had issues with him. Zack was proud of his ethnicity, even if he didn’t know much about it. He knew from the history texts that Greeks started democracy, had a lot of Gods, and what gave Zack bragging rights, Greeks had started the Olympic Games. He knew that movies showed Greeks as loud and always dancing. He couldn’t imagine his dad dancing, but dad was loud, especially when he yelled at Zack. Very loud. Okay, Turner, here goes. Zack started the name game and hoped that by the time he identified the other patients on the ballfield the little guy’s name would be there. At first base, Cherry Pie Stover. At second, an easy one, Joker Berkowski. Berkowski, a string bean of a patient, crouched next to second base, hands on knees, and eyes on the batter at the plate. Swiiing batter, go on Swiiing batter, was Berkowski’s patter. The Joker had what observers would say was a natural talent. A sharply struck ball to the left of the infield, Berkowski would scoop it cleanly, spin airborne and snap a throwback to first. It was as if his body was double-jointed, able to move in different directions at the same time. Berkowski had earned the nickname, Joker, from the techs and the patients based on his antics the first few weeks he had been on the ward. He had gained an appreciative audience for routines that helped them pass the monotonous routine their lives had become. Berkowski’s bald head and big ears complemented his fondness for playing the fool. His ears were a gift from dad. .    .    .    .    . I said get over here. Get over here. Berkowski Senior pinched the top of his young son’s ear and pulled the boy closer. To the customers in the store, they made an odd sight as the father walked quickly through the aisles, holding onto the boy’s ear as the youngster struggled to keep up. Berkowski’s baldness was his own doing. As a young boy on a trip to the circus he noticed how the clowns seemed to steal the show, especially after the slower, more tedious acts of horseback riding, slow moving elephants, and high wire walkers. The clowns lit up the arena, and many of them were bald with tufts of bright red or green hair standing out near their ears. The boy never forgot that. And on the day of high school graduation with students in black caps and gowns, when tassels were flipped on the caps, and caps were thrown into the air, Berkowski got the attention and appreciation of every classmate for a graduation memory. Bald. Berkowski was voted high school’s Class Clown. Classmates thought he was a riot, but not so his teachers or principal. When Berkowski was drafted into the Army, his bunkmates in Fox Company thought he was a real comedian. But not the drill instructor or company commander. .    .    .    .    . It was near the end of basic training and not a soul in the barracks that night was qualified for guard duty due to exhaustion from the day’s marches. The recruits were asleep except for Berkowski. Silently, slipping from his bunk to the floor, Berkowski, playing a soldier infiltrating enemy lines, low-crawled from locker to locker and bunk to bunk, exchanging fatigues and boots from one location to another. The next morning it was reveille and pandemonium. Hey, these can’t be my boots. Too tight. Can’t be … Hey, whose fucking pants are these? Where are my clothes? Confusion, and then laughter. It was clear who had created the catastrophe when outside at formation Berkowski stood at attention, a grin on his face, the only soldier on time and the only soldier dressed accordingly for morning inspection. Some of his antics were outrageous, some not so successful. Berkowski was transported to the psych wards. .    .    .    .    . That’s Lawyer Lucas behind second base, we can hear him from here. Zack identified the wiry patient who paced a few steps to the left, then the right, and back, then stopped, stared, then ranted to the patient who waited at the plate with bat in hand. Instead of Swiiing Batter, Lucas shouted, Hey batter, you don’t have to swing. They can’t make you, confusing an already confused batter. Play Ball! Lucas announced it, mimicking an umpire starting a game. Then he questioned himself, What if I don’t want to play ball? Don’t I have rights? What about the Bill of Rights? On and on he argued his case. Behind Lucas, Zack said, just where we put him is Catatonic Cart. The patient, sphinxlike, faced the outfield. The techs had placed him there behind two other patients as Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksLiterary FictionFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
