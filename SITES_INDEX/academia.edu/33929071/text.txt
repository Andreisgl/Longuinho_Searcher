Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are lauded by the government as "Bagong Bayani", or modern day heroes, because of their remittances, which amount to billions and keep the national economy afloat. OFWs seek work opportunities across continents to support their left-behind loved ones. Such fragmentation of the Filipino family leads to the formation of a new household arrangement: the transnational family. Running parallel to this steady international labour migration is the proliferation of digital mobile devices and convergent communication platforms. Mobile media, including smartphones, tablets and apps, and networked modes of communication, such as social networks, messaging applications and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), are used and integrated into family dynamics. These technologies and platforms enable and maintain linkages between...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMigration, Mobility, & DisplacementDigital Ties, Disrupted Togetherness: Locating Uneven Communicative Mobilities in Transnational Family Life2019 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoUbiquitous digital communication technologies play a crucial role in shaping the nature of family life at a distance. Paradoxically, mobile device use has not only brought dispersed family members together, it also sometimes stirs communicative tensions in transnational households. These tensions are often produced by uneven access to a wide range of re-sources in mediated communication. Employing the mobilities lens, this paper examines the role of smartphones and networked communications platforms in binding ties and relationships among twenty-one overseas Filipino workers in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines. Based on data drawn from in-depth interviews and photo elicitation, the research study uncovers the performance, embodiment, and negotiation of transnational relationships through mobile device use. Significantly, it also demonstrates the impact of structural and infrastructural forces in enabling differential mediated mobilities. In illuminating asymmetrical mobile communication, I propose six categories: access, socio-technical competency, quality of connectivity, rhythms, affective experience, and communicative space. Ultimately, this paper offers a critical lens on investigating mobile practices in the conduct of transnational family life.Download Free PDFView PDFContinuum: Journal of media and cultural studiesElastic carework: The cost and contradictions of mobile caregiving in a transnational household2020 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoABSTRACT This paper examines the pivotal role of digital communication technologies in the provision of transnational caregiving among geographically separated family members. Particularly, it examines the consequences of mobile device use in facilitating the circulation and consumption of money and consumer goods among 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines. By deploying a mediated mobilities lens (Keightley & Reading, 2014) in analysing the data drawn upon in-depth interviews, photo elicitation, and field notetaking, I coin the term ‘elastic carework’ to articulate the contradictory outcomes of mobile caregiving at a distance as shaped by the entanglement of social structures and technological infrastructures. On the one hand, caregiving at a distance enable transnational family members to enact affective exchanges, fulfil obligations and cement intimate ties. On the other hand, it can also become a source of frustration and unsettling feelings, which are often dealt with personalised tactics. Ultimately, this paper provides a vantage point in re-thinking the performance, embodiment and negotiation of a family-based and networked caregiving at a distance in the age of global migration.Download Free PDFView PDFHome on the move: negotiating differential domesticity in family life at a distanceEarvin Charles CabalquintoThis article examines the ways in which 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile media to re-stage, experience and negotiate home. Based on deploying in-depth interviews and visual methods, the findings show the reconstruction of a sense of dwelling through mobile devices. This transformation is shaped by the performance of ritualistic practices, gender roles and socioeconomic conditions. The study also uncovers how mediated mobilities are undermined by social structures and uneven technological infrastructures, paving the way for unstable, exclusionary and ambivalent experiences. Hence, members of the transnational Filipino family often negotiate such challenges by deploying various tactics to ensure that ties are maintained. By unravelling the differential and constrained mobile practices of the transnational Filipino family in forging a sense of at-homeness, the article attends to a critical conception of domesticity in the age of smartphones and mobile phone applications.Download Free PDFView PDFSecond International Handbook on Internet Reserch[Dis]connected households: Transnational Family Life in the Age of Mobile Internet2019 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoRapid technological innovations have revolutionized the ways in which Internet connectivity is utilized by individual users across diverse contexts. On a more specific note, the integration of the mobile Internet into a transnational household reproduces new textures and processes in sustaining familial linkages. This chapter illuminates how 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members use Internet-powered mobile devices and networked communications platforms in forging and maintaining family life at a distance. It deploys the theory of mediated mobilities (Keightley and Reading, Media Cult Soc 36:285–301, 2014) to examine how technologically mediated mobilities are engendered and undermined by structural and infrastructural forces. Drawing upon in-depth interviews, visual methods, and field note-taking, the study reveals how ubiquitous smartphones and online platforms mobilize the performance of gendered and familial roles, as well as affective surveillance. Furthermore, tactical connectivity is deployed through personalized strategies in overcoming structural and infrastructural barriers. Ultimately, the study approaches the domestication of the mobile Internet as part of a broader social context, such as the operations of a billion-dollar industry of Philippine migration. Paradoxically, Internet connectivity fuels transnational family life as well as legitimizes the retention of structural systems that produce family separation in a globalized economy. It is then by exposing the contradictory mobile experiences embodied and negotiated by transnational family members that this chapter offers a critical lens in critiquing the valorization of migration as a nationalist act in Philippine context.Download Free PDFView PDFAmbivalent Intimacies: Entangled Pains and Gains Through Facebook Use in Transnational Family LifeEarvin Charles CabalquintoDownload Free PDFView PDFInformation, Communication & Society They could picture me, or I could picture them': 'Displaying' family life beyond borders through mobile photography2019 • Earvin Charles CabalquintoTaking photographs has been an integral part of family life. However, recent technological innovations in mobile communication have paved the way for diverse use of photographic images in a household. This paper investigates how 21 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines deploy mobile photography to perform and embody visual co-presence. By examining the data based on in-depth interviews, photo elicitation and field notes, the study uncovers the role of images in enabling the ‘display’ (Finch, J. 2007. Displaying families. Sociology, 41(1), 65–81) of familial roles, responsibilities, and values. Notably, by taking into account how socio-cultural and socio-technological forces inform photographic practices, this study identifies and proposes four dimensions of visual copresence, including casual, practical, curated, and strategic. Consequently, images are broadly understood as important tools in bridging and reclaiming family life as disrupted by the uneven consequences of a global economy in the Philippines. In sum, the study aims to unpack the paradoxical consequences of mobile photography in the maintenance of transnational domesticity.Download Free PDFView PDF" We're not only here but we're there in spirit": Asymmetrical mobile intimacy and the transnational Filipino familyEarvin Charles CabalquintoOrganising, performing, and experiencing festive family rituals sustain relationships among family members. However, in recent times, high levels of human migration alongside the rapid development of digital communication technologies are reconfiguring family traditions. This paper investigates the ways in which 21 overseas Filipino workers in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile devices and communications platforms to restage festive family rituals. Employing a visual method and drawing on in-depth interviews, the empirical study uncovers the personalised and heterogenous practices of the transnational Filipino family in performing intimacy at a distance, paving the way for constructing copresence during festivities. Importantly, using the mobilities lens (Urry, 2007) as a framework for critical investigation, the findings show that a disproportionate level of network capital as informed by age, gender, and social class produces " asymmetrical mobile intimacy. " The present study also reveals how ambivalent feelings emerge due to technological asymmetries and parameters. Importantly, transnational families often negotiate such contradictory experiences through mobile device use. By comparing and contrasting the mobile practices of dispersed family members, the present study uncovers the hidden social inequalities perpetuated in a networked family life.Download Free PDFView PDF" I Have Always Thought of My Family First " : An Analysis of Transnational Caregiving Among Filipino Migrant Adult Children in Melbourne, AustraliaEarvin Charles CabalquintoThis article investigates the ways in which six Filipino migrant adult children in Melbourne, Australia use mobile devices and networked communications platforms to deliver care to their left-behind parents in the Philippines. The study interrogates the diverse mobile practices through a mobilities lens emphasizing how the performance of a resource-based and mediated mobility is engendered and undermined by existing sociocultural and sociotechnical forces. The findings reveal that the performance of various types of transnational caregiving—emotional and practical—in cementing linkages is shaped by filial duty and the obligation to care. Importantly, this study unveils how obstacles and frustrations arise in caregiving at a distance as a static familial norm remains unchanged despite the configuration of familial organization. In this case, sustaining transnational relations warrants constant negotiation and performative adjustments. In sum, the study seeks to unravel the enactment, embodiment, and negotiation of caregiving across distances and borders in the age of ubiquitous digital media.Download Free PDFView PDFPolymedia communication among transnational families: what are the long-term consequences for migration2016 • Mirca MadianouThis chapter investigates the cumulative consequences of new communication technologies for the phenomenon of migration. Drawing on a seven year long comparative and multi-sited ethnography of long-distance communication within Filipino transnational families I demonstrate that the recent convergence in new communication technologies has profound consequences not just for the migrants and their left-behind families but for the phenomenon of migration as a whole. Although new media cannot solve the fundamentally social problems of family separation, they are increasingly used as justifications for key decisions relating to migration or settlement in the host country. The chapter brings together research with migrants and institutional actors and shows that transnational communication through new media has become implicated in making female migration more socially acceptable while ultimately influencing patterns of migration. Technologically mediated communication remains a relatively unexplored aspect of transnational family life. Although new research has recently emerged, that it took so long for this issue to be placed on the agenda of migration research is surprising given the dependency of transnational families on communication technologies, especially in conditions of prolonged separation.

Drawing on a five year long comparative and multi-sited ethnography of long-distance communication within Filipino transnational families I demonstrate that the recent convergence in new communication technologies has profound consequences not just for the migrants and their left-behind families but for the phenomenon of migration as a whole. Although new media cannot solve the fundamentally social problems of family separation, they have become integral to how these relationships are experienced and managed. Despite the transnational asymmetries in infrastructure and media literacy, the increasing availability of transnational communication is used as a justification for key decisions relating to migration or settlement in the host country. This discourse, which ultimately normalizes migration decisions, is also evident at an institutional level. The chapter brings together research with institutional actors as well as migrant families and shows that transnational communication through new media – understood as an environment of polymedia – has become implicated in making female migration more socially acceptable while ultimately influencing patterns of migration. By bringing together an analysis of interpersonal communication as mediation and social change as mediatization the chapter shows that media do not just add a new dimension to the phenomenon of migration – they transform it altogether. The chapter also outlines the distinct contribution of an ethnographic approach to mediatization.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
