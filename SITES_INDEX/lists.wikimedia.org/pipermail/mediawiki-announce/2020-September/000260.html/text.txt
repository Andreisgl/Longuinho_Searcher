[MediaWiki-announce] Security and maintenance release: 1.31.9 / 1.34.3

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.34.3, and 1.31.9!
These releases also serve as a maintenance release for these branches.
While tarballs have already been uploaded, git tags will follow later on
today.
An "MediaWiki Extensions Security Release Supplement" email will follow
this one.
As mentioned in the pre-release announcement, this will potentially be the
final release of the MediaWiki 1.34 branch, barring any unforeseen issues.
For continued support in the future, you are advised to upgrade to
MediaWiki 1.35 in the near future.
The release announcement for MediaWiki 1.35 will follow this one before the
end of day tomorrow. MediaWiki 1.35 will be supported until September 2023.
