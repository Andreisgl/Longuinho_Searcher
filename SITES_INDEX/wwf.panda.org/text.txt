Oops, the page you’re looking for is extinct
The giant panda has been the WWF's symbol for more than 60 years

We’re sorry the page you wanted has gone. Fortunately it’s just a page and not another species.
We want people and nature to thrive together but the sad truth is that many species are at risk of extinction. There's been a 69% drop on average in wildlife populations since 1970. That’s a staggering decline and a reminder that we need to take urgent action.
Head over to our cause page to find out how we’re working to solve our planet’s BIG environmental challenges. Or try our homepage as an entry point to the varied information on our website.
Whatever you chose to do, we hope you join us in our mission to create a sustainable future for all life on Earth.
Working to sustain the natural world for the benefit of people and nature
