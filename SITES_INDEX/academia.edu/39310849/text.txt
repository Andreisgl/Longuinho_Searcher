Risk of aflatoxin contamination of commodities in the world, especially in Africa is increasing. Aflatoxin can occur in a wide range of important commodities, including cereals, nuts, spices, figs and dried fruit. AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG1, AFM1 and AFM2 are the most common type of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin contamination of agricultural commodities poses considerable risk to human and livestock health and economic losses. Exposure to aflatoxin leads to several health-related conditions in human including acute and chronic aflatoxicosis, immune suppression, liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, stunted growth in children and many others. Aflatoxins are detected from several crops especially from maize and groundnut. Several researches show that AFB1 is the most common aflatoxin in the world from most commodities at a very much higher level. AFM1 was also detected greater than the standard from milk and milk products. This indicates that a lot of developing countries people are at danger of aflatoxin contamination. Lack of awareness on aflatoxin contamination increases the risk of damage to human and animals. High economic losses due to aflatoxin occur in the country crops and animals.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAflatoxines Contaminations Levels in Animal Feeds and Milk around Addis Ababa, Ethiopia2020 • lamesgen yegremAflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic metabolites produced by a variety of fungi. Risk of aflatoxin contamination of commodities in the world, especially in Africa which in turn in Ethiopia were increasing. Aflatoxins are natural toxins that contaminate various types of feedstuffs and food leading to health risk in both humans and animal feeds. Milk is a highly nutritious food, and it is a source of necessary macroand micronutrients for the growth, development and maintenance of human health. This work was conducted to review the level of aflatoxin in animal feeds and milk from high potential place around Addis Ababa district, most milk products supplied for the great city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. Aflatoxin B1 and M1 are the major carcinogenic type frequently found in animal feed and milk, respectively thus posing a significant impact on human health. The results of the present review have shown that aflatoxin contamination in samples of animal feeds and milk were alarmingly high i...Download Free PDFView PDFToxinsPhysical and Chemical Methods for Reduction in Aflatoxin Content of Feed and FoodZ. GyoriAflatoxins (AFs) are among the most harmful fungal secondary metabolites imposing serious health risks on both household animals and humans. The more frequent occurrence of aflatoxins in the feed and food chain is clearly foreseeable as a consequence of the extreme weather conditions recorded most recently worldwide. Furthermore, production parameters, such as unadjusted variety use and improper cultural practices, can also increase the incidence of contamination. In current aflatoxin control measures, emphasis is put on prevention including a plethora of pre-harvest methods, introduced to control Aspergillus infestations and to avoid the deleterious effects of aflatoxins on public health. Nevertheless, the continuous evaluation and improvement of post-harvest methods to combat these hazardous secondary metabolites are also required. Already in-use and emerging physical methods, such as pulsed electric fields and other nonthermal treatments as well as interventions with chemical age...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Food QualityThe Scourge of Aflatoxins in Kenya: A 60-Year Review (1960 to 2020)Mark OderoAflatoxins are endemic in Kenya. The 2004 outbreak of acute aflatoxicosis in the country was one of the unprecedented epidemics of human aflatoxin poisoning recorded in mycotoxin history. In this study, an elaborate review was performed to synthesize Kenya’s major findings in relation to aflatoxins, their prevalence, detection, quantification, exposure assessment, prevention, and management in various matrices. Data retrieved indicate that the toxins are primarily biosynthesized by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, with the eastern part of the country reportedly more aflatoxin-prone. Aflatoxins have been reported in maize and maize products (Busaa, chan’gaa, githeri, irio, muthokoi, uji, and ugali), peanuts and its products, rice, cassava, sorghum, millet, yams, beers, dried fish, animal feeds, dairy and herbal products, and sometimes in tandem with other mycotoxins. The highest total aflatoxin concentration of 58,000 μg/kg has been reported in maize. At least 500 acute human i...Download Free PDFView PDFAflatoxins and aflatoxigenic fungi in Iran: A systematic review of the past, present, and future2017 • Mehdi Razzaghi-Abyaneh, Mycologia Iranica  (Journal of the Iranian Mycological Society)Aflatoxins are highly toxic compounds that are produced as secondary metabolites by some Aspergillus and Emericella species. Despite huge progress on aflatoxin research during the past 50 years, we have witnessed many cases of food contamination with aflatoxins all over the world. Aflatoxins have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects and they are capable of inducing hepatocellular carcinoma in human and animals. A wide array of substrates including nuts, oilseeds, cereals and dried fruits are susceptible to aflatoxin contamination which is a challenge for public health, especially in developing countries. Improper storage of food and feed provides conditions for aflatoxin production in crops, especially rice, wheat, pistachio, walnuts, and almonds which are the main sources of nutrients in the human food chain. Aflatoxins can be found in animal tissues and milk after ingestion of contaminated feed. Among nuts, pistachio is one of the most important exporting products of Iran which its contamination with aflatoxins is frequently reported. In general, despite frequent reports of aflatoxin– producing fungi and aflatoxin contamination of food and feed in Iran, limited data exist about human and animal exposure to aflatoxins and related consequences. This review highlights current status and future prospects of aflatoxin occurrence in food, feed and agricultural commodities in Iran, adverse effects on public health, advanced assay procedures and current control measures of aflatoxin contamination.Download Free PDFView PDFAflatoxins - Recent Advances and Future ProspectsMehdi Razzaghi-AbyanehDownload Free PDFView PDFToxinsA Review of the Impact of Mycotoxins on Dairy Cattle Health: Challenges for Food Safety and Dairy Production in Sub-Saharan AfricaJohanna LindahlMycotoxins are secondary metabolites of fungi that contaminate food and feed and have a significant negative impact on human and animal health and productivity. The tropical condition in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) together with poor storage of feed promotes fungal growth and subsequent mycotoxin production. Aflatoxins (AF) produced by Aspergillus species, fumonisins (FUM), zearalenone (ZEN), T-2 toxin (T-2), and deoxynivalenol (DON) produced by Fusarium species, and ochratoxin A (OTA) produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus species are well-known mycotoxins of agricultural importance. Consumption of feed contaminated with these toxins may cause mycotoxicoses in animals, characterized by a range of clinical signs depending on the toxin, and losses in the animal industry. In SSA, contamination of dairy feed with mycotoxins has been frequently reported, which poses a serious constraint to animal health and productivity, and is also a hazard to human health since some mycotoxins and their...Download Free PDFView PDF… foraging ecology of …Risk assessment of mycotoxins in ruminants and ruminant products2009 • Jean Pierre JouanyDownload Free PDFView PDFAflatoxin B1 Occurrence, Detection and Toxicological Effects [Working Title]Aflatoxin B1: Chemistry, Environmental and Diet Sources and Potential Exposure in Human in KenyaDora OronyDownload Free PDFView PDFFoodsMycotoxins Affecting Animals, Foods, Humans, and Plants: Types, Occurrence, Toxicities, Action Mechanisms, Prevention, and Detoxification Strategies—A RevisitErick N OndariMycotoxins are produced by fungi and are known to be toxic to humans and animals. Common mycotoxins include aflatoxins, ochratoxins, zearalenone, patulin, sterigmatocystin, citrinin, ergot alkaloids, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, trichothecenes, Alternaria toxins, tremorgenic mycotoxins, fusarins, 3-nitropropionic acid, cyclochlorotine, sporidesmin, etc. These mycotoxins can pose several health risks to both animals and humans, including death. As several mycotoxins simultaneously occur in nature, especially in foods and feeds, the detoxification and/or total removal of mycotoxins remains challenging. Moreover, given that the volume of scientific literature regarding mycotoxins is steadily on the rise, there is need for continuous synthesis of the body of knowledge. To supplement existing information, knowledge of mycotoxins affecting animals, foods, humans, and plants, with more focus on types, toxicity, and prevention measures, including strategies employed in detoxification and rem...Download Free PDFView PDFcdn.intechopen.comAflatoxin Contamination in Foods and Feeds: A Special Focus on AfricaHussaini MakunDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
