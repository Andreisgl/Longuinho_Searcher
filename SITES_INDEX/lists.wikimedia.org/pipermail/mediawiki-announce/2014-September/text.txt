Hello everyone,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.19.19, 1.22.11 and 1.23.4. This is a
regular security and maintenance release. Download links are given at the end of this
email. 
== Security ==
* (bug 69008) SECURITY: Enhance CSS filtering in SVG files. Filter <style> elements;
normalize style elements and attributes before filtering; add checks for attributes that
contain css; add unit tests for html5sec and reported bugs.
== Bugfixes in 1.23.4 ==
* (bug 65998) Make MySQLi work with non-standard socket.
* (bug 66986) GlobalVarConfig shouldn't throw exceptions for null-valued config
settings.
