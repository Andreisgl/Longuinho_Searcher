A Test of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide in a Non-Clinical Young Adult SampleSarah  CassidyAutism spectrum conditions (ASC) has recently been associated with increased risk of suicidality. However, no studies have explored how autistic traits may interact with current models of suicidal behavior in a non-clinical population. The current study therefore explored how self-reported autistic traits interact with perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness in predicting suicidal behavior, in the context of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS). 163 young adults (aged 18–30 years) completed an online survey including measures of thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness (Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire), self-reported autistic traits (Autism Spectrum Quotient), current depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), and lifetime suicidality (Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised). Results showed that burdensomeness and thwarted belonging significantly mediated the relationship between autistic traits and suicidal behavior. Both depression and autistic traits significantly predicted thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness. Autistic traits did not significantly moderate the relationship between suicidal behavior and thwarted belonging or perceived burdensomeness. Results suggest that the IPTS provides a useful framework for understanding the influence of autistic traits on suicidal behavior. However, the psychometric properties of these measures need be explored in those with clinically confirmed diagnosis of ASC. Lay Summary: Recent research has shown that people with high autistic traits are more likely to attempt suicide. However, no studies have explored why. We found that people with high autistic traits were more likely to experience feelings that they do not belong in the world, are a burden on others, and depression, which may increase their likelihood of attempting suicide. These results suggest that promoting inclusion and independence in those with high autistic traits could help prevent people attempting suicide.Download Free PDFView PDFHow and Why is Autism Spectrum Disorder Misdiagnosed in Adult Patients? - From Diagnostic Problem to Management for Adjustment -Kiyoharu  TakaraAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often overlooked or misdiagnosed in adult patients especially in those with other psychiatric comorbidities. Several reasons possibly account for this fact, for example, difficulty in obtaining accurate developmental history from a patient, insufficient experience among psychiatrists detecting ASD in adult patients, and mild/atypical autistic traits in contrast to prominent symptoms of psychiatric comorbidities. We conducted a search of databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and ERIC) for relevant articles published from January 2000 to May 2015 and summarized unrecognized or misdiagnosed cases as well as major psychiatric comorbidities among adults with ASD from previous reports. Five disorders, (i.e., schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and personality disorder) were specifically highlighted as misdiagnosed psychiatric diseases or comorbidities responsible for unrecognized ASD. This review also proposes plausible pathways for patterns of maladjustment and processes leading to misdiagnosis among adults with ASD, together with necessary approaches to support their goals of a requisite social life. In conclusion, clinicians should be more concerned with correct diagnosis of ASD as well as treatments of psychiatric comorbidities and need perspective of management for better mental health and social adjustment in ASD patients.Download Free PDFView PDFAutism and SuicideOren ShtayermmanDownload Free PDFView PDFHedleyUljarevic_2018_sys review author copy.pdfDarren  Hedley, Ph.DDownload Free PDFView PDFPsychiatry and Clinical Psychopharmacology9th International Congress on Psychopharmacology & 5th International Symposium on Child and Adolescent PsychopharmacologySerhat ErgünDownload Free PDFView PDFArchives of Suicide ResearchSuicide in Autism Spectrum Disorders2014 • Brian MisharaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Autism and Developmental DisordersThe Phenomenology and Clinical Correlates of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders2013 • Joshua NadeauDownload Free PDFView PDFGrant, N., Oliver, J., King, S., Wingrove, J., Tylee, A. (2015, July). Patient experience of psychological therapy: A thematic analysis with participants from an IAPT service. Poster session presented at BABCP 43rd Annual Conference, University of Warwick, UK.Jeremy OliverDepression and anxiety within the general population are a continuing and significant problem. Patients presenting with mild to moderate levels of these disorders are now commonly referred to Increasing Access to Psychological Therapy services. This project seeks to understand the experience of patients receiving psychological therapy in one IAPT service. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 patients, with questions focussing around expectations of therapy, experience of homework, structure of sessions, perceived usefulness of therapy, and therapeutic endings. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Key features of cognitive behaviour therapy were present in participants’ descriptions of therapy. For example, empathy and normalisation was described by one participant “I felt like [the therapist] really got it every time I didn’t have to correct [the therapist] and say well actually, I didn’t really mean that” and also offering a client-centred approach “When I explained that I didn’t really see it as depression [the therapist] was happy to work with me on how I felt and what my feelings were”. Some participants felt that whilst CBT had been helpful they may need further support “I would probably find it more helpful to have a way of managing those core [emotional] responses which I think is beyond the scope of CBT”. CBT was reported to be a positive subjective experience overall, but with periods of conflicting emotions, such as feeling sad to be ending treatment but pleased to be considered well-enough to be discharged. Understanding the experiences of patients who receive therapy. Whilst outcome measures are routinely collected using standardised forms, anonymous, open-ended feedback is rarely able to be collected. This information can inform service provision within primary care psychology services.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
