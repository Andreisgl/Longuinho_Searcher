Hello everyone,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.19.17, 1.21.11, 1.22.8 and 1.23.1.
This is a regular security and maintenance release. Download links are given at the end of
this email. 
== Security ==
* (bug 65839) SECURITY: Prevent external resources in SVG files.
== Bugfixes in 1.23.1 ==
* (bug 67025) Special:Watchlist: Don't try to render empty row
* (bug 66922) Don't allow some E_NOTICE messages to end up in the LocalSettings.php.
* (bug 66467) Filebackend: Avoid using popen() when "parallelize" is disabled
* (bug 66428) MimeMagic: Don't seek before BOF. This has weird side effects like only
extracting the tail of the file partially or not at all.
* (bug 66182) Removed -x flag on some php files.
== Bugfixes in 1.22.8 ==
* (bug 66428) MimeMagic: Don't seek before BOF. This has weird side effects like only
extracting the tail of the file partially or not at all.
== Bugfixes in 1.21.11 ==
* (bug 66428) MimeMagic: Don't seek before BOF. This has weird side effects like only
extracting the tail of the file partially or not at all.
== Bugfixes in 1.19.17 ==
* (bug 66428) MimeMagic: Don't seek before BOF. This has weird side effects like only
extracting the tail of the file partially or not at all.
