Deep inside a forest in Nazi Germany, a prisoner of war carved his name into the trunk of a tree. His surname was WOLSKI. This was no one-off event: in fact, there are dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of similar carvings with names, surnames, initials and other texts on trees. Who carved them, and what archaeological evidence can they add to our understanding of the Second World War?See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAntiquity 89 (345): 683-696.Tree memories of the Second World War: a case study of common beeches from Chycina, Poland2015 • Dawid Kobiałka, Kornelia KajdaDuring the final stages of the Second World War, a trench was dug in woodland near a small Polish village, probably by prisoners of war. There are no eye witness accounts and very few artefacts survive. The only way the story of these prisoners can be told is through the material memory held by the woodland. This paper aims to broaden the concept of material culture by considering the archaeological record that is retained in the bark of living trees. The focus is on the beech trees of Chycina that may hold the only record of the construction of a small section of the Festungsfront Oder-Warthe-Bogen in western Poland in 1944.Download Free PDFView PDFAntiquity100 years later: the dark heritage of the Great War at a prisoner-of-war camp in Czersk, PolandDawid KobiałkaArchaeological research into twentiethcentury global conflicts has understandably focused on sorrow, pain and death when interpreting the associated material, structural and human remains. There are, however, other approaches to studying ‘difficult’ (or ‘dark’) heritage, which reveal that such heritage may have a bright side. This study discusses a Russian canteen recovered from the German First World War prisoner-of-war camp at Czersk in Poland. Discovered in 2006, the canteen belonged to a Russian prisoner. It records biographical details of its owner, and offers an alternative narrative of difficult heritage by testifying to emotion and human creativity behind barbed wire.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Historical Archaeology The Great War and Its Landscapes Between Memory and Oblivion: the Case of Prisoners of War Camps in Tuchola and Czersk, Poland2017 • Dawid Kobiałka, Kornelia Kajda, Mikołaj KostyrkoMany sites related to the First World War are forgotten and neglected in today’s Poland. This paper shortly presents the ways of practicing conflict archaeology in Poland and it discusses results of the non-invasive archaeological survey conducted in Tuchola and Czersk, places where during the First World War Germans built and run prisoners of war camps. In the article the material remains of the camps that have survived in the local landscapes till the present are analyzed. Both sites are at the same time remembered and forgotten by local communities. This paper tries to account for oblivion as an inherent part of local landscapes that adds a unique value to them.Download Free PDFView PDFAirborne Laser Scanning and 20 th Century Military Heritage in the WoodlandsDawid KobiałkaKobiałka D. 2017. Airborne Laser Scanning and 20th Century Military Heritage in the Woodlands. Analecta Archaeologica Ressoviensia 12, 247–270 This paper discusses recent advancements in the context of modern conflict archaeology in the woodlands. One aspect of this development of archaeological research is a broad use and application of airborne laser scanning (ALS). Material remains of a forced labour camp and munitions depot in the forests around Gutowiec (Poland) known as Guttowitz 35 are used as a case study. After approaching prisoners' memories concerning the site, the results of ALS combined with the outcomes of fieldwalking at the site are presented. This article tries to back up the following thesis: due to applications of non-invasive methods (e.g. ALS, fieldwalking), archaeology is able to offer a deeper understanding and contextualization of such sites as Guttowiec 35: a fresh insight into the materiality of conflict landscapes from the recent past in the woodlands.Download Free PDFView PDFInconspicuous and Forgotten Material Memories of the First World War: The Case of a POW Camp in Czersk, PolandDawid Kobiałka, Mikołaj KostyrkoThis chapter is a case study of a prisoner of war (POW) camp in Czersk, Poland, established by Germans during the First World War. The site of the Czersk camp provides a context for the presentation and discussion of three issues concerning archaeological research of the recent past. The first issue concerns how each branch of archaeology, including archaeology of the First World War, is by definition archaeology in and of the present. The second discussion is an attempt to conceptualize the First World War as an archaeological event. The third issue concerns reclaiming material memories of First World War POWs of Czersk by using the remote sensing technology of LiDAR. The chapter concludes with the observation that there are inconspicuous and forgotten material memories of the First World War that can be reclaimed only through the craft of archaeology.Download Free PDFView PDFActa Universitatis Lodziensis. Folia ArchaeologicaDifficult Heritage of the 20 th Century from the Perspective of the Biography of Things2019 • Dawid KobiałkaThis paper discusses the concept of difficult/dark heritage from a theoretical perspective known as the biography of things. First, I analyse Polish archaeological research on dif-ficult/dark heritage. Second, I describe in greater detail the biography of things as a tool for studying relationships between people, things and places. The last part of the paper is a case study presenting the biographies of three objects found in the grounds of a pris-oner-of-war camp in Czersk. I aim to prove the following theses: 1) archaeologies of the recent past cannot be understood simply as the archaeology of martyrdom; 2) material cul-ture from the recent past allows us to create different kinds of narratives connected with dark heritage.Download Free PDFView PDFPopAnthMilitary heritage in the trenches. Woodlands and trash called trench art in the shadow of the Great War2017 • Dawid KobiałkaWherever there are wars, material heritage is left behind. Objects discarded or lost in battle can lie dormant for years, centuries, and sometimes even millennia. Archaeologists use these artefacts to piece together lost history and construct a better picture of the humans who were caught up in war, either as soldiers or civilians.Download Free PDFView PDF2017 Analecta Archaeologica Ressoviensia 12, Non-invasive Methods in Archaeology2017 • Maciej DębiecNon-invasive Methods in Archaeology edited by Maciej Dębiec and Wojciech PasterkiewiczDownload Free PDFView PDFAntiquityAn archaeology of ‘Death Valley’, PolandDawid KobiałkaThis article presents the initial results of a multidisciplinary project aimed at documenting evidence of the genocide that took place on the northern outskirts of Chojnice, Poland, in the autumn of 1939 and in January 1945.Download Free PDFView PDFArcheologie współczesności jako odpowiedź na kryzys dyscypliny/ Archaeologies of the contemporary past as a response to the crisis of the disciplineDawid KobiałkaThis paper discusses the links between archaeology and contemporary. Tree issues are presented. In the first part of the paper, due to a short reflection concerning the recent economic crisis, it is argued that archaeology is, at its most elementary level, a kind of social and cultural practice. Second issue touches upon the connections between time and materiality in archaeological practice. Finally, the issue of how archaeologies are at the crossroad between history and memory is pointed out. This paper tries to account for archaeologies of the present as a promising field of conducting archaeological research of social and cultural value for the present and future societies.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
