Yahoo Esports SEA How to get to Suntec City and the Singapore Indoor Stadium for TI11Read full articleAloysius Low·Contributing EditorUpdated 20 October 2022 at 10:53 am·7-min readTaking place in Singapore this year, the annual Dota 2 The International 2022 (TI11) will be the first time the tournament is split into two venues.The Main Event takes place from 20 to 23 Oct at Suntec City, and the Finals Weekend on Oct 28 to 29 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.Singapore has a well-connected public transport system, so getting to both venues is really easy. But just to be sure, we will have detailed instructions in case you're the sort to get easily lost.In any case, get a data plan, and Google will easily get you a train station near the venue.The tricky bit might be when you're trying to get to the Suntec City Convention & Exhibition Centre where the Main Event playoffs are taking place. Fret not, though, we're here for you.Do note that while masks are not needed indoors or outdoors, you will need a mask if you're taking public transport or a mask.If you're planning to take a taxi or Grab (Southeast Asia's version of Uber), you may not need one. However, if your driver requests for you to do so, it's polite to do so. Be nice, go ahead, and put on a mask.Plus catching COVID and missing out on all that Dota action will suck, so please listen to your driver.We'll be talking about the buses first, before the train options. Feel free to scroll down to the relevant sections.Main Event(Photo: Suntec City)Where: Suntec City Convention & Exhibition Centre Level 6By Bus (Suntec City: Stop ID 80159, Opp Suntec City: Stop ID 80151)There are a lot of buses that serve Suntec City. They are: 10, 14, 16, 70, and 196. These don't count the variations (but these are usually in the morning or evenings, or weekends).The bus stop to get off is Suntec City, or Opposite Suntec City. Regardless, once you get off, start walking towards the overhead bridge in front with a round car park structure.The mall entrance will be on your left. If you're coming from the Opp Suntec City bus stop, walk towards the overhead bridge to enter the mall from the second level.Story continues(Screenshot: Aloysius Low)Once inside, if you're on the first floor, head right until you get to an open space (may possibly be filled with booths) and two escalators.For those on the second floor, just keep walking right until you overlook that open space. You should see a Uniqlo nearby.Take the escalator up, and start walking towards the Monster Curry store.On the right of it is a walkway that you'll want to follow.If you're unsure if you're at the right spot, you should see a sign that is pointing to a Male toilet only.Once at the walkway, keep a lookout on the left for a door and two escalators.It will be just before the exit of the Suntec City mall.Take the escalator up, and you're in the Suntec City Convention & Exhibition Centre.From there, just follow the escalators up to the sixth floor and you're all good to go.By Bus (Suntec Convention Ctr: Stop ID 02151, Opp Suntec Convention Ctr: Stop ID 02159)Those taking the bus straight here will have it a lot easier.The normal buses are: 36, 97, 106, 111, 133, and 857. There are also variant bus routes that may or may not be active when you want to visit.Do use Google Maps to check (it should have timings on available buses). There's also an Opp Suntec Convention Ctr stop, which only serves two bus routes: 36 and 97.After alighting, just head up the two huge escalators outside the building and you'll be inside on the third floor of the Convention Centre.From there, just take the escalators up to the sixth floor. Easy peasy.By train (City Hall Station, North-South Line, or East-West Line, S25/EW13)Getting from City Hall to Suntec City is really easy.Once you exit the station, you'll see four escalators and a Raffles City sign.Make a right turn and follow the mall all the way till you get to Suntec City.Note that this is the long way. There's a shortcut, but it is terribly tricky for people who are unfamiliar with the route.If you want to try, here are the instructions, but we're not responsible if you get lost.Feel free to ask for directions though. Singaporeans are generally quite helpful.Anyway, head up the escalators that say to go to Raffles City.Do not enter the mall from the front doors. Instead, look to the right of the entrance for an escalator going down to Esplanade Exchange.Once you're inside, keep walking straight until the path splits and you can go right.Head that way and keep walking until you see an escalator that goes down. From there, keep walking straight until past a 7-Eleven.(Screenshot: Aloysius Low)Once there you'll reach space with three different paths. Head to the left towards exit A and take the escalator up. You'll be right at the entrance of Suntec City.Go in, and keep walking straight until you reach an open space with two escalators. You should see a Uniqlo, too.Take the escalator up, and start walking towards the Monster Curry store.On the right of it is a walkway that you'll want to follow. If you're unsure if you're at the right spot, you should see a sign that is pointing to a Male toilet only.Once at the walkway, keep a lookout on the left for a door and two escalators. It will be just before the exit of the Suntec City mall.Take the escalator up, and you're in the Suntec City Convention & Exhibition Centre. From there, just follow the escalators up to the sixth floor and you're all good to go.By train (Esplanade Station, CC3, Circle Line)If you're taking this line, do not get off at Promenade Station. While it will still get you to Suntec, it's a long walk through the mall. Don't. Get off at Esplanade instead.From there, head towards exit A, and you're good to go. Once there you'll reach space with three different paths.Head to the left, and take the escalator up. You'll be right at the entrance of Suntec City.Go in, and keep walking straight until you reach an open space with two escalators. You should see a Uniqlo, too.Take the escalator up, and start walking towards the Monster Curry store. On the right of it is a walkway that you'll want to follow.

From there, just follow the escalators up to the sixth floor and you're all good to go.By private hire or taxiFrom your private hire app, if given the option, make sure to select Lobby (LED Wall) as your drop off point. If you're going by taxi, be sure to tell your driver to drop you off at the Convention Centre at the side with the giant screen.Finals WeekendSingapore indoor stadium building entrance facade view. (Photo: Getty Images)Where: Singapore Indoor StadiumBy train (Stadium Station CC6, Circle Line)There's really only one good way to get to the Singapore Indoor Stadium by public transport, and that's by train.You'll want to get out at Exit A, walk towards the Sports Hub Library and you should see the temple-like roofs of the Singapore Indoor Stadium.There should also be signs around to help.By private hire or taxiFor private hire, select Indoor Stadium pick up bay.If by taxi, your driver should be quite familiar with how to get there and where to drop you off.Aloysius Low is an ex-CNET editor with more than 15 years of experience.
