Republic Day
September 24 
« Independence Day
Christmas Day »
Trinidad and Tobago became a Republic on August 1st, 1976. The event is celebrated as a public holiday on September 24th because this is the date when the first Parliament met under the new Republican Constitution.
On this day we celebrate having a Trinidad and Tobago President replace the Queen of England as the head of state, and the islands becoming a Republic – A state or nation in which the supreme power rests in all the citizens entitled to vote (the electorate), and is exercised by representatives elected, directly or indirectly, by them, and responsible to them.
On this day, the President distributes National Awards, to citizens who through their work, activities have demonstrated their dedication to Trinidad and Tobago.
