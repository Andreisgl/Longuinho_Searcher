So these dumpers need to be monitored right from their loading point to their destination point. The commercially available vehicle tracking systems use GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)/GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) network for the communication. But in the opencast mines there may be a problem of accessing the standard GSM network. So the previously available tracking systems cannot provide uninterrupted service. The tracking system designed here tracks and monitors the vehicles moving inside the opencast mines without any interruption. It is using the GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver (for getting the location and time information about the vehicles), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)/GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) network (For long range data communication) and Zigbee module (For short range data communication). The GSM module is sending the data to the internet ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Phytoremediation: Green technology for heavy metal clean up from contaminated soilsHeavy metal concentration is being continuously increasing in the soil due to modern industrializ... more Heavy metal concentration is being continuously increasing in the soil due to modern industrialization and anthropological activities. Heavy metals being nonbiodegradable and with long biological half-lives when entered the food chain, their concentrations get increase increasing with each trophic level due to biomagnification. This increased concentration of heavy metals also poses a threat to human life. A recent new solution to cope up with this problem is the use of green plants for the removal of toxic heavy metals from soil and convert it into harmless and reusable form by a process called phytoremediation. This technology has many advantages over conventional methods for the heavy metal clean up from the soil. Still, there are so many challenges to make this technology practically feasible and useful on a large scale. The present review focuses on the mechanisms of HM uptake, transport, and plant tolerance mechanisms to cope with heavy metals.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The complete details of hydraulic fracturing operations are explained including cementing of the “casing shoe”, “kick-off-point”, “well-head”, “perf”, and “proppant”. An example of integrating real geology, geophysics, geomechanics, and petrophysics data for optimization of a horizontal well and multistage fracture stimulation for a tight oil reservoir is discussed. The fundamentals of coal seam gas (CSG) field development, fracture stimulation, and production are explained, and its impact on human health and the environment are touched on. The application of a cross-well seismic modeling approach for very high-resolution imaging, amplitude versus offset (AVO) modeling, to identify thin coal layers is introduced. A full discussion on gas hydrates mapping, including concentration estimation methods and real data examples from different geographical regions, is included. Oil shale reservoir challenges with real data examples and the producing oil−gas ratio, including gas condensate and oil reservoirs, are described. Finally, gas hydrates-related seismic data analysis, full-waveform modeling, mode conversions, seismic indicators including bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), enhanced seismic reflection, gas chimneys, amplitude blanking, hydrate mound, and seismic uplift are explained with real data examples.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Jumla is the unique place where rice is cultivated in the highest altitude (3000 m) in the world. To find out changes in rice production due to climatic effect, six VDCs of Jumla were chosen for the study. Household survey, participatory rapid appraisal, farmers’ group discussions and desk review were used for collecting data. Rice varieties Chandannath-1 andChandannath-3 were disseminated by the formal seed system with the aim of increasing rice productivity. Despite the replacement of local varieties by improved ones the production trend seems to be stagnant. One of the factors on stagnant of rice production in Jumla is due to the lack of desirable variety with genetic traits of early maturity, less nutrient requirement compared to Jumli Marshi to cope up with the climate congruently supporting to cultural practice...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However in  Nepal, there are no scientific studies carried out recently on return to  research investment in major crops and commodities, despite priority given  in agricultural sector. This paper has summarized the research investment  with respect to major cereals viz; rice, maize, and wheat and income  generated by the impact of improved varieties of these crops in Nepal. Internal rate of return for major cereal crops (rice, maize, and wheat) was  estimated using time series data of 1995 to 2005. The findings revealed that there is a negative annual growth rate (-0.59%) of NARC budget during  1998-2004. There was a food deficit during mid nineties, however, in the late  nineties while despite tremendous curtailing of budget for research, a surplus  of food grain was observed.

The identification and assessment of gas hydrate volume can be done by different geophysical techniques including various types of seismic surveys, like (2D/3D conventional, ocean bottom seismic, vertical seismic profiling, cross-well seismic and multi-component), well logging, and control source electromagnetic surveys. This chapter provides a brief of various survey designs and optimal survey parameters for gas hydrate exploration. Reflection seismic profiles are useful to construct the compressional velocity (VP) model for hydrate bearing formations and to explore its possible lateral variation and thereby provide possible relevant interpretations in terms of the geology/tectonics of the subsurface earth. Ocean bottom seismic surveys are the key to explore deeper structures and to build the shear velocity model for hydrates. The results of various gas hydrate models together with the field data reveals that seismic methods are able to detect the lower stratigraphic bound of the hydrates as there is no seismic reflection from upper bound and there is no seismic signature within the hydrate stability zone. Another technique for hydrate detection includes well logging (electrical resistivity, gamma ray etc.) which, provide point measurements and provide no information into the lateral distribution of hydrates. Electromagnetic methods for hydrate detection are also feasible but require more field attempts and laboratory studies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Lithospheric Structure Model of Central Indian Ocean Basin Using Ocean Bottom Seismometer DataThe intense deformation zone in the central Indian Ocean, south of Indian continent is one of the... more The intense deformation zone in the central Indian Ocean, south of Indian continent is one of the most complex regions in terms of its structure and geodynamics. The deformation zone has been studied and debated in 1990s for its genesis. It was argued that deformation is mainly confined to sedimentary and oceanic crustal layers, while the large wave length geoidal anomalies, on which the deformation region lies, called for deeper sources. The inter connection between deeper and the shallower sources is found missing. The current study focuses on the complexities of this region by analyzing OBS (ocean bottom seismometer) data. The data acquired by five OBS systems along a 300 km long south-north profile in the CIOB (central Indian Ocean basin) have been modeled and the crustal and sub-crustal structure has been determined using 2-D tomographic inversion. Four subsurface layers are identified representing the sediment column, upper crustal layer, lower crustal layer and a sub-crustal layer (upper mantle layer). A considerable variation in thickness as well as velocity at all interfaces from sedimentary column to upper mantle is observed which indicates that the tectonic forces have affected the entire crust and sub-crustal configuration. The sediments are characterized by higher velocities (2.1 km/s) due to the increased confining pressure. Modeling results indicated that the velocity in upper crust is in the range of 5.7-6.2 km/s and the velocity of the lower crust varies from 7.0-7.6 km/s. The velocity of the sub-crustal layer is in the range of 7.8-8.4 km/s. This high-velocity layer is interpreted as magmatic under-plating with strong lateral variations. The base of the 7.0 km/s layer at 12-15 km depth is interpreted as the Moho.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
