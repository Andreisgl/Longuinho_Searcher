This selection is based on the fact that these metals are discharged in many of the industries such as electroplating, detergents, oil refining and others. The isolation of bacteria resistant to different metal ions was done by using mixed industrial and domestic wastewater from the western station of sewage treatment plant in Alexandria. Iron limiting Casamino acid media is used in this study, since it can induce the production of fluorescent siderofores of the Pseudomonas species. Eighteen colonies were selected and purified as single colonies. The preliminary observation and the biochemical identification of these isolates indicated that the selected isolates are belonging to Pseudomonas species. Screening of the bacterial isolates for metal resistance against Cr(VI), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II) was done by the use of MIC and MTC (Maximum tolerable concentrations).

In this study, the most efficient bacterial isolate in decolorization of Basic Red 46 dye, isolate A3, was isolated and identified as Enterobacter cloacae sp. under the accession number KP202719. Different parameters such as dye concentration (100 to 4200 mg/L), pH (2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10), time (6 to 48hrs), shaking or static and temperature (25, 30, 37, and 45oC) were optimized in the present study. It was found that Enterobacter cloacae sp. A3 decolorized 90% of BR46 dye (2000 mg/L) at pH 6 at 30°C within 18 hrs under shaking condition and the minimum inhibitory concentration for strain A3 was 3600 mg/L. The immobilization of A3 in calcium alginate was more effective in dye decolorization than the using of free cells. The continuous fed batch decolorization study reported that the ability of immobilized strain A3 for the decolorization...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Currently, there are a few successful techniques implemented for dye removal; however, little has been done in the field of using reusable biological material extracted from waste. We propose a new procedure to fabricate biocompatible magnetic collagen for dye removal. Our study was conducted on crystal violet (CV) removal from industrial effluent using fish scales collagen. In this study, removal of dye by adsorption on various types of collagen was studied using soft, coarse and magnetic collagen nanocomposite. The magnetic collagen nanocomposite was synthesized by coprecipitation method followed by mixing of iron nanoparticles with collagen. Characterization of the prepared materials was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Soft collagen, coarse collagen and ma...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
