I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.18.3. This release
correct issues
from the 1.18.2 security release, and also some other bugs.
 
* (bug 35446) Using "{{nse:}}" with an invalid namespace name no longer
throws
  a PHP warning.
* (bug 35567) The whole password reminder e-mail is now sent in the same
language.
* (bug 35961) Hash comparison should always be strict.
* (bug 35671) PHP Notice: Undefined index: gettoken in
includes/api/ApiMain.php
  on line 598.
* Fix broken email confirmation expiration caused by MWCryptRand changes.
