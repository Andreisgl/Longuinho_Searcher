Yet, exposure to disaster impact is only the opening salvo. As the disaster unfolds, and far into the aftermath, affected populations grapple with loss and change, consequences that persevere long after the risk for physical harm has dissipated. This trilogy of forces--exposure to hazard, massive personal and societal loss, and profound and enduring life change--characterize the nature of disaster. Thus we define a disaster as an encounter between a hazard (forces of harm) and a human population in harm's way, influenced by the ecological context, creating demands that exceed the coping capacity of the affected community Disasters are population-based phenomena. According to , -Disasters can have widespread and devastating impact on individuals, families, communities and nations.‖ Disasters are collective, community-wide events, necessitating simultaneous consideration of...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEpidemiologic ReviewsEpidemiology of Tropical Cyclones: The Dynamics of Disaster, Disease, and Development2005 • Zelde EspinelDownload Free PDFView PDFOceanographyCyclones, tsunamis and human health2006 • Mark KeimDownload Free PDFView PDFChildren: Stress, Trauma and Disasters2000 • Jon Shaw, Zelde EspinelDownload Free PDFView PDFEncyclopedia of Earth Sciences SeriesPsychological Impacts of Natural Disasters2013 • Yuval Neria, Zelde EspinelDownload Free PDFView PDFThe 2010 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: The Trauma Signature of an Ecological Disaster.

Sufiyan, PhDLow-income and vulnerable populations that suffer most in natural disasters are females, children, elderly, disabled, and ethnic minorities This dissertation explores the association between natural disaster and poverty conditions among socially disadvantaged subgroups within the social, economic, and political contexts of the disaster affected regions in the Gulf Coast States. It argues that poverty conditions increase the negative impacts of disaster for socially vulnerable populations. This dissertation advocates incorporating the vulnerabilities of the marginalized population in each phase of disaster management planning, from mitigation to recovery. The study uses correlation and regression analyses to find the association between disaster impacts and different poverty conditions. The study of 534 counties of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas reveals that people living in poverty have a significant positive association with disaster fatalities and property damage, which demonstrates that natural disasters are likely to increase poverty. Moreover, the counties with more socially disadvantaged groups are more vulnerable to disaster. In conclusion, the author proposes that integration of vulnerabilities of socially disadvantaged groups into disaster mitigation policies can fundamentally reduce the loss of human life and economic loss of a society from natural disaster.Download Free PDFView PDFCoping with fire: Psychological preparedness for bushfiresDanielle ClodePsychological preparedness is an underlying state of mind that helps people to physically prepare for a fire, to respond appropriately in the event of a fire, and to recover after a fire. Pro-action: Psychological preparedness in pro-action allows an accurate assessment of fire risk to be taken into account when choosing where to live, work or visit. Prevention: Psychological preparedness in prevention ensures adherence to fire restrictions, and adoption of strategies to prevent fires on properties (such as fuel reduction, building design, site location). Preparation: Psychological preparedness in preparation includes making a commitment to having a survival plan for fire should it occur, and making the necessary preparations to enact that plan and reduce the impact of fire on loss of life or property. Response: Psychological preparedness in response to a fire involves recognising the unique physiological and psychological reactions we have to extreme stress, and developing and impl...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
