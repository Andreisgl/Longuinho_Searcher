The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that steps be taken to improve ventilation in healthcare facilities, schools, businesses, and households. 1 However, limited guidance has been provided on how to evaluate the adequacy of ventilation. To be useful in real-world settings, tools to assess ventilation must be inexpensive, safe, and easy to use. An ideal tool would provide rapid and easy-to-interpret results that could be used to identify areas with inadequate ventilation and to assess the impact of interventions. One promising candidate as a practical tool to assess ventilation is carbon dioxide monitoring using inexpensive handheld devices that measure carbon dioxide concentrations. The concentration of carbon dioxide in outdoor air is ∼400 parts per million (ppm) versus ∼40,000 ppm in exhaled breath. 2 Thus, carbon dioxide levels rise in occupied spaces that are inadequately ventilated. 2 According to the CDC, carbon dioxide readings >800 ppm in buildings are an indicator of suboptimal ventilation requiring intervention. 1 Carbon dioxide monitoring has been used to assess ventilation and to identify measures to reduce risk in settings such as schools, university buildings, dental offices, motor vehicles, and hospitals. 3-7 The most important limitation of carbon dioxide monitoring is that it does not account for filtering of air. For example, carbon dioxide levels rise above 800 ppm in the cabin of airplanes both in flight and during boarding and deplaning, but the risk for viral transmission may remain low because the air conditioning system provides rapid recirculation of air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. 5 Other potential tools to assess ventilation include handheld particle counters and devices that measure total volatile organic compounds. 8,9 In an assessment of ventilation in public spaces,Save to LibraryDownloadby Curtis Donskey•  6  Carbon Dioxide, Ventilation, Airflow, Covid-19Performance of ventilator components for natural ventilation applicationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Steve  Sharples•  9  Architecture, Building, Laboratory experiment, Natural ventilationAutomatic detection and classification of acoustic breathing cyclesSave to LibraryDownloadby Miad Faezipour•  6  Support Vector Machines, Feature Extraction, Support vector machine, AccuracyAirflow versus pressure drop for bulk wood pelletsSave to LibraryDownloadby Anthony  Lau•  8  Engineering, Technology, Ventilation, Prediction ModelIndoor airflow behavior and thermal comfort in a courtyard house in warm humid tropicsThis paper assesses the effects of indoor airflow behavior modifying the indoor air temperature on thermal comfort conditions in a residential tropical courtyard building where courtyard maintains direct contacts with outdoor environment... moreThis paper assesses the effects of indoor airflow behavior modifying the indoor air temperature on thermal comfort conditions in a residential tropical courtyard building where courtyard maintains direct contacts with outdoor environment through openings found in the envelope. Results taken from a field investigation and a computer simulation reveal that given the ambient climatic conditions particular indoor airflow behaviors are sufficient to lower the indoor air temperatures below the ambient level in the courtyard as well as in surrounding internal spaces. Thus, thermal comfort condition not correlated to the number of openings but to the distribution pattern and volumetric rate of indoor airflow in enhancing heat exchange between wall surfaces and air. The optimum range of ambient wind direction, which required for optimum distribution and volumetric flow of indoor air, was found within a range of 30-60 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the courtyard and building.

This is critical for AEC applications as prototyping buildings are not practical and retrofitting existing designs is expensive. The impact of CFD on AEC applications is directly related to the interpretation of simulation results; the ability to assess performance, identifies opportunities for improvement, and quantifies the impact of modification. Results visualization provides the opportunity to optimize design performance characteristics such as energy consumption, amount of contaminant entrained, thermal comfort, solar influence, hot air recirculation, and various other metrics of AEC application design performance.Save to LibraryDownloadby IJIRAE - International Journal of Innovative Research in Advanced Engineering and +1Raja Surya Nukala•  18  Agent Based Simulation, Simulation, Numerical Simulation, Energy Efficient Data CentersThermal zoning and interzonal airflow in the design and simulation of solar houses: a sensitivity analysisMany assumptions must be made about thermal zoning and interzonal airflow for modelling the performance of buildings.

This is particularly important for solar homes, which are subjected to high levels of periodic solar heat gains in certain zones. The way in which these passive solar heat gains are distributed to other zones of a building has a significant effect on predicted energy performance, thermal comfort and optimal design selection. This article presents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis that quantifies the effect of thermal zoning and interzonal airflow on building performance, optimal south-facing glazing area, and thermal comfort. The effect of controlled shades to control unwanted solar gains is also explored. Results show that passive solar buildings, in particular, can benefit from increased air circulation with a forced air system because it allows solar gains to be redistributed and thus reduces direct gain zone overheating and total energy consumption.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ted Kesik•  11  Architecture, Building Energy Simulation, Energy Consumption, Sensitivity AnalysisFlow dynamics and characterization of a coughSave to LibraryDownloadby Chao-hsin  Lin•  17  Engineering, Earth Sciences, Visualization, ModelingComputational Analysis of Natural Ventilation Flows in Geodesic Dome Building in Hot ClimatesFor centuries, dome roofs were used in traditional houses in hot regions such as the Middle East and Mediterranean basin due to its thermal advantages, structural benefits and availability of construction materials.

This article presents the computational modelling of the wind-and buoyancy-induced ventilation in a geodesic dome building in a hot climate. The airflow and temperature distributions and ventilation flow rates were predicted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were solved using the CFD tool ANSYS FLUENT15. The standard k-epsilon was used as turbulence model. The modelling was verified using grid sensitivity and flux balance analysis. In order to validate the modelling method used in the current study, additional simulation of a similar domed-roof building was conducted for comparison. For wind-induced ventilation, the dome building was modelled with upper roof vents. For buoyancy-induced ventilation, the geometry was modelled with roof vents and also with two windows open in the lower level. The results showed that using the upper roof openings as a natural ventilation strategy during winter periods is advantageous and could reduce the indoor temperature and also introduce fresh air. The results also revealed that natural ventilation using roof vents cannot satisfy thermal requirements during hot summer periods and complementary cooling solutions should be considered. The analysis showed that buoyancy-induced ventilation model can still generate air movement inside the building during periods with no or very low wind.Save to LibraryDownloadby zohreh soleimani and +1John Calautit•  7  Architecture, Renewable Energy, Heat Transfer, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling and simulationInfluence of a DC corona discharge on the airflow along an inclined flat plateSave to LibraryDownloadby Eric Moreau•  11  Engineering, Electrostatics, Particle Image Velocimetry, Flow ControlState-of-the-art methods for studying air distributions in commercial airliner cabinsSave to LibraryDownloadby Chao-hsin  Lin•  7  Architecture, Experiment, Building, Building EnvironmentSize of nostril opening as a measure of intranasal volumeSave to LibraryDownloadby Jessica Freiherr•  13  Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Biological Sciences, Olfaction, HumansA resistance approach to analysis of natural ventilation airflow networksSave to LibraryDownloadby richard aynsley•  18  Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computational Fluid Dynamics, AerodynamicsAerodynamic characteristics of laryngectomees breathing quietly and speaking with the electrolarynxSave to LibraryDownloadby Hanjun  Liu•  17  Speech Production, Speech, Voice, HumansPassive Downdraught Evaporative CoolingI.

The reason for this difference is not clear. In a randomized prospective study, we made continuous recordings of airway pressure and airflow, with 20 healthy volunteers, with the PEP bottle and the PEP mask. The measurement sequence consisted of 3 sessions of 10 breaths with the PEP bottle and the PEP mask, in a randomized crossover design. A rest period of 15 min separated the PEP bottle and PEP mask measurements. With the PEP bottle the expiratory phase began with a zero-flow period of 0.39 s, during which airway pressure rose 11.9 cm H2O. With the PEP bottle the mean expiratory pressure was 11.7 cm H2O, and end-expiratory pressure was 9.5 cm H2O.

The mine is currently being extended to a second level. Available fans for ventilation are two surface fans of 24 kW and two underground booster fans of 12 kW. The design of a ventilation network in conjunction with multi surface fans and booster fans entails a complex procedure. Ventsim Visual software modeling has been used for network analysis to determine the optimum surface and booster fans locations, blade settings, and speeds. Both natural and mechanical induced ventilation pressures have been taken into account. Three working faces on each level have been designated as target points that minimum air quantities are required. The model has been calibrated against a pressure and quantity survey. Design of ductwork, door/stopping positions and different fans characteristics have been examined. The optimum flow rate at identified working faces, efficiency and minimum energy losses and annual network power cost determine the best scenario. The optimum design has been determined for the ventilation network for the next 100 years. The optimum flow rate across working faces is the key criterion selected.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ali  Haghighat, Ph.D.•  3  Mine Ventilation, Airflow, Axial flow fans,THE EFFICIENCY OF AIRPLANE WING: A REVIEWThe airplane wing efficiency is significantly impacted by the generated drag imposed by vortices.

The tenacity of winglets is to diminish these vortex formations. This article outlines the wind/air tunnel simulations on 3 wing model rectangular wing, conventional winged wings, and corrugated winged wing through a transverse cross-section of NACA 012 air foil. The purpose of the study is to consider the consequence of winglet corrugation on the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing. In a subsonic low-swiftness squall tunnel test was performed. Aerodynamic features such as the lifting coef icient (Cl) were obtained using Six Element Balance. Various tip devices on commercial jets have been mounted to reduce the use of fuel and provide greater flexibility for the mission. As these wingtip units are geometrically fixed and mainly intended for a certain mission segment, their overall performance can still be improved by introducing morphing techniques. The visualization of smoke flow was achieved to classify vortices and separated flow regions at 22000 Reynolds. The visualization of the airflow was performed to monitor regions with the strong cross flow, reverse flow and flow separation at the 172000 Reynolds. Both the aerodynamic feature and the tests of the simulation in flux have shown that the wing with an unadventurous wing and rectangular wing performed better aerodynamically than the wingSave to LibraryDownloadby IAEME Publication•  10  Aerodynamics, Drag, Flux, WingletInfluence of free air space on microbial kinetics in passively aerated compostSave to LibraryDownloadby Grant Clark•  23  Kinetics, Statistical Analysis, Rheology, MultidisciplinaryTechnical Notes: Evaluation of Two Alternative Procedures for Measuring Airflow Resistance of Sound Absorbing MaterialsIt is well known that sound absorption and sound transmission properties of open porous materials are highly dependent on their airflow resistance values.

Low values of airflow resistance indicate little resistance for air streaming through the porous material and high values are a sign that most of the pores inside the material are closed. The laboratory procedures for measuring airflow resistance have been stan- dardized by several organizations, including ISO and ASTM for both alternate flow and continuous flow. However, practical implementation of these standardized methods could be both complex and expensive. In this work, two indirect alternative measurement procedures were compared against the alternate flow standardized technique. The techniques were tested using three families of eco-friendly sound absorbent materials: recycled polyurethane foams, coconut natural fibres, and recycled polyester fibres.

The Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model is used to diagnose airflow in the Hawaiian coastal waters. High-resolution (2 km) runs are performed for July 2005 covering the ‘Alenuihāhā Channel and nested in a 6-km state domain. Under normal trade wind conditions (7–8 m s−1), winds at the channel entrance are 1–2 m s−1 faster than upstream due to the convergence of the deflected airflows by the islands of Maui and Hawaii, and accelerate through the channel due to along-gap pressure gradients and lower pressure in the wakes of both islands. The acceleration is accompanied by descending airflow (&gt;9 cm s−1) in the exit region with lowering of the trade wind inversion. Deceleration occurs downstream of the channel exit with a rapid change from sinking motion to rising motion (&gt;3 cm s−1).

Since ventilation is a key element in sustainable and environmental design, there is a need to evaluate local wind environments of high dense cities such as Hong Kong. In recent years non-standard curvilinear residential buildings that don't follow conventional rectilinear block structures are becoming increasingly more popular. Though various studies of ventilation conditions of conventionally design buildings have been made, research of non-standard curvilinear building layouts is still limited. Previous research mainly explored rectilinear block-shaped layouts that typically cause a so called 'Wall-Effect' by blocking adequate ventilation on street-and mid-levels around buildings. Our paper presents and summarizes the analysis of airflow and ventilation of non-standard curvilinear buildings based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The Flow Simulation of Solidworks has been used as our analysis software tools. Its technology is based upon the use of Cartesian-based meshes and solving the Navier-Stokes equations. Nonstandard and curvilinear shaped building arrangements are categorized into various groups and analyzed in respect to their performance of ventilation on street and mid-levels using a case study of high rise buildings in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. Hong Kong's climate is subtropical warm and humid in summer, subsequently a higher ventilation is needed and building design has to accommodate good airflow around the buildings. Our findings show that curvilinear buildings lead to a more favourable ventilation environment since they have a smaller wind resistance. Non-standard curvilinear designs perform better in terms of general ventilation since the airflow around the buildings is faster and less turbulent. Our simulations present that convex-shaped buildings have a better overall wind environment than concave-shaped ones. We conclude our paper with a classification of various nonstandard curvilinear buildings that offer a general better airflow and ventilation due to their shape. This classification allows designer to understand quickly wind resistance, airflow, and turbulences that a non-standard curvilinear design has on the immediate environment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marc Aurel Schnabel and +1Yi He•  17  Architecture, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling and simulation, Building science, CFD AnalysisOn natural ventilation and thermal comfort in compact urban environments – the Old Havana caseSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank De Troyer•  14  Architecture, Compact City, Air flow, BuildingEvaluation of airflow and thermal comfort in buildings ventilated with wind catchers: Simulation of conditions in Yazd City, IranThe usage of passive cooling systems such as wind catchers can reduce the energy usage in buildings and provide natural ventilation and comfort to its occupants, particularly in hot and dry regions of Iran and neighboring countries where... moreThe usage of passive cooling systems such as wind catchers can reduce the energy usage in buildings and provide natural ventilation and comfort to its occupants, particularly in hot and dry regions of Iran and neighboring countries where it was traditionally used. The purpose of this study was to investigate the airflow and thermal comfort in six different designs of wind catchers using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Simulations of airflow in the wind catcher and the building were done under steady state and turbulent flow regime with boundary conditions based on typical conditions found in Yazd city, Iran. Several commonly used turbulence models were evaluated to assess the accuracy of the simulation. First, the proposed CFD model was validated through comparison of wind tunnel data available in the literature, and then the model was used for design purposes. It was found that the k − ω turbulence model can accurately predict the airflow velocity in the range of parameters studied. The design and performance of wind catcher were evaluated based on the thermal comfort levels using the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) thermal comfort tool and numerical data. Width and height of the wind catcher were varied in the simulations and optimal values were determined. It was found that varying the width of the wind catcher had the greatest impact on the airflow speed and distribution inside the room. Reducing the width from 2.5 m to 2 m showed that airflow velocity in the middle area was increased up to 34%. While reducing the width from 2 m to 1.5 m showed an entirely different flow pattern inside the building and also increase airflow speed in the middle area up to 50%. The addition of curved wall at the bottom of the inlet channel showed that it could increase the airflow speed of the inflow stream, however, it also caused the airflow to be directed towards the lower levels of the room and very large rotating flows in the upper levels. Finally, the results showed that the wind catcher may be optimized for improving comfort for various climates using the tools presented in this work.Save to Libraryby seyyed hossein Hosseini•  5  Engineering, Thermal comfort, Natural ventilation, Energy for Sustainable DevelopmentPerformance of ventilator components for natural ventilation applicationsThis paper describes a series of laboratory experiments that investigated the airflow interactions that take place between components in louvered ventilators.

The context of the work was to improve the design and performance of ventilators used in natural ventilation systems in buildings. The study sort to analyse the measured results, identify any trends and ultimately to derive simple mathematical equations that could be used to describe the airflow behaviour of a given ventilator configuration. Multiple regression analysis was utilised in obtaining relationships between airflow rates, pressure differentials applied across ventilator components, mesh-screen free area, louver blade inclination angles and, where applicable, gaps between louver blades and mesh-screens. The paper introduces some simple generic equations that relate the airflow rate through a ventilator to the prevailing driving force and the constituent components/configuration of the ventilator.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nelson Chilengwe•  9  Architecture, Building, Laboratory experiment, Natural ventilationPrevention of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and House Flies (Diptera: Muscidae) from Entering Simulated Aircraft with Commercial Air Curtain UnitsSave to LibraryDownloadby J.

To obtain airflow measurement for an extended time, traverse measurements through the Equal-Area method were first conducted to select 3 sampling points (3-P) that represented the average velocity at a measurement plane. Next, through statistical analysis, additional uncertainty generated when reducing the number of sampling points was accounted for in terms of sampling time, reduced number of sampling points, measurement location, and comparison to common airflow measurement stations (AFMS). As a result of these analyses, it was found that for sampling times of 60 seconds, uncertainties below 5% can be expected from 3-P measurements when airflow velocity is above 800 fpm. Analysis showed that for return air (RA) measurements where velocities below 800 fpm are common, more than 3-P would be necessary to comply with 5% accuracy per ASHRAE Standard 111 [2008] requirements.  Next, it was demonstrated through comparison of measurement conditions and uncertainties for supply air (SA) that a relationship between measurement location and uncertainty of the 3-P measurement exists. Finally, the results showed that AFMS utilized more sampling points than necessary to achieve 5% accuracy in every test case. Performing airflow measurements with a tailored selection of sampling points was more effective than following cross-sectional area-based industry guidelines.  Upon the completion of the airflow uncertainty analyses, a calibration procedure for VAV AHUs was also produced and tested to obtain in-situ fan performance curves. In addition, based on the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 51 [1999], an uncertainty analysis was performed on adjusted measurements by fan laws to build in-situ fan performance curves. Uncertainty bands at 95% confidence showed that previously defined airflow measurement uncertainty is the most sensible variable. Results showed that while application of fan laws can be applicable to return fans (RFs), higher uncertainties can be expected as airflow velocities below 800 fpm are common. Nevertheless, since SA average velocities were generally above 800 fpm, narrow uncertainty intervals were observed. In conclusion, a practical and reliable approach for in-situ fan performance curves calibration was explored using statistical analysis and uncertainty propagation of airflow, fan head, and fan power uncertainties. Airflow measurements for extended sampling times were successfully achieved after developing a prototype holding bracket design for reducing field technician dependency. Finally, a VAV AHU calibration procedure for obtaining in-situ fan performance curves with actual range and visible system effect impacts was successfully applied and validated through this thesis work.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alejandro L Rivas Prieto•  7  Measurement and Evaluation, Uncertainty, Commissioning, HVAC and SustainabilityThe Helsinki Office Environment Study: Air Change in Mechanically Ventilated BuildingsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jouni Jaakkola•  7  Engineering, Earth Sciences, Ventilation, Hvac SystemHyperlocalization through Architecture & ClimatologyWellington is famous for its wind.

It is arguably the windiest city in the world and provides the site for this research that considers an inter-disciplinary design approach fusing climatology and architectural domains. This research uses Wellington's wind climate as the pivot of inquiry in all of its complexity, and explores design narratives that best respond to those circumstances in order to generate building forms with the capacity to emulate a 'hyperlocalized' typology by utilizing contextual wind data as the driver in the design process. Emergent systems will provide the models and processes of the wind dynamics in Wellington so that this naturally occurring phenomenon can be explored for the creation of artificial systems, designed to produce hyperlocalized forms derived from its immediate climate.Save to LibraryDownloadby Claudia Van Velthooven and +1Marc Aurel Schnabel•  7  Architecture, Parametric Design (Architecture), Climate responsive Architecture, Responsive DesignOn natural ventilation and thermal comfort in compact urban environments � the Old Havana caseSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank De Troyer•  14  Architecture, Compact City, Air flow, BuildingAnalysis of Inlet Configurations on the Microclimate Conditions of a Novel Standalone Agricultural Greenhouse for Egypt Using Computational Fluid DynamicsWater shortage, human population increase, and lack of food resources have directed societies towards sustainable energy and water resources, especially for agriculture.

While open agriculture requires a massive amount of water and energy, the requirements of horticultural systems can be controlled to provide standard conditions for the plants to grow, with significant decrease in water consumption. A greenhouse is a transparent indoor environment used for horticulture, as it allows for reasonable control of the microclimate conditions (e.g., temperature, air velocity, rate of ventilation, and humidity). While such systems create a controlled environment for the plants, the greenhouses need ventilation to provide fresh air.

Differently, the quantitative assessment of tidal volume (VT) (from which air ventilation, V˙E=fVT, is computed) can be a major challenge. This article reviews the most common experimental approaches to quantify VT in adult or young vertebrates of small body size. In these animals, techniques commonly used in adult humans are unsuitable. Furthermore, physiologically meaningful data necessitate techniques with minimal disturbance to the subject under investigation. During the last fifty years numerous and ingenious approaches have been developed and refined. Although none of them can be considered ideal or totally error-free, for specific tasks and/or species there is an optimal approach to measure tidal volume.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jacopo Mortola•  7  Animals, Vertebrates, Medical Physiology, PlethysmographyFLO/STRESS: an integrated software module to predict stress in electronic productsSave to LibraryDownloadby Koulis Pericleous•  5  CAD, Product Development, Temperature, Electronics IndustryMathematical Modelling of Airflow in an Aerated Soya Bean Store under Non-uniform ConditionsSave to LibraryDownloadby darci savicki•  11  Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Mathematical Modelling, Finite ElementBuilding ventilation: a pressure airflow model computer generation and elements of validationSave to LibraryDownloadby Philippe LAURET•  16  Engineering, Computer Science, Design, ModelingA CFD Analysis of Wall-Effect Building Groups in a Curved Layout: A Study in Sha Tin, Hong KongHong Kong&#39;s building density is one of the highest in the world.

A time-dependent computational model of transport through nasal models of a healthy human has been used to analyze the fields of physical stresses that may develop at the air-wall interface of the nasal mucosa. Simulations during quiet breathing revealed wall shear stresses as high as 0.3 Pa in the noselike model and 1.5 Pa in the anatomical model. These values are of the same order of those known to exist in uniform large arteries. The distribution of temperature near the nasal wall at peak inspiration is similar to that of wall shear stresses. The lowest temperatures occur in the vicinity of high stresses due to the narrow passageway in these locations. Time and spatial gradients of these stresses may have functional effects on nasal sensation of airflow and may play a role in the well-being of nasal breathing.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sara Naftali•  20  Mathematics, Stress, Biological Sciences, HumansAirflow Pattern Similarity Criteria for Ceiling Slot-Ventilated Agricultural Enclosures Under Isothermal ConditionsSave to LibraryDownloadby hsin yu•  4  Engineering, Ventilation, Airflow, SimilitudeEffect of Airflow on House Fly (Diptera: Muscidae) Distribution in Poultry HousesSave to LibraryDownloadby J.

The double-jet structure of the zonal mean zonal wind is analyzed in Southern Hemisphere observations for the two calendar months of November and April. The observed features are studied further in an idealized quasigeostrophic and a simplified general circulation model (GCM). Results suggest that capturing the bimodality of the zonal mean flow requires the parameterization of momentum and heat fluxes associated with baroclinic instability of the three-dimensional fields. The role of eddy heat fluxes in generating the observed double-jet pattern is ascertained by using an analytical Eady model with stratospheric easterlies, in which a single wave disturbance interacts with the mean flow. In this model, the dual jets are generated by the zonal mean flow correction. Sensitivity of the results to the tropospheric vertical wind shear (or, equivalently, the meridional temperature gradient in the...Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael Ghil•  9  Stratosphere, Atmospheric sciences, Dynamics, Heat FluxNextLast »Related TopicsMine VentilationFollowFollowingPassive Ventilation Strategies in BuildingsFollowFollowingMechanical PowerFollowFollowingComputational Fluid MechanicsFollowFollowingFluid MechanicsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
