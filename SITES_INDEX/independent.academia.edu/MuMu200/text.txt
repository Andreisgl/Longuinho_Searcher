Understanding user attention and behaviours in virtual environment can greatly inform the creative processes in VR. We developed an abstract VR painting and an experimentation system to study audience art encounters through eye gaze and movement tracking. The data from a user experiment with 35 participants reveal a range of user activity patterns in art exploration. Deep learning models are used to study the connections between the behavioural data and the audience’s background. The work also introduced new integrated methods to visualise user attention for content creators.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The quality of experience (QoE) over such new generation applications is dictated by the quality of service (QoS) of underlying networks. Inevitable network delay and bandwidth fluctuations affect the communications and media synchronization between connected devices. Therefore, network measurement is becoming the key to providing essential information for the QoE assurance of cross-device synchronized media. Amongst many network measurement techniques, packet probing is considered as the most effective for end-to-end evaluations. Packet probing may seem straightforward, but it requires a good understanding of the methodologies and how the results should be interpreted. This chapter provides a guide and some best practices in packet probing, accompanied with a use case where delay measurement enhances cross-device media synchronization and the QoE of an immersive media application. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The demo achieves this by describing how an artist who usually makes abstract paintings with paint and canvas in a studio, that is those existing as physical objects in the world, encounters and negotiates the process of making abstract paintings in VR using Tilt Brush software and Head-Mounted Displays (HMD). This paper also indicates potential future avenues for content creation in this emerging field and what this might mean for artists, viewers, and art institutions to experiment with effective methods of exhibiting innovative content.&lt;br&gt;Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Designing with users for domestic environmentsProceedings of the companion publication of the 17th ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work &amp; social computing,  2014ABSTRACT When developing new ICT systems and applications for domestic environments, rich qualita... more ABSTRACT When developing new ICT systems and applications for domestic environments, rich qualitative approaches improve the understanding of the user&amp;amp;#39;s integral usage of technology in their daily routines and thereby inform design. This knowledge will often be reached through in-home studies, strong relationships with the users and their involvement in the design and evaluation process. However, whilst this kind of research offers valuable context insights and brings out unexpected findings, it also presents methodological, technical and organizational challenges for the study design and its underlying cooperation processes. In particular, due to heterogeneous users in households in terms of technology affinity, individual needs, age distribution, gender, social constellations, personal role assignment, project expectations, etc. it produces particular demands to collaborate with users in the design process and thereby exposes a range of practical challenges. The full-day workshop wishes to identify these practical challenges, discuss best practice and develop a roadmap for sustainable relationships for design with users.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
