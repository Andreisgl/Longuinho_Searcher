Women, Monastic Commerce, and Coverture in Eastern India circa 1600–1800 CERequest PDFWomen, Monastic Commerce, and Coverture in Eastern India circa 1600–1800 CEModern Asian Studies, 2015Indrani ChatterjeeAbstractThis article argues that economic histories of the transition to colonial economics in the eighteenth century have overlooked the infrastructural investments that wives and widows made in networks of monastic commerce. Illustrative examples from late eighteenth-century records suggest that these networks competed with the commercial networks operated by private traders serving the English East India Company at the end of the eighteenth century. The latter prevailed. The results were the establishment of coverture and wardship laws interpellated from British common law courts into Company revenue policies, the demolition of buildings. and the relocation of the markets that were attached to many of the buildings women had sponsored. Together, these historical processes made women&#39;s commercial presence invisible to future scholars.Indrani Chatterjee hasn't uploaded this paper.Let Indrani know you want this paper to be uploaded.Ask for this paper to be uploaded.Request PDFRelated topicsRelated topicsPolitical ScienceMultidisciplinaryAboutPressBlogPeoplePapersTopicsJob Board We're Hiring! Help CenterFind new research papers in:PhysicsChemistryBiologyHealth SciencesEcologyEarth SciencesCognitive ScienceMathematicsComputer ScienceTermsPrivacyCopyrightAcademia ©2023
