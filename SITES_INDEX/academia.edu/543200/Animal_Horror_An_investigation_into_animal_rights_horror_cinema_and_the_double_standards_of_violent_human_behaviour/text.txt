The first one discusses my theoretical background in animal rights theory and ethical philosophy. I will review the concept of “speciesism” and recite a brief history of animal rights and some of the movement’s main arguments. The second part constitutes a retelling of the story of the now legendary serial killer Ed Gein, whose work inspired at least three generations of horror cinema. His story provides a paradigm example of speciesism in action and of the dystopian world where humans are hunted and killed precisely in the same manner as animals. The third part will analyze selected films from the horror genre in light of four different themes, or motifs, that I believe to resurface again and again in horror cinema. This part will be my experiment to perform what I refer to as a “vegetarian analysis” of filmic examples by referring both to the ethical background of the animal rights movement and the visual representations used to portray the relationship between the killer and his or her victims. By doing so I hope to show that human victims are often represented through animal terms (and can thus be read as symbolic for the status of animals in society) and that the storyworld of these films is one of an extremist “non-speciesist” disposition. The essay concludes with some points for further discussion.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIn:  Forceville & Urios-Aparisi (eds), Multimodal MetaphorMultimodal expressions of the 'human victim is animal' metaphor in horror films2009 • Charles ForcevilleIn this chapter, we analyze the structural metaphor human victim is animal in three modern horror films, and argue that the metaphor is characteristic of the horror genre. It is shown that its pervasive manifestations, in both monomodal and multimodal form, create what Musolff (2006) calls a “metaphor scenario.” In the concluding section we discuss some implications of our study for metaphor theory, genre, and animal rights.Download Free PDFView PDFImagining More Than Humans: A Re-Imagining of Animal ExistenceSophia DichariDownload Free PDFView PDFMust every animal studies scholar be vegan?Traci WarkentinDownload Free PDFView PDFHypatiaAmbivalence Towards Animals and The Moral Community2012 • Kelly OliverDownload Free PDFView PDFAnimal Matters: A Critical Theory of Animal Rights and Justice for All Animals (November 2021 draftTony Couture, Anthony CoutureIn this book of lectures about the politics and ethics of animal and human relations, I explore Animal Liberation by Peter Singer, Zoopolis by Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, and Animal Rights and Human Morality by Bernard Rollin.

A specifically vegan horror, as opposed to the categories of animal horror cinema and eco-horror, is proposed: a genre tendency that presents narratives that destabilize distinctions between “man” and “beast” while enacting modes of seeing that allow for the possibility of radical kinship. Finally, through a close reading of The Texas Chan Saw Massacre as a pivotal text, this paper argues that vegan horror can disturb fields of vision in ways that teach us to see others not as means to instrumental ends but instead as a multiplicity of interests and desires.Download Free PDFView PDFSerial Killing: A Philosophical Anthology, Religion, Domination and Serial Killing - Western Culture and Murder 2015 • Paul O'BrienDownload Free PDFView PDF"Surviving the Ends of Man: On the animal and/as black gaze in Jordan Peele's Get Out and Us" in Journal for Critical Animal Studies 18:2, pp. 70 - 99 (2021).M. Shadee MalaklouIn this paper, I read Derrida's “The Animal That Therefore I Am” through the theoretical framework that Hortense Spillers offers in her 1987 canonical essay “Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe: An American Grammar Book” and through the black radical tradition that her essay has galvanized, including afro-pessimistic readings of how black social life inheres in/as/through social death. I argue that Jordan Peele’s filmic imagination—in Get Out (2017) and Us (2019)—demonstrates the ways in which Spillers’ text and those who are in conversation with it put pressure on Derrida's original formulation, to think about how our concepts of the animal and of nature (not least of all, of the animal gaze) are always already raced and sexed. Specifically, I argue that Derrida's animal gaze returns Man to the ‘flesh’ of his being, or to a body beyond signification, which is none other than black ‘un/gendered’ flesh. This paper thus finds that the kind of gratuitous vulnerability that the human body experiences under the gaze of the animal makes that body available in black, which is to say: as flesh; and further, that this fleshification feminizes the human body, making it available as hole, that is to say, as gratuitously penetrable and vulnerable. The latter, I argue, also renders that human body as paradigmatically black.Download Free PDFView PDFAnimal Liberation Philosophy and Policy JournalIntroducing Critical Animal Studies2007 • Lisa  Kemmerer“Introducing Critical Animal Studies.” (Co-authors Steve Best, Anthony Nocella, Richard Kahn, and Carol Gigliotti).

The recent resurgence of economic localization exemplifies a grass roots attempt to undermine the hegemony of transnational corporations and build ecologically and economically sustainable communities. Social justice plays a key role in the guiding philosophies of these movements, and yet, while many ecocritical discourses examine the uncomfortable relationship of anthropocentricism and sustainability, some contemporary texts of the ethical food movement evidence a reluctant embrace of omnivorous eating, while simultaneously indicating a gendered, if ironic, machismo at odds with the principles of ethical eating. An analysis of the rhetoric of three popular nonfiction books that construct a similar narrative of the story of meat—Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma, Susan Bourette’s Meat, a Love Story, and Scott Gold’s The Shameless Carnivore—reveals an attempt by these authors to naturalize what is essentially an economic and lifestyle activity. Working within a vegetarian ecofeminist framework, though recognizing that multiple compelling philosophical positions exist for considering the ethics of meat eating, this paper intends to argue, not that “ethical” and “omnivorous” are contradictory terms, but rather that a moral ambivalence prevails in these texts despite these authors’ claims to the contrary. In elucidating these authors’ reactions to their own participation in “the omnivore’s dilemma” this paper pinpoints those areas where a resistance to a deeper examination of human-nonhuman relations is in operation.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
