This may include emotions related to watching their child play, supporting their child’s emotions, or simply related to daily parenting responsibilities. This research examined youth sport parent emotions through an expressive writing exercise. Twelve parents completed a total of 32 expressive writing exercises. In each exercise, parents were asked to write about their emotions as a youth sport parent. Quantitative analysis with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker et al., 2015) software and qualitative thematic analysis were employed to analyze writings. Results indicate that though parents experienced both positive and negative emotions, negative emotions were most common and salient. Thematic analysis resulted in six themes, including one theme related to positive emotions (happiness for child experience), and five themes related to negative emotions: 1) general str...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Farms and gardens everywhere but not a bite to eat?

The study takes place in SLC’s Westside, where an ample number of farms and gardens exist, yet food insecurity is a persistent issue. We partner with a small urban CSA farm operating in a USDA-designated food desert in SLC’s Westside to explore the farmers’ own questions about whom their farm is serving and the farms’ potential to contribute to food jus­tice in their community. Specifically, we examine (1) the member distribution of this urban CSA farm and (2) the underlying socio-political, eco­nomic, and geographic factors, such as inequitable access to land, housing, urban agriculture, food, and transportation, that contribute to this distribu­tion.

Supporting Public Lands in an Uncertain Age: The Wasatch Front Urban Ranger ProgramThe Journal of Park and Recreation Administration,  2019Open space and parks in urban and urban-proximate areas provide vital social, economic, and healt... more Open space and parks in urban and urban-proximate areas provide vital social, economic, and health benefits to people and communities. Specific benefits include offering opportunities for people to connect with nature, improving air quality, supporting wildlife habitat, and improving community identity and attachment. Management and maintenance of these areas can be expensive and challenging, particularly when multiple agencies oversee different components of the same resource. In the Salt Lake Valley in Utah, the Jordan River Parkway (JRP) and the Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST) provide recreation opportunities to local citizens. Multiple agencies and private land owners are charged with managing elements of each entity, resulting in inconsistent application of management plans including patrols and maintenance. Subsequently, there are aspects of these outdoor recreation spaces that need increased support, maintenance, and overall stewardship. In 2015, the Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism at the University of Utah and the National Park Service’s Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program (RTCA) created the Wasatch Front Urban Ranger Program (WFURP), a trail ambassador program featuring student volunteers from the University of Utah. Each Urban Ranger has three primary duties: public engagement, performing light maintenance, and collecting data on various aspects of trail use. During daily patrols, Rangers inform the public of land management issues and direct them to appropriate resources. They perform trail maintenance, including removing litter, cleaning dog waste, and plucking noxious weeds. They collect data about visitor use and conditions in each area, and regularly report the data to respective management agencies and/or law enforcement and health officials. Rangers recruit a student volunteer for each patrol, which helps increase engagement and enhance knowledge about public lands issues among University students. The program is funded through a number of small grants and the majority of the funding supports a graduate student to coordinate the program. Program partners include the National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Jordan River Commission (JRC), and Utah Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Support from additional local and national agencies help train the Rangers, including personnel the Salt Lake City Open Space District, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Forest Service (USFS), and local law enforcement agencies.

Unsheltered Homelessness and the Right to Metabolism: An Urban Political Ecology of Health and SustainabilityUnsheltered homelessness has increasingly become a standard expectation as part of the contempora... more Unsheltered homelessness has increasingly become a standard expectation as part of the contemporary urban landscape. This phenomenon is problematic for multiple reasons. Primarily, unsheltered homelessness is a concern because it represents a very real form of human suffering for the individuals facing homelessness. For the vast majority of people, they very desperately want a more stable and permanent housing option, and their inability to secure stable housing is often a difficult and desperate form of distress. Secondly, for urban community members not facing homelessness, unsheltered homelessness is often perceived as unsightly, and offends their sense of what a city—and a society—should be. Not only is unsheltered homelessness a visible sign of poverty and inequality, but it also disrupts normative visions of public space and public ecologies—seeing unsheltered homelessness represents, in part, a collective failure to produce a public domain that is equitable, inclusive, health...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nostalgia for an imagined past. Political ecologies of homelessness in urban public natureA familiar narrative of an objectified relationship with nonhuman nature in Western thought, and ... more A familiar narrative of an objectified relationship with nonhuman nature in Western thought, and especially in nature-society discourses in the United States, adheres closely to a notion of an environmental original sin. In this narrative, humans, by our very existence on the planet, have made nature dirty; we have made the natural world a little less natural. Humans have polluted, despoiled, extracted, extinguished, and unbalanced an otherwise ecologically harmonious system. Our environmental sins, however, are not solely confined to our material disturbances made upon nonhuman nature; our iniquities also include an objectification of nature, whereby through processes of science and superiority, we cast nature into an otherness where it is simultaneously romanticized, embraced, distanced, and harnessed for the powers and processes of capital. The material and discursive effects of humans make nature problematic in numerous ways.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In some cases, place identity contributes to higher acceptance of pollution and litter; in others, it yields negative attitudes toward crowding and environmental degradation. We tested the hypothesis that hikers who are attached to specific places are more sensitive to crowding. Using an indicators and thresholds approach, we assessed the relationship between place attachment and acceptability norms for People-At-One-Time through surveying hikers (n = 170) at the Living Room in the wildland– urban interface of Salt Lake City, Utah. Results illustrate moderate place attachment; however, no relationship between place attachment and acceptability norms for hikers was discovered. We support the proposition that the relationship between place attachment and perceptions of ecological conditions is site specific, but reject the notion that hikers attached to specific places are more sensitive to increasing use.

Using a case study approach, this research focuses on four steps in this process: initial community relationship forming, engaging in community service, transitioning to civic engagement, and developing a community-based research program. Narrative examples from student course evaluations position these community-based experiences as transformative for multiple parties. Institutional structures are presented as helpful entrees to engagement for students, while noting that community relationships provide contextualized, powerful, and meaningful relationships, supporting recommendations for emerging and existing community engagement programs.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The purpose of the study was to discover the current perceptions and experiences regarding D&amp;I of the AORE membership, which is made up primarily of outdoor education professionals and students in higher education outdoor programs. Additionally, the study looked at current D&amp;I programming in outdoor programs, what has been most and least successful, and what barriers may be in place for the creation of an inclusive environment for underrepresented populations. The survey included quantitative and qualitative responses. Findings and implications of the study will contribute to scholarship and practice around D&amp;I in the field of outdoor education.

Neoliberal Ideologies in Outdoor Adventure Education: Barriers to Social Justice and Strategies for ChangeThe Journal of Park and Recreation Administration,  2019Outdoor adventure education utilizes expeditions and experiential education to provide students w... more Outdoor adventure education utilizes expeditions and experiential education to provide students with opportunities for personal growth. However, by selling the possibility of adventure and character development, outdoor adventure education organizations unknowingly entangle the field with neoliberal ideologies. Neoliberalism is a political and economic ideology that promotes decentralization of governance, the rule of law, individual rights, and a free market. Despite its prevalence in the literature of related fields, outdoor adventure education scholars seldomly address neoliberalism, especially its effect on the field’s social justice efforts. In this paper, we examine how outdoor adventure education’s subscription to neoliberal principles, most notably individual rights and the free market, inhibits the field’s attempts to contribute to social justice. Social justice is a process that seeks to unearth the institutional and systemic roots of injustice to work toward greater social equity. Institutions working toward social justice must disentangle from elements of a dominating neoliberal system that actively perpetuates social inequities. By understanding neoliberalism’s influence, the outdoor adventure education field can become a leader for social justice by identifying the problems, and subsequent inequities, associated with neoliberalism. However, if outdoor adventure education hopes to progress beyond the oppressive structures imposed by neoliberal ideologies, we argue that the field needs to critique its current political, economic, and pedagogical practices. Outdoor adventure education organizations must embrace their role in developing citizens for a more just society by taking systematic and collective action. In an effort to make a tangible contribution, we offer potential strategies for mitigating the effects of neoliberalism and advancing social justice efforts in outdoor adventure education.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using a qualitative approach, researchers employed semi-structured interviews to explore participants‘ narratives related to adopting cycling as a means of moving through the urban landscape and as a leisure experience. Findings revealed an evolutionary process whereby participants tested out, experimented with, and sustained various practices of riding a bike in the city. Whereas participants began cycling for a variety of practical, outcome-oriented economic, health, or environmental reasons, the practice was sustained by its often unexpected experiential benefits. When compared to automobile use, urban cycling was also found to foster an enhanced connection to place and a comparitive sense of control and autonomy. Participants articulated pragmatic, physical, restorative, and emotional rationales for initiating and maintaining urban cycling practices. Analyses are developed through emotional geographies that intimately and relationally connect people and place. The study’s findings highlight the presence of a political, economic, and spatial regime of auto-centricism against which participants must struggle.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In geographic and anthropological ethnographies, positionalities are often benignly disclosed to readers under the auspices of being better able to understand specific subjective backgrounds, or the lenses, through which researchers engage with participants, places, and the overall subject matter. While positionality statements have become standard in qualitative research, there is not sustained development of the dynamic nature of positionality as way to better understand, analyze, and theorize through a research project. To contextualize this methodological argument, I draw from ethnographic engagement with a community of individuals facing homelessness who reside in tents and other rudimentary structures in a public municipal park. My own dynamic positionalities are positioned as both a lens through which I understand the “Hillside res...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Jeff Rose. 2017. Cleansing public nature: landscapes of homelessness, health, and displacement. Journal of Political Ecology 24: 11-23.by Journal of  Political Ecology and Jeff RoseThis article engages directly with a group of individuals who reside in and among the margins of ... more This article engages directly with a group of individuals who reside in and among the margins of an urban municipal park, through a 16-month critical ethnography. Facing abject poverty, threats from law enforcement, and trials of living outdoors, these 'Hillside residents' cite the local health department as a primary source of potential displacement from the place they call home. 'Health', in this context, references three interconnected features of contemporary urban homelessness: the material interactions associated with living outdoors, the litter that occasionally accumulates in the area, and human solid waste. Health also has specific discursive constructions on the Hillside, where the individuals living there are presented as unclean, particularly vis-à-vis the 'natural' unbuilt world in which they live. A logic of sanitizing the unclean means that 'cleaning' moves beyond the material imposition of humans on nature, or nature on humans. Instead, cleaning speaks to a societal problem: a need to cleanse society of unwanted social detritus, to create a healthy society. 'Cleanliness' creates an optimum, healthy urban experience to facilitate the transactions of contemporary consumer and financial capitalism, providing a new and central facet of global neoliberal restructuring, having particularly devastating effects for the lowest classes. Political ecology is leveraged to consider the roles of material and discursive cleanliness as an agent of health in the social reproduction of capitalism, creating natures and subjects that further support it. Cet article s'adresse directement à un groupe d'individus qui résident dans et dans les marges d'un parc municipal urbain, à travers une étude ethnographique de 16 mois. Face à la pauvreté abjecte, aux menaces de l'application de la loi et aux procès de vivre à l'extérieur, ces «résidents de Hillside» citent le département de santé de la commune comme l'agence principale chargée de les déplacer de leur domicile dans le parc. Dans ce contexte, la «santé» se présente sous trois aspects interreliés de l'itinérance urbaine contemporaine: les interactions matérielles associées à la vie à l'extérieur, les ordures qui s'accumulent parfois dans la région et les déchets solides humains. La santé est également représentée d'une certaine manière sur la Colline, où les individus qui y vivent sont présentés comme sales, en particulier vis-à-vis du monde «naturel» non construit dans lequel ils vivent. Une logique de désinfection de l'impur signifie que le «nettoyage» se déplace au-delà de l'imposition matérielle des humains sur la nature, ou la nature sur les humains. Au lieu de cela, le nettoyage parle d'un problème sociétal: le besoin de nettoyer la société des détritus sociaux indésirables, de créer une société saine. «Propreté» crée une expérience urbaine optimale et saine pour faciliter les transactions du capitalisme contemporain des consommateurs et du capital financier, apportant une nouvelle et centrale facette de la restructuration néolibérale mondiale, ayant des effets dévastateurs pour les classes sociales les plus bas. L'écologie politique est amenée à considérer les rôles de la propreté matérielle et discursive comme un agent de santé dans la reproduction sociale du capitalisme, en créant des natures et des sujets qui le soutiennent davantage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
