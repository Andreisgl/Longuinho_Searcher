Like many of he financial reform bill’s regulations, the complexity has proved to be greater than anticipated.
The LEI is a fundamental building block for living wills, the regulation being implemented in the UK and North America which directs large banks to develop plans for dealing with failure -- from selling off subsidiaries to raising equity and reducing or eliminating dividends. A second part of the living will process is to identify all of a bank’s subsidiaries and their legal relationships, in part to improve views of counterparty risk, and also to provide regulators with an institutional map they can use if unwinding the bank becomes necessary. The goal is to be able to restructure a bank over a weekend while avoiding the economic paralysis caused by the failure of Lehman.
In a recent Financial Times article, Brook Masters illustrated the scope of the problem. One large bank, she wrote, declared its institutional simplification  process “to be a grand success after cutting down its list of legal entities in half -- to just under 1,000.”
The second major challenge in developing useful LEIs is achieving international consensus. In developing standards, one is good, the creation of two or more or more standards is not an improvement. The goal of regulators is to develop a unique identifier for each HSBC or Citi subsidiary around the world in a consistent fashion that can be rolled up for a comprehensive view of the institution.
The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) said on 12 August that “additional work needs to be done to build international consensus on key issues...” It said the next major step in reaching consensus is a Financial Stability Board workshop on 28-29 September “to discuss how to coordinate work on LEI and move the initiative forward.” The OFR also said that enough work has been done to allow for an initial implementation in 2012 “consistent with the needs of regulatory authorities in a variety of jurisdictions.” One goal of the workshop is to develop a roadmap for next steps in development and implementation of an LEI, the OFR added.
Perhaps making a pointed reminder to European regulators that they need to get moving, the OFR press release noted that the Dodd-Frank legislation created the OFR to develop an LEI. Europeans, notoriously slow-moving and disjointed in their regulatory efforts, are under no legislative deadlines of any sort and have failed to reach any public agreement on LEI development.
The SEC and CFTC are eager to use LEIs in reporting if they can be implemented in a timely fashion, the release added.
“The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a draft technical specification for the identifier (ISO 17442), which the global coalition of financial services firms and trade associations recommended be part of the solution.  The OFR will continue to consult with these organizations and other members of the private sector to make sure that all stakeholders have adequate opportunity to inform future decisions.”
Note that the OFR promises to consult and provide everyone an opportunity to talk, but it does not pledge to wait indefinitely for them to arrive at a decision.
