To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the safety of vaccines recommended for routine immunization of children, adolescents, and adults in the United States as of 2011. Data sources. We included placebo-controlled clinical trials and cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We also included the following types of post-licensure analyses: case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed  from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vaccine manufacturers. Review methods. We reviewed the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report “Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality” and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines. For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded formulations not used in the United States. The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of evidence (SOE) as high, moderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Program. Results. A total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible. SOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. SOE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand. Moderate-strength evidence exists regarding human papillomavirus vaccine vii and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and GBS. Moderate-strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious AEs in pregnant women. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Conclusions. There is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with AEs; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the AE being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPediatricsSafety of vaccines used for routine immunization of U.S. children: a systematic review2014 • Ramya ChariConcerns about vaccine safety have led some parents to decline recommended vaccination of their children, leading to the resurgence of diseases. Reassurance of vaccine safety remains critical for population health. This study systematically reviewed the literature on the safety of routine vaccines recommended for children in the United States. Data sources included PubMed, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices statements, package inserts, existing reviews, manufacturer information packets, and the 2011 Institute of Medicine consensus report on vaccine safety. We augmented the Institute of Medicine report with more recent studies and increased the scope to include more vaccines. Only studies that used active surveillance and had a control mechanism were included. Formulations not used in the United States were excluded.

Every year an estimated two to three million deaths are prevented through vaccination against life threatening diseases that disproportionately affect children. This article attempts to give an overview of the childhood vaccines available in South Africa, and the pharmacist’s role in vaccination, with a special focus on the promotion of immunisation, safe immunisation administration, vaccine cold chain, and vaccine safety.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of ImmunologySafety and efficacy of neonatal vaccination2009 • Ofer LevyDownload Free PDFView PDFApprovals: R21/Matrix-M™ Malaria Plasmodium falciparum (77%).

Anti-Covid-19, anti-MMR, anti-Gardasil, anti-poliovirus anti-vaxxer depopulating messages are both unwelcome and repulsive to me.] BREAKING NEWS: Vaccine Catastrophe - Veterinary Vaccine (Live-Attenuated Brucella abortus strain RB51) has incorrectly been indicated as an 'approved' prophylactic therapy for human vaccination against Brucellosis or Malta Fever (also variously known as ‘Mediterranean Fever’ and ‘Undulant Fever’). This error is totally inexcusable as this strain is extremely harmful when given to humans. Immunisation Schedule for Zaire Ebola virus for work where large bull (bovine) and buffalo herds are present (put together for the rescue and care insurers). Zaire Ebola contamination management in large herds of aforesaid large ruminants proves problematic with the biohazard suit that protect from the disease vectors as the animals respond aggressively to the human protective gear leading to panicking animals attacks, attempts of human butchery and animal rummage where people and properties can suddenly become threatened, as a health protection gives rise to animal threat by the rummaging animals trampling and horn attacking people in biohazard gear. The ring fencing experimental Zaire Ebola vaccines were not available at the time of this original plan instigated where the China-based organisation prepared an emergency quantitative easing (QE) cash programme, ‘helicopter drops of money’ as a mitigation strategy to persuade the food producers and food vendors to continue serving the general public against an infection risk during a major ebola epidemic - to prevent food industry's distribution and production collapses as the personnel might otherwise decide to stop working and to stay home so as to avoid infecting themselves by the dangerous pathogen (in this case a Zaire Ebola Virus). The above can lead to severe food shortages and ultimately potential starvation occurrence unless that epidemic had not subsided soon enough to prevent this secondary consequence from emerging. Because of similarity of early Zaire Ebola symptoms to other infectious illnesses at the early stages, the work undertaken in remote areas, the lead time in medical evacuations in case of illnesses, and the immense cost of privately-funded flying hospital dispatch to carry out a rescue operation, an exhaustive mutual exclusion prophylactic scheme was initiated to minimise unnecessary calls for such a flying hospital facility (remote medical service) from overseas. Reported BEXSERO to GlaxoSmithKline on an unlisted side effect of stealthy temperature rise (see 19/03/2020 version, page 7) to +42.3C / +108.1F with weakening of normal body temperature control like sweating and relative lack of sense of highly elevated body temperature able to cause heat stroke and other related damage to body. The immunisation schedule incorporates emergency authorisation Covid-19 immunisations and coronavirus vaccines that shortly complete their approval. Some of the Covid-19 immunisations likely vanish from marketplace as soon as the pandemic is over whereas some other vaccine designs may seek themselves second life as generic coronavirus immunisations. (The research field of coronaviruses is rapidly changing with these overlooked viruses also causing many common colds is brought into spotlight.) Almost all Covid-19 products have not been tested for concomitant use with many other immunisation products and therefore a reasonable space should be allowed between immunisations to avoid adverse effect risks. Because of this one ought to consider whether at current pandemic situation some immunisation products of lesser importance should be taken and whether it is better to defer them until situation clears (considering the ongoing infections with Covid-19 variants and especially in some remote regions where sequencing of the variants is very sparse as the protection to Covid-19 is very important). Because of above reason, this schedule is not currently geared for rapid deployment in tropics as too many uncertainties lie within which good protection against Covid-19 must prevail.

During the conference the importance of including conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and anti-rabies vaccines in routine immunization was stressed. Also, the need for giving a second dose of measles mumps rubella vaccine at school entry; and the need for a two-dose varicella vaccine regimen (first dose at 12–15 months of age and a second dose at age 4–6 years) was elucidated. Information related to vaccines which have become available in India in recent years, namely, inactivated poliovirus vaccine; diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine; conjugate pneumococcal vaccine; rotavirus vaccines; H1N1 vaccines; live attenuated hepatitis A virus vaccine; oral cholera vaccine; tetanus, reduced-dose diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine; and human papillomavirus vaccines were discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFVaccineOverview of the Clinical Consult Case Review of adverse events following immunization: Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) network 2004–20092011 • Neal HalseyDownload Free PDFView PDFI D S A G U I D E L I N E S 2013 IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline for Vaccination of the Immunocompromised Host Vaccination of Immunocompromised Host @BULLET CID @BULLET 1 Clinical Infectious Diseases Advance Access published Decembersami aliDownload Free PDFView PDFIndian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) Recommended Immunization Schedule for Children Aged 0 through 18 years – India, 2014 and Updates on ImmunizationAnindita GoswamiDownload Free PDFView PDFGuidelines on Vaccinations in Paediatric Haematology andKaïs Sofiane Bouk'hilDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
