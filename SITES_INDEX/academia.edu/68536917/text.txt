By employing census data for early-nineteenth-century colonial Sierra Leone, the present study offers a valuable snapshot of a colony characterized by a heterogenous population of indigenous and migratory origin. The study shows that an association between colonial group categorization and socioeconomic status existed despite the colony being of very recent foundation implying a hierarchical structure of the society. Although Europeans and "mulattoes" occupied most high-status positions, as common in the colonies, indigenous immigrants were also represented in high socioeconomic strata thanks to the opportunities stemming from long-and short-distance trading. However, later arrivals, especially liberated slaves, belonged within the lowest socioeconomic strata of the society and worked as farmers or unskilled labor, suggesting that the time component may also have influence socioeconomic opportunities.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe History of the Family Marriage patterns in a black Utopia: Evidence from early nineteenth-century colonial Sierra Leone Marriage patterns in a black Utopia: Evidence from early nineteenth-century colonial Sierra Leone2019 • Stefania GalliThe colony of Sierra Leone was characterized by an unusually heterogeneous population made up of immigrants. The diverse population and the dynamics that led to its creation constitute a valuable case study for mating theories. This article examines the determinants of marriage patterns in early nineteenth-century urban Sierra Leone relying on census data. The degree to which marriage-market constraints and preferences influenced marriage patterns is studied. The results of this study suggest that marriage-market constraints contributed to explaining marriage patterns. However, even in a newly founded and multicultural context as that of urban Sierra Leone, social homogamy based on ascribed characteristics was the most prevalent marriage arrangement, in spite of the disruption of kin relations caused by slavery and migration.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Review of Economic HistoryColonialism and rural inequality in Sierra Leone: an egalitarian experiment2019 • Stefania GalliWe analyze the level of inequality in rural Sierra Leone in the early colonial period. Previous research has suggested that the colony was established under highly egalitarian ideals. We examine whether these ideals also are reflected in the real distribution of wealth in the colony. We employ a newly assembled dataset extracted from census data in the colony in 1831. The results show that rural Sierra Leone exhibited one of the most equal distributions of wealth so far estimated for any preindustrial rural society.Download Free PDFView PDFA Black Utopia? Social Stratification in Nineteenth-century Colonial Sierra LeoneStefania GalliIn the present dissertation, social stratification in colonial Sierra Leone is discussed, with the aim of providing novel evidence on the association between ideals, institutions and inequality. The case study of Sierra Leone is valuable for it allows to examine social stratification in an alleged egalitarian context. The dissertation consists of an introductory chapter and four research essays. The essays examine four aspects that contribute to social stratification. The former two essays delve into the social aspects of social stratification, namely socio-economic status and marriage patterns, whereas the latter two examine social stratification from an economic perspective. The intention is to employ the case study of Sierra Leone to portray a picture of European colonialism in Africa that differs from that often portrayed in the literature. The first essay studies the association between ethnic belonging and socio-economic status in early days colonial Sierra Leone. The findings suggest that, in spite of the egalitarian ideals on which it had been allegedly founded, a certain degree of ethnic discrimination characterized the socio-economic structure of the colony. Ethnic discrimination did not, however, translate into a strict occupational segregation for individuals from most ethnic groups could be found across the whole socio-economic spectrum. The second essay delves into the association between ethnic belonging and marriage patterns. The study shows that, irrespective of egalitarian ideals and ethnic heterogeneity, endogamy was the most prevalent marriage arrangement in colonial Sierra Leone. This finding implies the existence of an association between ethnic belonging and marriage patterns, while providing circumstantial evidence on the presence of an ethnic social divide in the colony. Furthermore, the essay shows that exogamy occurred within ethnic groups’ clusters, a finding that corroborates the hypothesis of the existence of a vertical ethnic hierarchy in colonial Sierra Leone. The third essay examines quantitatively the claim that egalitarian ideals impacted on inequality levels by studying wealth inequality in rural colonial Sierra Leone. The results show that between households’ distribution of resources was fairly egalitarian in global comparison. Wealth inequality estimates for Sierra Leone are on par with those estimated for other rural settler colonies in North America in their early days of existence. The results provide supportive evidence to the hypothesis that ideals can impact on the institutions driving inequality, by shaping the rules of allocation of resources towards egalitarianism. The fourth essay examines the evolution of land distribution in colonial Sierra Leone over the course of the first forty years of the colony’s existence. The results show that although egalitarian principles regulated land distribution, land inequality increased over the period studied. The essay argues that the shift in the type of egalitarianism underlying land distribution was the major responsible for increasing inequality as recorded for colonial Sierra Leone. The results of this dissertation suggest that Sierra Leone was a fairly equal colony under most perspectives, and that institutions were influenced by egalitarian ideals, although not all to the same extent. The present dissertation ultimately provides evidence supporting the existence of an association between ideals, institutions and social stratification in a colonial context.Download Free PDFView PDFHistory of Science“For the services of shipwrights, coopers, and grumettas”: Freetown’s ship repair cluster in nineteenth-century Sierra LeoneBronwen EverillThis article looks at the development of Sierra Leone’s ship repair cluster, particularly focusing on the period 1780 to 1860. It argues that several factors contributed to the colony’s ability to develop a ship repair cluster. The first was the local environment, which provided both a safe harbor for ships and boats, and local materials that could be used on European and American ships. Secondly, the port’s increasing commercial role and its unique position as the site of the Courts of Mixed Commission for the adjudication of condemned slaving ships after the abolition of the slave trade gave ship’s carpenters access to a wide and varied range of both customers and supplies. Finally, these material effects were enhanced by the cluster’s effect on knowledge spillover and on-the-spot tacit knowledge creation as disruptions in the supply chain, competition with slave traders, and other local circumstances fostered innovation in Freetown’s repair cluster.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Economic History ReviewLand distribution and inequality in a black settler colony: the case of Sierra Leone, 1792-18312020 • Stefania GalliLand distribution is considered to be one of the main contributors to inequality in pre-industrial societies. This article contributes to the debate on the origins of economic inequality in pre-industrial African societies by studying land inequality at a particularly early stage of African economic history. The research examines land distribution and inequality in land ownership among settlers in the Colony of Sierra Leone for three benchmark years over the first 40 years of its existence. The findings show that land inequality was low at the founding of the Colony but increased substantially over time. We suggest that this increase was enabled by a shift in the type of egalitarianism pursued by the colonial authorities, which was reflected in a change in the redistributive policy applied, which allowed later settlers to appropriate land more freely than had been previously possible.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of African History(2019) AFRICAN VOICES FROM THE CONGO COAST: LANGUAGES AND THE POLITICS OF IDENTIFICATION IN THE SLAVE SHIP JOVEM MARIA2019 • Marcos Abreu Leitão de AlmeidaDownload Free PDFView PDFTransactions of the Historical Society of Ghana (New Series), Number 16, 2014 The Brothers Easmon: The Emergence of a Nova Scotian Medical Dynasty in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.pdf2014 • Nigel  Browne-DaviesProfessional dynasties emerged in British West Africa in the mid to late nineteenth century. The Easmon family of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast (Ghana) is perhaps the most notable West African family in the medical field. The family descended from Nova Scotian settlers, free and formerly enslaved African Americans who had escaped to the British lines during the American Revolutionary War and had come to Sierra Leone in 1792. The Easmon family produced two medical doctors in the nineteenth century, Dr John Farrell Easmon and his half-brother Dr Albert Whiggs Easmon, who initially practiced together in the Gold Coast. Albert Whiggs Easmon later moved to Sierra Leone, where he was a medical doctor for nearly twenty years. This article focuses on the activities of the Easmon brothers and their social relations. The process through which the brothers were able to qualify as medical practitioners is illustrative of the upward mobility of certain African families, a process initiated by Africans, and without the assistance or interference of imperial or colonial authorities. The Easmon family was one of a small number of Settler families to transition from the decaying Settler 'aristocracy' and to secure a place within the new Creole elite.Download Free PDFView PDFFreedom in White and Black, A Lost Story of the Illegal Slave Trade and its Global LegacyAhmed BadranDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Sierra Leone Studies, Volume Six, Edition One.Jewish Merchants in Sierra Leone, 1831-1934.pdf2017 • Nigel  Browne-DaviesAn article examining the history of Jewish merchants in Sierra Leone and highlighting the unique historical experience of Sierra Leonean individuals and families of Jewish descent in Sierra Leone.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Sierra Leone Studies, Volume IV, Edition INotable Sierra Leonean Figures of the Past: A Biographical Sketch of William Charles De Graft Rosenior, 1862-1929Nigel  Browne-DaviesA biographical sketch of a nineteenth and early twentieth century artisan who was a prominent member of the local Freetown elite.
