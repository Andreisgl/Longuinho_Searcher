Author Biography
James Edward Corbly
James E. Corbly has been studying freeware and open source software for over a decade.  He successfully employed them while serving as the Director of the Scheele Memorial Library at Concordia College - New York (Bronxville, New York) and the Director of Library Services at the Memorial Library of Kansas Wesleyan University (Salina, Kansas).  Since 2010, an increasing number of information professionals from several disciplines have become aware of Mr. Corbly’s work with these software packages and his reputation has grown accordingly.  Over the last two years alone, he has delivered three major addresses on these types of software: first, at Campus Technology 2012 (Boston, MA - July 16, 2012); secondly, at the Kansas Library Association-College and University Libraries Section Fall Conference (Dodge City, KS - October 5, 2012); and finally, a return engagement to Campus Technology 2013 (Boston, MA - July 30, 2013).  Mr. Corbly makes his home in Austin, Minnesota.
