One of the mitigating techniques in minimizing risk is through insurance and Nigeria being a Muslim-majority country, takaful is the alternative to conventional insurance. Despite their fragile nature and their exposure to various threats, MSMEs are the least segment utilizing insurance cover. Based on the reports from the country's financial regulators it shows that majority of these businesses do not participate in any insurance scheme. Furthermore, there are less studies that examined takaful adoption by MSMEs, especially in Nigeria. These past studies are also inconclusive on the significant factors influencing adoption especially from the behavioral perspective. This paper aims to propose a conceptual framework to study the factors that influence general takaful adoption among MSMEs ownermanagers' in NorthWest Nigeria. An integrated framework based on the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and the Use of Technology (UTAUT) was developed to examine what motivates MSMEs owner-managers to adopt general takaful. Furthermore, the proposed model incorporates MSME owner-manager's personal and demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, prior loss experience and religiosity) as potential moderators in the study to enhance the predictive power of the model. Validating the conceptual framework of this research will be useful to takaful operators, financial regulators and policy makers in Nigeria to devise appropriate strategies that will increase the adoption rate of general takaful scheme among MSMEs.Download Free PDFView PDFSakarya University Journal of Computer and Information SciencesRain Rate and Rain Attenuation Prediction For Satellite Communication in Ku Band Beacon Over TURKSAT Golbasıyasin burakDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Contemporary Islamic StudiesAl-Rahnu System as an Alternative to Conventional Pawnbroking for Muslim Community in Malaysia: An Analysis Study of Legal Framework and Jurisdiction on The Governance of al-Rahnu2022 • Muhamad Zuhaili SaimanSince the introduction of al-Rahnu as an alternative to conventional pawnbroking for Muslims in Malaysia in 1992, there are many organizations providing this service, and al-Rahnu from year to year is growing and expanding.
