It is intended to support and use technologies in the field of contactless shopping/payments. The program is developed by using python programming language with the help of additional libraries such as OpenCV. In order to use this program, the person needs to be in front of a computer webcam. The webcam will be used to recognize the shape and the pattern of the presenters’ hands. The program will display results of recognized hand patterns of gestures on a live video frame stream. The result of this project is a program that can be used for improve the user experience of contactless systems and make safer transactions in a time of global pandemic of 2020, where social distancing is one of the main things to consider.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
