Its application enabled measurement of DTG pharmacokinetics in breastfeeding mothers and their infants. Results/methodology: Sample extraction was by liquid–liquid extraction using tert-butyl methy-ether, with DTG–d5 as an internal standard. DTG was eluted on a reverse phase C18 Waters XBridge (3.5 μm: 2.1 × 50 mm) column using a gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in deionised water or methanol. The assay was validated over a calibration range of 10–4000 ng/ml. Conclusion: Stability, inter and intra-assay variability were acceptable according to FDA and EMA bioanalytical method guidelines. The assay is robust, accurate, precise and can be reliably applied for analysis of clinical samples in trials from low resource settings.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Gini•  4  Chromatography, Bioanalysis, Medicine, DolutegravirA Comparison of the Absorption of a Series of Ethoxylates through Rat Skin In VitroSave to LibraryDownloadby Peter Blain•  5  Chemistry, Chromatography, In Vitro Toxicology, ElsevierRemoval of Endotoxin from Protein in Pharmaceutical ProcessesBacterial endotoxin is the lipopolysaccharide component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, together with other cellular material that combines to form an endotoxin complex.

Endotoxin is pyrogenic and it presents a risk to patients who are administered intravenous and intramuscular preparations.1Thus bacterial endotoxins pose a risk to many pharmaceutical processes and, where not controlled, to the finished products. There are different methods for endotoxin removal. These include depyrogenation,2 such as dry-heat processes applied to glassware, and rinsing,3 as might be applied to closures. These areas receive reasonable coverage within the pharmaceutical sector. Areas that are actively discussed within biotechnology fields but which receive less attention in the wider pharmaceutical context are steps to remove endotoxin bound to protein. This article considers some of the biotechnological applications for endotoxin removal.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tim Sandle•  8  Microbiology, Pharmacy, Water, Water qualitySample preparation for chromatography bookSave to LibraryDownloadby Dini  Nurhaliza•  3  Pharmacy, Chromatography, Pharmaceutical TechnologyAnalysis of Agarwood oil (Aquilaria Malaccensis) based on GC-MS dataSave to LibraryDownloadby Mohd Taib•  15  Signal Processing, Traditional Medicine, Chromatography, Principal Component AnalysisLC-UV Assay Method and UPLC/Q-TOF-MS Characterisation of Saponins from Ilex Paraguariensis A.

Due to its composition, the management of pulp and paper mill sludge presents an economic burden for wastewater treatment plants. In South Africa, paper mill sludge is mainly incinerated, landfilled or used for land application. These practices cause environmental and health hazards. In this study, a process of stabilization of paper mill sludge through hydrothermal carbonization is proposed. The quality of biochar produced and energy yield will depend on the elemental composition, calorific value and ash content of the sludge. Results revealed samples are composed of flat fibrous cellulosic morphology, with high volatile matter and little fixed carbon percentage. The main decomposition occurred between 220-400 °C. Sludge from primary clarifier contains the highest ash percentage, hence it was found to be unsuitable for energy recovery through hydroth...Save to LibraryDownloadby Englatina Assis•  8  Chromatography, Fatty acids, Candy, Theoretical ModelsSeparation and heat stability of the corticosteroid-induced and hepatic alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes in canine plasmaSave to LibraryDownloadby E.

The monograph for... moreMeasurement of cardiac perfusion via agents such as 99mTc-sestamibi (Cardiolite; DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical Co., Inc.) is widely used in clinical nuclear medicine for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The monograph for 99mTc-sestamibi recommends at least 90% radiochemical purity (RCP) for clinical use. Various factors may influence the RCP of certain reagent kits. Some of these include the amount of activity added to the reagent kit, the generator ingrowth time, the generator manufacturer, the age of the eluate, and the age of the formulated kit. A D-optimal design with a 20-experiment run was devised to study the effects of these variables either alone or in combination on the RCP of 99mTc-sestamibi. The RCP was assessed by Baker-Flex thin-layer and high-performance liquid chromatographic methods, immediately and 6 h after reconstitution of the 99mTc-sestamibi.

A new procedure to recover the major FFA from plasma for concentration and isotopic enrichment measurements is described and validated. The procedure involves extraction of plasma lipids with hexane, methylation with iodomethane (CH(3)I) to form fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), and subsequent purification of FAME by solid phase extraction (SPE) chromatography. The new method was compared with a traditional method using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to recover plasma FFA, with subsequent methylation by BF(3)/methanol. The TLC method was found to be less reliable than the new CH(3)I method because of contamination with extraneous fatty acids, chemical fractionation of FFA species, and incomplete recovery of FFA associated with TLC. In contrast, the CH(3)I/SPE method was free of contamination, did not exhibit chemical fractionation, and had higher recovery.

The ASC yields, on a dry weight basis, were 63.1 and 58.7%, respectively for young and adult fish skins. SDS-PAGE showed that the collagens contained two alpha components (α1 and α2). ASC from Nile perch was found to contain more imino acids (19.3 and 20.0%, respectively, for young and adult fish) than most fish species. The denaturation temperature for the collagens from the skins of young and adult Nile perch was determined to be 36 °C, which is also higher than that for most other fish species. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a higher degree of molecular order in ASC from adult than from young Nile perch. The results indicate that age-related changes in Nile perch skin collagen are not very pronounced, probably because there is minimal development of mature cross-links.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Muyonga•  14  Chromatography, Food Chemistry, Multidisciplinary, TemperatureFunctionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica in ion chromatography of alkali, alkaline earths, ammonium and transition metal ionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Barbara Onida•  13  Engineering, Technology, Chromatography, Ion ChromatographyPressure drop characteristics of poly(high internal phase emulsion) monolithsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ita Junkar•  13  Engineering, Technology, Chromatography, Scanning Electron MicroscopyReversed-phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography of drugs and related compounds using underivatized silica as the stationary phaseSave to LibraryDownloadby Jacques Crommen•  17  Engineering, Technology, Chromatography, HistamineJohnson (2019) Molasses Desugarization in the US Beet Sugar Industry - Recent UpdateMolasses desugarization (MDS) is an example of a large-scale chromatographic separation that has been in use in the United States beet sugar industry for almost 40 years.

The process has proven commercially viable under current market conditions, energy and environmental cost. As a result, most US sugar beet companies have been operating one or more MDS installations. Because of the variation in efficiencies and configuration of existing installations, it is sometimes difficult to evaluate the desired separation targets and identify the areas of operational improvement. Over the last few years, achievable separation targets have improved significantly, and new equipment configurations have been developed. Initially, a calculated sugar recovery (“sugar in the bag vs sugar in molasses”) of 75-78 % was considered acceptable. In modern systems, up to 88 % efficiency is commercially achievable. However, almost no guidance is available in the recent literature about how to achieve these results for various process configurations. The current presentation will attempt to provide these answers as well as assist in a general understanding of large-scale chromatographic technologies, existing types of equipment and factors that influence separation efficiencies. For many years, MDS systems were installed as stand-alone operations that could easily be “plugged” into conventional sugar factories. As chromatographic extract has notably different characteristics compared to thick juice, special consideration will be given to the way the extract processing is integrated in factories.Save to LibraryDownloadby Steve Peacock•  2  Chromatography, Sugar TechnologyInhibitory effect of ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)-inflorescence extract on the germination of Amaranthus hypochondriacus L. and growth of two soil algaeSave to LibraryDownloadby Zoltán Herpai•  11  Chromatography, Multidisciplinary, Soil Microbiology, GerminationChromatographic quantification of seven pesticide residues in vegetable: univariate and multiway calibration comparisonPlease cite this article as: Emanuella Santos Sousa , Mateus P.

In this chapter, megaporous cryogels were synthesized having metal-ion affinity functionality, and their adsorptive properties were investigated. These cryogels have large pore sizes ranging from 10 to 100 μm with corresponding porosities between 80 and 90 %. The synthesized IMAC-cryogel had a total ligand density of 770 μmol/g. Twelve milligram of a His 6-tagged protein (NAD (P)H-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one-reductase) can be purified from a crude cell extract per gram of IMAC-cryogels. The protein binding capacity is increased with higher degrees of grafting, although a slight decrease in column efficiency may result.

They contain a wide range of compounds with low molecular mass, including monomeric and oligomeric residues of polymerization, solvent-related chemicals residues, and various additives. Plastic products made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) are currently employed as food containers. This study therefore sought to identify volatile organic compounds released by EPS from food packages and utensils used in Cartagena, Colombia. EPS-based plates, food and soup containers were subjected to various temperatures and released chemicals captured by solid phase microextraction, followed by on-column thermal desorption and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Revista Ambiente & Água•  3  Chromatography, Mass Spectrometry, Solid Phase MicroextractionDevelopment of LC method for the simultaneous determination of antidepressant drug combination melitracen hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride in …Save to LibraryDownloadby Dimal shah•  2  Chemistry, ChromatographyOn the relationship between radial structure heterogeneities and efficiency of chromatographic columnsTransverse structural column heterogeneities Structure–performance relationship Aris general dispersion theory Asymptotic and pre-asymptotic dispersion regimes Sub-2 m particles a b s t r a c t The general dispersion theory of Aris is... moreTransverse structural column heterogeneities Structure–performance relationship Aris general dispersion theory Asymptotic and pre-asymptotic dispersion regimes Sub-2 m particles a b s t r a c t The general dispersion theory of Aris is applied to predict the virtual asymptotic dispersion behavior of packed columns. The derived model is also used to estimate the actual pre-asymptotic dispersion behavior of modern 2.1 mm × 50 mm columns packed with sub-2 m fully porous particles (FPPs) during the transient dispersion regime. The model accounts for the actual radial distribution of the flow velocity across the column diameter. From the wall to the center of the column, focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) experiments were recently performed to reveal the existence of a thin (0.15d p wide, d p is the average particle diameter) hydrodynamic boundary layer (THBL), a thin (3d p wide) and loose orderly packed layer (TLOPL), a 60d p wide and dense randomly packed layer (WDRPL), and a large (460d p) randomly packed bulk central region [1]. The theoretical calculations of the actual pre-asymptotic reduced van Deemter curves (2.1 mm × 50 mm column, sub-2 m BEH-C 18 FPPs, n-hexanophenone analyte, acetonitrile/water eluent, 80/20, v/v, flow rate from 0.05 to 0.35 mL/min) confirm that the impact of the sole THBL on column dispersion can be neglected. In contrast, the contribution of the TLOPL to the reduced plate height (RPH) is about 0.2 h unit at optimum reduced velocity. Most remarkably, the negative impact of the TLOPL on column performance may be fully compensated by the presence of the adjacent WDRPL if the depth of the velocity well were to be 5% of the bulk velocity. In actual 2.1 mm × 50 mm columns packed with sub-2 m FPPs, this velocity depth is as large as 25% of the bulk velocity causing a significant RPH deviation of 0.7 h unit from the RPH of the bulk packing free from wall effects. Maximum column performance is expected for a reduction of WDRPL density. This suggests optimizing the packing process by finding the proper balance between the stress gradient across the WDRPL (responsible for the deep velocity well) and the friction forces between the packed particles (responsible for the rearrangement of the particles during bed consolidation). Past and recently reported RPH data support the theoretical insights: the stress gradient/particle friction balance in the WDRPL is better realized when packing superficially porous particles (SPPs) rather than FPPs in 2.1–4.6 mm i.d. columns (the RPH deviation is reduced to 0.4 h unit) or sub-2 m particles in 100 cm × 75 m i.d. capillaries combining high slurry concentrations and sonication (the RPH deviation is reduced to only 0.15 h unit).Save to LibraryDownloadby Fabrice G E Gritti•  5  Chromatography, Dispersion, High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Chromatographic efficiencyDetermination of pesticides in water by cone-shaped membrane protected liquid phase microextraction prior to micro-liquid chromatographyA new sample pre-treatment technique termed cone-shaped membrane liquid phase microextraction (CSM-LPME) was developed and combined with micro-liquid chromatography (micro-LC) for the determination of selected pesticides in water samples.... moreA new sample pre-treatment technique termed cone-shaped membrane liquid phase microextraction (CSM-LPME) was developed and combined with micro-liquid chromatography (micro-LC) for the determination of selected pesticides in water samples. Four pesticides (hexaconazole, procymidone, quinalphos and vinclozolin) were considered as target analytes. Several important extraction parameters such as types of extraction solvent, agitation rate, pH value, total exposure time and effect of salt and humic acids were optimized. Enrichment factors of >50 folds were easily achieved within 20 min of extraction. The analytical data demonstrated relative standard deviations for the reproducibility of the optimized CSM-LPME method ranging from 6.3 to 7.5%. The correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were at least 0.9995 across a concentration range of 2–100 μg/L. The detection limits for all the analytes were found to be in the range of 1.1–1.9 μg/L.Save to LibraryDownloadby WAN AINI WAN IBRAHIM•  16  Engineering, Technology, Chromatography, UncertaintyNextLast »Related TopicsMass SpectrometryFollowFollowingHPLCFollowFollowingAnalytical ChemistryFollowFollowingNatural Products ChemistryFollowFollowingSpectroscopyFollowFollowingChemistryFollowFollowingNMR SpectroscopyFollowFollowingAnalytical Method DevelopmentFollowFollowingChemometricsFollowFollowingHigh Performance Liquid ChromatographyFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
