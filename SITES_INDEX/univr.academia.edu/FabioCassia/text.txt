Since quality management researchers also increasingly using PLS-SEM, this growing interest calls for guidance. Design/methodology/approachBased on established guidelines for applying PLS-SEM and evaluating the results, this research reviews 107 articles applying the method and published in eight leading quality management journals. FindingsThe use of PLS-SEM in quality management often only draws on limited information and analysis results. The discipline would benefit from the method's more comprehensive use by following established guidelines. Specifically, the use of predictive model assessment and more advanced PLS-SEM analyses harbors the potential to provide more detailed findings and conclusions when applying the method. Research limitations/implicationsThis research provides first insights into PLS-SEM's use in quality management. Future research should identify the key areas and the core quality management models that best support the method's capabilities and researchers' goals. Practical implicationsThe results of this analysis guide researchers who use the PLS-SEM method for their quality management studies. Originality/valueThis is the first article to systematically review the use of PLS-SEM in the quality management discipline.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Effects of Ethnocentrism on International Hospitality Brands: A Cross-Country Study of StarbucksJournal of Hospitality & Tourism Research,  2022Ethnocentrism is anticipated to have a growing impact on international hospitality brands, but cu... more Ethnocentrism is anticipated to have a growing impact on international hospitality brands, but current understandings of its effects is limited. Using the traditional, unidimensional conceptualization of ethnocentrism, prior hospitality research concluded that ethnocentrism drives people to favor domestic over foreign brands. This study proposes a model wherein ethnocentrism’s emotional and cognitive dimensions influence perceptions of international brands through separate direct and indirect mechanisms, which vary between the brand’s domestic and foreign markets. The model was assessed using multigroup analysis of perceptions of Starbucks in two samples of 186 and 235 consumers from the United States and Italy, respectively. The findings highlight that ethnocentrism’s emotional and cognitive dimensions have positive and negative effects, respectively, on brand image in the domestic market (United States) and vice versa in a foreign market (Italy). In the foreign market, ethnocentrism influences brand image only indirectly. The study concludes with implications for brand managers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Data-driven use of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) platforms and export performance: The mediating role of foreign market knowledge acquisitionSinergie Italian Journal of Management,  2022https://ojs.sijm.it/index.php/sinergie/article/view/1156

Specifically, many small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) choose to rely on digital e-commerce platforms (or marketplaces) that provide them with inexpensive and rapid access to a large base of potential foreign customers. The few studies available on this topic have implicitly assumed that SMEs embrace this channel with the sole intent of increasing export sales (i.e., to exploit existing opportunities). This study argues that SMEs can also implement a data-driven approach that uses cross-border e-commerce platforms as inexpensive tools to acquire foreign market knowledge by leveraging the large volume of data available on these digital platforms. Purpose of the paper: This work proposes and tests a model in which a firm's exploration-driven use of cross-border e-commerce platforms enhances foreign market knowledge acquisition, which improves both the overall export performance of the firm and the exploitation of foreign opportunities through e-commerce. Methodology: Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to estimate the proposed model. Data for analysis were collected from a sample of 110 Italian exporters belonging to the food and beverage industry. Results: The findings highlighted that the exploration-driven use of cross-border e-commerce platforms had a positive relationship with the export performance of firms. The results also implied that this effect was fully mediated by the level of foreign market knowledge (about customers, competitors, market conditions, business laws and regulations) acquired through the use of cross-border e-commerce platforms. Research limitations: Only exporters belonging to a specific industry were considered in the empirical analysis. Thus, caution is recommended when generalizing these results. Practical implications: The findings encourage export managers to embrace cross-border e-commerce platforms for both sales and market research purposes by deploying a data-driven approach to cross-border e-commerce platforms. Originality of the study: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study providing empirical evidence about the effects of using a data-driven approach to cross-border e-commerce platforms. #CBECSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The increasing importance of online reviews in hospitality and tourism has been widely assessed. A specific stream of research has addressed the motivations to write online reviews, highlighting the effects of both altruistic and egoistic motivations. In fact, some guests write reviews mainly for altruistic reasons such as the desire to help others, not only other customers but also the firms (hotels and restaurants in particular). Other guests post reviews mainly for egoistic motives such as to relive the experience but also to wreak revenge on hotels/restaurants. However, up to now the effects of these different motivations on online reviews writing behaviour have not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to fill this gap by examining the effects of altruistic and egoistic motivations on the frequency of writing online reviews. Methodology.

The aim of the research is to examine the perceived image of Verona, both as a tourist destination and as a city to live in. City image can be defined as a set of believes, ideas and impressions people hold regarding a city, and can strongly affect residents’ and tourists’ attitudes and behaviors toward the city: it can increase tourists’ loyalty and satisfaction, but it also plays a key role in creating residents’ support for further tourism development. The image of a city depends much on the quality of the services it provides, both public services and tourism facilities, and perceptions are expected to vary between residents and tourists. Methodology. The research was conducted through questionnaires to 380 residents and 167 tourists of Verona. Questionnaires were based on a multi-item scale addressing six dimensions of the city image, four of them being shared by both tourists and residents, thus allowing for a direct comparison. Findings.

The influence of PSA's likeability on children’s intentions to eat healthy food (OPEN ACCESS)International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing,  2021OPEN ACCESS: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12208-021-00287-2.pdf
This paper sug... more OPEN ACCESS: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12208-021-00287-2.pdfThis paper suggests a model that considers the effects of the children’s attitude toward Public Service Announcements—PSAs (measured through the likeability of PSAs) on their behavioural intention to eat fruits and vegetables. The suggested model was tested through an empirical analysis conducted with children aged 8 to 11 and the data were analysed through partial least squares – structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) multigroup analysis. The findings indicate that the positive emotions PSAs generate and PSA credibility mediate the effects of the children’s perceived likeability of PSAs on their behavioural intention to eat fruits and vegetables. Overall, understanding the connections between PSA likeability, positive emotions, PSA credibility and behavioural intentions can facilitate the development of further social advertisements aimed at children covering healthy eating. Therefore, the findings of this study are relevant for non-profit organizations, government institutions and advertisers interested in creating effective social messages aimed at children.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Fairness and behavioral intentions in discrete B2B transactions: a study of small business firms (OPEN ACCESS)Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,  2021OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBIM-12-2019-0538/full/pdf

The purpose of this paper is to explain buyers’ intention to renew a contract after discrete and time-delimited transactions by suggesting a model that complements social exchange theory with theories of fairness. In detail, this study aims to determine how evaluations of economic and social outcomes are complemented by both procedural fairness and distributive fairness.Design/methodology/approachThe hypotheses are tested in the social couponing industry with a survey of a sample of 199 firms purchasing advertising services from daily deal websites. Data are analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM).FindingsThe findings reveal direct effects of procedural fairness on social outcomes (satisfaction) and distributive fairness on the intention to renew a contract, negative moderating effect of procedural fairness on the relationship between economic outcomes (campaign effectiveness) and social outcomes (satisfaction).Research limitations/implicationsIn discrete, time-delimited transactions, high levels of procedural fairness may partially compensate for low levels of economic outcomes and prevent a reduction in social outcomes. Hence, when economic outcomes are influenced largely by external, uncontrollable conditions, the buyer seems to appreciate the supplier’s efforts to behave fairly.Practical implicationsSocial outcomes matter even in discrete transactions and considerations of fairness should be integrated in the management of discrete transactions. Sharing economic outcomes fairly is not sufficient to secure the buyer’s intention to renew the contract.Originality/valueThis study proposes and tests a model that complements social exchange theory with theories of fairness and explains contract renewal in discrete, time-delimited transactions, encompassing both economic outcomes and social outcomes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As the tourism industry has started to gradually reopen, tourism firms have been applying a wide array of responses, ranging from compliance with health measures to innovating their services, adopting new technologies and searching for new customer segments (Alonso et al., 2020). Some studies have addressed firms’ resilience and begun identifying the strategies adopted by tourism and hospitality firms to cope with the COVID-19 crisis (Breier et al., 2021; Kaushal & Srivastava, 2020; Lai & Wong, 2020). However, evidence about the effects of different types of responses on firm performance is still lacking. This study aims to provide a first assessment of the effects of three groups of responses to the COVID-19 crisis – marketing, cost cutting and organizational changes – on customer loyalty and economic performance.

Effects of agritourism businesses’ strategies to cope with the COVID-19 crisis: The key role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) behavioursJournal of Cleaner Production,  2021Full paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621034776
Evidence of the ... more Full paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621034776Evidence of the effects of tourism businesses’ strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis remains remarkably scarce. Drawing on the system resilience framework, this study suggests a model in which corporate social responsibility (CSR) behaviours encompassing five dimensions – community, employees, environment, heritage and products – and co-creation experience mediate the relationships between strategies and performance. Applying partial least squares structural equation modeling to a sample of 199 agritourism businesses in Italy, this study finds that proactive strategies have a positive effect on performance and that this effect is fully mediated by CSR and co-creation experience. Reactive strategies have both a negative direct effect and a positive mediated effect on performance. Hence, the strategies positively affect performance only if they first contribute to the resilience of the local system through CSR behaviours, enhancing the resources needed for tourism experience co-creation. This analysis emphasises the impacts of the community, environmental and heritage dimensions of CSR behaviours.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Antecedents of professionals’ self-efficacy in professional service firms: effects of external source credibility and content quality (OPEN ACCESS)Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing,  2021OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBIM-11-2019-0485/full/pdf 
Pur... more OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBIM-11-2019-0485/full/pdf PurposeProfessional service firm (PSF) performance depends on the accumulation and application of specialist knowledge to find customised solutions to customer problems. However, available research has not examined whether knowledge acquired from external sources affects PSF outcomes by strengthening professionals’ beliefs rather than only by increasing technical competency. Drawing on self-efficacy theory, this study tests a model that links the quality of content acquired from external sources and the credibility of those sources to professionals’ self-efficacy and, in turn, to PSF outcomes (solution quality and firm performance). In particular, this paper aims to consider the case of professional content exchanged through professional social media.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional research design was applied. Data were collected from a sample of 208 accountants, auditors and lawyers who used professional social media and were analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling.FindingsWhen accessing professional content from external sources, source credibility and content quality are significant antecedents of professionals’ self-efficacy, which, in turn, has positive effects on PSF outcomes (solution quality and PSF performance).Research limitations/implicationsSelf-efficacy plays a key role in the link between knowledge acquired from external sources (professional content) and PSF outcomes.Practical implicationsThis study provides recommendations and actionable insights for PSFs, professionals and other actors who create and exchange professional content. Professional associations may also take an active role by contributing and sharing credible and high-quality content, using, for example, professional social media.Originality/valueThis paper advances the current understanding of the effects of professionals’ access to content from external sources on PSF outcomes. It provides an explanation of these effects based on the enhancement of professionals’ beliefs instead of their technical competencies, as indicated in previous research. In addition, it is the first research effort to consider professional social media as a communication channel to exchange content that affects the self-efficacy of PSF professionals.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on the resource-based view, this study examines the relationship between a firm's information technology, international marketing, and export operations capabilities and its cross-border e-commerce strategic and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data from a sample of Italian exporters in the food and beverage industry. Findings: The results highlight the mixed effects of information technology, international marketing, and export operations capabilities on both e-commerce strategic and financial performance. Moreover, the use of third-party e-commerce platforms reduces the effect of exporters' information technology capabilities on their e-commerce financial performance.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The literature describes the ... more https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521002468The literature describes the potential for using future services technologies in public health emergencies. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic is resulting in unparalleled challenges to healthcare services in almost all countries, requiring innovative methods of practicing across health professions. Factors affecting pharmacists’ choice of telemedicine adoption/non-adoption are yet to be examined, especially in Italy. Thus, we investigate the behavioral intentions of pharmacists related to telemedicine, as a future services technology, in the current pandemic context. Our model draws on the theory of planned behavior and extends it to investigate the mechanisms underlying attitude formation to telemedicine adoption through a cross-sectional approach, using a questionnaire-based survey. The model has medium-to-high power in predicting telemedicine adoption intention, and the two significant direct antecedents of the target construct (attitude to telemedicine, and perceived behavioral control) are almost equally important. The psychological mechanisms linked to the tendency to implement emerging technology are complex and have major management effects. Studies in this field are yet to focus on the issues that affect the pharmacists’ decision regarding adopting or not adopting telemedicine, as a future services technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Finding a way towards high-quality, accessible tourism: the role of digital ecosystems (open access)TQM Journal,  2020OPEN ACCESS: https://doi.org/10.1108/TQM-03-2020-0062

Beyond a number of acknowledged barriers (e.g., cultural, architectural, relational), the main issue is the lack of coordination among the many actors participating in the co-creation of tourism experiences. This paper intends to advance available knowledge on this issue by conceptually suggesting a solution that draws on the concepts of the tourism experience and digital ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is developed as a conceptual contribution, drawing also on an illustrative example that considers a tourist with mobility disability as the focal actor. Findings: The results indicate that a digital ecosystem could contribute to making tourism locations more accessible by enabling information sharing and coordination among all actors that co-create the tourism experiences. Moreover, the analysis underlines that tourism locations should be designed to be usable by all people, drawing on the principles of the universal design. Limitations/Implications: The paper describes a path to fostering accessible tourism, drawing on local authorities, particularly municipalities and universities. The suggested solution would benefit from future empirical analyses to assess its strengths and weaknesses. Originality/value: By drawing on the concept of digital ecosystems, this paper is among the first studies to suggest a path to making tourism locations more accessible to all tourists (with or without disabilities) based on technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Manufacturing is coming home': Does reshoring improve perceived product quality

Purp... more OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/TQM-11-2019-0260/full/htmlPurposeRecently, many firms have reshored manufacturing activities back to their home countries to increase customer perceptions of product quality. However, there is no evidence that relocating production to the home country improves customer-perceived quality. This study intends to address this gap by assessing the variations between pre- and post-reshoring product quality, as perceived by domestic customers.Design/methodology/approachData were collected through a questionnaire, which used the case of an Italian fashion brand that had reshored its manufacturing from Romania to Italy as the stimulus. Two analyses of the collected data (n = 399) were conducted, applying both 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design and partial least squares–structural equation modelling (PLS–SEM) multigroup analysis.FindingsReshoring increased the level of perceived product quality only for customers that both were aware of the firm’s past offshoring decision and had high levels of affective ethnocentrism. For all other customers, no significant variations between pre- and post-reshoring product quality were observed.Research limitations/implicationsThis study challenges previous findings, revealing that only a minor share of customers perceived products to be of higher quality after reshoring.Practical implicationsIncreasing customer-perceived quality may not be a sufficient motivation to select the reshoring strategy. In addition, when announcing reshoring strategies, producers should appeal to customers’ emotions and not use rational arguments about objective product quality.Originality/valueThis is the first study to assess variations between pre- and post-reshoring customer-perceived quality and to identify factors that explain such variations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It represents positive and negative pressures toward sustainability respectively by entrepreneurs’ attitude and barriers to sustainability, while hypothesizing that customer satisfaction and competitiveness mediate effects of these practices on firm performance. Covariance-based structural equation modeling is used to analyze survey data on 334 restaurants in North Italy. Results show that sustainability attitude exerts pressure toward sustainability, while barriers in terms of costs, fear of regulation or skepticism about benefits have negative, but lower, effects. Sustainability implementation positively contributes to firm performance, but only via two intermediate measures of business success: competitiveness and customer satisfaction. The study fills a gap in the literature by presenting a whole construct of sustainability, by testing two mediating effects not yet hypothesized and by highlighting in the same model the role of factors enabling and deterring sustainability.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper addresses this gap by examining (a) the most important salesperson and sales management capabilities and (b) emerging trends related to the management of sales capabilities in the wine industry. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical analysis based on an explorative research design was conducted in the Italian wine industry. Sales directors from four of the 30 largest Italian wine producers were interviewed. Textual data were analysed using template analysis. Findings: Analysis of the findings revealed the most important capabilities of salespeople and sales managers and identified four emerging trends related to sales capability management in the wine industry-capabilities enrichment, capabilities balance, capabilities specialisation and capabilities acquisition process. Research limitations/implications: Given that only large wine producers in the Old World were interviewed, caution should be exercised before extending the findings to small and medium-sized players and to those in the New World. Practical implications: The trends identified in this study provide actionable insights for designing strategies to manage sales capabilities in wine businesses. Originality/value: This was one of the first studies to address the capabilities of salespeople and sales managers and to provide an in-depth examination of sales capability management trends in the wine industry.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using the traditional, unidimensional conceptualization of ethnocentrism, prior hospitality research concluded that ethnocentrism drives people to favor domestic over foreign brands. This study proposes a model wherein ethnocentrism’s emotional and cognitive dimensions influence perceptions of international brands through separate direct and indirect mechanisms, which vary between the brand’s domestic and foreign markets. The model was assessed using multigroup analysis of perceptions of Starbucks in two samples of 186 and 235 consumers from the United States and Italy, respectively. The findings highlight that ethnocentrism’s emotional and cognitive dimensions have positive and negative effects, respectively, on brand image in the domestic market (United States) and vice versa in a foreign market (Italy). In the foreign market, ethnocentrism influences brand image only indirectly.

Specifically, many small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) choose to rely on digital e-commerce platforms (or marketplaces) that provide them with inexpensive and rapid access to a large base of potential foreign customers. The few studies available on this topic have implicitly assumed that SMEs embrace this channel with the sole intent of increasing export sales (i.e., to exploit existing opportunities). This study argues that SMEs can also implement a data-driven approach that uses cross-border e-commerce platforms as inexpensive tools to acquire foreign market knowledge by leveraging the large volume of data available on these digital platforms. Purpose of the paper: This work proposes and tests a model in which a firm's exploration-driven use of cross-border e-commerce platforms enhances foreign market knowledge acquisition, which improves both the overall export performance of the firm and the exploitation of foreign opportunities through e-commerce. Methodology: Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to estimate the proposed model. Data for analysis were collected from a sample of 110 Italian exporters belonging to the food and beverage industry. Results: The findings highlighted that the exploration-driven use of cross-border e-commerce platforms had a positive relationship with the export performance of firms. The results also implied that this effect was fully mediated by the level of foreign market knowledge (about customers, competitors, market conditions, business laws and regulations) acquired through the use of cross-border e-commerce platforms. Research limitations: Only exporters belonging to a specific industry were considered in the empirical analysis. Thus, caution is recommended when generalizing these results. Practical implications: The findings encourage export managers to embrace cross-border e-commerce platforms for both sales and market research purposes by deploying a data-driven approach to cross-border e-commerce platforms. Originality of the study: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study providing empirical evidence about the effects of using a data-driven approach to cross-border e-commerce platforms. #CBECSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The increasing importance of online reviews in hospitality and tourism has been widely assessed. A specific stream of research has addressed the motivations to write online reviews, highlighting the effects of both altruistic and egoistic motivations. In fact, some guests write reviews mainly for altruistic reasons such as the desire to help others, not only other customers but also the firms (hotels and restaurants in particular). Other guests post reviews mainly for egoistic motives such as to relive the experience but also to wreak revenge on hotels/restaurants. However, up to now the effects of these different motivations on online reviews writing behaviour have not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to fill this gap by examining the effects of altruistic and egoistic motivations on the frequency of writing online reviews. Methodology.

The aim of the research is to examine the perceived image of Verona, both as a tourist destination and as a city to live in. City image can be defined as a set of believes, ideas and impressions people hold regarding a city, and can strongly affect residents’ and tourists’ attitudes and behaviors toward the city: it can increase tourists’ loyalty and satisfaction, but it also plays a key role in creating residents’ support for further tourism development. The image of a city depends much on the quality of the services it provides, both public services and tourism facilities, and perceptions are expected to vary between residents and tourists. Methodology. The research was conducted through questionnaires to 380 residents and 167 tourists of Verona. Questionnaires were based on a multi-item scale addressing six dimensions of the city image, four of them being shared by both tourists and residents, thus allowing for a direct comparison. Findings.

The influence of PSA's likeability on children’s intentions to eat healthy food (OPEN ACCESS)International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing,  2021OPEN ACCESS: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12208-021-00287-2.pdf
This paper sug... more OPEN ACCESS: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12208-021-00287-2.pdfThis paper suggests a model that considers the effects of the children’s attitude toward Public Service Announcements—PSAs (measured through the likeability of PSAs) on their behavioural intention to eat fruits and vegetables. The suggested model was tested through an empirical analysis conducted with children aged 8 to 11 and the data were analysed through partial least squares – structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) multigroup analysis. The findings indicate that the positive emotions PSAs generate and PSA credibility mediate the effects of the children’s perceived likeability of PSAs on their behavioural intention to eat fruits and vegetables. Overall, understanding the connections between PSA likeability, positive emotions, PSA credibility and behavioural intentions can facilitate the development of further social advertisements aimed at children covering healthy eating. Therefore, the findings of this study are relevant for non-profit organizations, government institutions and advertisers interested in creating effective social messages aimed at children.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The purpose of this paper is to explain buyers’ intention to renew a contract after discrete and time-delimited transactions by suggesting a model that complements social exchange theory with theories of fairness. In detail, this study aims to determine how evaluations of economic and social outcomes are complemented by both procedural fairness and distributive fairness.Design/methodology/approachThe hypotheses are tested in the social couponing industry with a survey of a sample of 199 firms purchasing advertising services from daily deal websites. Data are analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM).FindingsThe findings reveal direct effects of procedural fairness on social outcomes (satisfaction) and distributive fairness on the intention to renew a contract, negative moderating effect of procedural fairness on the relationship between economic outcomes (campaign effectiveness) and social outcomes (satisfaction).Research limitations/implicationsIn discrete, time-delimited transactions, high levels of procedural fairness may partially compensate for low levels of economic outcomes and prevent a reduction in social outcomes. Hence, when economic outcomes are influenced largely by external, uncontrollable conditions, the buyer seems to appreciate the supplier’s efforts to behave fairly.Practical implicationsSocial outcomes matter even in discrete transactions and considerations of fairness should be integrated in the management of discrete transactions. Sharing economic outcomes fairly is not sufficient to secure the buyer’s intention to renew the contract.Originality/valueThis study proposes and tests a model that complements social exchange theory with theories of fairness and explains contract renewal in discrete, time-delimited transactions, encompassing both economic outcomes and social outcomes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As the tourism industry has started to gradually reopen, tourism firms have been applying a wide array of responses, ranging from compliance with health measures to innovating their services, adopting new technologies and searching for new customer segments (Alonso et al., 2020). Some studies have addressed firms’ resilience and begun identifying the strategies adopted by tourism and hospitality firms to cope with the COVID-19 crisis (Breier et al., 2021; Kaushal & Srivastava, 2020; Lai & Wong, 2020). However, evidence about the effects of different types of responses on firm performance is still lacking. This study aims to provide a first assessment of the effects of three groups of responses to the COVID-19 crisis – marketing, cost cutting and organizational changes – on customer loyalty and economic performance.

Evidence of the ... more Full paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621034776Evidence of the effects of tourism businesses’ strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis remains remarkably scarce. Drawing on the system resilience framework, this study suggests a model in which corporate social responsibility (CSR) behaviours encompassing five dimensions – community, employees, environment, heritage and products – and co-creation experience mediate the relationships between strategies and performance. Applying partial least squares structural equation modeling to a sample of 199 agritourism businesses in Italy, this study finds that proactive strategies have a positive effect on performance and that this effect is fully mediated by CSR and co-creation experience. Reactive strategies have both a negative direct effect and a positive mediated effect on performance. Hence, the strategies positively affect performance only if they first contribute to the resilience of the local system through CSR behaviours, enhancing the resources needed for tourism experience co-creation. This analysis emphasises the impacts of the community, environmental and heritage dimensions of CSR behaviours.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Antecedents of professionals’ self-efficacy in professional service firms: effects of external source credibility and content quality (OPEN ACCESS)Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing,  2021OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBIM-11-2019-0485/full/pdf 
Pur... more OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBIM-11-2019-0485/full/pdf PurposeProfessional service firm (PSF) performance depends on the accumulation and application of specialist knowledge to find customised solutions to customer problems. However, available research has not examined whether knowledge acquired from external sources affects PSF outcomes by strengthening professionals’ beliefs rather than only by increasing technical competency. Drawing on self-efficacy theory, this study tests a model that links the quality of content acquired from external sources and the credibility of those sources to professionals’ self-efficacy and, in turn, to PSF outcomes (solution quality and firm performance). In particular, this paper aims to consider the case of professional content exchanged through professional social media.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional research design was applied. Data were collected from a sample of 208 accountants, auditors and lawyers who used professional social media and were analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling.FindingsWhen accessing professional content from external sources, source credibility and content quality are significant antecedents of professionals’ self-efficacy, which, in turn, has positive effects on PSF outcomes (solution quality and PSF performance).Research limitations/implicationsSelf-efficacy plays a key role in the link between knowledge acquired from external sources (professional content) and PSF outcomes.Practical implicationsThis study provides recommendations and actionable insights for PSFs, professionals and other actors who create and exchange professional content. Professional associations may also take an active role by contributing and sharing credible and high-quality content, using, for example, professional social media.Originality/valueThis paper advances the current understanding of the effects of professionals’ access to content from external sources on PSF outcomes. It provides an explanation of these effects based on the enhancement of professionals’ beliefs instead of their technical competencies, as indicated in previous research. In addition, it is the first research effort to consider professional social media as a communication channel to exchange content that affects the self-efficacy of PSF professionals.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on the resource-based view, this study examines the relationship between a firm's information technology, international marketing, and export operations capabilities and its cross-border e-commerce strategic and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data from a sample of Italian exporters in the food and beverage industry. Findings: The results highlight the mixed effects of information technology, international marketing, and export operations capabilities on both e-commerce strategic and financial performance. Moreover, the use of third-party e-commerce platforms reduces the effect of exporters' information technology capabilities on their e-commerce financial performance.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The literature describes the ... more https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521002468The literature describes the potential for using future services technologies in public health emergencies. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic is resulting in unparalleled challenges to healthcare services in almost all countries, requiring innovative methods of practicing across health professions. Factors affecting pharmacists’ choice of telemedicine adoption/non-adoption are yet to be examined, especially in Italy. Thus, we investigate the behavioral intentions of pharmacists related to telemedicine, as a future services technology, in the current pandemic context. Our model draws on the theory of planned behavior and extends it to investigate the mechanisms underlying attitude formation to telemedicine adoption through a cross-sectional approach, using a questionnaire-based survey. The model has medium-to-high power in predicting telemedicine adoption intention, and the two significant direct antecedents of the target construct (attitude to telemedicine, and perceived behavioral control) are almost equally important. The psychological mechanisms linked to the tendency to implement emerging technology are complex and have major management effects. Studies in this field are yet to focus on the issues that affect the pharmacists’ decision regarding adopting or not adopting telemedicine, as a future services technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Finding a way towards high-quality, accessible tourism: the role of digital ecosystems (open access)TQM Journal,  2020OPEN ACCESS: https://doi.org/10.1108/TQM-03-2020-0062

Beyond a number of acknowledged barriers (e.g., cultural, architectural, relational), the main issue is the lack of coordination among the many actors participating in the co-creation of tourism experiences. This paper intends to advance available knowledge on this issue by conceptually suggesting a solution that draws on the concepts of the tourism experience and digital ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is developed as a conceptual contribution, drawing also on an illustrative example that considers a tourist with mobility disability as the focal actor. Findings: The results indicate that a digital ecosystem could contribute to making tourism locations more accessible by enabling information sharing and coordination among all actors that co-create the tourism experiences. Moreover, the analysis underlines that tourism locations should be designed to be usable by all people, drawing on the principles of the universal design. Limitations/Implications: The paper describes a path to fostering accessible tourism, drawing on local authorities, particularly municipalities and universities. The suggested solution would benefit from future empirical analyses to assess its strengths and weaknesses. Originality/value: By drawing on the concept of digital ecosystems, this paper is among the first studies to suggest a path to making tourism locations more accessible to all tourists (with or without disabilities) based on technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Manufacturing is coming home': Does reshoring improve perceived product quality

Purp... more OPEN ACCESS: https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/TQM-11-2019-0260/full/htmlPurposeRecently, many firms have reshored manufacturing activities back to their home countries to increase customer perceptions of product quality. However, there is no evidence that relocating production to the home country improves customer-perceived quality. This study intends to address this gap by assessing the variations between pre- and post-reshoring product quality, as perceived by domestic customers.Design/methodology/approachData were collected through a questionnaire, which used the case of an Italian fashion brand that had reshored its manufacturing from Romania to Italy as the stimulus. Two analyses of the collected data (n = 399) were conducted, applying both 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design and partial least squares–structural equation modelling (PLS–SEM) multigroup analysis.FindingsReshoring increased the level of perceived product quality only for customers that both were aware of the firm’s past offshoring decision and had high levels of affective ethnocentrism. For all other customers, no significant variations between pre- and post-reshoring product quality were observed.Research limitations/implicationsThis study challenges previous findings, revealing that only a minor share of customers perceived products to be of higher quality after reshoring.Practical implicationsIncreasing customer-perceived quality may not be a sufficient motivation to select the reshoring strategy. In addition, when announcing reshoring strategies, producers should appeal to customers’ emotions and not use rational arguments about objective product quality.Originality/valueThis is the first study to assess variations between pre- and post-reshoring customer-perceived quality and to identify factors that explain such variations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It represents positive and negative pressures toward sustainability respectively by entrepreneurs’ attitude and barriers to sustainability, while hypothesizing that customer satisfaction and competitiveness mediate effects of these practices on firm performance. Covariance-based structural equation modeling is used to analyze survey data on 334 restaurants in North Italy. Results show that sustainability attitude exerts pressure toward sustainability, while barriers in terms of costs, fear of regulation or skepticism about benefits have negative, but lower, effects. Sustainability implementation positively contributes to firm performance, but only via two intermediate measures of business success: competitiveness and customer satisfaction. The study fills a gap in the literature by presenting a whole construct of sustainability, by testing two mediating effects not yet hypothesized and by highlighting in the same model the role of factors enabling and deterring sustainability.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper addresses this gap by examining (a) the most important salesperson and sales management capabilities and (b) emerging trends related to the management of sales capabilities in the wine industry. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical analysis based on an explorative research design was conducted in the Italian wine industry. Sales directors from four of the 30 largest Italian wine producers were interviewed. Textual data were analysed using template analysis. Findings: Analysis of the findings revealed the most important capabilities of salespeople and sales managers and identified four emerging trends related to sales capability management in the wine industry-capabilities enrichment, capabilities balance, capabilities specialisation and capabilities acquisition process. Research limitations/implications: Given that only large wine producers in the Old World were interviewed, caution should be exercised before extending the findings to small and medium-sized players and to those in the New World. Practical implications: The trends identified in this study provide actionable insights for designing strategies to manage sales capabilities in wine businesses. Originality/value: This was one of the first studies to address the capabilities of salespeople and sales managers and to provide an in-depth examination of sales capability management trends in the wine industry.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Le equazioni strutturali Partial Least Squares: Introduzione alla PLS-SEM (seconda edizione). Franco Angeli: Milano, Italia.Questo manuale, versione italiana del bestseller A Primer on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, presenta con un linguaggio accessibile e con un approccio orientato alla pratica il metodo noto come Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), o modelli di equazioni strutturali basati sui minimi quadrati parziali. Questo metodo sta conoscendo una rapidissima diffusione in una grande varietà di discipline, dal marketing al management, dall'international business al turismo e, in generale, nelle scienze sociali. Alla base di questa popolarità sta la capacità della PLS-SEM di coniugare rigore scientifico e facilità di applicazione, superando alcuni limiti tipici delle tecniche statistiche tradizionali (legate, ad esempio, ai requisiti di numerosità minima del campione o di complessità massima del modello). Il manuale rappresenta una guida ai concetti e alle applicazioni dei modelli di equazioni strutturali di tipo PLS, permettendo al lettore di comprendere e applicare correttamente e in autonomia questo metodo. L'approccio orientato alla pratica si concretizza anche nell'illustrazione di un caso (con l'impiego del software SmartPLS) attraverso il quale vengono applicati i concetti presentati in ciascun capitolo.https://www.amazon.it/equazioni-strutturali-Partial-Least-Squares/dp/8891791814/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2NPN25FTDDEAQ&dchild=1&keywords=equazioni+strutturali+pls&qid=1619276004&sprefix=equazioni+str%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-1Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since the late nineteenth century, it has embodied the economic and technological power of nations, the lifestyle, the dynamics of urban and territorial development, and it has acted as a national barometer of economic success and failure. This book explains how the car industry works and analyses the challenges both for the sector and for the economies that rely on the industry for jobs, growth, and innovation. It explores an industry that has been under severe pressure in industrialized countries for many years—factories have shut down, jobs have gone, and brands have disappeared—yet world production has never been so high, reaching new peaks annually. Fabio Cassia and Matteo Ferrazzi investigate as well the new trends of urban mobility and the characteristic of " car of the future " : the traditional landscape of car production and usage will be driven by technological advances, connectivity, car sharing, and by one the most fascinating advances, the self-driving car. How different will be the automotive sector in a decade?

Essa diviene un vero e proprio luogo di mediazione stabile tra l’impresa ed il proprio mercato, consentendo di generare un patrimonio relazionale di lungo periodo che sovente viene utilizzato anche per lanciare innovazioni di prodotto in mercati diversi da quelli già presidiati (la c.d. estensione di marca). La corretta gestione di tale operazione richiede tuttavia di adottare una prospettiva relazionale di lungo periodo, non sempre sovrapponibile al risultato di vendite in sé del nuovo prodotto. Il presente volume, servendosi di una cornice sistemico-relazionale, approfondisce tale tematica, sia presentando la Letteratura nazionale ed internazionale di riferimento sia analizzando in profondità alcuni casi concreti, per giungere infine a delineare un modello sistemico-relazionale di gestione del successo dell’estensione di marca.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Questi ultimi, infatti, offrono consistenti opportunità di mercato, che vanno ben oltre la tradizionale nicchia del lusso. Tuttavia per soddisfare la domanda in continua evoluzione dei consumatori posizionati anche negli strati intermedi ed inferiori di tali mercati, si rende necessaria una profonda revisione (e talvolta persino una falsificazione) delle tradizionali teorie manageriali, fino ad ora delineate e verificate quasi esclusivamente nei paesi occidentali.Il presente volume si propone quale tentativo di sistematizzare le conoscenze scientifiche sull’argomento, integrandole con dati aggiornati e presentando diverse decine di casi concreti di imprese che si sono confrontate con i nuovi mercati emergenti. In particolare, il materiale è organizzato seguendo un percorso logico che, prendendo avvio dall’analisi strategica del contesto e delle opportunità di mercato, giunge ad individuare le più efficaci leve di marketing per soddisfare la domanda dei paesi emergenti.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Tuttavia ad oggi poco si sa sulle strategie con le quali l'impresa dovrebbe gestire il brand in tali mercati. Si tratta di decisioni molto complesse che devono tenere conto delle peculiarità del business-to-business, non potendo semplicemente mutuare logiche e strumenti dal branding nei mercati business-to-consumer.Il presente lavoro si propone di fare luce su questo tema cercando di chiarire come l'impresa dovrebbe definire e gestire il proprio mix di strategie di BtoB branding in funzione delle specificità dei mercati (tipi di clienti e di supply chain) in cui opera.

Evoluzioni nelle condotte delle imprese per il presidio dei mercati internazionali: competenze, ruoli, gestione della conoscenzaContributi in onore di Gaetano Maria Golinelli,  2020Citazione: Ugolini, M.; Cassia, F.; Simeoni, F., "Evoluzioni nelle condotte delle imprese per il ... more Citazione: Ugolini, M.; Cassia, F.; Simeoni, F., "Evoluzioni nelle condotte delle imprese per il presidio dei mercati internazionali: competenze, ruoli, gestione della conoscenza", in Contributi in onore di Abstract Obiettivi. Prendendo avvio dal lavoro "Tecnica economica industriale e commerciale" di Panati e Golinelli del 1991, questo studio si propone di identificare alcuni vettori di cambiamento rilevanti per le condotte delle imprese, in particolare in quelle di piccola e media dimensione, per il presidio dei mercati internazionali. Metodologia. Il lavoro si configura come un contributo concettuale a partire dalla letteratura scientifica e dai dati secondari disponibili sul tema, integrati anche dagli studi e dalle interazioni dirette degli autori con imprenditori e manager. Risultati. Il lavoro presenta tre gruppi di evoluzioni emergenti nelle decisioni della funzione 'commerciale estero' o 'export' dell'impresa: i cambiamenti nelle competenze necessarie e nelle modalità di accesso ad esse; le persone e i ruoli, con un focus sull'export manager e sul temporary export manager; la gestione della conoscenza, includendo i nuovi strumenti disponibili per analizzare i dati e trasformarli in conoscenza. Limiti della ricerca. Considerata l'elevata varietà dei contesti e delle imprese, le riflessioni proposte nel paper non sono necessariamente estendibili a tutte le imprese impegnate nello sviluppo commerciale nei mercati internazionali. Implicazioni pratiche. Il lavoro fa emergere come i margini di miglioramento nelle decisioni e nelle condotte per lo sviluppo internazionale delle piccole e medie imprese siano significativi e indica alcuni elementi concreti sui quali agire a tale scopo. Originalità del lavoro. Il lavoro presenta un quadro delle novità recenti nelle decisioni e nelle condotte delle imprese impegnate nello sviluppo commerciale nei mercati internazionali. Parole chiave: internazionalizzazione; export; international business; export manager. Objectives. Drawing on the work "Tecnica economica industriale e commerciale" di Panati e Golinelli (1991), this study aims to identify some relevant changes in the behaviors of the firms, especially of the small-and medium-sized ones, targeting foreign markets. Methodology. This work is developed as a conceptual contribution which draws on both the scientific literature and the available secondary data, enriched by the studies and the direct interactions with entrepreneurs and managers carried out by the authors. Findings. This work presents three groups of emerging evolutions in the decisions of the export department of the firm. These groups are related to: changes in the needed competences and in the ways to access them; people and roles, with a focus on the export manager and on the temporary export manager; knowledge management, including the new tools that are available to analyze data and transform them into knowledge. Research limits. Given the high variety of both contexts and firms, the reflections developed in this paper cannot necessarily be extended to all the exporting firms. Practical implications. This work suggests that the potential for improvement in the decisions and behaviors of the exporting small-and medium-sized firms are significant. In addition, it indicates some directions to follow to pursue that improvement. Originality of the study. This work presents a comprehensive overview of the recent changes in the decisions and behaviors of firms pursuing sales development in foreign markets.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Evidenze da una destinazione ad alta intensità turistica: il caso Gardaland tra insostenibilità presunta e sustainability in useby Fabio Cassia and Federico  BrunettiManagement per la sostenibilità dello sviluppo turistico e la competitività delle destinazioni.

Partendo dalla presunta insostenibilità di un parco divertimenti come Gardaland, che attrae più di tre milioni di visitatori l'anno, gli autori dimostrano che esso si inserisce in modo coerente nel quadrante del sustainable mass tourism di Weaver.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
