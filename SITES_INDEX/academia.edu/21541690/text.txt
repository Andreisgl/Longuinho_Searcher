Bergeron, G.Bourogiannis, A. Johnston, F. Leclère, A. Masson and R. Thomas, Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt. The British Museum, Online Research Catalogue. Pottery is by far the most common artefact group found at Naukratis, and the Ptolemaic to Byzantine pottery spans over 10 centuries of the settlement’s history, from 331 BC until around AD 650. For this reason it is of particular importance for our understanding of the changing communities living at and visiting Naukratis over this long and dynamic period. Even though the assemblage known to us today is a heterogeneous selection made by successive excavators with different sampling strategies, careful assessment of the abundant evidence enables us to investigate the three key questions often asked of such assemblages: date, origin and function. The chapter surveys the large and varied assemblage so as to provide the reader with a good understanding of these broad questions, whilst also investigating, where possible, the complex and nuanced role of pottery in the expression of identities within the cosmopolitan communities of Naukratis.Download Free PDFView PDFVilling, A., Bergeron, M., Bourogiannia, G., Johnston, A., Leclère, F.,Masson, A., Thomas, R.I., 2013-2019.

British Museum Online Research Catalogue (www.britishmuseum.org/naukratis)Naukratis: Ptolemaic and Roman faience vessels (2017)2017 • Ross I ThomasPtolemaic and Roman faience vessels emerged from a long Egyptian tradition and their presence at Naukratis reflects the continued popularity of faience vessels within Egyptian society until the beginning of the 3rd century AD. However, the introduction of Greek technology as well as new forms and fashions mean that the variety of faience vessel forms is significantly different from what came before. The assemblage can be broadly separated into four productions: 3rd and 2nd century BC bi- or multi-chrome faience with mould-made relief and incised detail; 2nd to 1st century BC undecorated mono- or bi-chrome vessels; rare Ptolemaic faience plastic vases; and plain turquoise 1st and 2nd century AD table wares. There is also evidence for production during the 3rd or 2nd century BC in the form of moulds. Collectively the assemblage not only adds to our knowledge of the range of table wares used at Naukratis, but also sheds light on the ritual practices of the Greek elite and the ruler cult of Arsinoe II in the 3rd century BC. Faience vessels associated with the New Year and inundation festivals show remarkable continuity with the preceding periods at Naukratis.Download Free PDFView PDFPottery from Dongola: A stratigraphic assemblage from unit B.I.41Katarzyna de Lellis-Danys, Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean PCMAThe article discusses an assemblage of pottery recovered from unit B.I.41, a room in the palatial building B.I excavated on the citadel of Dongola in the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Exploration started with the fill of the room, followed by the fill of structures belonging to an earlier building below it. A well dated sequence of layers from the 6th through 7th centuries was identified. The pottery assemblage proved to be very abundant, composed of table vessels, cooking pots, storage and transport containers; the lattermost group included imported examples, mainly from Egypt. Most of the finds represented Dongolan ceramic production from the period in question.Download Free PDFView PDFWORKING IN MEMPHIS: THE PRODUCTION OF FAIENCE AT ROMAN PERIOD KOM HELULPaul Nicholson, Panagiota MantiThis PDF is the text volume of the book 'Working in Memphis' and is made available courtesy of the Egypt Exploration Society from whom hard-copies may still be available (complete with DVD not included in this upload).

Finds from the fill between floors confirmed the early dating of the oldest church (6th/7th century). Two buildings were examined in the vicinity of the inner peribolos: BN.13, which proved to be a domestic dwelling from a later phase (11th–12th century), and BS.13, identified as a structure of religious function built before the 9th–10th century.Download Free PDFView PDFThe material culture of Naukratis - an overview (2014)Aurelia Masson-Berghoff (Masson), Alexandra Villing, Marianne BergeronResearch on finds from the early fieldwork undertaken at Naukratis in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Flinders Petrie and others now makes it possible for material previously little known and studied to make a substantial contribution to scholarship, increasing our knowledge of the site of Naukratis and its history, our understanding of ancient Greek and Egyptian practices and of the interaction between these two cultures.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
