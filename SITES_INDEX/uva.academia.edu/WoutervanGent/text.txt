The act enables local governments to stop specific groups of deprived households from moving into designated neighbourhoods. More specifically, the Act allows local governments to refuse a residence permit to persons who have lived in the metropolitan region for less than six years and who do not receive an income from work, pensions or student loans. The policy is based on the idea that reducing the influx of poor newcomers improves liveability by providing a temporary relief of the demand for public services and by making neighbourhoods demographically 'balanced' or 'socially mixed'. This review examines the socio-spatial effects of the Act in Rotterdam between 2006 and 2013. While the Act produces socio-demographic changes, the state of the living environment in designated areas seems to be worsening rather than improving. Our findings show that the policy restricts the rights of excluded groups without demonstrably improving safety or liveability. The review concludes with a reflection on how the Act may signify a broader change in European statecraft and urban policy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Centre for Urban Studies Working Paper Series No. 22 State-sponsored gentrification or social regeneration? Symbolic politics and neighborhood intervention in an Amsterdam working class neighborhoodby Willem R.

Even though the residents have been successful in resisting redevelopment and renovation plans, state and housing association continue their efforts to change the area through symbolic politics. By introducing and facilitating cultural entrepreneurs and artists in the area - as part of regeneration and gentrification strategies -, the representation of what the neighborhood is, and ought to be, gravitates towards the planners’ future vision. As such, these representations undermine the legitimacy of long-term residents. Interviews with residents reveal that the change in the neighborhood instill a sense of loss of place, exacerbated by cuts in local service provision.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although evidently at odds with principles of equality enshrined in law, the Act has emerged as a standard part of the policy tool kit. This article seeks to explain how the Rotterdam Act came to pass. Asking this question sets us on the path of reconstructing how specific urban areas suffering from extraordinary problems were identified and how using exceptional measures to exclude specific groups were instituted. In a word, we are interested in the construction of exceptionality. We show that the construction of exceptional territories is based on the interplay of discretionary power and statistical calculation. We discuss the wider relevance of our analysis to the emerging field of critical data studies and for understanding the links between sovereignty, territory and statistics in constitutional democracies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By deconcentrating poverty and giving opportunities for social interaction, remaining residents are believed to benefit from middle class presence. This study looks at a post-war neighbourhood in Amsterdam which has undergone comprehensive renewal. By making use of survey data in combination with GIS techniques, this study shows that perceptions arestructured by physical characteristics, activity patterns and symbolic boundaries. These perceptions are highly dependent on social position. While some residents in renewal areas display inclusionary attitudes, there is also evidence of middle class and lower class disaffiliation. Interestingly, these translate into different mental maps for both groups. The paper ends with a methodological reflection on using GIS-based boundary drawing in neighbourhood surveys to gauge fragmentation and place-based displacement.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The literature suggests that changes in segregation occur primarily through selective migration. In this paper, we follow up on recent work that has questioned these orthodoxies, suggesting that in situ social mobility, and entries to and exits from the city population should be taken into account as well, and that dynamics in all neighbourhoods should be considered. The paper traces the processes by which segregation changes for the cities of Amsterdam and The Hague for 1999–2006, using a longitudinal individual-level database covering the entire population. It extends previous work by looking at income rather than socioeconomic status and by drilling down to the neighbourhood level. Applying an existing measure of segregation (Delta) in a novel way, the analysis focuses on changes in the spatial distribution of household income, measuring the relative contribution of a range of processes to changes in segregation. Results show that segregation rises in both cities but that different processes drive changes in each case. Furthermore, the aggregate change in segregation for each city masks a diversity of changes at the neighbourhood level, some of which tend to increase segregation while others tend to reduce it. Mapping these changes and the individual processes contributing to them shows that they have a distinct geography, which seems to be structured by historically specific trends in state and housing market context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Amsterdam in the 21st century: Geography, housing, spatial development and politics (published in Cities, 52, 103-113)by Federico Savini, Willem R.

We map the social-geography of the city, discussing recent housing and spatial development policies as well as city-regional political dynamics. Today, the city of Amsterdam is more diverse than ever, both ethnically and socially. The social geography of Amsterdam shows a growing core–periphery divide that underlines important economic and cultural asymmetries. The tradition of public subsidies and regulated housing currently allows for state-led gentrification within inner city neighborhoods. Public support for homeownership is changing the balance between social, middle and high-end housing segments. Changes in the tradition of large-scale interventions and strong public planning are likewise occurring. In times of austerity, current projects focus on small-scale and piecemeal interventions particularly oriented to stimulate entrepreneurialism in selected urban areas and often relate to creative economies and sustainable development. Finally, underlying these trends is a new political landscape composed of upcoming liberal and progressive parties, which together challenge the political equilibriums in the city regionSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Class, Migrants, and the European City  Spatial impacts of structural changes in early twenty-first century AmsterdamIn the late 20th century, prevailing Anglo-Saxon theories on urban segregation based on class and... more In the late 20th century, prevailing Anglo-Saxon theories on urban segregation based on class and ‘migrant-status’ have often been rejected for continental European cities, mainly because of different economic and labour market structures and higher levels of state interventions and welfare support in all spheres of life in the latter type of cities. As urban economies in continental Europe are growing ever more global and welfare states are in continuous restructuring we seek to investigate whether a typical European socially-balanced migrant city, the city (and metropolitan region) of Amsterdam, is developing into the direction of a more outspoken ‘double dual’ condition with populations getting more spatially segregated in terms of class and migrant status.  This study looks at developments in terms of the spatial dynamics of the ‘native’ and immigrant population of different classes. We find that, while the region is growing and becoming more diverse through migration and demographic shifts, it is undergoing a transformation, which for now reduces spatial concentrations and inequality. As the urban core is gentrifying and some suburban neighbourhoods are declining, the typical dichotomy of poor-migrant central city versus affluent-native suburbs is vanishing. These developments point to a different type of social migrant city, one with a patchwork of residential milieus along social and cultural lines. However, we challenge the sustainability of that patchwork over time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
An anatomy of gentrification processes: variegating causes of neighbourhood change (Environment and Planning A, 2015, vol.47(7), pp.1480-1501)by Cody Hochstenbach and Wouter van GentHochstenbach, C. and Van Gent, W.P.C.

These debates focus primarily on structural processes. However, we have comparatively little insight into how and to what degree different mechanisms actually underpin upgrading in urban neighbourhoods. This paper uses Dutch register data toshow how residential mobility, social mobility, and demographic change each contribute to gentrification in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. First, our findings show that residential mobility remains key to understanding the growth of higher-income residents in gentrifiying neighbourhoods. At the same time, social mobility and demographic change—notably ageing—are most important in explaining dwindling numbers of lower-income residents. Second, large differences exist across neighbourhoods. By mapping three ideal-typicaldrivers of gentrification, we show how the migration-based ‘displacement model’ occurs predominantly in upgrading neighbourhoods with a high status. Conversely, inlow-status upgrading neighbourhoods social mobility is more important in explaining gentrification. These different forms of upgrading occur simultaneously in both cities andshould be integrated to advance our understanding of gentrification as a process that is both widespread and occurs in different, ever-changing forms across neighbourhoods.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We aim to understand the most recent (2004-2011) socio-economic segregation process in (metropolitan) Amsterdam, while connecting it to the changing Dutch welfare regime, which from around 1990 is moving into a liberal direction. The social rented sector and the ‘regulated’ parts of the private sector are under pressure, while owner-occupancy is growing. Social housing is increasingly catering for just those who have a very low income. Since housing is not spatially distributed in an even way, this affects the level of socio-economic segregation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Adaptive behaviour in urban space: Residential mobility in response to social distanceby Wouter van Gent and S. MusterdUrban StudiesThe social relationship between an individual and their residential environment is shaped by a ra... more The social relationship between an individual and their residential environment is shaped by a range of housing market rules and regulations, by residential choice and by constraints. This paper elaborates on that relationship by focusing on the distance between an individual’s (and his/her household) social position and the social position of the neighbourhood of residence. Through the analysis of large-scale longitudinal register data for each resident in the four largest cities of the Netherlands, we studied the relations mentioned, as well as the residential moves triggered by such relations, as well as the outcome effects on individual-neighbourhood relations in the destination neighbourhoods. We found that the larger the social distance (positive or negative) between an individual and the median social position of their residential neighbourhood, the higher the odds that the individual would move from that neighbourhood. Those individuals that moved tended to select destination neighbourhoods that reduced their social distance. Our findings offer new input for debates and policies relating to de-segregation and social mixing.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We examine the political geography of possible shifts in support patterns for competing parties at national elections (in the member states where they have been held) and the geographical distribution of popular protests related to the crisis in 2011-2012. Finally we address the risks of democratic deterioration by comparing current developments with the interwar period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Combining survey analyses and geocoded polling station data analyses of the 2010 Dutch parliamentary elections, we find that overrepresentation of PVV support in suburban environments cannot be explained by voter composition alone. There is a positive contextual effect in lower-density neighbourhoods in cities and in suburban municipalities, as well as in post-war New Towns. To account for spatial variations, we propose an explanatory framework based on urban theories of class. Traditional middle classes, concentrated in suburbs, seem more likely to support RRPPs as a defensive strategy, and to reclaim urban space for daily use.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unintended Effects of Urban and Housing Policies on Integration: "White" Discontent in the Dutch Cityby S.

The... more Residential environments are a product of urban and housing policies and household responses. These environments develop as physical and social territories and have their own impacts on voting patterns. These specificities relate to several spheres of life, including political preferences and associated voting behavior. In this paper we argue that support for Right-wing Radical Populist Parties (RRPP) is firmly related to and affected by the production of social patterns and specific residential environments. The relation may be direct, through protest or discontent with socio-spatial processes and policies, or indirect through social networks. Empirical support for these statements is based on analyses of voting data from the city of The Hague, The Netherlands. The analyses suggest that there are three types of neighborhoods where different explanations for RRPP support are salient: native working class neighborhoods (where the so-called ethnic competition thesis is evident); ethnically-mixed urban neighborhoods (where social isolation and “hunkering down” would be key processes), and (lower) middle class suburbanSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Gentrification in AmsterdamNeil Smith argues that in the last two decades gentrification has become a generalized global urb... more Neil Smith argues that in the last two decades gentrification has become a generalized global urban phenomenon. His theory is at a high level of abstraction, as it links urban gentrification to globalization, financial capitalism and neo-liberalization. With these global processes, all cities have experienced ‘third wave’ gentrification. The theory, however, leaves little room for variegations of gentrification, apart from characterizing geographical differences as idiosyncrasies or as minor variations. This downplays the role of intervening mechanisms that impinge upon the pursuit and social outcomes of gentrification. This paper modestly aims to amend abstract theory by looking at Amsterdam from an historical institutional perspective. In Amsterdam, gentrification was particularly made possible by a process of neo-liberalization within the housing system. However, as institutional change is incremental and based on layering and conversion, many older institutional arrangements remain in place. These arrangements tend to slow gentrification and assuage social consequences. Nevertheless, neoliberal modifications to the housing system have been accelerating the pursuit of gentrification. Current policies will very likely lead to exclusionary displacement.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Housing Liberalization and Gentrification; The Social Effects of Tenure Conversions in Amsterdam by Wouter van Gent and Willem R. Botermanslightly revised version has been accepted for publication in TESGPrivatization and liberalization of the housing market are often used as governmental strategies ... more Privatization and liberalization of the housing market are often used as governmental strategies for engineering the social composition of urban neighbourhoods. Drawing on longitudinal register data from the Social Statistical Database (SSB) this study reports findings from the highly-regulated housing context of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. By making use of regression modelling and GIS analyses, it is demonstrated that tenure conversions from rent to owner occupancy are not just bringing about changes in social class composition, but also affect the ethnic and demographic composition of the population. Moreover, it is shown that conversions from rent to owner occupancy have effects that are highly spatially specific. Our evidence suggests that tenure conversions may contribute to processes of gentrification in the inner city of Amsterdam, while tenure conversions in post-war neighbourhoods do not lead to a social upgrading and may even facilitate downgrading. In addition, trends in the converted section of the housing market are not just mirroring income developments but also seem to reflect trends in ethnic segregation, as well as demographic trends such as a renewed interest among families to live in the inner city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Puzzling patterns in neighbourhood change: upgrading and downgrading in highly regulated urban housing marketsUrban Geography,  2012This study disentangles the relationship between income and real estate value development in Dutc... more This study disentangles the relationship between income and real estate value development in Dutch urban neighborhoods. Within the literature on upgrading and downgrading, it is often assumed that neighborhood income and real estate value development are strongly linked. The results reported here—based on research in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Tilburg—indicate that income and real estate values develop simultaneously in only a relatively small number of neighborhoods, which are at the top and bottom of the housing market hierarchy. The majority reveal a more complex relationship: a number of neighborhoods show a time lag between the trends, whereas in other neighborhoods income and real estate values show partially diverging trends. Several tentative explanations are offered for the complex relationship, and stress the importance of place-specific knowledge. Three points of attention are suggested for further research: understanding the role of household dynamics, the position of neighborhoods within their urban system, and the role of the state and housing associations in neighborhood change.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Political Reactions to the Eurocrisis: Cross-national Variations and Re-scaling Issues in Elections and Popular ProtestsEurasian Geography and Economics,  2013In this paper we explore the different political responses to the eurocrisis among European publi... more In this paper we explore the different political responses to the eurocrisis among European publics since the financial crisis in Europe started in 2008 by concentrating on the two most important organizational vehicles in a democratic polity: political parties and social movements. We examine the political geography of possible shifts in support patterns for competing parties at national elections (in the member states where they have been held) and the geographical distribution of popular protests related to the crisis in 2011-2012. Finally we address the risks of democratic deterioration by comparing current developments with the interwar period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Right-wing Radical Populism in Cities and Suburbsby Wouter van Gent and Joost  SmitsThis paper looks at the electoral geography of Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV), a Dutch Right-wing ... more This paper looks at the electoral geography of Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV), a Dutch Right-wing Radical Populist Party, which is anti-immigration, anti-establishment and critical of urban conditions. Combining survey analyses and geocoded polling station data analyses of the 2010 Dutch parliamentary elections, we find that overrepresentation of PVV support in suburban environments cannot be explained by voter composition alone. There is a positive contextual effect in lower-density neighbourhoods in cities and in suburban municipalities, as well as in post-war New Towns. To account for spatial variations, we propose an explanatory framework based on urban theories of class. Traditional middle classes, concentrated in suburbs, seem more likely to support RRPPs as a defensive strategy, and to reclaim urban space for daily use.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unintended Effects of Urban and Housing Policies on Integration: "White" Discontent in the Dutch Cityby S. Musterd and Wouter van GentGeography Research Forum,  2013Residential environments are a product of urban and housing policies and household responses. The... more Residential environments are a product of urban and housing policies and household responses. These environments develop as physical and social territories and have their own impacts on voting patterns. These specificities relate to several spheres of life, including political preferences and associated voting behavior. In this paper we argue that support for Right-wing Radical Populist Parties (RRPP) is firmly related to and affected by the production of social patterns and specific residential environments. The relation may be direct, through protest or discontent with socio-spatial processes and policies, or indirect through social networks. Empirical support for these statements is based on analyses of voting data from the city of The Hague, The Netherlands. The analyses suggest that there are three types of neighborhoods where different explanations for RRPP support are salient: native working class neighborhoods (where the so-called ethnic competition thesis is evident); ethnically-mixed urban neighborhoods (where social isolation and “hunkering down” would be key processes), and (lower) middle class suburbanSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Gentrification in AmsterdamNeil Smith argues that in the last two decades gentrification has become a generalized global urb... more Neil Smith argues that in the last two decades gentrification has become a generalized global urban phenomenon. His theory is at a high level of abstraction, as it links urban gentrification to globalization, financial capitalism and neo-liberalization. With these global processes, all cities have experienced ‘third wave’ gentrification. The theory, however, leaves little room for variegations of gentrification, apart from characterizing geographical differences as idiosyncrasies or as minor variations. This downplays the role of intervening mechanisms that impinge upon the pursuit and social outcomes of gentrification. This paper modestly aims to amend abstract theory by looking at Amsterdam from an historical institutional perspective. In Amsterdam, gentrification was particularly made possible by a process of neo-liberalization within the housing system. However, as institutional change is incremental and based on layering and conversion, many older institutional arrangements remain in place. These arrangements tend to slow gentrification and assuage social consequences. Nevertheless, neoliberal modifications to the housing system have been accelerating the pursuit of gentrification. Current policies will very likely lead to exclusionary displacement.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Housing Liberalization and Gentrification; The Social Effects of Tenure Conversions in Amsterdam by Wouter van Gent and Willem R. Botermanslightly revised version has been accepted for publication in TESGPrivatization and liberalization of the housing market are often used as governmental strategies ... more Privatization and liberalization of the housing market are often used as governmental strategies for engineering the social composition of urban neighbourhoods. Drawing on longitudinal register data from the Social Statistical Database (SSB) this study reports findings from the highly-regulated housing context of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. By making use of regression modelling and GIS analyses, it is demonstrated that tenure conversions from rent to owner occupancy are not just bringing about changes in social class composition, but also affect the ethnic and demographic composition of the population. Moreover, it is shown that conversions from rent to owner occupancy have effects that are highly spatially specific. Our evidence suggests that tenure conversions may contribute to processes of gentrification in the inner city of Amsterdam, while tenure conversions in post-war neighbourhoods do not lead to a social upgrading and may even facilitate downgrading. In addition, trends in the converted section of the housing market are not just mirroring income developments but also seem to reflect trends in ethnic segregation, as well as demographic trends such as a renewed interest among families to live in the inner city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Puzzling patterns in neighbourhood change: upgrading and downgrading in highly regulated urban housing marketsUrban Geography,  2012This study disentangles the relationship between income and real estate value development in Dutc... more This study disentangles the relationship between income and real estate value development in Dutch urban neighborhoods. Within the literature on upgrading and downgrading, it is often assumed that neighborhood income and real estate value development are strongly linked. The results reported here—based on research in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Tilburg—indicate that income and real estate values develop simultaneously in only a relatively small number of neighborhoods, which are at the top and bottom of the housing market hierarchy. The majority reveal a more complex relationship: a number of neighborhoods show a time lag between the trends, whereas in other neighborhoods income and real estate values show partially diverging trends. Several tentative explanations are offered for the complex relationship, and stress the importance of place-specific knowledge. Three points of attention are suggested for further research: understanding the role of household dynamics, the position of neighborhoods within their urban system, and the role of the state and housing associations in neighborhood change.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In dit themanummer richten we ons daarom juist op andere vormen van verzet uit onverwachte hoek, georganiseerd door gemarginaliseerde bevolkingsgroepen. Dit verzet neemt veelal subtiele, creatieve en ongebruikelijke vormen aan.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Call for papers AAG 2018 (New Orleans): Life course, gentrification and urban inequalityby Willem R. Boterman, Wouter van Gent, and Cody HochstenbachGentrification is generally understood as the class-based transformation of urban space, but it i... more Gentrification is generally understood as the class-based transformation of urban space, but it is also imagined as being connected to young adulthood, as a spatial expression of the time-space trajectories of particular middle-class fractions. Although gentrification studies often do acknowledge age, we argue that life course should be treated as a key dimension to understand gentrification and segregation, and the inequalities it brings about in people's lives cumulatively. Acknowledging the central role of demographic processes in urban transformations may also help us gain insight into the political economies of life course. In urban development, state and market actors may favour certain groups while excluding others, not only across social class but also between generations and life stages. In many contexts, young adults are struggling on the housing market. This is likely to have spatial implications, as specific groups of young adults may be excluded from privileged areas or cities in general. Likewise, the intergenerational transmission of inequalities through housing wealth has spatial impacts. Age and life course may play a broader, more general, role in forging urban inequalities as well. We call for papers that investigate how life course is implicated in gentrification, urban transformation and urban inequality more generally, focussing on differentiation in age and generation. We seek papers from both the Global North and Global South dealing with the following, or related, topics: • The intersections of class and age in gentrification processes • How intergenerational inequalities and the intergenerational transmission of inequalities unfold in urban space • How urban transformations are changing the geography of demographic transitions • The role of generations in historical and contemporary urban transformations • Young people in gentrification processes as both displacers and the displaced • The cumulative effects of housing and neighbourhood trajectories on life course and (dis)advantage • The politics of life course and age in urban development Please submit your abstract (max 250 words), with name, affiliation and contact details, to Willem Boterman (w.r.boterman@uva.nl) before October 18 th. Accepted applicants will be notified by October 20th and asked to register for the AAG conference by 25 October 2017.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
