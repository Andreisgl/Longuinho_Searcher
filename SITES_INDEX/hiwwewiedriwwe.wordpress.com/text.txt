HI I am trying to get a translation of a PA German name for a tradition from my mothers family. The name is “Ahid Vayglen” can you help me with this?
The tradition comes from Berks County and I believe is originally from the Baden Württemberg area of Germany.
Thanks Michael

Hello!  I am PA Dutch with family roots in Annville PA.  I never learned much of the language, but my grandfather spoke it all the time when he was with friends or family who spoke.  Whenever we left his house, he would say “Kum Bah Widda”.  I’m not sure of the spelling, but my understanding was that it meant “come back soon”.  Could you help me clarify?  Thanks!!

Oh my goodness! I am so pleased to find this site! My father was raised Amish and spoke Pennsylvania Dutch, but, although he spoke it when his siblings came to visit, he never spoke it at home as Mama did not know it.
I begged him to teach me, but he only taught me a word here and there.
I always wished I had been able to learn.
I wonder if you could tell me….he had a saying: “it’s a silver nothing in a golden box” which he would always say if we were being too nosy about a present. It was something like “silvere nichtsli een en guldene bixli” I really have no idea if that is right…or how you would spell it. Have you ever heard that phrase?

Hi, I live in Western PA and we seem to have more and more Amish and Mennonite families moving into the area …  I was wondering if you could be kind enough to give me a couple of translations…. the first is “Posted. Private property. Hunting, fishing, trapping or trespassing for any purpose is strictly forbidden. Violators will be prosecuted. Name.  Address.”  Also, “No Doe Hunting”.  And finally, “Posted. Private Property. Hunting, fishing, trapping or trespassing by written permission only.”  (Been having a bit of a trespassing problem as of late).  Not being rude… just notifying….

Linguists named the dialects which are spoken in Northern Germany “Niederdeutsch” (Low German), because they are spoken in an area that is located close to the (North and Baltic) sea. They named “Oberdeutsch” the dialects which are spoken in Southern Germany close to the Bavarian Alps. The dialects which are spoken in between, are called “Mitteldeutsch” (“Middle German”). In this area one can find Hesse and the Palatinate, where most of the ancestors of the Pennsylvania Germans came from (Rhine Valley). Pennsylvania German is derived from a “Middle German” dialect …

Would Penn Dutch be considered closer to “low” German? My father was telling me about his Penn Dutch grandparents, (Indiana), and he cannot remember the answer, but he had remarked once upon the comparison of German dialects with them. (By the way, there was loads of Swiss heritage in his grandfather’s background, if that has any connection?)  Thank you!

Hello, I have to do a presentation about the Amish and I would like to start by speaking Pennsylvania Dutch. Maybe someone could translate me these Phrases in Pennsylvania Dutch. “Hello, maybe you wonder why i don´t speak Englisch and what language i am speaking. It´s a very old language and is called Pennsylvania Dutch. You maybe think which persons speak this language nowadays? I will introduce them now to you…. Thank you very much for your attention”.  It would really appreciate that. :-)

It’s the way, Palatines in Germany speak even today. The lingustic construction was taken along by the emigrants who left the Palatinate in the 18th century and settled in Pennsylvania.

Hi! My name is Alessandra and live in Italy. I’m writing my graduation thesis on Pennsylvaniadutch and  I’m analysing a little text published by HwD. I’m comparing it with Standard German trying to understand why a construction differs from it. In the sentence: “Wie ich en Kind waar, hemmer zwee Telephones deheem uff ‘re Bauerei ghatt”, I don’t understand the use of “wie” in place of “als”…I’ve tought that it could be a loan translation of the English “as”….but in this case it would have been more obvious to use “als” because “as” is derived just from “als”. I hope you can help me….thank you!
My compliments to your magazine….I have written about it in my thesis.

Hi! Found this site with the great videos for learning PA German with Doug Madenford!  My hearing isn’t the best and having a bit of trouble when he uses words beginning with “w” (Wu, Was, weit and such); is the W pronounced as a “V” ?  A little booklet I have, says all Ws in German are pronounced as V, but can’t quite distinguish on the video.  Can someone please clarify?  Thank you!  Pat

Found the page and found It quite entertaining to read your newspaper. I do actually understand every single word it, but I have never learned to read and write it that way. I am German and grew up north of the area where the dialect seems to come from in Germany. I just learned it by using it from the first days of my life, but we do write and read German. Like the Swiss German, which I can only understand if they do write it down and it turns out to be German. SO it is very easy for me to understand as a native “Hessian” German
I worked a while in PA, but I have actually never had the chance to talk to a native Pennsylvanisch-Deitsch speaker.
