Changes in photosynthetic pigments, soluble proteins, soluble starch, starch, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, nitrate reductase, photosynthetic activities and thylakoid membrane proteins were investigated. The level of total chlorophyll and carotenoids were markedly reduced in cypress canker-infected needles. Similar results were also observed for soluble proteins, nitrate reductase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase activity. In contrast, the content of soluble starch and sugar were increased in infected needles. In isolated thylakoids, cypress canker infection caused marked inhibition of whole chain and photosystem II activity while the inhibition of photosystem I activity was only marginal. The artificial exogenous electron donors, diphenyl carbazide and hydroxylamine significantly restored the loss of photosystem II activity in infected needles. The same results were obtained when Fv/Fm was evaluated by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. The marked loss of photosystem II activity in infected needles could be due to the loss of 47, 43, 33, 28, 25, 23, 17 and 15 kDa polypeptides. It is concluded that cypress canker infection inactivates the donor side of photosystem II. This conclusion was confirmed by immunological studies showing that the content of the 33 kDa protein of the water-splitting complex was diminished significantly in infected needles.Download Free PDFView PDFLeaf plasticity to light intensity in Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.): Adaptability of a Mediterranean conifer cultivated in the AlpsNicola  La PortaItalian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.) is native to the eastern Mediterranean, an area characterised by hot, dry summers and mild winters. Over the centuries, however, the species has been introduced into more northerly regions, a long way from its native range. The current, generally warmer climatic conditions brought about by global warming have favoured its cultivation in even more northerly areas in the Alps and other European alpine regions. Given that not only temperature, but also light availability are limiting factors for the spread of cypress in these environments, it is important to ascertain how this species copes with low light conditions. The photosynthetic characteristics of cypress leaves collected from different portions of the crown with contrasting light availability were evaluated by several methods. Chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and carotenoid (Car) content was found to be higher in shade leaves than in sun leaves when measured on a fresh mass basis, although enzymatic activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) and nitrate reductase were lower in shade leaves. When the efficiency of PSII was measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, a marked reduction in F m was found in shade leaves, while F o remained unchanged. The use of exogenous electron donors diphenyl car-bazide (DPC) and NH 2 OH actually improved the photosynthetic efficiency of shade leaves, and the same effect was found when PSII electron transport activity was measured as O 2 evolution. Altogether, these results seem to indicate lesser photosynthetic efficiency in shade leaves, probably an impairment on the donor side of the PSII. At the same time, analysis by SDS–PAGE revealed differences in the polypeptide composition of the thylakoid membranes of sun and shade leaves: the bands corresponding to 23 kDa, 28–25 kDa and 33 kDa polypeptides were less intense in the thylakoid membranes extracted from shade leaves. These results were further confirmed by an immunological study showing that the content of the 33 kDa protein, corresponding to the extrinsic PSII protein PsbO, was significantly diminished in shade leaves. The high plasticity of cypress leaves appears to be an advantageous trait in the plant's response to variations in environmental conditions, including global change. Implications for the management of this Mediterranean species at the northern edge of its distribution are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of PhytopathologyPhotoinhibition and Recovery of Photosynthesis in Canker-susceptible and Resistant Needles of Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L2005 • Massimo  BertaminiThe aim of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that the cypress canker caused by a fungus (Seiridium cardinale) infection induced effects on photosynthesis which could be related to photoinhibition and the process of recovery in susceptible and resistant needles. Photoinhibition of photosynthesis and recovery was studied in canker-infected susceptible and resistant needles of cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.) under controlled conditions (irradiation of detached needles to approximately 1900 μmol/m2/s). The degree of photoinhibition was determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and electron transport measurements. The potential efficiency of photosystem (PS) II, Fv/Fm declined, and Fo increased significantly in canker-susceptible needles, while Fo did not change in resistant needles. In isolated thylakoids, high light (HL) decreased the rate of whole chain and PS II activity markedly more in susceptible than in resistant needles. A smaller reduction of PS I activity was noticed only in susceptible needles. Upon subsequent dark incubation, fast recovery was noticed in both needle types and reached maximum rates of PS II efficiency similar to those noticed in non-photoinhibited needles. The artificial exogenous electron donors such as diphenyl carbazide (DPC), NH2OH and Mn2+ failed to restore the HL induced loss of PS II activity in susceptible needles, while DPC and NH2OH significantly restored it in resistant needles. The results suggest that HL inactivates the donor side of PS II in resistant and the acceptor side of PS II in susceptible needles. The results on the quantification of the PS II reaction centre protein D1 and 33 kDa protein of water-splitting complex following HL exposure showed pronounced differences between susceptible and resistant needles. The marked loss of PS II activity in HL-irradiated needles was due to the marked loss of D1 protein in susceptible and 33 kDa protein in resistant needles, respectively.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Plant PhysiologyPhotoinhibition and recovery of photosynthesis in leaves of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis rupestris2004 • Massimo  BertaminiDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysiological and Molecular Plant PathologyEffect of phytoplasmal infection on photosystem II efficiency and thylakoid membrane protein changes in field grown apple ( Malus pumila) leaves2002 • Massimo  BertaminiDownload Free PDFView PDFPhotosynthetic changes that occur during aging of cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.) needlesNicola  La Porta2-years-old cypress needles (A2) were physiologically most active with regard to net photosynthetic (P N) and electron transport rates. Variable to maximum fluorescence (F v /F m) ratios of dark-adapted needles were higher in A2 needles than in current year (A1) or senescent (A4) needles. Lower F v /F m values in these stages seemed to be caused not by photo-inhibition but by a low photochemical capacity as suggested from the chlorophyll (Chl) a/b ratios. In isolated thylakoids, lower rates of whole chain and photosystem 2 (PS2) activities were observed in A4 needles, while higher rates were observed in A2 needles. A similar trend was noticed for contents of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPC) and total soluble proteins. The artificial exogenous electron donor Mn 2+ failed to restore the loss of PS2 activity in 3-year-old (A3) and A4 needles, while diphenylcarbazide and NH 2 OH significantly restored the loss of PS2 activity. The marked loss of PS2 activity in A4 needles was primarily the result of the loss of 33, 28–25, 23, and 17 kDa polypeptides. A marked loss of RuBPC activity in A4 needles is mainly due to the loss of 15 (SSU) and 55 (LSU) kDa polypeptides.

Clones 52 and 30 under controlled conditions of high irradiation (about 1900 µmol m – 2 s – 1 for 60 min; HL treatment), followed by 60 min in darkness. The degree of photoinhibition was determined based on the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F v /F m), which is a measure of the potential efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), and on electron transport measurements. The F v /F m ratio declined in needles of both clones in response to the HL treatment. Minimal fluorescence (F o) increased in HL-treated needles of both clones. The HL treatment decreased rates of whole-chain and PSII activity of isolated thylakoids more in Clone 52 than in Clone 30. In needles of both clones, PSI activity was less sensitive to photoinhibition than PSII activity. In the subsequent 60-min dark incubation, fast recovery was observed in needles of both clones, with PSII efficiencies reaching similar values to those in non-photoinhibited needles. The artificial exogenous electron donors diphenyl carbazide (DPC), hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) and manganese chloride (MnCl 2) failed to restore the HL-induced loss of PSII activity in needles of Clone 30, whereas DPC and NH 2 OH significantly restored PSII activity in photoinhibited needles of Clone 52. Quantification of the PSII reaction center protein D1 and the 33-kDa protein of the water-splitting complex following HL treatment of needles revealed pronounced differences between Clone 52 and Clone 30. The large decrease in PSII activity in HL-treated needles was caused by the marked loss of D1 protein and 33-kDa protein in Clone 30 and Clone 52, respectively.Download Free PDFView PDFTree PhysiologyPhotoinhibition of photosynthesis in needles of two cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) clones2005 • Massimo  BertaminiDownload Free PDFView PDFBiochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - BiomembranesIsolation and characterization of a thylakoid membrane module showing partial light and dark reactions2005 • Diksha DaniDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
