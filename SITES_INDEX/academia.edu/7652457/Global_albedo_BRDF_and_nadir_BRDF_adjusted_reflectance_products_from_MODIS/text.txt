BRDF model parameters (or weights) are used to compute black sky albedo at local solar noon and white sky albedo and to compute surface reflectance at a common nadir geometry. In addition to these standard resolution albedo, BRDF, and NBAR products, which are provided in the integerized sinusoidal grid projection, the BRDF parameters, black sky albedos (at local solar noon), and white sky albedos are now also being operationally produced in a global geographic projection known as the Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). These are currently available at a 0.25 degree spatial resolution, although there is community interest in a 0.05 degree resolution. In addition to the operational CMGs, coarser 0.5 degree and 1 degree resolution versions of the reprocessed albedo data have also been produced for the ISLSCP-II initiative. The global distribution of these albedos (as they vary throughout the year) are presented, as well as discussions of the most recent evaluations of the quality of the standard products.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRemote Sensing of  …First Operational BRDF, Albedo Nadir Reflectance Products From MODIS2002 • Philip LewisWith the launch of NASA's Terra satellite and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), operational Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo products are now being made available to the scientific community. The MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model and multidate, multispectral data to provide global 1-km gridded and tiled products of the land surface every 16 days. These products include directional hemispherical albedo (black-sky albedo), bihemispherical albedo (white-sky albedo), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted surface Reflectances (MBAR), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The algorithm has been consistently producing albedo and NBAR for the public since July 2000. Initial evaluations indicate a stable BRDF/Albedo Product, where, for example, the spatial and temporal progression of phenological characteristics is easily detected in the NBAR and albedo results. These early beta and provisional products auger well for the routine production of stable MODIS-derived BRDF parameters, nadir reflectances, and albedos for use by the global observation and modeling communities.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geophysical ResearchMODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function and albedo Climate Modeling Grid products and the variability of albedo for major global vegetation types2005 • andreas roeschDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentAccuracy assessment of the MODIS 16-day albedo product for snow: comparisons with Greenland in situ measurements2005 • crystal schaafDownload Free PDFView PDFP5.21 LAND SURFACE ALBEDO, NADIR BRDF-ADJUSTED REFLECTANCE, AND BRDF PRODUCTS FROM THE MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER (MODISChristopher DollDownload Free PDFView PDFIEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote SensingAn algorithm for the retrieval of albedo from space using semiempirical BRDF models2000 • crystal schaafDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geophysical ResearchUse of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer bidirectional reflectance distribution function products to enhance simulated surface albedos2004 • andreas roeschDownload Free PDFView PDFMODIS operational bidirectional reflectance and albedo products2001 • Christopher DollThe MODIS BRDF and albedo science data product (MOD43B) has been providing provisional quality products to the science community since October 2000.
