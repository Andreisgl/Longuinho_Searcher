For some microalgae species, and under certain growth conditions, flocculation can occur naturally. Natural flocculation presents many advantages as it does not require the addition of any flocculants to the culture medium and shows high efficiency rate. But because natural flocculation is so specific to the species and conditions, and thanks to the knowledge accumulated over the last years on flocculation mechanisms, researchers have developed strategies to induce this natural harvesting. In this review, we first decipher at the molecular scale the underlying mechanisms of natural flocculation and illustrate them by selected studies from the literature. Then we describe the developed strategies to induce natural flocculation that include the use of biopolymers, chemically modified or not, or involve mixed species cultures. But all these strategies nee...Save to LibraryDownloadby İrem Güzeler Demir•  7  Chemistry, Biochemical Engineering, Medicine, MultidisciplinarySupplementary material to "Potassium-limitation of forest productivity, part 1: A mechanistic model simulating the effects of potassium availability on canopy carbon and water fluxes in tropical eucalypt standsSave to LibraryDownloadby Vitoria Santos•  5  Environmental Science, Productivity, Canopy, PotassiumYoung Modeling for I lntensi Loblolly Pine Plantations in Southeastern U SIntensively managed loblolly pine stands are often subjected to a variety of silvicultural treatments at t ime of planting or shortly thereafter.

However, most loblolly pine growth-and-yield models predict growth after crown closure has occurred. In this article, we describe the development and implementation of a system of equations designed to simulate growth of loblolly pine before the onset of intraspecific competition. Treatment response functions were also developed for various site pre&#39;paration, herbaceous weed control, and fertilization practices. These functions modify the baseline model predictions to simulate the effects of treatments on tree growth and stand development. This system was incorporated into the PTAEDAZ growth-and-yield simulator to make growth projections f rom time of planting through rotation age for intensively managed stands of loblolly pine in the southeastern United States.

Most of the belowground biomass in older loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forests is in coarse roots, and coarse roots persist longer after harvest than aboveground biomass and fine roots. The main objective was to assess the carbon accumulation in coarse roots of a loblolly pine plantation that was subjected to different levels of management intensity. Total belowground biomass ranged from 56.4 to 62.4 Mt·ha1 and was not affected by treatment. Vegetation control and disking increased pine taproot biomass and decreased hardwood taproot biomass. Pines between tree coarse roots were unaffected by treatment, but hardwoods between tree coarse roots were significantly reduced by vegetation control. Necromass was substantially lower than between-tree biomass, indicating that decomposition of coarse-root biomass from the previous stand was rapid for between-tree coarse roots.

Nigeria as a country is faced with challenges of poor electric power supply due to the challenges from the power holding company of Nigeria (PHCN) which have left many households and isolated areas with no access to electricity. The fact that fossil fuel generators contributes to climate changes, renewable energy such as wind could be the best alternative. This paper presents the numerical design of an off-grid wind energy systems for powering load demand of two bedrooms apartment. The load demand of two bedroom flats were estimated and sizes of wind turbine, storage batteries and inverter with respect to typical load demand were numerically estimated. The performance of three 1 KW horizontal axis wind turbines of the same capacity but from different manufacturers namely; Bergey’s (BWC XL.1), Wind energy (WE.7) and Hummer wind energy (H3.1) were numerically tested  using the average monthly wind ...Save to LibraryDownloadby zayyanu hussaini•  14  Engineering, Geophysics, Physics, ChemistryHighly active carbons on base of biomass waste - nut shellsSave to LibraryDownloadby Galina Dobele•  3  Chemistry, Waste Management, nutSeasonal variations of coastal sedimentary trace metals cycling: Insight on the effect of manganese and iron (oxy)hydroxides, sulphide and organic matterThe combination of analysis, multivariate treatment (PCA) and chemical speciation calculation confirmed the control of Fe, Mn, sulphide and organic matter on metals dynamics in coastal sediments (0-5cm surface sediments and sediments... moreThe combination of analysis, multivariate treatment (PCA) and chemical speciation calculation confirmed the control of Fe, Mn, sulphide and organic matter on metals dynamics in coastal sediments (0-5cm surface sediments and sediments cores) of Toulon Bay (NW Mediterranean). The temporal monitoring of the physic-chemical parameters as well as the dissolved/particulate minor (Fe/Mn) and trace elements (i.e. Ag, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, …) concentrations in porewaters and sediments were assessed. Multivariate treatment revealed different behaviours for marine elements, terrestrial ones and contaminants. Seasonal variations of metals mobilization in porewater were observed, related to diagenesis activity. Element mobility was studied by selective extractions (ascorbate, acid and alkaline) on sediments.

Then the raw material is characterized by physicochemical methods, identifying that it is composed of polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamide. The operating conditions for each chemical recycling process are set at 280 minutes of residence time and 1 kg of raw material. In the same way, the temperature levels to be evaluated are set at 600 and 650° C, while for the concentration of catalyst, levels of 5, 10 and 15% w/w are chosen. The data of the 2x3 experiment design are studied by a statistical analysis of variance ANOVA, with which it is affirmed that both the temperature and catalyst concentration factors, as well as the interaction between them, have an effect in the conversion of the material to pyrolytic oil.

To study the dye removing capacity, leaves of Raphinus sativus (radish) and peels of Citrus sinensis (orange) were utilized. Two adsorption isotherms were studied to explain adsorption equilibrium. The Langmuir isotherm is compatible to adsorption data. Best adsorption capacities for Raphinus sativus and Citrus sinensis were: 3.437 mg/g and 5.844 mg/g correspondingly. Citrus sinensis peels showed more adsorption. The negative values of thermodynamic parameters ∆Go for both adsorbents have shown the feasibility of this process. The results had shown that for removal of Cosmos Red dye, Citrus sinensis (orange) peels are more efficient adsorbent as compared to Raphinus sativus leaves.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Rabia Rehman•  3  Chemistry, Adsorption, Citrus SinensisGenerating Electricity and Production of Ethanol using Kitchen WasteThe methodology of generating electricity and producing ethanol using any sort of kitchen waste (organic) such as cooked rice, vegetables peels, banana peels or any other liquid waste will be the next big step towards creating the green... moreThe methodology of generating electricity and producing ethanol using any sort of kitchen waste (organic) such as cooked rice, vegetables peels, banana peels or any other liquid waste will be the next big step towards creating the green technology. We all are having a lot of kitchen waste in various forms, which ultimately remains unused. In today&#39;s world where the importance of energy and waste management is required the most, this will be one of the most significant things, and is simply generating electricity and producing ethanol using organic waste. India is amongst the largest organic waste producing countries and thus it provides commonly available input in various conformations to be used as lignocelluloses substrate. When it comes to our homes itself, we create almost 45% of organic waste that act as the source for bio ethanol production from the sugars created due to different chemical and biological treatments.

Under these conditions, imaging action is provided only on the surface of distributed targets. The present work describes an imaging method based on the analysis of micro-movements on the Khnum-Khufu Pyramid, which are usually generated by background seismic waves. The results obtained prove to be very promising, as high-resolution full 3D tomographic imaging of the pyramid&#39;s interior and subsurface was achieved. Khnum-Khufu becomes transparent like a crystal when observed in the micro-movement domain. Based on this novelty, we have completely reconstructed internal objects, observing and measuring structures that have never been discovered before.

SINAL7 has the ability to self-ubiquitinate and to mono-ubiquitinate glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase 1 (GAPC1), suggesting a role for both proteins in a hypothetical signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. In this study, the in vivo effects of SINAL7 on plant physiology were examined by over-expressing SINAL7 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Phenotypic and gene expression analyses suggest the involvement of SINAL7 in the regulation of several vegetative parameters, essentially those that affect the aerial parts of the plants. Over-expression of SINAL7 resulted in an increase in the concentrations of hexoses and sucrose, with a concommitant increase in plant biomass, particularly in the number of rosette leaves and stem thickness.

So far, the farmers have not effectively utilized organic materials as fertilizers in agricultural lands. Organic materials which can be used include agricultural waste and animal waste. The existence of alternative fertilizers and in order to support the development of sustainable agriculture, utilizing agricultural waste as the materials to make organic fertilizers is encouraged. Organic fertilizers can be in the forms of manure, compost, and the combination of both. The research was aimed to study the NPPt content in compost from cocoa rind and cow waste.

The exponential growth of the world population, climate variability, and soil degradation are essential factors that require the development of novel agricultural practices to achieve food security. In this context, organo-mineral fertilization has been proposed as a promising approach. Such a concept is based on novel fertilizers formulations combining organic and mineral resources features, which could simultaneously address soil fertility and health issues. The manufacturing processes of organo-mineral fertilizers (OMF) are highly versatile and revolve around the co-processing of organic and mineral matrices. OMF’s peculiarity resides in using systemic methodologies for waste valorization to generate cost-effective and eco-friendly products in alignment with the bio-circular economy.

The use of Agent-Based Simulations can help to identify the factors that cause the number of trucks that are not optimal by looking at the behavior and interaction between the agent actors involved in the tbs collection and transportation process. The results showed the utilization rate of transportation modes increased from 27% to 40% by reducing the number of truck units rented from 177 trucks to 118 trucks and reducing transportation collection costs by 0.225% of the total cost value. With the reduced journey time, the quality of the oil palm is better with the reduction of free fatty acids (FFA) and the average weight loss of fruit.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rizkha Rida•Precision Aquaculture Drone Mapping of the Spatial Distribution of Kappaphycus alvarezii Biomass and CarrageenanThe aquaculture of Kappaphycus alvarezii (Kappaphycus hereafter) seaweed has rapidly expanded among coastal communities in Indonesia due to its relatively simple farming process, low capital costs and short production cycles.

This species is mainly cultivated for its carrageenan content used as a gelling agent in the food industry. To further assist producers in improving cultivation management and providing quantitative information about the yield, a novel approach involving remote sensing techniques was tested. In this study, multispectral images obtained from a drone (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle, UAV) were processed to estimate the fresh and carrageenan weights of Kappaphycus at a cultivation site in South Sulawesi. The UAV imagery was geometrically and radiometrically corrected, and the resulting orthomosaics were used for detecting and classifying Kappaphycus using a random forest algorithm.

These pollutants are toxic and harmful to the ecosystem. The presence of the multicomponent pollutants causes more complications to remove from the water system. The adsorptions were examined in a batch system under certain experimental conditions (pH solution system and contact time). Meanwhile, the FTIR spectrophotometer determines the differences adsorption interaction in silica functional groups before and after adsorption. The results showed that the silanol group of silica gel acted as an adsorption site. In the single systems, the adsorption capacity of silica gel follows the order MB &gt; Cu2+ &gt; Pb2+ of around 84.03; 64.81; and 56.88 mg.L−1, respectively.

Prolonged autonomous existence of integral ecosystems depends on the degree of cyclic use of substances and the coefficient of closure of the ecosystem&#39;s mass-exchange processes. In missions lasting over two years, it becomes more beneficial to reproduce necessary substances inside the system instead of relying on external supplies. This research aims to explore the integration of closed biotechnological cycles, with a focus on the biotechnological cycles of methane and carbon dioxide, in the LSS ATS to achieve a high coefficient of closed circulation of substances and nature-like features. Two methods of ATS crew waste processing are described, and the potential of using methane for additional oxygen generation and food protein biosynthesis in the closed-loop cycle of substances transformation is i...Save to LibraryDownloadby Igor Kabashkin•Abundance, biomass, composition and grazing impact of the sea-ice meiofauna in the North Water, northern Baffin BaySave to LibraryDownloadby Christine Michel•  15  Zoology, Environmental Science, Oceanography, BiomassSource separation increases methane yields for waste-to-energy applications in the personal care product industrySave to LibraryDownloadby Aliyu Yakubu•  10  Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Waste Management, BiogasModelo empírico integral de una plantación de Eucalyptus granáis en Concordia, Entre RíosSave to LibraryDownloadby J.
