On PhilologyAs the Byzantinist Ihor Ševčenko once observed, "Philology is constituting and interpreting the t... more As the Byzantinist Ihor Ševčenko once observed, "Philology is constituting and interpreting the texts that have come down to us. It is a narrow thing, but without it nothing else is possible." This definition accords with Saussure's succinct description of the mission of philology: "especially to correct, interpret, and comment upon the texts." Philology is not just a grand etymological or lexicographical enterprise. It also involves restoring to works as much of their original life and nuances as we can manage. To read the written records of bygone civilizations correctly requires knowledge of cultural history in a broad sense: of folklore, legends, laws, and customs. Philology also encompasses the forms in which texts express their messages, and thus it includes stylistics, metrics, and similar studies. On Philology brings together the papers delivered at a 1988 conference at Harvard University's Center for Literary and Cultural Studies. The topic "What is Philology?" drew an interdisciplinary audience whose main fields of research ran the gamut from ancient Indo-European languages to African-American literature, signaling a certain sense of urgency about a seemingly narrow subject. These papers reveal that the role of philology is more important than ever. At a time when literature in printed form has taken a back seat to television, film, and music, it is crucial that scholars be able to articulate why students and colleagues should care about the books with which they work. Just as knowledge will be lost if philological standards decline, so too will fields of study die if their representatives cannot find meaning for today's readers. On Philology will be of interest not only to students of philology but also to anyone working in the fields of hermeneutics, literature, and communication.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The gathering took place on Saturday, March 19, 1988 at Harvard University under the aegis of the Center for Literary and Cultural Studies. The depth and breadth of interest in the conference was deeply gratifying. I had not experienced another occasion when so many scholars from different language and literature departments gathered at Harvard, and I hope that publishing the proceedings will benefit a larger community outside the University. By way of introduction I will describe how the event originated. My description will explore a few of the reasons why an interdisciplinary conference of a dozen speakers and respondents attracted an audience of more than two hundred, and why a topic that 'may sound rarefied drew participants whose main fields of research and teaching interests ran the gamut from the most ancient Indo-European languages to the most recent African American literature. In short, I will offer tentative explanations for the urgency of the topic to students, professors, and independent scholars who engage in philology, linguistics, literary history, literary criticism, and literary theory."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This assumption can, however, be challenged by moving away from the conventional antagonism – philology vs scepticism – in order to identify the sceptical elements within philology itself. Instead of asking ‘how effective an antidote to scepticism is philology?', the more relevant question is: ‘how can philology cope with its own inner scepticism?’ By attempting to answer this question, the workshop will help us to see textual criticism as a fresh source for understanding sceptical trends of thought. - See more at: http://renaissance-events.blogspot.com/2012/05/marriage-of-philology-and-scepticism.html#sthash.RklpKo1m.dpufSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This and other related concepts conventionally assigned to the sceptical tradition are identified and explored in the activity of scholars and editors, whose varying degree of philosophical awareness does not detract from the significance of their ways of conceiving, or coping with, textual uncertainty. The methods of the history of ideas and of classical scholarship are combined in an effort to bring out the methodological assumptions of specific philological projects, editorial strategies and technical devices, as well as to track their possible overlap and interplay with patterns of thought revolving around notions such as uncertainty and conjectural knowledge. The eight papers confront an array of problems, texts, scholars and intellectual contexts, from introductory assessments of the nature of Greek scepticism, particularly in its relation to ancient grammar and medieval thought, to in-depth analyses of the semantic family of uncertainty, as well as of the notion of divination; from case studies of the textual transmission, and relevant editorial problems, of Seneca and Lucretius, to explorations of larger debates in the area of biblical philology, with special attention paid to key figures such as Patrick Young, Richard Bentley and Anthony Collins.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The spoken, dew beneath morning sun, melt into vapor. The written, letters etched into inscriptions, endure. The durability, at first counterintuitive, explains Horace's boast that an ode was his monument, more eternal than bronze. Old-time Romans, like older Americans, often got it right. This paradox of frailty and durability, with its conjoined twin of mortality and immortality, calls for loving care in every noun and verb we touch. Like various other breakables, words matter. For our species, for our family, they stand as testimony and destiny. Today we have lost the dialogue we could conduct live with Dad until December 2020, with Mom into January this very year. Their favorite expressions, warm accents, still hang in the air, her near-imperative "You will be interested," his endearment "buddy" on the phone. Both individuals abide, beloved, with and within us, yet the conversation has shifted forevermore. In mind and heart, I talk to them even now, but boy do I wish I had asked and said more while they could speak back. The supremely simple "Thank you" and "I love you" top the list of regrets about things unsaid. (Millennials, heed the advice, if you want an easy Father's Day gift.) Mom and Dad met young in a college town and fell in neverending love. The municipality remains, no question, but major faces and features have disappeared. Only family legend, fading, tells of Miss Vickery, Irene and Olga. College grew into university; buildings and personalities vanished that rendered community familiar. As in their cherished Princeton and Berlin, the lone constant is change. Yet however much this place has altered, Mom and Dad have returned home. True, they were always, together, zu Hause. Their union had bizarre inevitability, Yetta daughter of the sole Pole in Lincoln and Talladega County, Ted son of the only one in Montevallo and Shelby.

Herren on his 65th Birthday,  2006The essays here gathered focus, though not exclusively, on the insular Latin of Ireland and Engla... more The essays here gathered focus, though not exclusively, on the insular Latin of Ireland and England, as well as on some Irish centres on the Continent such as St. Gall. Some thirty years ago Michael Herren burst on the medieval Latin scene with his edition and translation of the notoriously difficult Hisperica Famina, and followed this a few years later with his translation of the prose works of Aldhelm. Notice was given that a junior scholar, unafraid to tackle some of the most obscure, complex, and arcane Latin, wished to make it accessible to non-Latinists as well as to those Latinists who lacked his particular skills. Not content with labouring alone in that field, Herren gathered scholars in Toronto to a conference on “Insular Latin Studies,” the proceedings of which he published two years later. Over the years he shed considerable light on such obscure texts and authors as Virgilius Maro Grammaticus, John Scottus Eriugena, and the Cosmographia by the pseudonymous Aethicus Ister. His research trail led him again and again to Ireland, and the Irish contribution to early medieval Latinity and to English, Carolingian, and even Italian culture. Recognizing the rich diversity of medieval Latin, Herren in 1990 founded The Journal of Medieval Latin and has, as its editor, provided a home for medieval Latinists of all stripes. The fourteen colleagues and former students who have contributed to the present volume wish to express their thanks to Herren for creating a venue in which medieval Latinists can come together, exchange ideas, learn from each other, and teach each other. In their careers, they have all learned from Herren who either supervised their theses or performed editorial magic on articles submitted to The Journal of Medieval Latin. The essays here gathered focus, though not exclusively, on the insular Latin of Ireland and England, as well as on some Irish centres on the Continent such as St. Gall. The Hisperica Famina, so strongly associated with Herren, though mentioned only in passing by some of the studies here, provides the half-line which was chosen as the title and the most suitable address to Herren: insignis sophiae arcator – “excellent teacher of wisdom.”  Gregory Hays, Flumen Orationis – Haijo Jan Westra, Frisians, Saxons, and Franks: Ethnogenesis and Ethnic Identity in Roman and Early Medieval Sources – Scott G.

This process of domesticating texts was fundamentally creative and might more accurately be described as 'reconstruction'. The essays in Germanic Texts and Latin Models: Medieval Reconstructions explore the ways in which Latin texts and traditions were reconstructed in Old English, Old Icelandic and Old High German and cover a range of genres: legal texts, genealogies, histories, and poetry. They examine how medieval Germanic authors negotiated the need to transmit their models while at the same time fulfilling their own political, artistic and didactic objectives in the creation of vernacular texts. These new studies demonstrate the variety of ways in which medieval Germanic texts were indebted to their Latin exemplars, while reflecting their new culturally specific circumstances in the complex nexus of Latin learning and Germanic lore.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The era once dismissed as a "Dark Age" now turns out to have been the long morning of the medieval millennium: the centuries from AD 500 to 1000 witnessed the dawn of developments that were to shape Europe for centuries to come. In 2004, historians, art historians, archaeologists, and literary specialists from Europe and North America convened at Harvard University for an interdisciplinary conference exploring new directions in the study of that long morning of medieval Europe, the early Middle Ages. Invited to think about what seemed to each the most exciting new ways of investigating the early development of western European civilization, this impressive group of international scholars produced a wide-ranging discussion of innovative types of research that define tomorrow's field today. The contributors, many of whom rarely publish in English, test approaches extending from using ancient DNA to deducing cultural patterns signified by thousands of medieval manuscripts of saints' lives. They examine the archaeology of slave labor, economic systems, disease history, transformations of piety, the experience of power and property, exquisite literary sophistication, and the construction of the meaning of palace spaces or images of the divinity. The book illustrates in an approachable style the vitality of research into the early Middle Ages, and the signal contributions of that era to the future development of western civilization. The chapters cluster around new approaches to five key themes: the early medieval economy; early medieval holiness; representation and reality in early medieval literary art; practices of power in an early medieval empire; and the intellectuality of early medieval art and architecture. Michael McCormick's brief introductions open each part of the volume; synthetic essays by accomplished specialists conclude them. The editors summarize the whole in a synoptic introduction. All Latin terms and citations and other foreign-language quotations are translated, making this work accessible even to undergraduates. The Long Morning of Medieval Europe: New Directions in Early Medieval Studies presents innovative research across the wide spectrum of study of the early Middle Ages. It exemplifies the promising questions and methodologies at play in the field today, and the directions that beckon tomorrow.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unat... more The hero Walter of Aquitaine (or Spain) is probably known best in German-speaking countries. Unattested in any historical writings from within centuries of his alleged existence, he earned his renown from legends preserved mainly in literary texts. Less generally recognized (and still sometimes disputed) is Walter's varied afterlife in Romance literature, where he and his story are attested first in Old French and Occitan and later in Spanish. From the perspective of ballad scholarship, materials connected with Walter are particularly significant for the conundrum of connections between on the one hand the early medieval Germanic and Latin materials and on the other ballads in Spanish and related languages and dialects from the late Middle Ages down to today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its premise is that the various Souths—from the North American South to the European South, Latin and Central America, Africa, Asia, and Australia—share comparable experiences that differentiate them from mainstream and hegemonic cultures in their locations.   Since many of these Souths share not necessarily a common wealth, but various issues of marginalization and inadequate access to means of production and amenities under globalization, TGS is concerned with the intersections among their experiences."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Cambridge songs (Carmina Cantabrigiensia)"The Cambridge Songs (Carmina Cantabrigiensia) are a collection of Goliardic medieval Latin poems... more "The Cambridge Songs (Carmina Cantabrigiensia) are a collection of Goliardic medieval Latin poems found on ten leaves (ff. 432–41) of the Codex Cantabrigiensis (C, MS Gg. 5.35), now at the Cambridge University Library. The songs as they survive are copies made shortly before or after the Norman Conquest (1066). They may have been collected by an English scholar while travelling on the continent sometime after the last datable song (1039), and brought back with him to the church of Saint Augustine at Canterbury, where they were copied and where the Codex was long kept. The original manuscript was possibly lost in a fire that struck Saint Augustine's in 1168. The dialect of the few vernacular portions found in some of the songs is in the North Rheno-Franconian dialect of Old High German, suggesting that the Goliard(s) who composed them came from the north or middle Rhineland, probably the area between Trier, Cologne, and Xanten. It has been suggested that some of the songs originated in France or Italy. While most of the Cambridge Songs survive only in the Cambridge manuscript, a few are duplicated in a manuscript, W, from Wolfenbüttel. The Cambridge Songs were long thought to be forty-nine in number, but a missing folio that contained twenty-seven more was discovered in Frankfurt and returned to the University Library in 1982. All these songs were copied in the same hand. Seven songs in a different hand, but occurring in the same Codex (after the first forty-nine) have since been identified as probably part of the collection. The total number of Cambridge Songs is now considered to be eighty-three. Some of the verses are neumed and it is assumed that the entire collection was to be sung. Four of the original forty-nine are called modi (melodies, namely sequences). The purpose of the collection has also eluded scholars. It was probably either a book of instruction on Latin verse, a songbook for wandering minstrels (or the clerici vagabundi, vagabond clerics), or an anthology for private enjoyment.--Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Songs"Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The author's thesis-that these early writers were pioneers working with a new genre and therefore had a freedom forced upon them-permits him to employ a formalistic approach showing how the underlying meaning of these works is often determined by the writers' use of classical and Christian source materials. Ziolkowski's source work, along with his translations, is itself a pioneering effort, making a little-known group of poems more accessible to both specialists and nonspecialists." -- Michael P. Kuczynski, Speculum, 1994 "Although fables of course figure largely in medieval beast literature, the use of animal characters extends far beyond the exemplary genre. The Owl and the Nightingale, Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale and The Parliament of Fowls, the Roman de Renart and its analogues in other languages, all witness to the range of texts in which animals speak up. The present study focuses on the Latin development. In that tradition, one of the arguable masterpieces of twelfth-century literature, the Ysengrimus, and one of the same period's most successful and widely read works, Nigel Whiteacre's Speculum stultorum (Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Daun Burnel the Asse), both employ the anthropomorphic mode." -- David Townsend, The Review of English Studies, 1996Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Alan of Lille's grammar of sex : the meaning of grammar to a twelfth-century intellectualTwentieth-century readers have not always admired the elaborate literary artifice with which Alan... more Twentieth-century readers have not always admired the elaborate literary artifice with which Alan of Lille, the twelfth-century theologian, poet, and philosopher, composed his prosimetrum Deplanctu naturae. 'Those who have read it to the end — a small company — and those only, can understand how speedily amused contempt turns into contempt without amusement, and how even contempt at last settles into something not far removed from a rankling personal hatred of the author', claims C. S. Lewis. During his own age, Alan was judged very differently. Both De planctu naturae and Anticlaudianus, his epic poem, were copied in hundreds of manuscripts during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and were studied and used byvernacular authors such as Jean de Meun, Dante, and Chaucer. In his scholarly and lucid monograph, Jan Ziolkowski helps the modern reader to understand and share this appreciation of Alan's work by introducing him to an area of culture familiar to a medieval audience, but now obscure: the study of grammar. Many of the most apparently rebarbative passages in De planctu naturae turn out to be elegant wit once their relation to Alan's central grammatical conceit is grasped. Impropriety in grammar (and versification) stands for sexual impropriety. For homosexuality —which it is Alan's particular purpose to decry — there are a number of especially appropriate grammatical metaphors: in using 'Venus's grammar', some men 'embrace only the masculine gender'; the 'active sex' degenerates into the 'passive'; the same term 'is both subject and predicate'. After a chapter devoted to a detailed examination of such metaphors in De planctu, Professor Ziolkowski broadens the scope of his survey. First, he shows that the figurative use of grammatical terms to describe sexual relationships was not an idiosyncrasy of Alan's: it is found in the writings of many places and periods, from ancient Greece and Rome to medieval Islam and the medieval West, where it was particularly popular among Alan's near-contemporaries, such as the poet Walter of Chatiilon and the literary theorist Geoffrey of Vinsauf. Grammatical metaphors were common in those cultures because in all of them the study of grammar was an important part of education. So Ziolkowski goes on — in a wide-ranging survey — to describe the role of grammar in the school curriculum of Alan's time. Then, by considering the relations between grammar and twelfth-century theology, he brings his broader discussion back to Alan. Although theologians were highly trained in grammar, they were aware of its limitations within their subject: the Bible's Latin is sometimes faulty, but its authority is irrefragable; and, indeed, some mysteries of the faith (such as the Trinity, which is both one and many) seem to defy normal grammar. Alan shared this ambivalent attitude and, as Professor Ziolkowski illustrates, this made grammatical metaphors an important tool for him in describing divine things: just as he likens sexual aberrance from natural order to grammatical solecism, so be compares God's miraculous deviation from the rule of nature to grammatical novelty. When God becomes incarnate, 'a new trope is created . . . a new construction. A new rhetorical color appears in this compounding, a new metaphor'. Professor Ziolkowski does more than merely illuminate an interesting but particular aspect of a talented and influential twelfth-century writer. He also provides an excellent, brief, general introduction to medieval ideas about grammar and to the work of Alan of Lille. Both subjects have often suffered in recent presentations from the narrowness of modern scholarly disciplines: grammar is viewed, for instance, exclusively in the context of medieval interest in the classics, or exclusively in the context of logical and semantic theories; Alan is seen either as a poet, or as a philosopher, or as a theologian. By contrast, Ziolkowski shows how the literary, logical, ethical, and theological implications of grammatical study were interrelated in the twelfth century, and how they were brought together in many of Alan's writings. Had C. S. Lewis lived to read this study, perhaps he would have found his attitude to Alan much altered and rancour replaced hy understanding and even admiration." --John Marenbon, Modern Language Review, 1988Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Dès lors, le thème du « sens du temps » a semblé aux organisateurs du VII e Congrès du Comité International de Latin médiéval, qui s'est tenu à Lyon du 10 au 13 septembre 2014, propre à favoriser le dialogue entre spécialistes de grammaire et d'historiographie, de philosophie et de poésie, d'histoire des sciences et de théologie, tous aptes à alimenter une réflexion sur le sujet à partir des documents les plus divers. C'est ce souci d'interdisciplinarité qu'entend refléter ici un large choix de communications présentées à l'occasion du Congrès. Medieval Latin is, in itself, a representation of the passage of time – an old language but still present, a taught language but not extinct. Consequently, it is tirelessly reshaped to meet the needs, abilities and aspirations of its users. It provides the paradigm of the relationship between the passing of time and the unchanging ideal. The organisers of the 7th Congress of the International Medieval Latin Committee, chose the fitting theme of Sense of time to stimulate dialogue on the subject among experts. These experts included specialists in Latin grammar, historiography, poetry, philosophy, theology and the history of science – bringing a rich array of original contributions to the discussion from a wide variety of texts. The range of texts and contributions presented at this Congress illustrates the need for interdisciplinarity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

During the meeting of the Board in Toronto, Gunilla Iversen first proposed as theme “authoritative texts and textual authorities”. Michael Herren then suggested “Auctoritas in the Latin Middle Ages”, in the sense of reflection about auctoritas in Medieval Latin texts, and about the auctoritas of Medieval Latin texts. The precise title eventually emerged from a proposal from Walter Berschin and Gunilla Iversen: Auctor et Auctoritas in Latinis Medii Aevi litteris. The Board was keen to promote profound reflection on the concept of auctoritas in medieval culture. They had in mind consideration of the authority of Latin as an oral and written language; the authority of writing, authors, and their sources; the relation between anonymous and declared authorship; and other, related issues."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Are there ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ versions? And where do they come from? These and many other related questions are addressed in Writing Down the Myths, a collection of critical studies of the contents of some of the most famous mythographic works from ancient, classical, medieval, and modern times, and of the methods, motivations, and ideological implications underlying these literary records of myth. While there are many works on myth and mythology, and on the study of this genre of traditional narrative, there is little scholarship to date on the venerable activity of actually writing down the myths (mythography), attested throughout history, from the cultures of the ancient Middle East and the Mediterranean to those of the modern world. By assembling studies of the major literary traditions and texts through a variety of critical approaches, this collection poses - and seeks to answer - key questions such as these: how do the composers of mythographic texts choose their material and present them; what are the diverse reasons for preserving stories of mythological import and creating these mythographic vessels; how do the agenda and criteria of pre-modern writers still affect our popular and scholarly understanding of myth; and do mythographic texts (in which myths are, so to speak, captured by being written down) signal the rebirth, or the death, of mythology?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article considers the fortunes of Medieval Latin literature in Modern English translation. The translation of Medieval Latin into English has received only very short shrift. Medieval Latin played only a marginal role in the process: professionalization presupposes a profit motive that is rarely imaginable where Medieval Latin texts or translations are at stake. Despite the cultural significance that is accorded to Latin books, the decision of which texts to translate and publish is governed largely by purely commercial factors. Cultural institutions counterbalance the market, and Latin has suffered from lacking such institutional backing. In the second half of the twentieth century, a few prolific translators who earned their livings through their craft became well known among readers of high-cultural literature. The dearth of professional translators of Medieval Latin results partly from the fragile status of translating within the large culture and especially within academic culture, but it also reflects the marginality of medieval Latin literature.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

First, I will examine the relationship between being a disciple and being a student, then the important place in discipleship and studentship occupied by imitation of the apostolic past, and finally the threat that the attraction of followers to charismatic masters posed to the Church (and to the masters). My contention is that the long twelfth century witnessed an intersection between the concepts of discipleship and studentship—that disciples and discipuli were one and the same much more often than has commonly been the case.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Both the programme and the lectures focus on editorial method and theory as applied to dynamic textual traditions of medieval Latin and Greek works. For the Lecture Series, leading scholars are invited to share their expertise regarding textual criticism and the art of editing. In this volume, the first in a planned series of four, Nigel Wilson guides future editors to new challenges and indicates how their work will be markedly different on account of advances in related technologies. In Jan Ziokowski's lecture, new technology is also strongly present as he reflects on the future of the printed book and the work of critical editing in the digital age. Technology of a more specific kind is treated by Timothy Janz, who accounts for a method under development to identify scribes with more certainty by their script alone. In the last two lectures here, the focus shifts from hard technology to a greater sensitivity in the editing of texts as regards both linguistic forms and aesthetics in the Middle Ages. Peter Stotz examines the first volume of the Corpus rhythmorum musicum, giving examples of where such a sensitivity can create more credible editions. Pascale Bourgain emphasizes the importance of a stylistic awareness on behalf of the editor and how the lack of it can distort the author's original sense.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The 'Gregorian Chants', mostly words from passages of the Old Testament, were reinterpreted and ornamented by means of new lyrics, and became the basis for new literary and musical genres, such as tropes, sequences, and other new lyrics. In spite of all the unifying efforts made by the Carolingian reformers, it is the rich variety in practice that came to characterize the performance of the Mass in the ninth through the twelfth centuries. Extensive repertories of new texts and melodies were spread in manuscripts all over Europe. Until now this fascinating material has been the preserve of a small circle of specialists in musicology and philology. With this volume, the author introduces and analyses these hidden treasures to make them available to a wider public. It is directed to those with an interest in the expressions of spiritual, musical, and poetic creativity of the European Middle Ages, and in the philosophy, theology, and history of medieval Latin literature.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this book, essays by leading scholars analyse how the medieval arts invited and delighted in collaborative performances designed to persuade. The essays cast fresh light on subjects ranging from pilgrim processions within Chartres Cathedral, to polyphonic song, and the 'rhetoric of silence' perfected by the Cistercians. Rhetoric is defined broadly in this book to encompass its relationship to its sister arts of music, architecture, and painting, all of which use materials and media in addition to words, sometimes altogether without words. Contributors have concentrated on those aspects of formal rhetoric that are performative in nature, the sound, gesture and facial expressions of persuasive speech in action. Delivery (performance) is shown to be at the heart of rhetoric, that aspect of it which is indeed beyond words.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Considered collectively, the contents illustrate the transmission of this important literary kind from Ancient to Modern times, and from east to west, from south to north. The Romantic age led to the lyric being seen as the dominant poetical mode, and today it has become almost axiomatic to view the chief function of poetry as the articulation of the thoughts and emotions of the individual; a concomitant assumption is that the essential quality of poetry is the aesthetic. However, in other cultures, and in earlier times, things were very different, and the didactic was long accorded a secure place as one of several prominent literary modes. While it is difficult to give a precise definition of the didactic, it may be said to be characteristically concerned with knowledge and wisdom, where the latter term inclines toward moral and religious instruction, and the former toward information both practical and encyclopaedic. The present contributions deal with the functioning of didactic verse in such widely diverse areas as: education in school; mnemotechnics; rhetoric, style and composition; farming; grammar; the natural world; cultural identity; liturgy and worship; aetiology; philosophy; politics; intertextuality; man as microcosm; the training of the soul; gender awareness. Truly, the classroom presided over by Calliope, the chief of muses, is no arid intellectual forcing-house but rather a place where the resources of rhetoric, learning and imagination are felicitously combined in the training of the individual mind and the betterment of society in general.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cet auteur est bien sur loin d'être le premier médiévistes à s'intéresser à cette zone limitrophe qui s'identifie à, ou qui se trouve au-delà de, la circonférence des cartes médiévales. A titre d'exemple, souvenons-nous des études publiées depuis plus de dix ans qui traitent des marges du monde classique, aussi bien que des marges des manuscrits médiévaux. Dans le sillage de cet intérêt apporte a la marge est apparu un renforcement des oppositions parfois conflictuelles entre le chrétien et son Autre - en règle générale son Autre musulman. Grace à Edward Saïd et aux nombreux héritiers de sa pensée, les attitudes vis-à-vis de l'Orient ont reçu, pour ainsi dire, une nouvelle orientation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
An Introduction to Dag Norberg's IntroductionDag Norberg’s analysis and interpretation of Medieval Latin versification, which was published in... more Dag Norberg’s analysis and interpretation of Medieval Latin versification, which was published in French in 1958 and remains the standard work on the subject, appears here for the first time in English with a detailed, scholarly introduction by Jan Ziolkowski that reviews the developments of the past fifty years. Norberg examines various theories of Medieval Latin metrics and proposes his own insightful empirical solutions. His interpretation brings much needed clarification to a controversial and misunderstood subject. In the first four chapters of the book, Norberg analyzes the sometimes perplexing technical elements of Medieval Latin metrics: prosody, accentuation, synaeresis, diaeresis, prosthesis, elision, hiatus, assonance, rime, and alliteration. He then turns to some of the metrical devices of the poetry: acrostics, carmina figurata (shaped songs), and the like. Two chapters unravel the problems of quantitative and rhythmic verses. Two chapters are devoted to the fractious disputes among scholars over rhythmic verses, which are based on the stress accents of the words. Norberg evaluates the various theories and judiciously examines this area of Latin scholarship. The final two chapters discuss the relationship between music and poetry, considering such questions as, which was written first, the melody or the words? How can we tell? What is the origin of rhythmic poetry? Beginning with the earliest hymns of Augustine and Ambrose, he considers syllabic melodies and then the development of non-syllabic melodies. In the last chapter Norberg deals with the "poetry in liturgical prose" of the Christian religious service, a "poetry" borrowed from the Bible or based on Biblical models.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

T... more &quot;The Romantic Tale&quot; of Peter Abelard and Heloise has been widely known for centuries. The legend relates in part to the letters exchanged between the two, years after Abelard had been castrated at the behest of Heloise&#39;s vindictive uncle, Fulbert. These &quot;personal&quot; letters form the basis for bestselling compilations of works by Abelard and Heloise in translation, such as the recently revised Penguin &quot;The Letters of Abelard and Heloise&quot; or the new Hackett Abelard and Heloise, &quot;The Letters and Other Writings&quot;. They hold fascination for the light they shed on the relationship between the man and woman, as teacher and student, lovers, husband and wife, monk and nun, abbot and mother superior, and much more. The popularity of the &quot;personal&quot; letters has generated considerable fanfare for the publication of another set of correspondence printed under the title &quot;The Lost Love Letters of Heloise and Abelard&quot;. The authorship of all these letters has been contested repeatedly, with the last-mentioned collection being the center of a present firestorm. Generally ignored have been nearly a dozen other letters or letter-like texts, unassailably the work of Peter Abelard. Jan M. Ziolkowski&#39;s comprehensive and learned translation of these texts affords insight into Abelard&#39;s thinking over a much longer sweep of time and offers snapshots of the great twelfth-century philosopher and theologian in a variety of contexts. Broadening our panorama of the twelfth-century Renaissance, the picture presented by these texts complements, complicates, and enriches Abelard&#39;s autobiographical letter of consolation and his personal letters to Heloise.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article considers the fortunes of Medieval Latin literature in Modern English translation. The translation of Medieval Latin into English has received only very short shrift. Medieval Latin played only a marginal role in the process: professionalization presupposes a profit motive that is rarely imaginable where Medieval Latin texts or translations are at stake. Despite the cultural significance that is accorded to Latin books, the decision of which texts to translate and publish is governed largely by purely commercial factors. Cultural institutions counterbalance the market, and Latin has suffered from lacking such institutional backing. In the second half of the twentieth century, a few prolific translators who earned their livings through their craft became well known among readers of high-cultural literature. The dearth of professional translators of Medieval Latin results partly from the fragile status of translating within the large culture and especially within academic culture, but it also reflects the marginality of medieval Latin literature.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Trebizond, which stretched along the coast of the Black Sea, outlasted numerous rivals and invaders until its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1461. Though this empire has fascinated writers from Cervantes to Dorothy Dunnett, few Trapezuntine writings survive.This volume presents translations from the Greek of two crucial primary sources published together for the first time: On the Emperors of Trebizond and Encomium on Trebizond. In the fourteenth century, Michael Panaretos, the emperor’s personal secretary, penned the only extant history of the ruling dynasty, including key details about foreign relations. The encomium by Bessarion (1403–1472), here in English for the first time, praises the author’s native city and retells Trapezuntine history from antiquity to his own moment. It provides enlightening perspectives on Byzantine identity and illuminating views of this major trading hub along the Silk Road.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At a turbulent time when England was under increasingly severe Viking attack, the examples of these saints modeled courageous faith, self-sacrifice, and individual and collective resistance. The Lives also covers topics as diverse as the four kinds of war, the three orders of society, and whether the unjust can be exempt from eternal punishment. Ælfric intended this series to complement his Catholic Homilies, two important and widely disseminated collections used for preaching to lay people and clergy. The translation is presented alongside a new edition of Lives of Saints, for which all extant manuscripts have been collated afresh.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This volume presents the first English translation of what may have been his source, the anonymous First Variant Version. This shorter and less polished Latin version of the History is attested in just a handful of manuscripts.

The scholar, poet, and teacher John Tzetzes (ca. 1110–1180) joined the extensive tradition of interpreting Homer by producing his Allegories of the Iliad, dedicated to the foreign-born empress Eirene. Tzetzes later composed the Allegories of the Odyssey, a more advanced verse commentary, to explain Odysseus’s journey and the pagan gods and marvels he encountered. Through historical allegory, the gods become ancient kings deified by the pagan poet; through astrological interpretation, they become planets whose positions and movements affect human life; through moral allegory Athena represents wisdom, Aphrodite desire.

Architrenius’s quest for moral instruction leads through vivid tableaux of the vices of school, court, and church, from the House of Gluttony to the Palace of Ambition to the Mount of Presumption. Despite the allegorical nature of Architrenius, its focus is not primarily religious. Johannes de Hauvilla, who taught at an important cathedral school, probably Rouen, uses his stylistic virtuosity and the many resources of Latin poetry to condemn a secular world where wealth and preferment were all-consuming. His highly topical satire anticipates the comic visions of Jean de Meun, Boccaccio, and Chaucer.This edition of Architrenius brings together the most authoritative Latin text with a new English translation of an important medieval poem.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Together, these works illuminate one of the most obscure periods of Greek history—when holy men played central roles as the Byzantine administration reimposed control on southern and central Greece in the wake of Avar, Slavic, and Arab attacks and the collapse of the late Roman Empire. The bishops of the region provided much-needed leadership and institutional stability, while ascetics established hermitages and faced invaders. The Lives gathered here include accounts of Peter of Argos, which offers insight into episcopal authority in medieval Greece, and Theodore of Kythera, an important source for the history of piracy in the Aegean Sea.This volume, which illustrates the literary variety of saints’ Lives, presents Byzantine Greek texts written by locals in the provinces and translated here into English for the first time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Topics treated at length include methods for beginning and ending a composition, techniques for expanding and abbreviating a text, varieties of figurative language, attributes of persons and actions, and the art of letter writing.This anonymous treatise, related especially closely to work by Geoffrey of Vinsauf, served as a textbook for rhetorical composition at Oxford.

These stories,... more Throughout the Middle Ages, Christians wrote about Islam and the life of Muhammad. These stories, ranging from the humorous to the vitriolic, both informed and warned audiences about what was regarded as a schismatic form of Christianity. Medieval Latin Lives of Muhammad covers nearly five centuries of Christian writings on the prophet, including accounts from the farthest-flung reaches of medieval Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Byzantine Empire. Over time, authors portrayed Muhammad in many guises, among them: Theophanes’s influential ninth-century chronicle describing the prophet as the heretical leader of a Jewish conspiracy; Embrico of Mainz’s eleventh-century depiction of Muhammad as a former slave who is manipulated by a magician into performing unholy deeds; and Walter of Compiègne’s twelfth-century presentation of the founder of Islam as a likable but tricky serf ambitiously seeking upward social mobility.The prose, verse, and epistolary texts in Medieval Latin Lives of Muhammad help trace the persistence of old clichés as well as the evolution of new attitudes toward Islam and its prophet in Western culture.

Their collections, aptly called “various verses,” greatly range in length and style—including epigrams, polemics, encomia, and more—and their poems were written for a broad range of social occasions such as court ceremonies, horse races, contests between schools, and funerals. Some were inscribed on icons and buildings. Many honored patrons and friends, debunked rivals, or offered satirical portraits of moral types in contemporary society. In some remarkable introspective poems, Mauropous carefully shaped a narrative of his life and career, while Christopher’s body of work is peppered with riddles and jocular wordplay.

Bringing together cartography, history, philosophy, philology, reception studies, religious studies, and other disciplines, these essays tap into knowledge and skills from specialists in the medieval West, Byzantium, and Dante. The twelve contributors discuss the presence of ancient Greek poetry, philosophy, and science (astrology, cosmography, geography) in Dante’s writings, as well as the Greek characters who populate his works. Some of these individuals were drawn indirectly from ancient mythography, Homeric epic, and other such sources, while others were historically attested personages, down to Dante’s own era. Greek was not only a language and civilization of the past, but also a present (and often rival) religious and political entity. To each layer—ancient pagan, early Christian, and contemporary Byzantine—Latins related differently. Doctrinal, political, linguistic, cultural, and educational matters all played important roles in shaping the attitudes that form the focal point for this volume, which sets the stage for further engagement with Dante’s corpus in its cultural settings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The roll of documents translated and edited in this volume preserves the most detailed statistical portrait before the Domesday Book of the finances, monuments (including exact dimensions), and female and male personnel of any major Christian church. Setting these documents in the context of economic trends, archaeological evidence, and a comparison of Holy Land churches and monasteries with their contemporaries west and east, this study shows that the Palestinian church was living in decline as its old financial links with Byzantium slackened. In recounting Charlemagne’s move to outflank the Byzantine emperor, McCormick constructs a microhistory of the Frankish king’s ambitions and formidable organizational talents for running an empire. Supplementing McCormick’s major synthesis, The Origins of the European Economy, this volume will be indispensable reading for anyone interested in medieval rulership and economics, and in the history of the Holy Land, its Christian communities, and its late antique monuments.  "At its worst, microhistory is merely antiquarian button counting. But at its best, as exemplified here, small things serve as touchstones for studies of wider-ranging significance. McCormick examines the Basel Roll, a ninth-century manuscript relating the information gathered by envoys of Charlemagne, who inquired into the financial needs of churches in and around Jerusalem. The roll preserves three documents that provide personnel numbers and sizes of building roofs in area churches and monasteries, as well as partial annual expenditures for the patriarch of Jerusalem...McCormick shows that the Jerusalem church had shrunk since late antiquity; that contemporary Frankish houses were larger and richer; and that Einhard did not exaggerate Charlemagne's interest in faraway Christian communities. Among the many strengths of the book is the full-size facsimile of the Basel Roll included as a stand-alone poster. (C. J.

How to Defeat the Saracens, William of Adam; Text and Translation with Notes, PDF excerptDumbarton Oaks Medieval Humanities,  Aug 2010The fall of the crusader-controlled city of Acre to the Muslims in 1291 inspired many schemes for... more The fall of the crusader-controlled city of Acre to the Muslims in 1291 inspired many schemes for crusades to recover Jerusalem and its environs. One of these proposals is How to Defeat the Saracens, written around 1317 by William of Adam, a Dominican who traveled extensively in the eastern Mediterranean, Persia, and parts of India. The treatise, poorly known even among specialists, presents a five-pronged plan for retaking the Holy Land. In particular, it focuses on cutting off economic and military support for Egypt. William’s personal experience in the lands he describes comes through, for example, when he recollects his encounters in Persia with a captive Greek woman whose child he baptized, and in India with a lapsed Christian who said that God had abandoned him. In this volume Giles Constable provides a critical edition of the Latin text and a facing English translation. Extensive notes, produced in collaboration with other experts, guide the reader through the political, geographical, economic, military, and historical context of this fascinating work.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
De nobilitate animi: Guillelmus de AragoniaHarvard Studies in Medieval Latin 2,  2013An edition, translation, and study of De nobilitate animi, “On Nobility of Mind,” a Latin treatis... more An edition, translation, and study of De nobilitate animi, “On Nobility of Mind,” a Latin treatise written about 1280–1290. The author, Guillelmus de Aragonia, was known as a philosopher for his commentary on Boethius and his works on physiognomy, oneirology, and astronomy; he was also a physician, perhaps a personal physician to the king of Aragon. In a time of intellectual upheaval and civil strife, when nobility was on the verge of being defined with legal precision as it had not been since antiquity, Guillelmus taught that true nobility is an acquired habit, not an inborn quality. Working in the recently renewed Aristotelian tradition, he took an independent and original approach, quoting from philosophers, astronomers, physicians, historians, naturalists, orators, poets, and rustics pronouncing proverbs. This edition presents the Latin text, based on six manuscripts, three of them hitherto unknown. An introduction reviews Guillelmus’s life and work, considering his theory of nobility in the contexts of history, philosophy, and rhetoric, and studies the authorities he quotes with particular attention to the troubadours, lyric poets from the area known today as the south of France. The editors provide a translation and an appendix of sources and analogues.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of its two parts is a dialogue, in which the king and jester, sage and fool, prophet and blasphemer bandy back and forth questions and comments. Whereas Solomon is solemn and pompous, Marcolf resorts to low language and earthy topics. The other part comprises twenty short chapters in which Marcolf tricks Solomon time and again. These episodes are as impudent and scatological as is the dialogue. Together, the two parts constitute a rudimental prose novel or “rogue biography.” Cited by Bakhtin in Rabelais and His World, Solomon and Marcolf is widely known by name. But until now it has not been translated into any modern language. The present volume offers an introduction, followed by the Latin and English, detailed commentary, and reproductions of woodcut illustrations from the 1514 edition. Appendixes help readers understand the origins and influence of a work that was composed around 1200, that attained its greatest popularity in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that has the potential still today to delight and instruct.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nonetheless, the phrase may sound jarringly paradoxical, in pairing the poet most emblematic of medieval Christianity with the name of a rival religion. The Commedia possesses a stature beyond being merely the foundational and preeminent masterpiece in the canon of ltalian literature. It also stands more generally as a centerpiece in Western culture. Among other things, it constitutes a summa of medieval Christian culture and an archetype of Catholic literature. Although Dante could not have foreseen every winding and turning in the subsequent reception of his poem, in Paradiso he refers presciently to his work as the "sacrato poema" (23.62) and "poema sacra" (25.1). Yet the Commedia achieves its summa-like (or encyclopedic) qualities in part by incorporating heterogeneous components, some of which render it highly uncanonical for a canonical work. We should not be startled to learn that Dante was already accused of being heterodox and even heretical by some of his near contemporaries."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Bringing together cartography, history, philosophy, philology, reception studies, religious studies, and other disciplines, these essays tap into knowledge and skills from specialists in the medieval West, Byzantium, and Dante. The twelve contributors discuss the presence of ancient Greek poetry, philosophy, and science (astrology, cosmography, geography) in Dante’s writings, as well as the Greek characters who populate his works. Some of these individuals were drawn indirectly from ancient mythography, Homeric epic, and other such sources, while others were historically attested personages, down to Dante’s own era. Greek was not only a language and civilization of the past, but also a present (and often rival) religious and political entity. To each layer—ancient pagan, early Christian, and contemporary Byzantine—Latins related differently. Doctrinal, political, linguistic, cultural, and educational matters all played important roles in shaping the attitudes that form the focal point for this volume, which sets the stage for further engagement with Dante’s corpus in its cultural settings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This volume brings together interdisciplinary essays by leading, international scholars to provide a comprehensive account of the historical, cultural and intellectual context in which Dante lived and worked: from the economic, social and political scene to the feel of daily life; from education and religion to the administration of justice; from medicine to philosophy and science; from classical antiquity to popular culture; and from the dramatic transformation of urban spaces to the explosion of visual arts and music. This book, while locating Dante in relation to each of these topics, offers readers a clear and reliable idea of what life was like for Dante as an outstanding poet and intellectual in the Italy of the late Middle Ages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Scrutiny was given to the presence of ancient Greek poetry and philosophy (such as Homer, Plato, Aristotle) as well as science (astrology, cosmography, geography) in Dante’s works. In addition, participants explored the Greek characters (drawn indirectly from the ancient Greek mythographic tradition, Homeric epic, and other such sources) that populate Dante’s works, as well as others (such as the Cretan Veglio). Speakers considered the degree to which such influences were filtered to the Italian poet through Patristic and late-antique texts (by Origen, the Cappadocians, Dionysius the Areopagite, and others), since Dante could have been introduced to at least some of the original ancient literature by way of these intermediaries. The symposium also investigated very broadly the medieval assimilation of Greek thought into Christian culture. This assimilation includes Byzantine influences on political thought, particularly on the centrality of the emperor and the empire as ideas and ideals (Justinian and the juridical and political thought of the Eastern Roman Empire). This issue relates particularly, but not exclusively, to Dante's De monarchia. Beyond a strict concern with Dante lies the challenge of setting him in a broader context with regard to the perception and reception of Greek in the thirteenth-century West. Latin Christians manifested a schizophrenic outlook, instead of a single Greekness there were several, not all of them even interconnected. First of all were the pagan Greeks and then the Byzantine Greeks. Even the Byzantines were far from uniform, since Westerners responded very differently to the traditions of the Greek Church fathers and of their own contemporary Greeks. Thus Greek was not only a past language or culture, but also a present (and often rival) religious and political entity. To each of these layers Latins related somewhat differently. Doctrinal, political, linguistic, cultural, educational matters all played important roles in shaping attitudes, and in this regard travel and diplomacy are perhaps as relevant as translations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At the same time, the medieval Christian poet placed several Islamic philosophers much more honorably in Limbo. Furthermore, it has long been suggested that for much of the basic framework of the Divine Comedy Dante was indebted to apocryphal traditions about a “night journey” taken by Muhammad.Dante scholars have increasingly returned to the question of Islam to explore the often surprising encounters among religious traditions that the Middle Ages afforded. This collection of essays works through what was known of the Qur’an and of Islamic philosophy and science in Dante’s day and explores the bases for Dante’s images of Muhammad and Ali.

On one side are demands for a coherent ''core'' program, centered on a canon of great books and required courses in the traditions of the West. On the other side are arguments that deny that a canon exists or can be formed. The publicity given this debate has masked several ironies. Did a system of coherent requirements ever really exist? Is our nostalgia for such requirements appropriate? Alumni reunions easily cast doubt on the long term influence of having forced freshmen and sophomores to read some Aristotle and Tolstoy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Whatever the answer, there can be no doubt that animals have appeared in literature from the ages before Aesop through the decades after Orwell--with no end in sight today or tomorrow. Of the many ways in which this beast literature can be classified, one helpful distinction can be drawn between, on the one hand, those writings in which animals are anthropomorphized so much that they speak and, on the other, those in which the animals are not so thoroughly humanized. Writings of both sorts exist from many periods: for instance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the animals of Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus and Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Books could be contrasted to those of Ernest Thompson Seton and Jack London, in the late Middle Ages the animals of the Renard the Fox cycle to those of the bestiaries. Two Latin poems composed during the reign of Charlemagne are especially interesting because, although closely related to each other, they already embody these same extremes in the literary depiction of animals."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The art of insulting is being examined from the standpoints of various disciplines, such as psychology, semiotics, andsociology. A specific form of verbal aggression, namely, the exchange of insults in the manner of a duel, has aroused particular interest. Such duels have been recorded and analyzed by sociolinguists as they occur in today's ghettos in the United States (where they are known as "playing the dozens" or "sounding") and in Turkey. At the same time, invective exchanges in ancient and medieval literature have been collected and scrutinized. As part of this effort, formal exchanges of insults and threats in Old English and Old Norse writings, which are often labeled 'flytings', have won their share of the attention. Correspondingly, the tantalizing remains of flytings in medieval Latin have also aroused interest. Indeed, a corpus is gradually taking shape: the seventh-century Irish 'Hisperica famina' has been re-edited, a tenth-century English 'Altercatio magistri et discipuli' has been published for the first time, and the resemblance of these poems to previously known pieces (such as the mutually vituperative give-and-take between the early eleventh-century scholars Warner of Rouen and Franbald) has been pointed out. Although undoubtedly more documents in manuscript await discovery, the moment seems ripe to give preliminary attention to a special type of flyting which has been neglected - the medieval Latin beast flyting. Besides having intrinsic merits, the beast flytings raise intriguing questions about the influence of popular theater on medieval monks and suggest that it is wrong to assume that vernacular beast and bird debates, in particular the Middle English 'Owl and the Nightingale', were exclusively learned in inspiration."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Tito Vespasiano Strozzi’s ‘Ad psyttacum’: A Renaissance Latin Poet Parrots the PastHarvard Library Bulletin 35,  1988"In the first part of Henry IV Shakespeare has Hotspur declare: 'He said he would not ransom Mort... more "In the first part of Henry IV Shakespeare has Hotspur declare: 'He said he would not ransom Mortimer,/ Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,/ But I will find him when he lies asleep,/ And in his ear I'll hollow 'Mortimer!'/ Nay,/ I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak/ Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him/ To keep his anger still in motion." Shakespeare's choice of talking bird in this passage has had far-reaching ecological consequences. The common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) came into the New World in 1890-1891 when American Shakespeare enthusiasts, who wished to introduce all the birds mentioned by the Bard of Avon, brought about one hundred starlings across the Atlantic and released them in Central Park. Although at first starlings were as out of place in Central Park as nightingales would be in Harvard Yard, eventually they took to their new habitat, and, in part thanks to this importation, starlings now constitute one of the most numerous species of birds in the world.  The fate of Shakespeare's bird poses in a particularly memorable fashion the problem of imitation which has to be central in the discussion of Tito Vespasiano Strozzi's poetry, as well as of so many other Neo-Latin poems.

Walahfrid’s Poem about a Man Carried to Heaven by an Eagle: Parodic Vision or Serious Illusio?Poetica: An International Journal of Linguistic-Literary Studies,  1991"The Poet: Walahfrid Strabo, despite the tragic brevity of his life, played a major role in the i... more "The Poet: Walahfrid Strabo, despite the tragic brevity of his life, played a major role in the intellectual activity of the ninth century. In forty years he made a lasting mark, not solely in the monastery of Reichenau, where he served as abbot after many years as a monk, but even throughout Western Europe thanks to his accomplishments as a theologian, liturgist, naturalist, royal tutor, and, last but not least, poet." "The Poem: Whereas numerous articles have been written about the other three of Walahfrid's vision poems, the short poem entitled De quodam somnio ad Erluinum has been almost entirely shunned by scholars. One explanation for this avoidance is prudery; for although in the poem Walahfrid deals with the seemingly earnest subject of heaven seen by a dreamer, the vision he relates almost transmogrifies bis verse treatment of Wettin's pious vision. Another reason for the neglect of De quodam somnio ad Erluinum is its refusal to comply with expectations of medieval visions. More than one scholar has remarked upon the monotony of early medieval visions, owing to the repetitiveness with which they employ various motifs, images, and concepts. Unlike most of its contemporaries, Walahfrid's poem has no part of such conformism. It sits provocatively at the juncture between learned and popular traditions."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this triptych the leftmost panel is a lost medieval oral folk narrative, such as can be discerned behind the thick varnish of medieval textuality; the central frame contains the Latin verse adaptation of that oral narrative; and, last but not least, the right panel is occupied by the eventual reformulation of the tale as one of the Kinder- und Hausmiirchen (henceforth KHM) of the Brothers Grimm. This investigation will rest upon two different versions, separated by six hundred years, of a single tale. By exploring, however cursorily, the relationships in form, content, and text between one of the Grimms' Fairy Tales and the medieval poem on which it was based, I hope to delineate the Platonic, or rather Napoleonic, idea of Märchen that Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm held. A concomitant aim will be to suggest through this one example that a number of other Grimms' Fairy Tales have a medieval past."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Beast and the Beauty: The Reorientation of ‘The Donkey,’ From the Middle Ages to the Brothers GrimmJournal of Medieval Latin 5 ,  1995"In this study I shall focus upon the medieval background of a story that goes by the title "Das ... more "In this study I shall focus upon the medieval background of a story that goes by the title "Das Eselein" (which means "The Donkey" or "The Little Ass") in the famous fairy tale collection of the Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859). At the heart of the tale lies the motif of a man transformed into a donkey, which also appears in such famous ancient stories as Apuleius's Metamorphoses or The Golden Ass (second half of second century C.E.) and "Lucius or the Ass" (among the pseudoepigrapha of Lucian)--neither of which was readily available in the Latin Middle Ages. The similarities between the ancient stories and the Grimms' "Das Eselein," though initially striking, are not extensive. In the Grimms' tale the central figure is not a picaresque character whose metamorphosis occurs as the result of his own lust and curiosity, like the protagonist Lucius in both Apuleius and Pseudo-Lucian, but rather a well-mannered prince with an improbable and unfortunate but ultimately remediable birth defect: he is born an ass. He exits permanently from his animal form not when he eats roses--the resolution in the two ancient stories--but rather after marrying a princess, when his father-in-law snatches and burns the hide that he doffs by night."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In varying ways and with varying intent, it speaks to the essential experience of participating in imaginative worlds, offering different accounts of how language signifies in real and imaginary contexts, and why people read and write rival realities. Taking as point of departure Aristotle's definition of poesis, it questions how literature stands in both mimetic and transformative relation to the givens of history, reworking them within the order of imagination and desire. Through historical, linguistic, and literary analysis of texts spanning nine centuries, it demonstrates how though it is irreducible to reality, literary imagination conveys something very real about the human response to the world, including the knowledge and power proper to such experience; neither history nor lie, it discloses a reality purged of extraneous detail, making what is essential to human experience more concentrated and dramatic. Thus made apparent is that literature and history do not exclude each other, but inform, correct, and supplement each other, underscoring the complexities of thought and imagination.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Straparola and the Fairy TaleAgainst Ruth B. Bottigheimer's argument that the sixteenth-century Italian author Giovanni France... more Against Ruth B. Bottigheimer's argument that the sixteenth-century Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola originated fairy tale in its best-known form, this article maintains that ancient and medieval texts contain earlier literary adaptations of folktales that qualify as fairy tales. Particular attention is paid to similarities between Straparola's "Il re porco" and the Medieval Latin Asinarius. Such affinities suggest that oral tradition is not as difficult to document before the print era as Bottigheimer asserts. With regard to her theory that Straparola invented the narrative pattern that she calls "rise tales," this article offers evidence that one such tale may be found as early as the second century CE, in Apuleius's famous "Cupid and Psyche." In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries folklorists were deeply concerned with studying the distribution of folktales across space and time; their key preoccupations were questions about origins and about the relationship between orality and literacy. These issues deserve to retain a central place in folklore studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nigel is widely known for his Speculum Stultorum, an amusing satiric poem nearly four thousand lines in length, and for a caustic treatise that has been given the title Tractatus contra Curiales et Officiales Clericos. Although his seventeen Miracula Sancte Dei genitricis uirginis Marie, uersifice have been edited recently, not all his other works have fared well. This edition brings into print for the first time the Nigel's remaining poems. From British Library Cotton Vespasian D xix are edited his account in rhymed hexameters of the passion of Saint Lawrence and thirteen epigrams; from Cambridge, Trinity College B. 15.5(342) are published newly discovered marginal poems that shed light upon his techniques of poetic composition. The volume opens with a general introduction on Nigel's writings, his life at Canterbury, and notable features of his verse. Each of the three texts or sets of texts is preceded by a brief introduction and followed by a detailed commentary, which glosses difficult words and constructions and which points the reader to literary sources and analogues. The volume concludes with indexes of names and of notable words. This new edition deepens our perspective upon Nigel of Canterbury and upon intellectual life in Canterbury after the death of Becket.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Instead, I have set for myself one main objective in sifting the evidence: to figure out whether or not the author who wrote the letters identified as being by the man in the Epistolae is likely to have been Peter Abelard. The restriction to one party in the exchange of letters demands an immediate explanation. The number of words in known texts that have been ascribed to Abelard amounts to a total far more than ten times greater than in those attributed to Heloise, which means that the grounds for any sort of statistical or quantitative analysis are much more substantial in a comparison geared to his writings rather than to hers. In other words, the data available for a comparison of the man's texts in the Epistolae with Abelard are considerably richer. Accordingly, I have privileged Abelard in my own samplings, not because I like him more than Heloise, and not because I take pleasure in stifling a woman's voice, but rather for simple statistical reasons."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These eight letters are now most often numbered continuously from one through eight, although confusingly they have been presented sometimes with the Historia calamitatum unnumbered and the letters from and to Heloise numbered one through seven, rather than two through eight. (This is to say nothing of the so-called Lost Love Letters, which have been argued recently and controversially to be excerpts from the billets doux exchanged by Heloise and Abelard during their love affair.) All of these texts have been made easily accessible in good editions and translations and are generally familiar to medievalists. Less studied have been at least a half dozen other letters, among which are Letters 9–14, which were edited definitively by the late Edmé Smits (1950–1992). These other writings have the disadvantages of not being as closely associated with the personal engagement of Peter Abelard and Heloise, of having separate addressees, and of being transmitted separately rather than in an organic collection. But several of them stand out for being as extraordinary in their own right as is the personal correspondence, and they hold the potential to repay the effort of close examination. In this case I would like to probe two of them to glean insights into Peter Abelard’s practice as a historian and as a textual critic. Letters 11 and 10 will be treated chronologically, not according to the traditional numbering."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Letters of Peter Abelard, beyond the personal"The romantic tale of Peter Abelard and Heloise has been widely known for centuries. The legend r... more "The romantic tale of Peter Abelard and Heloise has been widely known for centuries. The legend relates in part to the letters exchanged between the two, years after Abelard had been castrated at the behest of Heloise's vindictive uncle, Fulbert. These "personal" letters form the basis for bestselling compilations of works by Abelard and Heloise in translation, such as the recently revised Penguin The Letters of Abelard and Heloise or the new Hackett Abelard and Heloise, The Letters and Other Writings. They hold fascination for the light they shed on the relationship between the man and woman, as teacher and student, lovers, husband and wife, monk and nun, abbot and mother superior, and much more. The popularity of the "personal" letters has generated considerable fanfare for the publication of another set of correspondence printed under the title The Lost Love Letters of Heloise and Abelard. The authorship of all these letters has been contested repeatedly, with the last-mentioned collection being the center of a present firestorm. Generally ignored have been nearly a dozen other letters or letter-like texts, unassailably the work of Peter Abelard. Jan M. Ziolkowski's comprehensive and learned translation of these texts affords insight into Abelard's thinking over a much longer sweep of time and offers snapshots of the great twelfth-century philosopher and theologian in a variety of contexts. One group shows him engaging with Heloise and nuns of the Paraclete, another with Bernard of Clairvaux, and a third with four entirely different addressees on four entirely different topics. Broadening our panorama of the twelfth-century Renaissance, the picture presented by these texts complements, complicates, and enriches Abelard's autobiographical letter of consolation and his personal letters to Heloise."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Though often called a dialogue, the second of its two parts comprises a rudimentary novel with twenty episodes. In 2009 the "original" received at last an edition and translation with commentary as the first volume in the Harvard Studies in Medieval Latin series. Solomon and Marcolf: Vernacular Traditions, the fourth volume in the series, displays the mysteries of the tradition. Solomon relates to the biblical king, but did Marcolf originate in Germanic or Eastern regions? Here lovers of literature and folklore may explore, in English for the first time, relevant texts, from the twelfth through the early eighteenth century. These astonishingly varied and fascinating pieces, from Iceland in the North and West through Russia in the East and Italy in the South, have been translated from medieval and early modern French, Russian, German, Icelandic, Danish, and Italian. The book opens with snapshots of two nineteenth-century polymaths, the Englishman John M. Kemble and Russian Aleksandr Veselovskii, whose hypotheses can now be evaluated. An appendix documents awareness of Solomon and Marcolf in late medieval and early modern times.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Then I will consider briefly the standing of formal mnemotechnics in the Middle Ages. From theory I will move to practice, by examining the role of memory training in ancient and medieval school training. In this examination I will focus on the effects that formal memory training and the prestige of memory had on the remembrance and interpretation of the Aeneid. Throughout I will set my sights on the problematic period from late antiquity through the twelfth century A.D. Frances Yates, in her still-essential book on The Art of Memory, states at one juncture that: "If Simonides was the inventor of the art of memory, and 'Tullius' its teacher, Thomas Aquinas became something like its patron saint." Because the stimulating recent publications of Lina Bolzoni and Mary Carruthers have dealt mainly with the later Middle Ages, I will restrict myself to the centuries before Thomas underwent canonization-a period that has received attention from M.T. Clanchy, from Janet Coleman, and even more from Patrick Geary, but with a view toward history rather than the interpretation of literature."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Even so, John of Alta Silva's Dolopathos stands in a close relationship to the great work of Arabic literature, since the Latin prose work presents an intriguing inversion of The Thousand and One Nights in its chief characters and themes. At the risk of advancing a conclusion where an exordium belongs, I will reveal that my main aim in this consideration of the Dolopathos is to highlight the changes and emphases which our author -- twelfth-century Cistercian monk writing in Latin -- is likely to have implemented as he accommodated a very foreign collection of "stories within a story" to his own culture. The oldest extant fragment of the Arabic Thousand Nights, which through a very modest inflation later acquired the title The Thousand and One Nights dates from the ninth century. The inaugural European version of The Thousand and One Nights began to be published in 1704, when the first of six volumes ( 1704-1717) by the French Orientalist Antoine Galland (1646-1715) came into print. Since that year the text has enjoyed enormous popularity, becoming famous in English under the telegraphic title of The Arabian Nights. However it is entitled, "no work of Arabic or even Islamic literature is as well known to the Western world".Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Before a... more The tide of this essay is formulated not so much to provoke as to crystallize paradoxes. Before arriving at issues relating specifically to the early-medieval reception of Vergil, l will first set forth as a general backdrop the apparent contradictions that concern me. Most basically, the relative priority of speech and writing, talk and text, and other such categories has been an eternal preoccupation in Western culture, from Plato and ancient Greece down to Jacques Derrida and post-structuralism, and now beyond, into the eclecticism of the twenty-first century. For Derrida, it has been written, <<orality itself is a fiction inscribed in literacy and in writing; it is not a historical stage, phase, or event>>.  Often the endeavor to determine the precedence of orality over literacy or vice versa degenerates into speculation as fruitless as the old conundrum about the chicken or the egg. The futility seems particularly great since as a rule philologists make poor philosophers, and sometimes the reverse holds equally true. In any event, the two groups have been at loggerheads at the latest since the nineteenth century, when Friedrich Nietzsche, whose outlook upon philology was famously conflicted, clashed with the classical philologist - and his former classmate - Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf (designated simply as Wilamowitz by his present-day fans).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The only books that many non-musicologists handle with any frequency in which text and notation appear conjoined are hymnals. Indeed, it would surprise, puzzle, or even frustrate many readers, especially those who cannot read music, to open a novel or an epic poem and to find suddenly in the middle that for a few pages the format switched to that of sheet music, with clefs, bars, and notes. Yet however much we take for granted the autonomy of the two forms - bare words for most prose and verse, words and music only when the words are brief instructions to performers (usually in Italian), lyrics, or texts that have been set to music - this outcome was not already predetermined in the early Middle Ages. For three centuries the sort of abrupt transition described a moment ago would not have been infrequent. Through an examination of a selection from the more than two dozen passages of Virgil's poetry that survive with musical notation from the tenth through the twelfth century, this essay offers a reminder of how different the experience of encountering Virgil could have been to the audiences of medieval manuscripts and how complexly musical notation, in the form known as 'neumes', could relate to other types of markers that were being developed to give directions about the delivery and comprehension of poetry."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Thereafter such notation of Virgil apparently ceases for centuries. The neumes (and singing) may have fallen by the wayside as new practices developed of singing Latin rhythmic poems or vernacular songs based on Virgil, rather than excerpts from Virgil's own quantitative poetry. In prefaces to the Paraclete Hymnbook Peter Abelard quotes observations by Heloise on the need for a more regular syllable count than in quantitative hymns. Virgilian reception and musical notation may have evolved together away from quantitative Latin.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They often even free us from worry about [material] necessities, so that the mind may have still greater liberty to apply itself to philosophy.”"Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The memorial service gathered together hundreds – family members, former colleagues and students, and countless friends. The eight speakers at this memorial described Edward (Ned) Keenan's influence on them, but also his inestimable impact on the field of Russian history; and his widow provided a window into his thinking about the many roles he played over the course of a diverse and significant career that spanned four decades. The memorial service marked a sad moment in the field of Russian studies, and the words offered at it are important for understanding how the field of Russian history in the United States grew and was transformed in the last quarter of the twentieth century.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Meta-Nomadism: Introduction to Elena Boeck's Introduction to Florin Curta's Dumbarton Oaks Public Lecture, "An Uneasy Relation: Byzantium and the Nomads.""Although the relations between the nomads and Byzantium have been the subject of many studies, t... more "Although the relations between the nomads and Byzantium have been the subject of many studies, there is to date no comprehensive treatment of the topic. Byzantine sources provide abundant information about how the imperial government in Constantinople dealt with the peoples inhabiting the steppe lands north of the Black and Caspian Seas. Conclusions drawn on the basis of written sources, however, differ from those resulting from archaeological excavations. New evidence from excavations has enriched our understanding of relations between nomadic and settled communities and has questioned the pigeonholing of diverse communities into preconceived ethnic categories such as “Pechenegs,” “Oghuz,” and “Cumans.”Recent research has moved beyond the study of burial mounds to focus on the cultures of those nomads who moved into areas neighboring the Byzantine Empire or into Hungary between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries. These studies have emphasized the processes of sedentization, conversion to Christianity, and eventual assimilation. The study of local settlements in the Balkans has revealed great differences between their relations with sedentary populations north and south of the Danube. Pioneering research in bioarchaeology has only begun to enrich the already complex picture of the archaeology of medieval nomadism in eastern Europe."Florin Curta is professor of medieval history and archaeology at the University of Florida. His books include The Making of the Slavs: History and Archaeology of the Lower Danube Region, ca. 500–700 (Cambridge, 2001), which received the Herbert Baxter Adams Award of the American Historical Association; Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500–1250 (Cambridge, 2006); and The Edinburgh History of the Greeks, c. 500 to 1050 (Edinburgh, 2011). Curta is the editor of five volumes, most recently The Steppe Lands and the World Beyond Them: Studies in Honor of Victor Spinei on His 70th Birthday (Iaşi, 2013), and he is also the editor in chief of the Brill series East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450–1450.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

S Eliot's 1944 "What Is a Classic?" has found its most recent echo, highly amplified and subtly analyzed, in Ankhi Mukherjee's already classic 2014 "What Is a Classic?: PostcolonialRewriting and Invention of the Canon."The moment is ripe for reconsidering the significance of the classic in general. This paper will start by recapitulating the evolution from Classical Latin (sic) of the term classic and its close relationsclassicism and classicality. Thereafter it will relate the classic to two clusters of key concepts. One includes canon and curriculum. Another is world literature, which has a lineage that leads from Goethe through Erich Auerbach. World literature leads in turn to global literature.The relationship of the classic to the Greco-Roman classics will be considered in connection with the charge of Eurocentrism that has been leveled against the system for determining classicality. The discussion will then turn to the context of postcolonialism that Mukherjee has established.Other issues that require treatment have to do with market forces. The classic and the bestseller are distinct phenomena. Can the classic survive in the face of the bestseller? Can the conventional classics from earlier times, starting with classical antiquity, retain their importance, when their sales and impact are harder to measure? How likely are texts in non-global languages to attain the status of classics-and will doing so require the sacrifice of their original tongues?To close, attention will be paid to new techniques of research that have become possible thanks to the digital humanities. At the very least tools that are now available will facilitate the study of reception in hitherto-impossible ways. Digital methods reliant upon algorithms that are conducive to graphs, maps, and trees may open new doors for literary historians. It remains to be seen whether or not such methods will lead to greater enlightenment about what is a classic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In twenty-six years of curatorial work, Stephen has played an integral role in the development of the Dumbarton Oaks Museum. On the occasion of his retirement, Stephen recently gave an interview for the Dumbarton Oaks Oral History Project. First introduced to Dumbarton Oaks in the late 1970s as a student from New York University, Stephen’s long and fruitful curatorial tenure has spanned a third of the institution’s history, over a quarter of a century, through four directorships and through two major renovation projects. The first of these major renovation projects occurred between 1987 and 1989 when the Director, Robert Thompson, launched a construction project that would literally change the shape of the museum. Working with then Curator of the Byzantine Collection, Susan Boyd, Stephen redesigned the galleries and reinstalled the collection, taking advantage of this opportunity to reinterpret the collection and to reimagine its narrative implications. Twenty years later, under the directorship of Edward Keenan, another major construction project gave Stephen a second opportunity to completely reinstall the collection under the guidance of the current Director of the Museum, Gudrun Bühl. Few curators have the opportunity to affect such profound and long-lasting change on the presentation of a museum’s permanent collection, but Stephen has done it no less than twice at Dumbarton Oaks. Stephen’s plans for his retirement include a wealth of scholarly projects, and Dumbarton Oaks looks forward to his continued contributions to Byzantine Studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is then that vagrants who have pitched tents in the park below DO light campfires that burn up into our property. It is then that the lunatics—and I choose my word very deliberately, since the full moon seems to drive them—come out, or rather onto DO property. And, last but not least, it is then that in the summer young neighbors and others decide to undertake the local rite de passage by clambering over the walls and going swimming in our pool. Sometimes they get caught, which means deciding how to handle the trespass. Other times they escape, but get hurt in the process, which brings fresh worries. Once in a while they make their get-away after skinny-dipping, but leave behind clothing.

The symposium first looked back into the historiography of the debate on the role of the state in Late Antique exchanges and then gave the state of the art of research on the movement of goods at various levels within the Byzantine world, with particular importance given to regional exchanges. In relation with the temporary exhibition of coin weights, scales and their context in the reopened Byzantine gallery, the symposium focused equally on markets and the market place, which have up to now been studied essentially from the Constantinopolitan point of view. It was hoped that bringing together historians, archaeologists and epigraphists will help us combine the "macro" perspective with a "micro" and less familiar one.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Introduction to the Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine symposium, “Morea: The Land and Its People in the Aftermath of the Fourth Crusade.”"I'm going to tell you a great tale, and if you will listen to me, I hope it will please you." Th... more "I'm going to tell you a great tale, and if you will listen to me, I hope it will please you." The opening line of the Chronicle of the Morea sets the stage for this symposium, which examines the late medieval Peloponnese following its conquest by the Crusader knights in 1205. Far from ancestral homelands in France, the Crusaders found a land that "was fertile, spacious and delightful with its fields and waters and multitude of pastures." The Chronicle, written sources, and the buildings and artifacts that are left to us or recovered archaeologically reveal a bold attempt to establish a new kingdom in this distant land, adding yet another layer to the many levels of habitation on the "island of Pelops". Omitted from this myth of Crusader foundation are the large numbers of Orthodox villagers and town dwellers who also shared the region and created their own myths of an eternal and sacred empire generated by the pains of loss and the hopes of refoundation. Their remains, though less studied, are also left in the written and material records of the period. Layered upon the historical and physical topography of this region, as well are the traces of the Venetians, whose "right eye," Modon, was sited at the southwestern tip of the peninsula. The Turkish layers, revealed in standing fortresses, toponyms, vernacular poetry, and pottery, also left deep traces on the ground and remain in collective memory. How these groups and others who shared the land interacted and how they established corporate identity is at the center of this symposium. At the core of our investigation, too, is the understanding of place and memory – the recollection of the ancient history of the Peloponnese, the architectural and cartographic marking of its mountains and valleys, and the re-creation of distant capitals on its land. The speakers in this symposium look at the Morea and its people in the broadest possible manner and with careful attention to written and material evidence, historiography, and the making – or re-telling – of myths.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Byzantines – who are normally beli... more Iconoclasm was not a common term in the pre-modern world.  The Byzantines – who are normally believed to have initiated the concept – used the word ‘iconoclast’ as a pejorative label, but called the debate about images ‘iconomachy’ (the struggle about images).  Iconoclasm as a term only comes into currency in the mid-sixteenth century.  In modern usage, the term iconoclasm has come to cover a wide semantic field and a multitude of practices, and rather than impose pre-modern terminology, we have elected to retain the term, but in the plural, to emphasise the diversity of the phenomema that it has been used to encompass. The study of this historiographical shift is a way into understanding changing attitudes about the values and functions of images and the development of visual cultures.  The value of objects – and how this was expressed – is a critical issue in modern cultural and art history, and iconoclasms provide a neat way into these debates by raising questions about how images are used to mediate power relations.  Images are good to think with, and they always have been. Some comparative work has been done on the different constructions of ‘iconoclasm’, but little has been done on how the similarities and differences between these phenomena (and their historiography) illuminate discourses about cultures.  The themes and questions that we would like the scholars involved in this round table to consider are aimed at addressing how words about images – and words not used about images – open up larger cultural issues about how and why the visual communicates, about the interface and friction between verbal and written communication, and about what later understandings of earlier practices tell about the reception and reconception of the past.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Welcome to the Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine colloquium “Light, Surface, Spirit: Phenomenology and Aesthetics in Byzantine Art"Byzantine liturgical and luxury objects were set in rich spaces of mosaics, marble, fragrance, an... more Byzantine liturgical and luxury objects were set in rich spaces of mosaics, marble, fragrance, and changing light. They possessed polymorphous appearances, which were set to perform when the vessels were carried in space or when shifting ambient light or density of air ruffled their variegated textures. The Byzantines called this spectacle of change poikilia (phenomenal presence effects experienced by the senses). Photios wrote about it in his ekphrasis of the Pharos chapel:     It is as if one had entered heaven itself with no one barring the way from any side, and was illuminated by the beauty in changing forms (polymorphos) shining all around like so many stars, so is one utterly amazed. […] It seems that everything is in ecstatic motion, and the church itself is circling around. For the spectator, through his whirling about in all directions and being constantly astir, which he is forced to experience by the variegated spectacle (poikilia) on all sides, imagines that his personal condition is transferred to the object (Photios, Homily X, sect. 5,1, & Photiou Homiliai, ed. Laourdas, 101, tr. Mango, The Art of the Byzantine Empire, 185). The phenomenological effects gliding over the surfaces of objects stirred a sense of motion in the spectator, who in turn projected his psychological state, his pathema, back onto the object, transforming it in his perception into an empsychos graphe. We have tended to study Byzantine objects in isolation and under steady electric light. As a result, we no longer have access to the Byzantine poikilia of phenomenal effects. By contrast, nineteenth-century scholarship right at the advent of photography and electricity was keenly aware how the mutable and polymorphous presence of Byzantine art could be drained by these new technologies. Nikodim Kondakov remarked on the emerald-jewel-like effect of green enamel, filled with the energy of iridescence. He observed how this same shimmering 'fish-scales' quality vanished in the steadied photographic snapshot. This colloquium focused on the poikilia of changing appearances of icons and luxury vessels set in shifting ambient conditions and explore the power of this spectacle of phenomenal changes to generate a sense of animation. Following are some of the main questions this colloquium addressed: how did Byzantine objects perform in space; how was the spectacle of poikilia staged and experienced; to what extent was the Byzantine poikilia culture-specific especially when compared to Western or Islamic objects and their display?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Welcome to the Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine Studies Symposium, "Warfare in the Byzantine World""War and the need to wage it, the organisational constraints it imposes, its effects on society a... more "War and the need to wage it, the organisational constraints it imposes, its effects on society and economy as well as its ideological justification and the debates it engenders, can be a radical force for social and political transformation. However unpleasant the effects of war, it is an undeniable fact of human history that war has been on many occasions and in many different historical contexts a powerful stimulus both to technological innovation and social and political change. The crucial role of war and its concomitants cannot be ignored in the history of any culture. Byzantium is no exception. Indeed, in many respects the history of the Byzantine state is also the history of its ability successfully to defend itself and to organise for war, for its military organisation was central both to the inflection of its social relations in general as well as to the ways in which the central government extracted and redistributed the resources available to it, whether in the form of agricultural produce or money taxes on agriculture and trade. In its thousand years of existence—from the reign of Anastasius (491–518) until that of the last emperor, Constantine Ⅺ (1448–1453)—the Byzantine state was almost constantly at war with one or another of its neighbours. This reflected its geography and strategic situation, centred as it was on the southern Balkans and Asia Minor. It had constantly to fend off challenges to its territorial integrity from the Persian and then Arab or Turkish Islamic powers to the east, or its Balkan or central European neighbours to the north west and north. As the western and central European powers grew and matured—first in the form of the Carolingian empire, then the German empire and the kingdom of Hungary—so Byzantine political pre-eminence came to be challenged, until by the end of the twelfth century the empire had become a second-rate state, subject to the power politics of powerful western kingdoms and the commercial strength of Italian merchant republics such as Venice, Genoa and Pisa. Byzantium was a society in which the virtues of peace were extolled and war was usually condemned, certainly when taken for its own sake. Fighting was to be avoided at all costs. Yet the empire nevertheless inherited the military administrative structures and, in many ways, the militaristic ideology of the expanding pre-Christian Roman empire in its heyday. These tensions were overcome through the blending of Christian ideals with the political will to survive and the justification of war as a necessary evil, waged primarily in defence of the Roman world and the Orthodox faith. Late Roman and medieval Christian society in the eastern Mediterranean/south Balkan region thus generated a unique culture which was able to cling without reservation to a pacifistic ideal while at the same time legitimating and justifying the maintenance of an immensely efficient and, for the most part remarkably effective, military apparatus. This symposium examined some of these themes in an attempt to re-evaluate Byzantine as well as other perceptions of warfare and the military, to understand how the Byzantines organised for war, and the reasons for their success or failure."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Middle Ages and, especially, non-western medieval societies have always held an ambiguous position in such historiographical attempts, given the preoccupation with European modernity and Greco-Roman antiquity. In the late 1970s and with Alexander Kazhdan at the forefront, Byzantinists joined this debate and significant publications have appeared since then—including a history of Byzantine autobiography (Vienna, 1999) and a conference on the Discovery of the Senses and Personal Preferences (Athens, 2000). Nevertheless, compared to similar work on classical, late antique, and western medieval literatures and cultures, Byzantium still remains an uncharted territory for its place in the history of the self. With an open-ended definition of selfhood, as constructed both by participation in collective identities and by individual choices, this colloquium explores aspects of the Byzantine self through different disciplinary perspectives applied to a series of Byzantine texts and practices. This is the second of three Dumbarton Oaks colloquia on the individual, personal relations, and social networks in Byzantium.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Colleagues from Harvard, CASVA, the Freer-Sackler and (now) the Getty helped by chairing sessions. On Friday afternoon we heard from the AORCs themselves and from the host countries, and learned how diverse they are. On Saturday we began to address some problems in Byzantine archaeology on a practical level, discussing relations with the academy, withearlier and later archaeologies, and with ministries of tourism in the host country. The afternoon brought further elaboration and discussion of all these, but also added atheoretical aspect in analysing the tensions between Byzantine and medieval, and between archaeology as an institution and archaeology as a critical practice. Participants broke into four groups to brainstorm solutions to problems of job-creation, funding, the integration of Byzantium into diachronic archaeological projects, andways for the AORCs to collaborate with each other and with other organisations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Introduction to the Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine colloquium, "The Social Network in Byzantium and its Neighbors"This, the last of three related colloquia picks up from studies of friendship and other personal ... more This, the last of three related colloquia picks up from studies of friendship and other personal relations in March 2010 and the self in 2011 to look at communications and social networks in Byzantium as seen in a wider Mediterranean perspective. Recent attempts to apply network theory to interactive texts in the premodern world have had varying results, and we look beyond Byzantium to the ancient world, the medieval west and the Islamic world. Talk of social networks may seem bound to this era of instant messages and Facebook revolutions. But pre-modern worlds were just as dependent on personal interaction, conducted through various cultural categories and modes of communication. For generations scholars have studied the friendships and patronage ties of classical Greece and Rome, the personal loyalties of medieval western Christendom, the threads of mentorship among early rabbis and early Islamic sages, the role of fama in consolidating (or disintegrating) communities. In each case, they have found amorphous webs of attachment, shaping community life more deeply than formal institutions. Byzantine society featured distinct patterns of relations, between civil and military elites, clergy and laity, landlords and peasants, merchants and bureaucrats. Equally Byzantium owed its distinction to links outside the empire, and the centrality of its members in wider Mediterranean relations. Since the 1960s sociologists have developed methods to map and measure modern social attachment, and to conceptualize the interplay between social interactions and individual and communal identity. Historians have variously adapted these methods and concepts to study Byzantium and other Mediterranean societies. But how should we understand the workings of pre-modern social networks, given the vast differences in technology and culture? How can we perceive these networks through our limited sources? How might we discern the way pre-modern social interactions employed cultural constructs and in turn shaped selves and communities? This colloquium explored social connectedness in Byzantium and other related communities. Building on the recent Dumbarton Oaks colloquia about friendship and the self, this gathering focused on the use of network analysis and network concepts with a range of evidence (from collected sayings to documentary papyri) over the whole Byzantine period (from classical to late medieval and beyond). Special emphasis was placed on probing various methodologies for use in pre-modern studies and comparing the social and cultural patterns of Byzantium with those of its predecessors and neighbors.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Welcome to the Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine symposium, "Rome Re-Imagined: Byzantine and Early Islamic Africa, c. 500–800"The short period of Byzantine rule in the Maghreb belies the region’s importance to the empire in... more The short period of Byzantine rule in the Maghreb belies the region’s importance to the empire in the sixth and seventh centuries. Given the profound economic and strategic significance of the province of “Africa,” the territory was also highly contested in the Byzantine period—by the empire itself, Berber kingdoms, and eventually also Muslim Arabs—as each of these groups sought to gain, retain control of, and exploit the region to its own advantage. In light of this charged history, scholars have typically taken the failure of the Byzantine endeavor in Africa as a foregone conclusion. The symposium sought to reassess this pessimistic vision both by examining those elements of Romano-African identity that provided continuity in a period of remarkable transition, and by seeking to understand the transformations in African society in the context of developments in the larger post-Roman Mediterranean. An international group of researchers from North America, Europe, and North Africa, including both well-established and emerging scholars, addressed topics including the legacy of Vandal rule in Africa, historiography and literature, art and architectural history, the archaeology of cities and their rural hinterlands, the economy, the family, theology, the cult of saints, Berbers, and the Islamic conquest, in an effort to consider the ways in which the imperial legacy was re-interpreted, re-imagined, and put to new uses in Byzantine and early Islamic Africa.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We have a corpus of oneirokritika, and studies on dream treatises, but the study of dream narratives has hardly begun, despite the ground-breaking database initiative of the Institute of Byzantine Studies in Athens. Dreams can be many things: a view into the future, a manifestation of the past, a means of approaching the divine, a mechanism for healing, a plot device, a medieval cinema, a complex means of communication, or an alternative plane of existence. We have simply not determined which of these are pertinent to Byzantium. Historians (Angold, Hatlie) have begun to use dreams as an indicator of the concerns and fears of a period, or ‘age of anxiety’ (in Dodds’s sense) without explicit analysis of the dream narratives in the context of dreaming. We would hope to select a certain number of narratives for close examination by a multi-disciplinary group, and arrive at some view of how dream-narratives work in Byzantium. Is there any difference between ‘dreams’ and ‘visions’? what are ‘phantasiai’ and ‘logismoi’? How do our categories map on to Byzantine ones? How visual are the narratives? How are they plotted? How do they relate to fictional products of the literary imagination? and to other forms of perception and cognition in Byzantium? And, finally, how should historians use them in constructing cultural and social history?  A web presence could allow the offering of narratives to supplement those already entered into the database, and also of contributions to their discussion, both before and after the event. Each contributor brought a Byzantine dream, introduced it (10 minutes) and the group then discussed it for an hour.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This meeting has a sharper focus—on surface survey. Initially seen as a precursor to excavation, the use of survey as an independent tool has expanded significantly and the method has been refined. Investigating settlement patterns, land use, cultural identity, and social hierarchies, survey archaeology—also called landscape archaeology—offers Byzantinists the ability to read history from the land, measuring information gleaned from texts against evidence offered or counter-offered by the material remains, quite often revealing information that is wholly absent from the written record. Survey archaeology provides data both chronologically broad and geographically wide, enabling us to understand small regions and their settlements, but also to compare regions and broad patterns. The use of field survey and the interpretation of its data, however, raise a number of questions for archaeologists of the medieval East. How does Byzantine survey archaeology fit within the broader field of survey archaeology? How do the research strategies of diachronic surveys account for an area that belongs more to the field of historical archaeology than to the field of classical and prehistoric archaeology? How do we evaluate the findings of older surveys that did not incorporate Byzantium fully into their initial research agenda? How reliable is the data collected from survey archaeology? In the absence of standardized methods (and chronological bands), how does one read across survey data? These and other questions were addressed by the speakers, who specialize in methods of archaeological survey, the analysis of data, and the interpretation of results.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From the costume dramas of the 1950s and 1960s to the feature films of the twenty-first century, Hollywood has conjured a great variety of epochs and characters, yet has struggled to represent the ancient Americas. Dr. Pohl has decades of experience documenting the Pre-Columbian past in scholarly publications, as well as bringing it to life in films. His lecture will provide unique insight into the reasons for the movie industry’s challenges in representing the ancient civilizations of the Americas. This illustrated lecture is presented in association with the current exhibition in the Dumbarton Oaks Museum, Inspiring Art: The Dumbarton Oaks Birthing Figure.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The start was not as joyous as we are this afternoon. It fell in the sad last days of 1963, only weeks after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, that the eight mushroom-like pods of the wing were opened to enable the permanent exhibition of Robert Woods Bliss’s Pre-Columbian art. But that was then, and this is now. We have come together for something cheerful, on the order of a cast party after the final performance in the successful run of a great play. Since January of 2013, the institutional calendar has not seen a single month without a reception, tour lecture, talk, special event, or some combination of them.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

But it cannot be emphasized too much that the Blisses, when they left Dumbarton Oaks to Harvard University, designated it very explicitly not to become a think tank or a beachhead for a school of international relations (DC has enough of those already), but rather to be (and I quote) “a home for the humanities.” Perhaps especially because Washington is a city of politics, institutions devoted to the study of past cultures have an important supporting role to play, especially in conjunction with the diplomatic and museum community. Between 1940 and when they died in the 1960s, the Blisses founded their bequest upon their collections. But a foundation does not a whole edifice make. The two were intent on making Dumbarton Oaks, as it is formally named, a Research Library and Collection so that fellows could study here and produce advanced scholarship. The emphasis of the Blisses on art as amplified and contextualized by archaeology, history, art history, epigraphy, and other humanistic disciplines has served us well, since the focus in Pre-Columbian studies shifted decades ago from the collection of objects to the study of the ancient American past, through exhibitions, archives, scholarly programs, fellowships, and much more."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Made of cords, both Inka and Wari khipu seem to have recorded not only quantitative or statistical content, but narrative information as well. The variation in cord structures, colors, wrapping patterns, and knots encoded and conveyed information, while the basic khipu elements-flexible knotted cords-offered a lightweight and compact means of transporting information across distances. This exhibition is the first to bring together examples of Wari, Inka, and Colonial khipu. Less than a dozen complete Wari khipu are known to exist in museum collections, and three will be on display at Dumbarton Oaks, along with interactive displays that will help visitors understand the way khipu worked, how they were made, and how information was encoded.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cummins’s Director’s Office Public Lecture, “Mirrored Reflections: Spanish Iconoclasm in the New World and Its Reverberations in the Old.” The event took place in the Fellowship House Oak Room.Five hundred years ago, Martin Luther posted the Ninety-Five Theses; half a century later, in the summer of 1566, the Protestant iconoclastic fervor of the Beeldenstorm gripped the Netherlands. Taking these two events as its point of departure, this talk explored how images became a central manipulative element in the religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and how America was in many ways the crucible. It focused on one of the most famous texts about the Spanish in America: Bartolomé de las Casas’s Breuíssima relación de la destruycion de las Indias (1552) and subsequent editions with illustrations.Thomas B. F. Cummins is the Dumbarton Oaks Professor of the History of Pre-Columbian and Colonial Art at Harvard University.

The symposium, organized by Vera Tiesler and Andrew Scherer, will run for two full days, beginning Friday morning and concluding late Saturday afternoon.Epitomizing the radiating sun and perpetuating the cycles of life and time, fire was and continues to be a central force in the Mesoamerican cosmos. In the Mesoamerican worldview, heat and flames are animate forces and signify strength and vitality; the most powerful of individuals are embodied with immense heat. Moreover, fire is transformative; it is both a means to destroy and to transport offerings to otherworldly places. The importance of heat and flames is evident in a spectrum of ritual practices, ranging from the use of sweat baths to the burning of offerings, especially copal.In Pre-Columbian times, human bodies were among the most valuable resources heated or consumed by fire. The collection of papers in this symposium revolves around the body and represents a diversity of approaches to the uses and multilayered meanings of fire in ancient, historic, and modern Mesoamerica, including archaeology, bioarchaeology, epigraphy, iconography, ethnohistory, and ethnography.The symposium is organized by Vera Tiesler (Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán) and Andrew Scherer (Brown University). Symposium speakers include Ximena Chávez (Tulane University/Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia), Oswaldo Chinchilla (Yale University), John Chuchiak (Missouri State University), Danièle Dehouve (Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense), William Duncan (East Tennessee State University), Markus Eberl (Vanderbilt University), Christophe Helmke (University of Copenhagen), Stephen Houston (Brown University), Jesper Nielsen (University of Copenhagen), Guilhem Olivier (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), Joel Palka (University of Illinois, Chicago), Grégory Pereira (French National Centre for Scientific Research), Pedro Pitarch (Universidad Complutense de Madrid), Prudence Rice (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Gabrielle Vail (New College of Florida).

Researchers have gained a good understanding of the principles of khipu recording and accounting for administrative purposes. However, Spanish observers of Inka record keeping at the time of the conquest stated that this knotted-cord device was also used for recording narrative events of the past. This talk reviews what we have learned to date regarding khipu record keeping and speculates on how we may go about investigating the still undeciphered narrative contents of these extraordinary records. Gary Urton is the Dumbarton Oaks Professor of Pre-Columbian Studies and Chairman of the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University.

In ancient Mesoamerica, these practices were considered essential to rebirth, renewal and the cycling of the world. A number of ancient murals, notably the spectacular paintings of Cacaxtla, Mexico, depict individuals engaged in offering blood. The paintings document the importance and antiquity of the practice and illustrate its role in a process of sacrifice, death and rebirth that lies at the heart of the Mesoamerican worldview. Maria Teresa Uriarte is head of the Cultural Affairs department of the Universidad Nacional Autonóma de México (UNAM) and director of the project “La pintura mural Prehispánica.” She is the author of over forty publications and co-editor of Olmeca: balance y perspectivas and Pre-Columbian Architecture in Mesoamerica.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A perusal of the recent literature on Pre-Columbian warfare reveals that much of the work is regionally focused or primarily concerned with the evolution of violent conflict from formative to increasingly complex societies. Lacking, however, is a dialogue on Pre-Columbian warfare that recognizes the striking parallels in certain practices—captive taking, human sacrifice, warfare as statecraft, violence as ritual—that occur across the hemisphere. Researchers across the Americas have marshaled the same new methodological advances—such as bioarchaeology, settlement archaeology, and GIS analysis—to tackle the problem of violent conflict, yet may not be taking advantage of the insights gained from similar studies in other parts of Latin America. This symposium will take advantage of these new trends in research by bringing together a diverse group of scholars with similar interests in understanding warfare in the Pre-Columbian past.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In Mesoamerica, the rise of civilization and state level society is characterized by thriving interregional trade and the development of one of the world’s most complex market systems. In the Andes, the situation appears markedly different, with the political economy more important than the commercial economy in organizing both production and distribution systems. This symposium will examine the structure, scale, and complexity of economic systems in the Pre-Hispanic world, with a particular focus on the central highlands of Mexico, the Maya lowlands, and the central Andes. Presenters will examine dimensions of ancient economy, including artisans who produced goods as part of their livelihood, merchants (and other individuals) who exchanged and moved a wide range of goods over space, and the trade and distribution networks through which goods were exchanged, bought, and sold.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Often considered neutral representations, this gathering seeks to analyze and contextualize the visual culture of archaeological illustration. What is the intellectual history of the field? How did early archaeological illustrations cleave or depart from scientific illustration in other fields? What was the relationship between the archaeological artists and prevailing currents in the fine arts? How have representations—such as aerial photography—shaped the direction of archaeological field research (and vice-versa)? How did certain graphic conventions begin, and why have some remained so central to the field? Many scholars speak of the "accuracy" of drawings, maps and models, implying a greater faithfulness to "truth," yet how and in what ways are these images culturally informed by the interests and trends of their own times? How do these presentations of data and reconstructions shape our perceptions? Finally, the symposium will also look at contemporary 3D models and the future of archaeological illustration. What is the heuristic value of contemporary presentations (i.e., "beyond illustration")? This symposium will bring together scholars working on specific critical histories of representations as well as broader approaches to the understanding of visual conceptualizations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This inspired the use of specific materials, patterns, and plants. The resulting courtyard and roof garden are decidedly contemporary and avoid recreating a Farrand design, yet generate a respectful and resonant echo of the masterpiece only one block away. Woltz will discuss this project and three others at a range of scales in which contemporary designs emerge from the firm’s extensive cultural and historical research. Projects include The Cedars in Old Brookville, New York, Centennial Park in Nashville, Tennessee, and Citygarden in St. Louis, Missouri. For each of these projects, the design team first conducts extensive research into the region’s geologic, ecological, and historical contexts. From this broad view, the research then focuses on the specific uses of the site to discover historical and cultural traces through maps, letters, photographs, and archaeology. Thomas Woltz was named Design Innovator of the Year by the WSJ. Magazine in 2013. In 2011, he was invested into the American Society of Landscape Architects Council of Fellows, among the highest honors achieved in the profession. He was educated at the University of Virginia, receiving master's degrees in Landscape Architecture and Architecture. Current work includes projects at Hudson Yards (NYC), Memorial Park (Houston), Devonian Botanic Garden (Alberta, Canada) and Cornwall Park (Auckland, New Zealand).

These vary according to garden type – aesthetic or utilitarian, public or private, “wild” or “formal,” secular or sacred – and according to the background and motives of the experiencer. Ranging through numerous examples of garden history and garden literature across times and cultures, Professor Buell will take note of some important ways in which gardens can embody or activate environmental memory in the different meanings of that term: personal, folk-collective, national, evolutionary, spiritual. But how closely does a passion for gardens or gardening correlate with environmental stewardship beyond those privileged garden spaces? To what extent does it nurture an “ecological conscience,” a sense of connectedness and accountability to the natural world? To those larger questions of environmental ethics Professor Buell will also suggest some answers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Introduction to the Dumbarton Oaks Director's Office sympoium, "Sign and Design: script as Image in a Cross-Cultural Perspective (300-1600 CE)"Dumbarton Oaks is pleased to announce a symposium, to be held in the Music Room of Dumbarton Oaks... more Dumbarton Oaks is pleased to announce a symposium, to be held in the Music Room of Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., on Friday, October 12th, Saturday, October 13th, and Sunday, October 14th, 2012. Please note that the symposium will be two and a half days: sessions will begin at 9 am on Friday, and conclude Sunday afternoon. In the Middle Ages and beyond, legal, documentary, exegetical, literary and linguistic traditions have organized the relationship between image and letter in diverse ways, whether in terms of equivalency, complementarity or polarity. In this symposium, we wish to explore those situations in which letter and image were fused, forming hybrid signs that had no vocal equivalent and were not necessarily bound to any specific language.  Although imagistic scripts work on the visible, arranging representation, they challenge the legible in terms of linguistic signification. The incorporation of figures, objects, colors, even events, within the letter insists on the material dimension of the sign. As the iconicity of the letter transforms reading into gazing, the script-like character of the image compels consideration of the co-signification of sign forms. In mediating each other into altered formats, the script-image disrupts a-priori models and ideas and thus redefines both text and image in terms of their signifying and representational processes. The disruptive effect of imagistic script inheres in a suspension of meaning that opens the system of representation and signification in which it was produced and circulated. During the three-day conference, we propose to bring together scholars of Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Pre-Columbian cultures from numerous disciplines – art history, history, literature, religion, linguistics, and law – to consider the purpose, operations, agency and specular forms of iconic scripts. What sort of communication did they facilitate? Did they imply reception by the inner eye? In prompting recognition of the aesthetic dimension of texts, did they open governance, law, literature, diplomatics, and theology to sensorial appreciation? Did they enforce a latent principle of non-representability? Does their use imply what might be called an iconomy, a practice of policing images? The symposium is organized with Brigitte Bedos-Rezak (New York University) and Jeffrey F. Hamburger (Harvard University). Symposium speakers include Elizabeth Hill Boone, Ghislain Brunel, Anne-Marie Christin, Tom Cummins, Vincent Debiais, Ivan Drpić, Antony Eastmond, Beatrice Frankel, Cynthia Hahn, Herbert Kessler, Katrin Kogman-Appel, Didier Méhu, Irvin Cemil Schick and Irene Winter.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Introduction to the Dumbarton Oaks Gardend and Landscape symposium, "The Interlacing of Words and Things in Gardens and Landscapes: Beyond Nature and Culture"Over recent decades, debates about environmentalism, global warming and its consequences for life... more Over recent decades, debates about environmentalism, global warming and its consequences for life have triggered a questioning of the opposition between nature and culture. This has become particularly obvious in discussions among landscape architects and anthropologists. Yet there is little in common between these two areas of debate. Landscape architects tend to be concerned with ways of devising new roles for humans in the transformation of a natural world shared to a great extent with non-humans, thus endorsing the embeddedness of nature and culture, but perhaps falling short in the criticism of these dualistic concepts. Anthropologists have been largely concerned with describing and understanding the perspectives of non-Western peoples without seeking to impose the implicit dualities of nature/culture, emotion/reason, practice/ideology, mundane/ritual, sacred/profane, cosmos/society. In this symposium, we attempt to bring these two areas of debate closer by proposing new modes for the description and understanding of gardens, whether in the context of history or in the present – as they have been, or are, experienced by those who make and use them across many different areas of the world. Gardens are the result of a selection of plants, objects and animals for intentional purposes. This has led in turn to the transformation of those plants, objects and animals; that is to say, they have been appropriated for human communication, and become representations in poetry, imagery, religion and myth. The same process has taken place with features of the wider landscape. So, if we provisionally bracket off the categories relating to nature and culture in the western world, we find that the challenge of interpreting descriptions of gardens and landscapes impels us to rediscover the specific categories involved in constituting them as representations. The papers in this symposium cover in equal measure western and non-western traditions, and range from individual case studies to analyses of long-term historical developments. The aim is to show how garden and landscape studies illuminate the many different modalities of transforming the world in which we live and act.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This carefully controlled invasive species was planted in the 1860s by an owner of Dumbarton Oaks, Edward Linthicum. His family name sounds like a second-declension Latin neuter as used in the Linnaean taxonomy, but it is actually Scottish. The ficus—all of which has ramified from the northeast corner of this orangery—provides vivid evidence for the sustained quality of gardening at Dumbarton Oaks. The vine also speaks to the conservativism of this institution. The traditionalism of the place sometimes makes it hard to conduct experiments, but all the same you are here to make a success of one. No one has recited more often than I the local mantra of Byzantine, Pre-Columbian, and Garden and Landscape Studies. No one values and supports our three fields of studies more than I. But no one is more acutely aware that we cannot (to risk a seriously troubled metaphor) rest on the laurels of fields as framed 75 or 50 years ago, and that failure to adapt and grow may well mean contraction or even worse extinction. The cultural marketplace of the United States, even under the aegis of a university such as Harvard, is a site of unending Darwinian struggle, never more than now. So I am very grateful to the co-organizers of this symposium, the wonderful duo of Yota Batsaki and Sarah Burke Cahalan, for the innovation and imagination behind this symposium. They have knocked themselves out to produce the display of books, the online exhibition of digitized images, and above all the conception of this symposium.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We aim to revisit these developments from a comparative perspective that will include Europe, the Ottoman Empire, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Main themes for discussion are global networks of plant discovery and transfer; the quest for medicinal plants and global crops such as ginseng, tea and opium; the economies of gift, trade, patronage, and scientific prestige in which plants circulated; imperial aspirations or influences as reflected in garden design; and visual strategies and epistemologies. Individual papers will explore the contributions of naturalists such as William Bartram (North America), Paul-Émile Botta (Levant), and François Le Vaillant (South Africa). The symposium is timed to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the Rare Book Room at Dumbarton Oaks, and will feature an exhibit of botanical works from our collections.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To me as a Latinist, a name that sounds like a second declension neuter has great appeal. The Ficus—all of which grows out of the northeast corner—constitutes a testimonial not only to one way in which nature and culture may come together.

On Friday, June 15 Perry gave a talk to Dumbarton Oaks staff and interns about the role of social media and digital trends at Harvard. Perry spoke about the challenges of the constantly changing digital landscape, and the delicate balance between control and influence in providing open access to an ever wider array of resources. Mobile devices have revolutionized the media industry, and social apps have come to define institutions’ online identities. The creation, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge remain central to all of the university’s digital efforts. Following Perry’s presentation, Dumbarton Oaks staff presented various initiatives in the field of digital humanities and social media, from the ongoing digitization of 17,000 Byzantine seals to intern and project blogs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For historians and archaeologists this promises new data to add to the growing wealth of information on the environmental matrix, the changing ecological conditions of the Roman empire and its responses. For climate scientists it offers the opportunity to verify that the postulated mechanisms though to be documented by proxy indicators actually functioned and had the anticipated impact; it offers a kind of super-proxy evidence, eye-witness testimony on particular climate conditions in the distant human past.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The... more This essay traces the history, current state, and potential future of comparative literature. The great expansions have coincided with aspirations for international understanding. The term first emerged after the Napoleonic wars. The field soared in the late 19th century, became a discipline after the Second World War, and experienced its most vigorous growth (of departments and programs) in the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Comparative literature has always worried its supporters as well as its skeptics. At the same time it has experienced a constant crisis within. In each episode it has responded by enlarging its purview and self-definition. Thus in the late 20th century it transcended the European literatures that had long been its bedrock to embrace East-West literary and cultural relations in ever-broader outward orbits, encompassing eventually first Edward Said's orientalism, then Homi Bhabha's deconstructivist postcolonialism, and finally Gayatri Spivak's eclecticism. The models that served during the extended pax americana seem poorly suited to terrorism, war, and globalization. Supranationalism cannot be lightly readjusted to fit transnationalism. But comparative literature can and will survive, so long as balances persist between theory and practice, so long as interdisciplinarity does not come at the cost of disciplinarity, and so long as the indivisible relationships uniting humanism, humanities, and humaneness are not forgotten. While comparative literature retains its emphases on language-training and critical skills, and while it satisfies desires of students to transcend boundaries culturally, interpretatively, and otherwise, it will not only always remain alive but even often thrive.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Readying myself for this undertaking has forced upon me the jouissance of scholarly research, which has encompassed both hunting down books and articles and surfing the web. The scholarship has allowed and even forced me to indulge anappetite for industrial espionage by finding out how things have been and are being done at other institutions. As a comparatist, I have felt duty- and honor-bound to explorewhat sorts of programs and proclamations about Comparative Literature have been issued at colleges and universities around the country. I had performed the same kind of research (it is tempting to call it "comparison shopping") before in an administrative capacity, whenever our program undertook to revamp its rules and requirements, and I collected and read all sorts of publications on the nature and future of Camp Lit (as the name is often affectionately and efficiently truncated); but I never had a motive to synthesize my findings systematically and process them intellectually."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One common measure of the propriety or impropriety of a given word or topic has been to see if it brings a blush to the cheeks of an innocent girl. The same two-thousand-year period has witnessed much greater fluctuation in suppositions about the groups that represent the opposite of blushing girls and that indulge with particular abandon in "dirty talk." Yesterday's preconceptions do not match today's prevailing beliefs -- that men who engage in manual labor (sailors, dockworkers, truckdrivers) are peculiarly predisposed to use earthy language and that among old people it is old men who are especially prone to think dirty and, if given the opportunity, to talk correspondingly. If in the Middle Ages any collection of individuals was implicated strongly in obscene language and was perceived to be habitual offenders, that group was old women, above all old brothelkeepers. After all, it was from old bawds that the very notion of bawdry derived."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Over two decades he lectured and wrote with the twin goals of interpreting contemporary literature, especially French but also English, for his countrymen and of fostering a European culture that transcended nationalism. In 1932 he published Deutscher Geist in Gefahr (German Spirit in Peril). This last-ditch effort at helping to avert the coming German catastrophe failed, but he redirected his energies toward establishing that centuries earlier a continent-wide humanism, fusing classicism and Christian tradition, had taken shape in what he called the Latin Middle Ages. The outcome was his chef d'oeuvre, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. He died in 1956 in Rome, a civis Romanus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
