          09 February 2021
        
December 10, 2018 marked the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which for the first time in the world affirmed the equal and inalienable rights of everyone.
In commemoration of the anniversary of the Declaration, at the initiative of the United Nations in Belarus, for the first time in many years, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was published in the Belarusian language. The text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Belarusian was clarified by the Center for the Study of Belarusian Culture, Language and Literature of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.
