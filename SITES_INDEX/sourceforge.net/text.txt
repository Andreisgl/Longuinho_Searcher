It is a very poor compared with the others existent. Very unstable, very bad for the eyes at least, it is very limited in matter of dictionary but is the instability of the image in the monitor that marks the worst problem. For some years, since the beginning, that I am hopping a more stable, at least, software on this, like Chattha Sangayana for instance.
