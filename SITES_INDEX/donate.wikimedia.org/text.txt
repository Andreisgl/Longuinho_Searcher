We want everyone to have equal access to knowledge, forever
Thank you for considering a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia and other crucial free knowledge projects.
Each year, because of the 2% of readers who give to support our mission, we can expand the reach of free knowledge to new corners of the world. If Wikipedia matters and is useful to you too, please join them and donate $5, $20, $50 or whatever feels right to you today.
Wikipedia is different. No advertising, no subscription fees, no paywalls. Those don't belong here. Wikipedia is a place to learn, free from bias or agenda.
Today, we invite you to donate whatever feels right. Show the world that access to independent and unbiased information matters to you.
Thank you.
Sorry, we're having a little trouble detecting what country you're in. Please visit Ways to Give for international payment methods.
