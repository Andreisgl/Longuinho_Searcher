First, the clustering of firms has been found to promote creativity in an urban environment (cf. clustering theories). Second, and indicating an inverse course of action, creative individuals have been found to foster the economic growth of cities by attracting employers to places where the former want to reside (cf. creative class theory). Third, the specific attributes of a location, in particular urban environments, have been shown to have a positive impact on individual creativity. Our study adds to this fascinating liaison by exploring: the economic and non-economic features that lead to designers establishing their businesses in Athens’ city centre; and the perceived direct and indirect benefits of these locational factors in relation to the creative labour of these entrepreneurs. In this way, we merge micro and macro perspectives on the relationship between creative entrepreneurship and place, but in a potentially experimental setting, given that the urban fabric in Athens had to be reconstructed after it experienced economic and social turbulence following the 2008/2009 economic crisis.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersΤhe symbolic economy of cities -new shapes of work and networking: Τhe role of traditional and emerging clusters of creativity in the Αthenian public space2020 • Aggeliki Demertzi, Maria KoutsariIn this article we investigate the changes in the Athenian urban space that have taken place in the light of the crisis, changes in labour relations and the symbolic economy. In the first part a theoretical overview of international changes, the role of culture in development strategies and the symbolic economy is made. Urban policies and new shapes of work are also being analyzed. The case of the historic centre of Athens, as a host of creative activities and as a growing tourist destination, also comes to the forefront. The last part is devoted to the ongoing field research conducted to look into the traditional and emerging creativity clusters in the center of Athens, how they are built and located and their interaction with the Athenian Urban Factory.

Athens and Barcelona used as urban laboratories to document the factors (discursive, structural, and institutional) that influenced micro-entrepreneurial adaptation strategies to the post-2008 crisis and thus to discover to what extent the altered discourses and practices of this agency exhibit potential to stimulate wider socio-economic transformations. The field engagement targeted ‘‘conventional’’ micro-enterprises, operating at street-level in traditional market sectors and micro-enterprises operating in the social and solidarity economy. The results indicate that the crisis indeed provided context for path-shaping processes towards alternative urban economic realities in which this particular agency has an important role to play. However, for a transformative process to capitalize, further empowerment, institutional framing and material support needed along with the activation of other types of collective and individual agencies.Download Free PDFView PDFState of the Art and Mapping of Competences ReportFabrizio Boldrini, Fondazione Hallgarten - Franchetti Centro Studi Villa MontescaThis document is the synthesis Report of the Mapping of the competences in the Culture and Creative Sector (CCS) carried on in Greece, Italy and Spain. The Authors of the national reports gave all the documents and information on which the results and comments are based. The National reports were realized by:  CUP Consorzio Universitario Piceno (ITALY)  Athens Chamber of Tradesmen (Greece)  FVEM, Federación Vizcaína de empresas del metal (Spain) The comments and the attempt of comparison are in full responsibility of the Authors of the Summary report. The primary idea that comes in mind when we thing to the so defined “art professions” or “creative professions” is related to the idea of defining, validating, maintaining, and reproducing certain categories of actions, related to what is generally accepted and defined as “cultural category of art and craft”, in order to produce an economic added value that it is clearly expected as “added” to the cultural and humanistic values. The creative sector is distributed through a network of institutions (schools, museums, galleries, commercial market systems, and industries), all of which participate in constructing a global, international system or network of networks for Art and creativity. The skills related to the Art world and to the creative sectors are thus part of the modern systems of competences, and many parts of these networks are now highly professionalized and organized in an industrial way. The creative economy is difficult to define and measure. However, we have the opportunity to identify not totally satisfactory attempts to find common terminology and streamline statistical data. Furthermore, if we take into account the Cultural and Creative sector in all the EU Countries and in the rest of the world, matters become even more complex with diverse cultural issues fusing into other definitions. Even if finding and investigating common definition is not the aim of this report, anyway this complicated debate is one of the reason of the fascination and specificity of the creative industries which ‘refuse to lie down and be measured like other sectors of the economy. And that is why economists and statisticians will probably never stop debating how to define them and how to estimate their worth’ (Newbegin 2010). The rise of these cultural and creative sectors as an ‘industry’ has also brought resistance from numerous artists and creative practitioners who do not want to associate themselves or their work with the post-industrial consumerist conditions set by ‘industry’. They prefer to see themselves as individual creative practitioners who are closer to social activism and cultural value than industrial workmanship. Without undermining the social and intrinsic value of the cultural and creative sectors, which in themselves add value to the economic discourse for cultural and creative potential, those championing these sectors are also aware that the process of validation for the sector and its specificities cannot be approached without an ‘industry’ lens. This is the process which has revolutionised political agendas in the last decade and which set an important cultural agenda in numerous countries, regions and cities. The most successful managed to fuse the grassroots social and cultural values with the discourse on markets and growth.Download Free PDFView PDFAreaSocio-economic profile and working conditions of freelancers in coworking spaces and work collectives; evidence from the design sector in Greece2017 • Vasilis Avdikos, Athanasios KalogeresisThird places, such as business incubators, co-working spaces and work collectives, represent a new ecosystem of collaborative working practices in the creative economy that alters significantly the spatial distribution of work and the notion of “workplace”. Collaborative workplaces emerged after the gradual collapse of the stable employment paradigm that was one of the main features of the Keynesian welfare state and as a response to precarious working conditions that were augmented during the recent economic crisis and the subsequent recession. The paper contributes to the critical understanding of these new geographies of workplace and working conditions that third places manifest. Using data from a large survey about the economics and the working conditions of Greek designers and from four interviews with freelancers in work collectives and facilitators of co-working spaces, the paper sheds light on the socio-economic profile and the working conditions of Greek freelance designers that use co-working spaces and work collectives as means of reducing precarious working conditions and personal-professional risks. The results show that designers in third places, in contrast to freelancers that use formal workplaces or work from home, work long hours with poor pay and a large proportion has no safety net, concerning social security. Third places can be enclaves of the shadow economy and of very specific precarious working conditions. On the other hand, third places help freelance designers become more embedded to business networks, both local and foreign, rather than working in isolation. By allowing the sharing of projects, business intelligence, resources and social time, third places appear to successfully counterbalance the pervasive immaterialization of labour. Networking effects between freelancers and self-employed that choose to work in third places usually result in greater opportunities for outsourcing and subcontracting and in more exports.Download Free PDFView PDFCultural Trends, 27:3, 187-202, DOI:  10.1080/09548963.2018.1473981The uneven regional geography of labour precariousness; the case of Greek design industry2018 • Vasilis Avdikos, Athanasios KalogeresisThe paper attempts to unveil the precarious working conditions of the design industry and the ways that precariousness is distributed throughout space. In more details, the paper researches the working conditions of graphic, web, interior and industrial designers in the Greek design industry and contributes to the understanding of the uneven regional geography of precariousness. We use a large dataset that was produced through an online questionnaire (Creative Survey 2015, Avdikos et al, 2015) and through descriptive statistics we analyze the working conditions of three occupational categories: freelancers; full-time employees and owners of mainly very small design sector enterprises. The analysis shows that Greek designers work in particularly precarious conditions, considering their annual income, their working hours and their work-related injuries, especially compared with other service sectors of the Greek economy. Moreover, the spatial distribution of precariousness is highly uneven, especially for the full-time employees between the capital region of Attiki and the other 12 Greek regions. access: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09548963.2018.1473981Download Free PDFView PDFFrom a Jewish Quarter into a Creative DistrictAndrea Dúll, Barbara  KeszeiThe seventh district of Budapest once was home to the Jewish community, but World War II left the once flourishing Jewish neighbourhood with abandoned houses and poorlymaintained buildings, which were squatted in the early 2000s by ruin pubs and subsequently attracted and were populated by underground artists and cultural creatives ‐ now the area hosts subcultural1entrepreneurs, creative communities and a lively nightlife concentrated around the unique venues of the city called „ruin pubs”. This paper aims to illustrate the present dynamics and characteristics of this creative urban environment through a case study of grassroots, small‐scale fashion designers and retailers. By focusing on these space users and their relations we intend to give insight into the buzz that whirls around in this area and to reveal part of its fascinating socio‐cultural history at the same time, since the present creative ecology feeds upon its unique past.Download Free PDFView PDFCreative Districts Around the World2014 • greg richards, Lénia  MarquesCreative districts are springing up around the world. They are seen as catalysts for urban development, creative regeneration and cultural renewal. This volume reviews a wide range of such developments from different cities around the world. The 500th anniversary of one of the historic creative districts of the world, Bairro Alto, in Lisbon (Portugal) served as a catalyst for the publication of this interactive e-book. In a journey that starts in the heart of the Bairro, several authors and artists take us on a journey to different creative districts around the globe. Creative Districts around the world is a snapshot of the dynamic changes taking place in very different cities, such as London, New York, Johannesburg or Melaka.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Arts Management, Law, and SocietyCultural Policies and Local Planning Strategies: What Is the Role of Culture in Local Sustainable Development?2009 • Pier Luigi SaccoDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Historical Review/La Revue HistoriqueFamily and Labour in Corfu Manufacturing, 1920–19442018 • Dimitrios KopanasThis article concentrates on the relation between labour and family in the secondary sector of production of Corfu. It argues that family was crucial in forming the main characteristics of the labour force. The familial division of labour according to gender and age is examined not only as a decisive determinant in the categorisation of work positions as skilled and unskilled but also as a factor that defined the temporality or permanence of labour. It also focuses on the role of local and family networks and their effect on the labour market. These questions, thoroughly discussed by labour historians, will be applied to the case of Corfu, in an effort to complete the Greek paradigm.Download Free PDFView PDFTeorija in praksaSelf-governance and social inclusion in a post-socialist city: Contradictions between city-designated and naturally-occurring arts districts2020 • Peter KumerThe tendency of artists and creative professionals , ranging from non-profit and for-profit firms, individual artists, and cultural participants, to cluster in a specific area is observed and discussed in a large body of literature. However, the ways these districts are internally organised has received much less attention. In Ljubljana, one can find five different arts districts that emerged via grassroots and top-down planning approaches. The article explores their community through the concepts of self-governance, social inclusion, and the right to the city. Our examination of the collective activities in these districts shows that the naturally-occurring districts reflect a spatial political agenda. Those active in such areas are resistant to heteronomy, formal regulation and hierarchy while being engaged in activism, social justice advocacy and artistic self-expression. In contrast, a city designation allows less freedom in management and organisation of the space and does not conflict with authorities over control of the land. While both district types reveal a strong desire to constantly change and produce novelty, the naturally-occurring districts are evolving at a faster pace. The article highlights the value of self-organisation and informal networks in the construction and development of arts districts.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
