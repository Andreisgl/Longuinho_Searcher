Tarot for Entrepreneurs contains a wide variety of spreads, including ones on your strengths and weaknesses, your money story and how to change it, your ideal audience, what to delegate and prioritise, when and how to level up, where to go next, when to quit, how to sell yourself without selling your soul, how to say ‘No’, and more. Besides fifty full card spreads, Tarot for Entrepreneurs also includes a selection of one-, two-, and three-card spreads and a handful of other intentional practices that will help big and small business owners centre themselves and connect to their inner guidance. You will find these additional sections at the end of the book. Although I dubbed the card spreads in this book tarot spreads, there is no reason why you shouldn’t use any other means of divination to work with them. Feel free to pick your favourite oracle deck or set of angel cards or to use your crystals or runes when working with this book. If you want to mix it up as you do a reading, go ahead. Your gut will tell you what works best for you; don’t be afraid to listen. Cartomancy as a tool to (re)connect to our intuition Those who are familiar with my work know that I don’t merely see cartomancy as a means for divining the future. Throughout my cardslinging career, I’ve used the card decks at my disposal first and foremost as tools to (re)connect to my intuition. I do ask questions about the future – from the Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksOccult & ParanormalFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
