submitted
verification
final decision
This language has been verified as eligible.The language is eligible for a project, which means that the subdomain can be created once there is an active community and a localized interface, as described in the language proposal policy. You can discuss the creation of this language project on this page.
Once the criteria are met, the language committee can proceed with the approval and will verify the test project content with a reliable neutral source, such as a professor or expert.
If you think the criteria are met, but the project is still waiting for approval, feel free to notify the committee and ask them to consider its approval.A committee member provided the following comment: Please contribute to the test project. StevenJ81 (talk) 14:25, 11 June 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The community needs to develop an active test project; it must remain active until approval (automated statistics, recent changes). It is generally considered active if the analysis lists at least three active, not-grayed-out editors listed in the sections for the previous few months.
The community needs to complete required MediaWiki interface translations in that language (about localization, translatewiki, check completion).
The community needs to discuss and complete the settings table below:
