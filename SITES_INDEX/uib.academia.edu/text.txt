In this research I followed several classes which used the video game "The Walking Dead" to learn ethics in the classroom. The thesis focuses on gathering relevant information from a number of research fields and shows a holistic view of the pros and cons of video games in the classroom. The study reveals a positive attitude towards video games from both the students' perspective, as well as satisfied educators. The study includes multiple surveys with over 100 students, focused interviews with 17 students and 3 teachers, and statistical data from the school. The results indicate that video games are potentially good tools for educators that wish to use them, and that those who do, should be encouraged to use them. The research also includes the key success factors to implement video games in classroom learning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
