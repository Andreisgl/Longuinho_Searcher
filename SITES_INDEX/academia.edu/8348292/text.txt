Zayra  Millan2011, Behavioural Brain ResearchOn April 24-27, 2010, the Motivational Neuronal Networks meeting took place in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The conference was devoted to "Emerging, re-emerging, and forgotten brain areas" of the reward circuit. A central feature of the conference was four scholarly discussions of cutting-edge topics related to the conference's theme. These discussions form the basis of the present review, which summarizes areas of consensus and controversy, and serves as a roadmap for the next several years of research.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBiochemical PharmacologyMechanistic insights into nicotine withdrawal2011 • Mariella De BiasiDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuropsychopharmacologyCortico-Basal Ganglia Reward Network: Microcircuitry2010 • Anthony GraceDownload Free PDFView PDFBrain ResearchOptogenetic dissection of neural circuits underlying emotional valence and motivated behaviors2013 • Edward H NiehDownload Free PDFView PDFContribution of emotional and motivational neurocircuitry to cue-signaled active avoidance learningAnton IlangoMany animal and human subjects can learn to avoid punishment or noxious stimuli by exploiting the sensory cues predicting them. In cue-signaled active avoidance (AA) learning, subjects first learn about the predictive properties of cues and subsequently learn a behavioral strategy of an avoidance response (e.g., crossing a hurdle that divides a two-compartment cage in order to avoid a mild but unpleasant footshock). AA learning develops with fear reduction as an intervening variable. If execution of avoidance action occurs on the pursuit of seeking safety, an overlap of recruitments of neurocircuitry essential for reward processing and for avoidance can be expected on the basis of two-process theory. Recent insights from two-way AA (2WAA) studies, which integrate both Pavlovian and instrumental components, provide strong evidence for the recruitment of emotional circuitry centered on the amygdala and motivational circuitry centered around midbrain dopaminergic structures. In this review, we address the following: (1) the role of emotional neurocircuitry in the formation of AA, (2) the involvement of reward circuitry and its input-output pathways on AA, and (3) the possible serial and parallel processing within and between these circuitries.Download Free PDFView PDFProgress in NeurobiologyThe ventral basal ganglia, a selection mechanism at the crossroads of space, strategy, and reward2010 • Tony J PrescottDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroscience and Biobehavioral ReviewsThe SEEKING mind: Primal neuro-affective substrates for appetitive incentive states and their pathological dynamics in addictions and depression2011 • Antonio AlcaroDownload Free PDFView PDFPharmacological ReviewsNeurotensin and DA interactionsCharles NemeroffDownload Free PDFView PDFPharmacological reviewsMechanisms of Action and Persistent Neuroplasticity by Drugs of Abuse2015 • Gavin DaweAdaptation of the nervous system to different chemical and physiologic conditions is important for the homeostasis of brain processes and for learning and remembering appropriate responses to challenges. Although processes such as tolerance and dependence to various drugs of abuse have been known for a long time, it was recently discovered that even a single pharmacologically relevant dose of various drugs of abuse induces neuroplasticity in selected neuronal populations, such as the dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area, which persist long after the drug has been excreted. Prolonged (self-) administration of drugs induces gene expression, neurochemical, neurophysiological, and structural changes in many brain cell populations. These region-specific changes correlate with addiction, drug intake, and conditioned drugs effects, such as cue- or stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. In rodents, adolescent drug exposure often causes significantly more behavioral changes ...Download Free PDFView PDFAlcoholism: Clinical and Experimental ResearchEthanol-Sensitive Brain Regions in Rat and Mouse: A Cartographic Review, Using Immediate Early Gene Expression2009 • Mickael Naassila, Catherine VilpouxDownload Free PDFView PDFMultiplexed neurochemical signaling by neurons of the ventral tegmental areaDavid BarkerThe ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an evolutionarily conserved structure that has roles in reward-seeking, safety-seeking, learning, motivation, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction and depression. The involvement of the VTA in these various behaviors and disorders is paralleled by its diverse signaling mechanisms. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of neuronal diversity in the VTA with a focus on cell phenotypes that participate in 'multiplexed' neurotransmission involving distinct signaling mechanisms. First, we describe the cellular diversity within the VTA, including neurons capable of transmitting dopamine, glutamate or GABA as well as neurons capable of multiplexing combinations of these neurotransmitters. Next, we describe the complex synaptic architecture used by VTA neurons in order to accommodate the transmission of multiple transmitters. We specifically cover recent findings showing that VTA multiplexed neurotransmission may be mediated by either the segregation of dopamine and glutamate into distinct microdomains within a single axon or by the integration of glutamate and GABA into a single axon terminal. In addition, we discuss our current understanding of the functional role that these multiplexed signaling pathways have in the lateral habenula and the nucleus accumbens. Finally, we consider the putative roles of VTA multiplexed neurotransmission in synaptic plasticity and discuss how changes in VTA multiplexed neurons may relate to various psychopathologies including drug addiction and depression.
