It was there that my curiosity for understanding people and knowing how to connect with them began – and it hasn’t stopped. My mission is to directly serve one million people. I want to facilitate a pathway to take them back home to themselves through connection and understanding – of both themselves and others. Mentoring and teaching human connection and business growth is the vehicle that I do this through today. I live in Sydney, Australia with my son, and when I’m not working on my mission you can find me practising yoga."view lessBooks by Shani TaylorView MoreSkip carouselcarousel previouscarousel nextFrom Ignored to Adored: Ignite Connection and Communication Online to Attract Your Soul Mate Clients...Without Being SalesyAuthor LoadingQuick navigationHomeBooksAudiobooksDocuments
