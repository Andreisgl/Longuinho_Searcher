Ensuring free knowledge for future generations
Access to knowledge is a fundamental human right. The Wikimedia Endowment is our enduring commitment to a world of freely shared knowledge, now and in perpetuity.
We believe that knowledge is a foundation. It is a foundation for human potential, a foundation for freedom, a foundation for opportunity. Wikipedia is the world’s largest free knowledge ecosystem — a public trust for the common good — built by people, for people.

Why an Endowment?
When it was founded in 2001, Wikipedia seemed like an impossible dream. Today, Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects are a core part of the 21st century cultural infrastructure. They are a testament to human ingenuity, one that the Wikimedia Endowment is committed to protecting so that this knowledge can be passed down to future generations.
The purpose of the Wikimedia Endowment is to support Wikimedia projects in perpetuity. It represents a collective belief in what the Wikimedia projects have accomplished and what they have yet to achieve. As a fund that is invested for growth, it creates a solid financial foundation for the future and ensures long-term security.
A robust Endowment also provides Wikimedia’s community of volunteers and donors with the confidence that the mission and vision in which they’ve invested will be supported for future generations. New gifts are added to those of past donors, allowing the Endowment to keep pace with the growing needs of Wikimedia projects.
“Wikipedia stands alone in the online world, providing information and knowledge to anyone, anywhere, without cost.”— Annette Campbell-White, Wikimedia Endowment Advisory Board Member
Our projects
Wikipedia was launched in 2001 with an ambitious vision: “Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.” Today, Wikipedia is the largest collection of open knowledge in history. With over 57 million articles in 310 active languages, it is accessed by 1.5 billion unique devices every month, making it the only non-profit site in the top ten most visited on the web.
Wikimedia also supports a range of additional projects that further enrich the landscape of free knowledge. Every month, more than 300,000 volunteer editors contribute to these projects, helping millions of people around the world discover information and share it with others. 
When you make a gift to the Wikimedia Endowment, you become part of this global movement. Your contribution helps ensure that Wikimedia’s free knowledge resources remain accessible and valuable for generations to come. 
Select projects supported by the endowment:
Free and open storage for the structured data of Wikimedia projects including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wikisource, and others
The world’s largest multilingual free-to-use library of illustrations, photos, drawings, videos, music, and other media
The open source package that powers Wikipedia and many other wikis on the web
The world’s largest freely available and openly editable online encyclopedia
A free multilingual dictionary currently available in over 170 languages
“The Wikimedia Endowment is a springboard for growth and innovation in how we curate and deliver knowledge to the world for generations to come.”— Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia Founder and Wikimedia Endowment Advisory Board Member

The Endowment has been established, with an initial contribution by Wikimedia Foundation, as a Collective Action Fund at Tides Foundation (Tax ID# 51-0198509). Tides is a public charity with a 40-year track record of holding and managing charitable funds for nonprofit organizations. The purpose of the Wikimedia Endowment is to act as a permanent safekeeping fund to generate income to support the operations and activities of the Wikimedia projects in perpetuity. An Advisory Board, nominated by the Wikimedia Foundation and appointed by Tides, makes recommendations to Tides related to the Endowment. Tides or the Wikimedia Foundation may choose to transfer the Endowment from Tides to the Wikimedia Foundation, or other charities identified by the Wikimedia Foundation that are engaged in activities that further the Wikimedia Endowment’s purpose. Following any transfer, the Endowment would continue to act for the purpose of being a permanent, income-generating fund to support the Wikimedia projects.
