Today's Featured Project
Instructional Design
The instructional design camp is a set of course modules based around a core created by Peter Honebein and students of the Indiana University. Groups from other universities, as well as other researchers and experts, are welcome to add modules to this project. The goal of this learning experience is to develop the skills needed to design instructional material using media (especially communication technologies) to transfer knowledge as effectively as possible between teachers and learners. The project currently comprises about 130 pages included well-developed modules on crafting well-formed learning objectives, prioritizing content for learning experiences, designing constructivist learning experiences, designing instruction for cognitive behaviors, designing instruction for psychomotor behaviors, designing instruction for affective behaviors, designing instruction for interpersonal behaviors.
