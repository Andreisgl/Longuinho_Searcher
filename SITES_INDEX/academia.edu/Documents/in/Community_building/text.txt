This article continues the discussion of community building in public relations by arguing that (1) dialogue is an essential component of ethical community building and (2) public relations is uniquely situated within the organizational hierarchy to help build communities through dialogue. Drawing on insights from the communitarian movement, feminism, dialogue, and the social networks concept of tertius iugens, this article further develops a dialogic/communitarian model of public relations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael L Kent and +1Adam Saffer•  5  Social Networks, Public Relations, Dialogue, CommunitarianismMobilizing for community building and everyday innovationSave to LibraryDownloadby Maria Foverskov•  7  Design for Social Innovation, Interaction Design, Design Research, Communication TechnologyScale Development and Construct Clarification of Servant LeadershipThis article presents an integrated construct of servant leadership derived from a review of the literature.

Subscale items were developed to measure 11 potential dimensions of servant leadership: calling, listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, growth, and community building. Data from 80 leaders and 388 raters were used to test the internal consistency, confirm factor structure, and assess convergent, divergent, and predictive validity. Results produced five servant leadership factors—altruistic calling, emotional healing, persuasive mapping, wisdom, and organizational stewardship—with significant relations to transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, extra effort, satisfaction, and organizational effectiveness. Strong factor structures and good performance in all validity criteria indicate that the instrument offers value for future research.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Wheeler•  9  Psychology, Servant Leadership, Transformational Leadership, Organizational EffectivenessConceptualising community cultural development: The role of cultural planning in community changeThere is a growing recognition of the importance of engaging grassroots communities in all aspects of community building and other initiatives to address concerns about declining community well-being.

Playback theatre combines artistic expression and social connection based on story-telling and empathic listening, thus bringing together modes thought to promote healing. Here, we explore the potential of playback theatre to promote recovery in the field of mental health. We conducted two playback courses for a total of 19 adults in a university-based program for recovery, and collected qualitative reports pre–post self-report measures for self-esteem, personal growth and recovery. We also developed a self-report measure named the playback impact scale that includes items related to creativity, confidence in performing, social connectedness and seeing one's life as full of stories. We find significant enhancement in the playback impact scale following a 10 week playback course. The qualitative reports indicate recurring themes of enhanced self-esteem, self-knowledge, as well as fun and relaxation, and enhanced sense of connection and empathy for others. These preliminary results suggest that playback theatre can serve as an effective practice for enhancing recovery processes from serious mental illness.► Playback theatre workshops for people with severe mental illness were studied. ► In playback, personal stories are enacted on the spot with empathy by peers. ► Qualitative reports and a quantitative playback impact scale were used. ► Workshops enhanced self-esteem, self-knowledge, relaxation, connection with others, and empathy. ► We suggest that playback can be effective for enhancing recovery from serious mental illness.Save to LibraryDownloadby galia S moran•  12  Psychology, Improvisation, Mental Health, Mental IllnessSanierungen von Wohnsiedlungen.

Building on academic literature as well as grassroots social justice organising, it argues that the very idea of individualism is an illusion. Specifically, an illusion made visible by foregrounding the lived experiences of disabled people, where interdependence is always already a foundational aspect of life. It maintains that the perspectives of disability-aligned writers and activists provide vital contributions to broader critiques of the neoliberal capitalist system. Comparing these perspectives to academic discourses, it demonstrates how interventions in both scholarship and wider movement building are necessary for imagining intersectional liberated futures beyond neoliberal individualism. By introducing discourses of disability justice, care webs, access intimacy and the complexities of debility, this zine provides an accessible starting point for exploring the potential of radical crip perspectives in bringing about sociopolitical and economic change.This zine was originally produced for my undergraduate dissertation in BA International Relations at SOAS, University of London.

During the recent years PechaKucha, a PowerPoint presentation format consisting of twenty slides that are shown twenty seconds each, has become popular in business school classrooms especially in creating more compelling and engaging presentations. Extant studies on PechaKucha have mostly focused on the presentation aspect of the concept, but in this paper we build on this body of knowledge by looking at PechaKucha as a means for supporting community-building in contemporary classrooms. This insight is drawn from the authors’ participation in PechaKucha Nights in Helsinki, Finland, and Tokyo, Japan, as well as the PechaKucha organizers’ published description of the concept. By aligning ourselves with studio-based learning and experiential learning theories we participate in laying the first theoretical foundations to analyzing PechaKucha in classrooms in order to foster student-driven learning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Anna  Salo-Toyoki and +1Miikka J .

Most theorizing begins with basic assumptions about the three main social actors for which public relations has been practiced: (1) corporations, (2) nongovernmental and civil society organizations (NGOs and CSOs), and (3) governments. Questions about society itself are rarely examined, but when they do come up, scholars and practitioners tend to assume generally accepted values and mores. Neglected has been a robust criticism of the concepts upon which such paradigms have been built. The authors argue that earlier paradigms are mostly inadequate in addressing the needs of a 21st Century in which communication technology is creating rapid globalization while it is dangerously exacerbating the tensions of multiculturalism. Through a critical discussion of prior assumptions and paradigms in public relations scholarship, the authors underline the need for public relations to revitalize and bring its body of knowledge into the 21st Century. The authors posit and discuss how the community-building theory originally espoused by Kruckeberg and Starck (1988) and modified in subsequent scholarship can provide a viable departure point toward developing new approaches to research about and practice of public relations that can take into account the dynamic environment wrought by changes in communication technology."Save to LibraryDownloadby Chiara Valentini and +1Kenneth Starck•  7  Public Relations, Organization Studies, Globalism, Community buildingLocalising the city: The new turn in DMO campaigning – making residents locals calls for host-making activities to solve the DMO's tasks for tomorrow's urban destinationIn recent years, a turn in DMO campaigning and management decisions is noticeable-a turn from the traditional tourism value chain perspective towards a focus on 'the locals'.

From a tourist perspective – or through 'the tourist gaze' – residents are now perceived as locals. They are part of the destination and as such they are a resource. The importance of the host-guest relation becomes evident in such DMO campaigns, and the hypothesis in this paper is therefore that a strengthened focus on host-making activities at DMO level is to be seen as a competitive resource. With current DMO-turns as inspiration, the paper includes considerations on the development of the future tasks of the DMOs based on host-making activities for the DMO aiming to facilitate host/guest-encounters.

I examine the ways in which the DIY values of autonomy and community are expressed through their social organisation, musical performances, and DIY practices of production and exchange. The autonomous community of DIY hardcore is an attempt to realise a positive alternative to capitalist alienation, though it remains contained within a restricted sphere of cultural activity and may still generate some value for capital.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sean Martin-Iverson•  10  Social and Cultural Anthropology, Creative Commons, Indonesia, Value TheoryThe Roles of the Police in the Offender Reentry ProcessSave to LibraryDownloadby Heather Perez•  6  Criminology, Social Support, Problem Solving, Public SafetyBedri Gencer-Tasavvufun Cemaat InsasiSave to LibraryDownloadby Bedri Gencer•  4  Religion, Community building, Naqshbandiyya, SufismeStructuring and Regulating Collaborative Learning In Higher Education With Wireless Networks and Mobile ToolsSave to LibraryDownloadby Piia Näykki•  8  Higher Education, Social Software, Knowledge Representation, Collaborative LearningZusammen mit F.

I capitoli si soffermano sui vari contesti in cui Petrarca veniva letto, interpretato e riscritto e si confrontano con diverse pratiche in cui il modello petrarchesco si riattiva e insieme si trasforma, dal gioco all’emblema. L’evoluzione dei paratesti, tanto verbali quanto visivi, riflette le attese di determinate comunità, dalle corti alle accademie, e al tempo stesso influenza le dinamiche di lettura e circolazione dei testi. Come la storia della lirica quattro-cinquecentesca è inseparabile dalla storia della ricezione di Petrarca, così, nel Rinascimento, la nascita e lo sviluppo del commento alla poesia dei contemporanei si intrecciano con le vicende della tradizione esegetica dedicata a Canzoniere e Trionfi.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bernhard Huss•  18  Renaissance Studies, Renaissance Humanism, Petrarch, Italian HumanismTweeting the night away: Using Twitter to enhance social presenceSave to LibraryDownloadby Joanna  Dunlap and +1Patrick Lowenthal•  20  Information Systems, Education, Instructional Design, Educational TechnologyMAIDAN ON FACEBOOK: SENSITIVE, EXPRESSIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE PROTEST LOREThe thesis traces Internet textual representations of the Maidan, a wide-scale protest movement that took place in 2013-2014 in Ukraine, and their function in identifying the opposing sides during the protests.

These texts helped to formulate new narratives, articulate attitudes, and build relationships, create a sense of community within the protestors’ side, which had its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices.Facebook served as an important platform for the initial appeal, for coordination between the participants, for reflections, and for identification of the opposing sides during the protests. It was a key space for sharing emotions, personal stories, humor and expressive forms of protest, making allusions to known literary works, historical events and world public figures.Exploring the types of narratives and their contribution in identifying the opposing sides, the work is focused on digital stories that illuminate elements not covered by the professional media coverage and official reports. It traces the diverse forms, topics and expressive devices in the narratives, and identifies the categories of lore (eyewitness narratives, (re)telling of stories, jokes, poetry, songs, etc.). It provides juxtaposition of the patterns found in the text with the main events of each specific day. The thesis provides several chapters that focus on: (1) a review of the historical context of the events; (2) an analysis of the data with reference to all categories and topics, and the main findings; (3) the role of humor and expressive devices in releasing the tension of the conflict and in helping to formulate the attitudes within the protestors’ side; (4) evidence of the functions of personal stories as they build relationships, create a sense of community, and validate the participants’ experiences and the significance of the events from the protestors’ perspectives; (5) interpretation within this protest lore, and its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices as in the example of the Nebesna Sotnia (Heavenly Hundred) narrative formation and its correlation to the repertoire of motifs and terms of the selected historical periods: the Cossack, the Ukrainian National Republic and World War II.The study underlines the relevance of time and several patterns related to historical events, as Facebook posts immediately responded to the events occurring on the square and streets occupied by protestors, simultaneously with professional media outlets, and sometimes prior to them. These findings have important implications that go beyond the Ukrainian context in that they contribute to the further exploration of social networks functioning in relation to factual events.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nataliya Bezborodova and +1Nataliya  Bezborodova•  25  Space and Place, Language, Space and Place, Intangible cultural heritage, Memory StudiesCommunity Engagement in a Multicultural Society: Smokescreens and Mirrors?Proceedings of a seminar held at the Darebin Arts and Entertainment Centre, Preston, Victoria, on 14 April 2005 / Compiled and edited by Josara de Lange and Simone Battiston.

As mounting evidence demonstrates the long-standing system of punitive discipline to be not only ineffective in reducing behavioral incidents but to be detrimental to young people, particularly those of color, districts are increasingly turning to the research-supported practice of restorative justice.This brief highlights three schools located in the urban districts of New York City and Rochester, N.Y., each committed to restorative justice reform: Leadership and Public Service High School (LPS) in Manhattan, World of Inquiry School (WOIS) in Rochester, and East Lower and Upper Schools (East) in Rochester. Presented here are the experiences they shared with us at the Center for Urban Education Success (CUES) through a series of interviews that included administrators, a university professor, teachers, social workers, and a student. Interviews with several LPS staff, conducted by The New York Times Magazine, supplement these accounts .

Owing to these large numbers and the catastrophic housing conditions, many had to spend varying periods of time incamps. This article looks at refugee camps for German refugees in three West German Länder to examine the extent to which community-building can be seen to have taken place between 1945 and 1960.  The development of the refugee camp phenomenon is traced, from the initial policies to ensure a quick turnaround, to the transformation of many camps into Wohnlager , providing facilities for everyday living, social events and employment. Perceptions of outsiders are analysed and found to show that they were rarely able to recognize instances of community growth. This may be largely explained by political considerations and concern over the social effects of living in a refugee camp environment. Finally, the article turns to Camp Poxdorf/Hagenau in Mid-Franconia to demonstrate how a refugee settlement with a thriving social life was able to emerge from an unremarkable hut camp.  The conclusion places the refugee camps in the wider context of the postwar history of the FRG, arguing that fears surrounding ‘ asocials ’ in camps reflected wider fears about society, but, like the rest of the population, refugee camp residents were working towards achieving a state of normality. Camp communities can be seen to have aided integration by providing an environment where the residents could get used to their situation and look to the future."Save to LibraryDownloadby Meryn  McLaren•  3  German History, Refugee Camps, Community buildingMSc Thesis.

Even the most generous team can not predict all complexities and externalities of city developments. There are more and more theoretical and practical works, which insist that our cities should develop organically. Even though, the experience of the previous century should also be taking into account. That is why contemporary projects are trying to combine both top-down and bottom-up development.This work focus on the development of urban expansion areas, which are traditionally totally influenced by the architect’s visions (the informal urban expansion is not taken into consideration in this thought). In the light of Organic Urbanism movements, these areas tend to give more opportunities and responsibilities to the future residents. With this in mind, the current study looks at residential Community Building as an essential parallel process with the actual spatial area development. Moreover, for many western countries these responsibilities deviations are new not only from the environment policy point of view but also for the society. Altogether, it determines the nature and focus of current study. The aim of the research is to explore the links between Organic Urban Expansion and Community Building as well as what is the influence of the Innovation Diffusion on it? The Almere Oosterwold is a case study for this research.The study makes use of qualitative data. The main sources if information for this were interviews with future residents, municipality workers, architects; analysis of Facebook and Twitter posts, comments; secondary data as several interviews with project creators, information about Almere development history as well as project details. First, the analysis of this information leads to the identification aspects that influence on particular personal and community characteristics. Second, it showed the relationships of these characteristics with spatial characteristics of the different initiatives1. Finally, this analysis determinates several community and spatial projects typologies as well as result of their combinations.At present, the actual development of Oosterwold consists of initiatives of different sizes (from a single detached house up to large developments with 60+ dwellings). Most of the initiators, who are building now or about to start it, are the pioneers of Oosterwold. Each of them had spent around two or even more ears on getting all necessary permits. This study detected what are the drivers and barriers which influence on the social composition among pioneers. It also shows that they form different types of communities depending on their attitudes and reasons of collaboration. It is important to realise that relationship inside those communities, their openness to the neighbours, decision-making power distribution and other aspects influence on the physical characteristics of their projects. For example, some of them have common space other do not; there are monotony projects and diverse.Under those circumstances, it is important to understand to what kind of pioneers the strategy of Organic Urban Expansion correspond to achieve certain goals the urban professionals have.Save to LibraryDownloadby Oleksandra Tkachenko•  6  Diffusion of Innovations, Urban Planning, Urban Studies, Community buildingInstitutionalising Islam: Community Building and Conflict in the CaribbeanThe Muslim community in the post-indenture Caribbean witnessed several changes that affected the character of its practices.

As a way of institutionalizing the faith, the community had established masajid (mosques), schools and other organisations. As these physical manifestations and legal entities were being inserted into the local space, foreign missionaries who visited imposed their brand of Islam on the local landscape. The tension which arose resulted in the splintering of the Muslim community. Each strain, Sunnism and Ahmaddiyaism, vied for supremacy – territoriality - by supporting missionary visits from India and later Pakistan, and embarking upon da’wah (invitation to...). As these streams of Islam collided or solidified, organisations, either at the community or national levels, were established.  As part of forging the ummah (community) Muslim leaders established links with South American Islamic bodies, principally those of British Guiana and Suriname. This development of Islamic consciousness and cooperation culminated with a regional conference in 1950 in Trinidad that involved Muslims from Trinidad, British Guiana, Suriname and Barbados. This conference was the highlight of Islamic consciousness in the Caribbean and preceded the departure of two eminent Islamic scholars, Maulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqui and Dr. Fazl-ur Rahaman Ansari. This paper, therefore, takes a look at the above issues and rethinks them in the context of interconnected networks and sometimes, through the lens of the local-global nexus. It views it as a noble attempt by the Muslims to assert the ummah beyond national boundaries and a forerunner to other efforts in the later twentieth century.Save to LibraryDownloadby Halima-Sa'adia Kassim•  6  Consciousness, Civil Society, Identity, CaribbeanEncouraging role based online learning environments - The BLUE ReportSave to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Rosser•  11  Community Development, Peer Review, Community of Practice, Learning EnvironmentValoriser les ressources des quartiersCe rapport pour le réseau Amadeus croise une analyse des dynamiques institutionnelles de participation (ou de non-­participation) avec l’analyse d’un panel d’expériences illustrant le pouvoir d’agir des habitants dans la politique de la... moreCe rapport pour le réseau Amadeus croise une analyse des dynamiques institutionnelles de participation (ou de non-­participation) avec l’analyse d’un panel d’expériences illustrant le pouvoir d’agir des habitants dans la politique de la ville.

Principalement développées dans ces mêmes territoires, sept expériences donnent à voir le « pouvoir d’agir » des habitants.Save to LibraryDownloadby Thomas Kirszbaum•  5  Community Organizing, Community building, Pouvoir d'agir, Politique De La VilleA Tale of Two Communities: Group Dynamics and Community Building in a Spanish-English TelecollaborationSave to LibraryDownloadby Mark Darhower•  14  Discourse Analysis, Spanish, Virtual Community, Computer Mediated CommunicationDesigning capacity-building in e-learning expertise: Challenges and strategiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Peake•  15  Instructional Design, Educational Technology, Community Development, ICT for DevelopmentCommunity participation in riverfront developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Henry  Sanoff•  9  Information Systems, Architecture, Strategic Planning, Community ParticipationBuilding An Active Citizenry: The Role of Neighborhood Problems, Readiness, and Capacity for ChangeSave to LibraryDownloadby Laurie Van Egeren•  15  Psychology, Leadership, Collective Action, Community CapacityA leadership program in an undergraduate nursing course in Western Australia: Building leaders in our midstSave to LibraryDownloadby Vicki Cope•  20  Program Evaluation, Nursing, Communication, LeadershipPolicy and challenges of building schools as inclusive communitiesIn this paper, we address building inclusive communities by looking at school as a community, as a place where students participate in learning and also learn to participate in the life of a community and life in a broader inclusive... moreIn this paper, we address building inclusive communities by looking at school as a community, as a place where students participate in learning and also learn to participate in the life of a community and life in a broader inclusive society. At the international level, policies increasingly position education as a business organisation, with claims about accountability and managerialism that distract attention from and undermine inclusive community‐building writ large. This results in conversations in education that focus almost exclusively on students' test performance without attention to the moral and civic purposes of education. In this paper, we argue that the international policy attention to test performance in education, with a focus on proficiency over learning, claims educational equity as a purpose but perpetuates social inequality instead.Save to LibraryDownloadby Svjetlana Curcic and +1Susan L Gabel•  4  Inclusive Education, Social Inequality, Community building, InclusiveNextLast »Related TopicsYouth participationFollowFollowingDeradicalizationFollowFollowingTaklil-i Cemaat (Deminishing of Mosque Congregation As a Problem)FollowFollowingSocial actionFollowFollowingNaqshbandiyyaFollowFollowingSufismeFollowFollowingYouth empowermentFollowFollowingCross Media PlatformsFollowFollowingTelevision FormatsFollowFollowingSocial TheoryFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
