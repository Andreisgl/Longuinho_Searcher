The authors have an established track record of historically informed longitudinal research on the topics of sport, finance, and public management.,  This includes books and articles about England’s successful history of hosting the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games, including finance, operations, marketing, legacy and ‘populism’. We are active members of the British Academy of Management and are both employed full-time by University of York, part of the Russell Group of research-intensive UK universities. This report answers in distinct sections the four questions asked by the DCMS in its call for evidence. Firstly, we assess in detail what the public wants from major cultural and sporting events and the extent to which this is reflected in the events scheduled for 2022. With reference to past sporting mega-events we show that events which capture a sense of occasion and communality without being too ostentatious, forge a place in collective popular memory (see also section 5).  A substantial idea of what this legacy entails should be planned for, although such legacy and ‘feel good factor’ will to some extent be emergent, and it is not simply a case of being able to fully control a collective programming of the mind.  Based on this, we then outline an idea for bringing people from all four nations of the UK together, before briefly explaining our thoughts about measurement of outcomes and what the legacies of such events should be.  From this we conclude to address the challenges facing the delivery of major cultural and sporting events in 2022, and the bid to host the World Cup 2030.  Finally, we provide a list of sources and evidence used in this report.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Extant literature has instead tended to focus upon infrastructureissues, economic geography and cultural aspects. Drawing upon Swarm theory andVamplew’s typologies of entrepreneurial activity in sport we compare and contrast thecommercial aspects of two World Cups; firstly, the 1966 tournament held in England, thefirst time that a serious attempt had been made to produce and licence a mascot character(‘World Cup Willie’) to exploit merchandising opportunities. This approach became animportant part of World Cups thereafter; Secondly, the 1994 tournament in the USA, themost commercially successful World Cup ever, realising record profits and catalysing the relaunch of elite professional soccer in the USA. These cases enrich understanding of thenetworks and entrepreneurial activity of the World Cup, one of the most significant sportingand cultural mega-event projects in the world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The nature of history means that all the events and periods we study are typically ordered into chronologies, often divided down into periods and events; these six papers highlight management and organizational phenomena that have in some way been defined by the periods in which they manifested themselves. All of them illustrate organizations or industries passing through particular " change points " or critical evolutions, which would in some way alter the character of the industry while also presenting important continuities. It is worth briefly reflecting on the concepts of chronology and periodization, and how they characterize the topic, before we embark on the papers of the SI. Three of the papers also showcase research done by colleagues at the Management and Organization History Research Cluster at the University of York since Miskell (2015, p. 210) noted its establishment.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Shadow hybridity and the institutional logic of professional sport: Perpetuating a sporting business in times of rapid social and economic changeby Kevin  Tennent and Alex GillettPurpose: Existing studies of the finance of English Association Football (soccer) have tended to ... more Purpose: Existing studies of the finance of English Association Football (soccer) have tended to focus on the sport's early years, or on the post-1992 Premiership era. The authors examine a case from the turbulent 1980s charting the struggle for economic survival of one club in a rapidly changing financial, economic, political and demographic landscape. The purpose of this paper is to examine not only the financial management of a football club during this time, but also the interventionist role of the local authority during this turbulent period. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate the financial difficulties of a sport business, Middlesbrough Football and Athletic Company Limited, examining the broader economic context, drawing on unseen archival sources dating from the 1980s to analyze the relationship between club, local and national government and the regional economy. Findings: They not only examine the financial management of the football club but also analyse the interventionist role of the local authority in supporting the club which had symbolic value for the local community.Practical implications: This paper is relevant to policymakers interested in the provision of local sports facilities and the links between elite sport and participation. Originality/value: The authors show that professional sports clubs are driven by a different institutional logic to state organizations and the findings enable them to define these differences, thereby refining Thornton et al.'s (2012) typology of institutional orders. Furthermore, the case study highlights practices involving informal partnership between state and sport that the authors label as shadow hybridity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The 2018 conference theme, ‘Driving Productivity in uncertain and challenging times’, is an ideal opportunity to explore the value of historical study for management research. Histories of organizations, industries and institutions give us the opportunity to understand how managers have responded to uncertain and challenging times in the past, whether it be through war, economic crisis, scandal or other disruptions to their activities. Inspired by Fayol, Ford and Taylor managers also attempted to boost productivity, often with mixed results. In this track we specialize in chronologically or longitudinally motivated research. We welcome papers, symposia or workshop proposals either using new and innovative methodologies, or applying archival methodology to a new disciplinary context. We are also interested in context specific papers using more traditional historical methodology but which take innovative approaches to relate their findings to wider social science concerns. In addition, we appreciate papers dealing with the legacy of uncertainty in the past in business and management more generally, and how it has influenced the diversity of experience in present day businesses, regions and communities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
International taxation and corporate strategy: evidence from British overseas business, circa 1900–1965by Kevin  Tennent and Simon MollanBusiness History,  2015In this article we establish the impact and importance of international taxation on British overs... more In this article we establish the impact and importance of international taxation on British overseas business circa 1900 to 1965. As the levels of national taxation rose across the twentieth century, different states began to compete for taxable income. This created international double taxation whereby taxation was due twice on the same income or profit. We examine the difficulties that this caused and the responses of firms to this challenge, through the adoption of tax-minimisation strategies, alterations to corporate structure, and the relocation of corporate domicile. We discuss how international taxation was one of the secular changes in the international business environment that contributed to the rise of large-scale multinational enterprises. We conclude by making a call for greater consideration of international taxation in international business history.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A distribution revolution: Changes in music distribution in the UK 1950–76Little business history has been written on the popular music industry while sociological study h... more Little business history has been written on the popular music industry while sociological study has tended to focus on the effect of the industry on society. This paper concentrates on how recorded popular music reached the customer, charting the evolution of the industry in the UK from a cartel structure distributing only to specialists, into an industry which allowed upstream entry freely but increasingly emphasised large-scale distribution through mass retailers by the mid-1970s. The paper examines the structure of music distribution in the UK prior to 1965 and how the industry adapted its distribution strategy to the changing environment after 1965.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article examines the experience of one such tie, the New Zealand and Australian Land Company, a Scottish-based agricultural and land company which operated in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Australasia. This company contributed to the colonies' economic development directly, opening up new farming lands and initiating wool and protein exports, as well as influencing the development of the communities which grew up around its stations and factories. The article details the strategic development of the company until c. 1900 in the wider context of Australia and New Zealand's economic development, demonstrating that studying the evolution of commercial organisations can contribute to the wider debate around the role of British capital in development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Peterson and Berger argued that in the United States the majors lost market share to independent companies in 1955–62, then recovered their position to 1973. This article uses a newly-constructed database and concentration measures to test the proposition in relation to Britain for 1952–75. We find that British majors also lost market share, but the process started much later, and was not followed by a recovery. Instead, American majors entered the market directly from the late 1960s.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet in terms of learning the lessons of the past formanagement practice, while the study of management history and railways have been connectedin the work of a number of authors (Chandler, 1962, 1977; Gourvish, 1972, 1986, 2002, 2008;Edwards 2010, 2011) little work has been done on the non- mainline rail based public transportsector. The ownership and operation of public transport continue to be contentious topics today,particularly as, despite the transfer of risk to the private sector during the 1980s, majorinvestments such as the Edinburgh Trams, and the New Bus for London continue to require largeamounts of public capital. With public capital in shorter supply a return to the pre-Keynesian eraof local subscription for transport investment and operation may seem a desirable possibility.This paper studies one such early 20th century operation, the City of York Corporation’sTramways committee, which operated several tram routes as well as trolley and petrol buses. Thesystem was municipalised in 1909 to fund electrification but was eventually sold to a buscompany in 1934 after struggling to operate profitably on a narrow resource base. This paperuses a close examination of the minutes of the committee to analyse management style andpolicy with reference to major decisions, particularly in terms of attitudes to profitability and themanagement of the company’s resource base. The paper finds that despite municipal ownershipthe public service ethos that we might expect to be present today was absent in an organisationwhich mainly saw itself as a commercial venture, albeit one constrained by the political andeconomic environment surrounding it. Despite the professionalization of its managerial andengineering hierarchies, the undertaking was unable to sustain any kind of lasting competitiveadvantage, and was subsumed into a larger body.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unlike previous literature, which has tended to focus activities on the field, this book brings an institutional level approach to organizing the 1966 FIFA World Cup and examines the management process in the buildup and execution of the event.This intriguing new volume looks at the first significant UK government intervention in football and how this created a significant legacy as the government started to take a real interest in leisure facilities and stadium safety as policy areas after this competition. Foundations of Managing Sporting Events will be of considerable interest to research academics working on aspects of post war British, Imperial, and World history including sport, social, business, economic, and political history.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper examines the structure of music distribution in the UK prior to 1965 and how the industry adapted its distribution strategy to the changing environment after 1965.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Management and the Free-Standing Company: The New Zealand and Australia Land Company c. 1866–1900The scholarly reappraisal of the British imperial system as the ‘British World’ has given scholar... more The scholarly reappraisal of the British imperial system as the ‘British World’ has given scholars the opportunity to examine anew the financial, commercial and industrial ties which held the empire together. This article examines the experience of one such tie, the New Zealand and Australian Land Company, a Scottish-based agricultural and land company which operated in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Australasia. This company contributed to the colonies' economic development directly, opening up new farming lands and initiating wool and protein exports, as well as influencing the development of the communities which grew up around its stations and factories. The article details the strategic development of the company until c. 1900 in the wider context of Australia and New Zealand's economic development, demonstrating that studying the evolution of commercial organisations can contribute to the wider debate around the role of British capital in development.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Peterson and Berger revisited: Changing market dominance in the British popular music industry, c.1950–80In studies of the popular music industry, there has been much interest in the market share of the... more In studies of the popular music industry, there has been much interest in the market share of the leading firms (majors), and the apparent connections between a high level of concentration and musical innovation and diversity. Peterson and Berger argued that in the United States the majors lost market share to independent companies in 1955–62, then recovered their position to 1973. This article uses a newly-constructed database and concentration measures to test the proposition in relation to Britain for 1952–75. We find that British majors also lost market share, but the process started much later, and was not followed by a recovery. Instead, American majors entered the market directly from the late 1960s.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Management and Competitive Advantage in the public transport industry – York Corporation Tramways c.1909-1934Previous academic study of transport history has often tended to confine itself to the social and... more Previous academic study of transport history has often tended to confine itself to the social andcultural aspects of the wider history field. Yet in terms of learning the lessons of the past formanagement practice, while the study of management history and railways have been connectedin the work of a number of authors (Chandler, 1962, 1977; Gourvish, 1972, 1986, 2002, 2008;Edwards 2010, 2011) little work has been done on the non- mainline rail based public transportsector. The ownership and operation of public transport continue to be contentious topics today,particularly as, despite the transfer of risk to the private sector during the 1980s, majorinvestments such as the Edinburgh Trams, and the New Bus for London continue to require largeamounts of public capital. With public capital in shorter supply a return to the pre-Keynesian eraof local subscription for transport investment and operation may seem a desirable possibility.This paper studies one such early 20th century operation, the City of York Corporation’sTramways committee, which operated several tram routes as well as trolley and petrol buses. Thesystem was municipalised in 1909 to fund electrification but was eventually sold to a buscompany in 1934 after struggling to operate profitably on a narrow resource base. This paperuses a close examination of the minutes of the committee to analyse management style andpolicy with reference to major decisions, particularly in terms of attitudes to profitability and themanagement of the company’s resource base. The paper finds that despite municipal ownershipthe public service ethos that we might expect to be present today was absent in an organisationwhich mainly saw itself as a commercial venture, albeit one constrained by the political andeconomic environment surrounding it. Despite the professionalization of its managerial andengineering hierarchies, the undertaking was unable to sustain any kind of lasting competitiveadvantage, and was subsumed into a larger body.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Unlike previous literature, which has tended to focus activities on the field, this book brings an institutional level approach to organizing the 1966 FIFA World Cup and examines the management process in the buildup and execution of the event.This intriguing new volume looks at the first significant UK government intervention in football and how this created a significant legacy as the government started to take a real interest in leisure facilities and stadium safety as policy areas after this competition. Foundations of Managing Sporting Events will be of considerable interest to research academics working on aspects of post war British, Imperial, and World history including sport, social, business, economic, and political history.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter narrates that development with reference to marketing practice, academic research, and education, to show how ideas about the scope of marketing broadened, particularly during the decades after World War II. In particular, this chapter examines the ideas from services and relationship marketing that first emerged during and before the 1980s.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
