Although substantial information exists on the styles of these pipes, very little is known about their methods of manufacture. This paper examines one particular style of pipe, the Florence Pipe, associated with the proto-Wichita Great Bend peoples. A block of Minnesota pipestone was manufactured into a pipe using stone tools replicated after those found in the Robb Collection from central Kansas. This archaeological assemblage was proposed to have been used in the manufacture of Florence pipes, which was confirmed through use-wear analysis of the collection. The steps and labor requirements for the creation of Florence pipes are illuminated in this paper in a way that cannot be accomplished through archaeological analysis and use-wear analysis alone.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAn Exploration of Use-wear Analysis on Acheulean Large Cutting Tools: The Cave of Hearths' Bed 3 AssemblageTimothy Lambert-Law de LauristonLarge cutting tools (LCTs) are a stone tool techno-group that appeared ca. 1.76 Ma in Africa and marked the beginning of the Acheulean. The group is conventionally comprised of three tool types called handaxes, cleavers, and picks. The function of LCTs has only been determined through assumptions (e.g., names based on historical antecedents or assigning functional names to morpho-types) or through experimental tasks designed to determine if a particular tool type was efficient for a given task, (e.g., are handaxes conducive to butchery tasks?). To date, no extensive use-wear analysis has been carried out on African Acheulean LCTs. This is the pioneering study. Utilising a multi-stranded approach comprised of experimental archaeology, blind testing and low- power use-wear analysis the functions of a sample of LCTs from The Cave of Hearths were derived. The Cave of Hearths (CoH) lies in the Makapan Valley in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. Excavations were carried out from 1947 to 1954, and it is these excavations from which this study draws its sample. Thirty-eight handaxes and cleavers from the CoH Bed 3 Acheulean (ca. 0.5 Ma) were submitted to a low-power use-wear analysis. The results showed that a full range of tasks was performed on site including: wood- working, animal and vegetal matter processing, accompanied by digging and a number of other tasks. Corroborated by faunal analysis and an environmental reconstruction, the results suggest that the cave acted as a home camp/ residential base to the hominins that inhabited the area during the Acheulean. Additionally, evidence was found which may indicate that two of the tools were possibly hafted. If this finding is corroborated by future studies it would push back by approximately 150 Ka the earliest date previously published for hafting with Mode 3 tools.Download Free PDFView PDFUniversity of Alabama PressFrom Tubes to Platforms Chapter 1 in ARCHAEOLOGY & ANCIENT RELIGION2018 • Brad KoldehoffDownload Free PDFView PDFArcheological Investigations at Arkansas City, KansasRobert J HoardDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Arkansas City Country Club Site and Europeans in the Middle Arkansas River ValleyMarlin F HawleyDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Elk Hill Site 14RY328Tricia Waggoner, Robert J HoardDownload Free PDFView PDFIdentifying Microblade Function at EeRb-140 and EeRb-144, Kamloops, British ColumbiaRyan DickieDownload Free PDFView PDFWhittaker's Annotated Lithic BibliographyJohn WhittakerGood heavens there are a lot of lithic papers, and I have spent way too much time reading them!
