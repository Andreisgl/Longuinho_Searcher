Language is often defined circularly as whatever aspects of communication are uniquely human. While psychologists and biologists often define language as culturally specific shared systems of meaning, linguists often define language in terms of innate cognitive structures. A cross-disciplinary dialogue aimed at bridging these definitional chasms set forth two domains of language: a faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) that consists of skills shared with other species and a faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLN) that is specific to humans . They concluded that what constitutes FLN (including whether or not any aspects of language are unique to humans) and how language evolved remain open questions.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersFrontiers in PsychologyGestural and symbolic development among apes and humans: support for a multimodal theory of language evolution2014 • Heidi LynDownload Free PDFView PDFA cross-species study of gesture and its role in symbolic development: implications for the gestural theory of language evolutionJojo FengUsing a naturalistic video database, we examined whether gestures scaffold the symbolic development of a language-enculturated chimpanzee, a language-enculturated bonobo, and a human child during the second year of life. These three species constitute a complete clade: species possessing a common immediate ancestor. A basic finding was the functional and formal similarity of many gestures between chimpanzee, bonobo, and human child. The child’s symbols were spoken words; the apes’ symbols were lexigrams – non-iconic visual signifiers. A developmental pattern in which gestural representation of a referent preceded symbolic representation of the same referent appeared in all three species (but was statistically significant only for the child). Nonetheless, across species, the ratio of symbol to gesture increased significantly with age. But even though their symbol production increased, the apes continued to communicate more frequently by gesture than by symbol. In contrast, by 15–18 months of age, the child used symbols more frequently than gestures. This ontogenetic sequence from gesture to symbol, present across the clade but more pronounced in child than ape, provides support for the role of gesture in language evolution. In all three species, the overwhelming majority of gestures were communicative (i.e., paired with eye contact, vocalization, and/or persistence). However, vocalization was rare for the apes, but accompanied the majority of the child’s communicative gestures. This species difference suggests the co-evolution of speech and gesture after the evolutionary divergence of the hominid line. Multimodal expressions of communicative intent (e.g., vocalization plus persistence) were normative for the child, but less common for the apes. This species difference suggests that multimodal expression of communicative intent was also strengthened after hominids diverged from apes.Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of PrimatologyConnecting primate gesture to the evolutionary roots of language: A systematic review2021 • Flávia VeppoDownload Free PDFView PDFCurrent AnthropologyPrimate Vocalization, Gesture, and the Evolution of Human Language2008 • Michael A ArbibDownload Free PDFView PDFGestureGestural communication of apes2005 • Katja LiebalDownload Free PDFView PDFApe gestures and language evolution.pdfMatteo RiveraDownload Free PDFView PDFIn S.

John BenjaminsHands and faces: Linking human language and non-human primate communication2012 • Sherman  WilcoxThis chapter investigates the linguistic links between gesture and language, relying on data from signed languages. Data focuses on the developmental routes by which non-linguistic gestures become incorporated into the linguistic system of signed languages. Evidence is presented for two routes: one leading from gesture to word to grammatical morpheme, and a second leading from gesture to prosody to grammatical marker. These two routes emerge because of the semiotic characteristics of hands and faces. One application of this work is to inform research on non-human primate gesture. The goal is to pose new questions about the relation between gesture and language and to propose a new approach that primate gesture researchers may address when surveying the range of gestural forms.Download Free PDFView PDFFirst LanguageGestures of apes and pre-linguistic human children: Similar or different?2008 • Simone PikaDownload Free PDFView PDFLanguage, gesture, skill: the coevolutionary foundations of languageSterelny KimDownload Free PDFView PDFCommunicative Signaling, Lateralization and Brain Substrate in Nonhuman Primates: Toward a Gestural or a Multimodal Origin of Language?Jacques VauclairDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
