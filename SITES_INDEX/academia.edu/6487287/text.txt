It binds irreversibly to the ethylene receptors and inhibits downstream processes that are controlled by ethylene. In the area of postharvest this means many ripening processes of climacteric fruits, such as softening, color and aroma development, respiration increase and organic acid decrease are inhibited. However, beyond these processes, ethylene also has a role to play in responses to pathogen attack and to wounding, such as occurs during preparation of fresh-cut commodities. 1-MCP has effects on biochemical responses to these occurrences as well. In addition, 1-MCP has been used on non-climacteric commodities to determine what maturation and senescence processes are under the control of ethylene. This review will describe the current knowledge of the effect of 1-MCP on ripening and senescence, on the responses of harvested produce to pathogen infection, and responses of fresh-cut commodities.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Food Processing and PreservationEFFECT OF ANTIBROWNING AGENTS ON COLOR AND RELATED ENZYMES IN FRESH-CUT APPLES DURING COLD STORAGE2012 • G.

The review includes an exclusive discussion on production chain of minimally processed products from raw material selection to its consumption with different aspects including food safety issues. The intent is to provide a level of understanding that can be used to underpin future research directions in order to resolve existing issues that limit fresh-cut quality and shelf life.Download Free PDFView PDFPostharvest Biology and TechnologyRecent approaches using chemical treatments to preserve quality of fresh-cut fruit: A review2010 • laura gonzalezDownload Free PDFView PDFFresh-cut Fruits. In: The Commercial Storage of Fruits, Vegetables, and Florist and Nursery Stocks. USDA, ARS, Agriculture Handbook 66John C BeaulieuFresh-cut fruit products for both retail and food service applications have increasingly appeared in the market place recently. In the coming years, it is commonly perceived that the fresh-cut fruit industry will have unprecedented growth. For this reason, many leading fresh-cut salad manufacturers have targeted development of fresh-cut fruit products as part of their long-term business plans. However, processors of fresh-cut fruit products will face numerous challenges not commonly encountered during fresh-cut vegetable processing. The difficulties encountered with fresh-cut fruit, while not insurmountable, require a new and higher level of technical and operational sophistication.Download Free PDFView PDFDyna (Medellin, Colombia)Changes in Mechanical Properties of Minimally-Processed Yellow Pitahaya Treated with 1-MCPLiliana  Serna-CockDownload Free PDFView PDFHorticulturaeAloe-Based Edible Coating to Maintain Quality of Fresh-Cut Italian Pears (Pyrus communis L.) during Cold StorageRoberta PassafiumePear fruits are known for their antioxidant and nutritional characteristics. However, they are very susceptible to rapid decay. Edible coating (EC) represents a good strategy to maintain postharvest quality. The effects of two EC in slowing down the senescence processes in fresh-cut ‘Coscia’ pears were investigated: EC1 (A. vera gel, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose and pomegranate seeds oil (PSO), EC2 (A. vera gel and hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose). Weight loss, firmness and colour decrease more slowly in both EC-treated than in untreated (CTR) slices; soluble solid content increases faster in CTR, indicating a faster ripening process. The specific investigation of undesired microorganisms did not generate any colony in all analysed samples. Sensory analysis confirmed that the tasters preferred the EC2-treated samples, as they were the only ones that did not show undesirable flavours until the last day of storage.Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition Recent advances in modified atmosphere packaging and edible coatings to maintain quality of fresh-cut fruits and vegetablesmuhammad zeshanDownload Free PDFView PDFStewart Postharvest ReviewCurrent perspectives on the use of 1-methylcyclopropene in tree fruit crops: an international survey2007 • Gabriel SozziDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
