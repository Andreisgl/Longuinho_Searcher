The whole world of work is in evolution. The old employment system of secure, lifelong jobs with predictable advancement and stable pay is dead. For some time now we’ve observed a greater focus on flexibility, mobility, and the ability of quick adaptation of workers. The new era of Work 2.0 is coming driven by: work virtualisation, nonroutine creativity, hyperspecialisation, and reduction of communication, coordination and interactions costs. This calls for a different approach to management and work. However, technology is a double-edged sword, with the power to both liberate and enslave. The recession is said to be over, but you’ll never get your old job back – it’s disappeared and you can’t even blame the Chinese! Your job no longer exists – it’s been automated. Book "Work 2.0” isn’t just a description of what is happening to the labor market, how we're working nowadays, it’s a complete how-to guide for successfully navigating today’s treacherous jobs environment, mitigating the risks of job loss, job insecurity, and increasing automation. Book is discussing the repercussions of automation, changes in the economic balance between East and West in terms of work, the growing importance of innovation and creativity for creating value, how companies can take advantage of the new situation and how can individuals stay competitive on the labour market. How do you survive and thrive in the new labour market? How can workers cope in an economy which doesn’t generate stable lifelong careers? How can companies remain competitive and manage armies of dispersed hyperspecialists? You’ve become the newest victim of Work 2.0, a force you can’t possibly fight – but you can join it! If you are looking for a job – why not create one for yourself? If your company is losing its best talent – why not listen to what your workers are saying. Let them work anywhen. After all, there is nowhere to hide from the wave of creative destruction.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLabour Markets and Identity on the Post-Industrial Assembly LineAnthony  LloydAs a product of its time, the call centre utilises new developments in telecommunications and information technology to offer cost-efficient delivery systems for customer care. Efficiency, productivity and flexibility are all embodiments of neoliberal market capitalism and are all personified in the call centre operation, as well as the structure of the labour market in general. Thus the individual and the workplace are embedded in a variety of global processes. In order to frame the context in which call centre operations exist today and their employees (mainly young men and women) negotiate the increasingly risky and individualised task of developing an identity or sense of belonging in the world, Labour Markets and Identity on the Post-Industrial Assembly Line sets out the economic, social and political changes over the last three decades that have restructured the labour market, altered the balance between labour, management and the state, and unleashed global market capitalism upon previously sheltered areas of the economy and social life in both Britain and elsewhere. This ground-breaking book offers one of the first real qualitative sociological investigations of a relatively new form of employment, to see what life is like on the 'post-industrial assembly line', whilst also taking a close look at the nature of class, identity and subjectivity in relation to young people coming of age in a world dramatically altered over the last three decades.Download Free PDFView PDFpdf-archive.comA Internmehmet elcanDownload Free PDFView PDFRegenerationChristo AlborRegeneration focuses on the question of intergenerational justice. Defining the world's young people as those born after 1979 - a hugely symbolic moment in the history of globalisation - it reflects on the massive growth in generational protest across the globe thirty years later. At its heart is an analysis of politics though the prism of generation. The incapacity of the major political parties in Britain to think beyond their short-term electoral interests is, by definition, particularly harmful for those at the beginning of their lives. It has led to a failure to act on climate change, savage cutbacks in education and training, an acute shortage of housing, big cuts in youth services, and, for many, the prospect of an old age without pensions. Things have deteriorated to the point where many young people are finding it impossible to find the wherewithal to settle down and have families - the classic marks of adulthood. But, as Shiv Malik argues in his preface, a diagnosis of the problem does not absolve the young from taking responsibility for developing solutions. We need more than 'a whinge of epic proportions'. And, as he also points out, the young are well placed to develop alternatives: 'we are the most well-educated, innovative, dynamic and open generation in human history'. This means that this book also has plenty of ideas for changing the future.Download Free PDFView PDFRegenerationAll the news that’s fit to sell: reforming the media for the next generationTim HolmesDownload Free PDFView PDFRegeneration: Radical Futures, Volume IIA contract between generations: pensions and saving2012 • Craig BerryThere are few areas of social and economic life more replete with intergenerational bargains than pensions and long-term saving. Yet it cannot be denied that the intergenerational contract in policy and practice around pensions and saving has begun to unravel at a rapid rate, to the detriment of today’s young people. The individualisation of the pensions system means we are not only on our own as a generation, but also within our generation.Download Free PDFView PDFRed Chalk: On Schooling, Capitalism and Politics 2001 • Glenn Rikowski, dave hill, Professor Mike ColeDownload Free PDFView PDFERIK BRYNJOLFSSON ANDREW MCAFEEJoanna MillerDownload Free PDFView PDFMore Praise for Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the TimeDario Nicolas Gianoglio"This extraordinary book shows a new way to simplify your life and work, increase your focus, and get more done in less time than you ever thought possible."-Brian Tracy, bestselling author of Eat That Frog! and Time Power "Groundbreaking … Will upend people's assumptions about how productive they can actually be.… Jeff Sutherland discloses to the non-tech world the elegantly simple process that programmers and web developers have been using since he invented Scrum, showing how a small, empowered, and dedicated team can deliver significantly higher quality work at a faster pace through introspection, iteration, and adaptation."-Michael Mangi, senior VP of interactive technology, Social@Ogilvy "Jeff Sutherland has written the essence of Scrum for the masses. This book elevates Scrum from a fix-it tool to a way of life."-Hirotaka Takeuchi, professor of management practice, Harvard Business School "Jeff Sutherland is the master of creating high-performing teams. The subtitle of this book understates Scrum's impact. If you don't get three times the results in one-third the time, you aren't doing it right!"-Scott Maxwell, founder and senior managing director, OpenView Venture Partners "Jeff Sutherland used the common-sense but seldom-applied principles of the quality movement, user-centered design, and lean development to come up with a process that dramatically increases productivity while reducing employees' frustrations with the typical corporate nonsense. This book is the best description I've seen of how this process can work across many industries."Download Free PDFView PDFUniversity of Melbourne PhD thesis Foreign correspondents and fixers: an investigation of teamwork in international television newsgathering2011 • colleen murrellDownload Free PDFView PDFUniversity of California PressVoices of Labor: Creativity, Craft, and Conflict in Global Hollywood2017 • Michael CurtinDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
