Jacques Derrida's theory makes it possible to deconstruct the familiar home space, which, however, does not constitute in any case its destruction. Revealing a complex and ambiguous nature of the challenge of hospitality, he perceives the sense of feeling at home as one of the necessary conditions of a stable subject. This is the subject that most fears the Otherness which could disrupt, unsettle their permanent structure and a sense of certainty. Therefore, the Author follows closely the fear of strangeness and the nostalgic longing for the sense of feeling at home as depicted by David Lynch and Michael Haneke in their films. Then he passes on to the field of contemporary art which not only reveals the fact that something has happened to the house we have known so far, but it also allows for creative deconstruction of the feeling at home. The artistic works selected by the Author break the binary oppositions: one’s own/someone else’s, familiar/strange (Jessica Sue Layton), close/distant (Shizuka Yokomizo) and finally the most important one: interior/exterior (Marja Pirilä, Eve Dent).Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrzej Marzec•  265  Critical Theory, Languages, Biochemistry, BioinformaticsContemporary Artists as Shamans - Archival Exploration, full text and referencesShamans and artists have been perceived as similar across a variety of dimensions.

Nonetheless, these similarities have not been systematically explored and are poorly understood. This study was designed to investigate these similarities.Stanley Krippner (personal communication, January 12, 2010) provided the initial definition of a shaman that, after minor modifications to more fully represent knowledge about shamans, became: A shaman is a socially designated spiritual practitioner who obtains information in ways not available to the shaman’s community through the voluntary regulation of the shaman’s own attention, which is used for the benefit of the shaman’s community and its members.  Defining constructs were operationalized and validated cross-culturally to support multidirectional comparisons between artists and shamans using archival data from psychology, archaeology, anthropology, philosophy, art history, and creativity studies. Previous publications about 24 well-known artists provided archival data for comparisons with shamans. The dimensions explored included familial influence, talent, neurological functions, calling to vocation, social support, personality, training, initiation, inspiration, positive disintegration, transliminality, imaginal realms, altered states, purported psi experiences, mental health issues, soul retrieval, spiritual emergence, transpersonal orientation, intent to benefit, and creativity. Tables, charts, and diagrams organized archival information that, supported by descriptive comparisons, explored the nature and extent of similarities between artists and shamans. The integration of visual art, poetry, and stories provided an emic artist’s perspective and alternate ways of knowing for the reader.The study found that four artists from traditional cultures fulfilled all defining constructs of shaman, comprising a set of prototypical shamanic artists. In contrast, twenty artists fulfilled some, but not all, constructs defining shaman. These shamanlike artists were noncentral members in a fuzzy set where the shamanlike artists had family resemblances to traditional shamans and shamanic artists.The study identified and articulated gaps in knowledge as well as establishing a broad, well-grounded theoretical model that can serve as a foundation for future research on relationships between contemporary artists and shamans, and, potentially, contribute towards transformation of art experiences in artists, art audiences, and art institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Denita M Benyshek, PhD MFA MA LMHC•  12  Performing Arts, Creativity studies, Creativity, Contemporary ArtCreativity, Society, and Gender: Contextualizing and Redefining CreativityCreativity is currently being redefined in more inclusive and complex ways.

This article examines old and new ways of viewing creativity, focusing especially on how historically creativity has been considered a male preserve and the need for a more inclusive definition that includes areas such as “everyday creativity.” It places definitions of creativity in their social and historical context, showing how a society’s orientation to a partnership model or a dominator model affects what and who is considered creative. It proposes an un-gendered definition of creativity, highlights the need for this broader definition to meet the enormous contemporary challenges we face, and distinguishes between innovativeness and creativity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alfonso Montuori and +1Gabrielle Donnelly•  86  Creative Writing, History, Cultural History, SociologyThe First Biography of Artemisia Gentileschi: Self-Fashioning and Proto-Feminist Art History in Cristofano Bronzini’s Notes on Women Artists.Between roughly 1615 and 1622, Cristofano Bronzini (1580–1633) wrote Della dignità et della nobiltà delle donne, a defense of women that was partially published during his lifetime with the patronage of Medici women.

This articlebrings to light the unpublished sections of Bronzini’smanuscript containing descriptions of some thirty-three earlymodern women artists, ranging from Properzia de’ Rossi tothe female court artists of the Ming Dynasty. At the focusof this study is Bronzini’s profile of Artemisia Gentileschi,offering a narrative account of the discovery of her artistictalent at age twelve and detailing her earliest vocationaltraining in Rome up until the time of her marriage toPierantonio Stiattesi of Florence.Artemisia’s profile in the Bronzini manuscript stands outnot only because it is the earliest biographical account everwritten about her, but also because it is rife with statementsthat have no bearing upon the real facts of her life. It isargued here that Artemisia herself supplied Bronzini withthis fictitious account and that she deliberately distorted thefacts of her youth in order to fashion herself according toher own aspirations as well as her society’s morality codes,its female stereotypes, and its mytho-heroic archetype of theartist. In this account of Artemisia’s youth in Rome, the nameof Agostino Tassi and Artemisia’s relationship with him arecompletely suppressed, while Artemisia’s own father, OrazioGentileschi, is portrayed in a negative light as her primaryantagonist. Moreover, the biography purports that Artemisiataught herself to paint by studying Caravaggio’s canvases,effectively asserting her place among the master’s earliest andmost devoted followers.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sheila Barker•  20  Gender Studies, Women's Studies, Feminist Theory, Women's HistoryTempo, Tempo!

Rooted in the Bauhaus project of engaging mass-produced visual cultures, Brandt’s montages served not only as a culturally-critical pendant to the sleek, practical metal designs for which she is better known; they also provided a model for confronting radical changes in gendered ideals in the wake of the First World War and addressing dynamic shifts in the visual fields of architecture, advertising and film. Bringing together images of Brandt’s 45 extant photomontages for the first time, the book explores this artist’s embrace of the dynamism of the modern metropolis and her engagement with pictorial theories of Bauhaus colleagues Wassily Kandinsky and László Moholy-Nagy.  Tempo, Tempo! was written to accompany the exhibition of the same name that was shown at the Bauhaus-Archiv, Museum of Design in Berlin (Oct. 2005–Jan. 2006), Harvard University’s Busch-Reisinger Museum (March–May 2006) and the International Center of Photography in New York (June–Aug. 2006).

Nor is this some kind of art manifesto. We are not saying this is how art should be, or could be, but how it is, if you let go of the prison of aesthetics, and follow an infinitely more interesting conceptual trail. This is about uncovering and identifying an approach to art which avoids the triviality of sensory-based aesthetic theory and moves instead towards exploring the experiential worlds that art presents us with. And this approach is not about diminishing the sensory enjoyment of artworks, but about placing them in a much richer context, where they can work a far greater magic.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jakob Zaaiman•  159  Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Psychoanalysis, PsychiatryTesis de doctorado: Fuera de discurso.

Éstos se ubicaron mayoritariamente en la ciudad de Buenos Aires: Unión Feminista Argentina (UFA) fundado en 1969 -del que participó María Luisa Bemberg- y Movimiento Feminista de Liberación (MFL) conformado en 1972 -con el que se vinculará Ilse Fusková- entre otros. Si bien las vicisitudes políticas no permitieron un desarrollo lineal del movimiento de mujeres, se realizarán importantes actividades desde 1970 a 1976, año de un gran parón o retroceso ocasionado por la última dictadura militar argentina. Luego de la vuelta a la democracia, Buenos Aires vive un verdadero renacer de la actividad de las feministas, saliendo nuevamente a la calle y visibilizando reivindicaciones silenciadas por la dictadura. Lugar de Mujer será uno de los centros que acoja propuestas artísticas motivando reuniones y grupos de discusión y debate.En este contexto se produce una efervescencia cultural dada por las artistas feministas, quienes tomarán la posta del activismo de UFA y de la búsqueda de conseguir centros culturales públicos para las mujeres con objeto de visibilizar el sistema de inequidad imperante en el campo artístico local. Es entonces cuando se realizan tres exposiciones fundamentales para el arte feminista porteño: Mitominas I (1986) y Mitominas II (1988) en el Centro Cultural Ciudad de Buenos Aires (hoy Centro Cultural Recoleta) y El ama de casa y la locura (1987) en la sala de exposiciones del Centro Cultural San Martín. Mientras tanto entre 1986-1988 el Grupo de Denuncia Feminista realizará las primeras manifestaciones de activismo urbano, exhibiendo situaciones de violencia por las que atravesaban las mujeres o reivindicando el derecho de las mujeres sobre su propio cuerpo.Las artistas que emergieron de las agrupaciones feministas o que se vincularon a sus proclamas sin integrarse al movimiento de base, realizaron obras que evidenciaron lo dudoso, difícil y poco fiable que resultaron las categorías y disquisiciones culturales con las que se definieron a ‘la mujer’, durante las décadas 1970-1980. Sus trabajos cuestionaron el lenguaje formalista del arte o la proclama del ‘regreso a la pintura’ difundida durante la década del ’80, a la vez que se implicaron en la búsqueda de la transformación del imaginario social, con el fin de subvertir los discursos patriarcales. Para llevar a cabo dicho objetivo se valieron del empleo de la obra de arte como instrumento para la reflexión sobre la experiencia de género. La práctica de concienciación funcionó como catalizadora de los trabajos artísticos.La tesis de dicha investigación sostiene que el feminismo es una lengua franca de la que se valieron las artistas feministas. Por ello, y buscando investigar otras metodologías de la historia del arte, relacioné los trabajos de las artistas porteñas con otras creadoras mexicanas y estadounidenses para exhibir problemáticas comunes en temporalidades similares. Es así como el cuestionamiento a la domesticidad es una línea común en los trabajos de las artistas feministas.En la presente investigación analicé a artistas locales como Grete Stern, María Luisa Bemberg, Ilse Fusková y Monique Altschul, así como también reconstruí exposiciones fundacionales para el arte feminista porteño, como ser Mitominas I (1986), Mitominas II (1988), Mitominas III (1992) y El ama de casa y la locura (1987).

The book focuses on four well-known and highly respected North and South American artists of the period: Eva Hesse, Lygia Clark, Ana Mendieta and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. I show how their work transforms the avant-garde protocols of the period by introducing an affective dimension to late modern art. This aspect of their work, while frequently noted, has never been analysed in detail.  "Visualizing Feeling" also addresses a methodological blind spot in art history: the interpretation of feeling, emotion and affect. It demonstrates that the affective dimension, alongside other materials and methods of art, is part of the artistic means of production and innovation. This is the first thorough re-appraisal of aesthetic engagement with affect in post-1960s art.  CONTENTS Introduction 1 Minimalism and Subjectivity: Aesthetics and the Anti-Aesthetic Tradition  2 Feeling and Late Modern Art  3 Participation, Affect and the Body: Lygia Clark  4 Eva Hesse’s Late Sculptures: Elusive Expression and Unconscious Affect  5 Ana Mendieta: Affect Miniaturization, Emotional Ties and the Silueta Series 6 The Dream of the Audience: The Moving Images of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha  Conclusion: Which anthropomorphism? Book endorsements:"At last, here is, a book that lifts the ban on affect imposed on art criticism and theory by the "anti-aesthetic" school that has been dominating the scene in the last forty years! Taking her clues from four of the best women artists whose work spans the period, Susan Best convincingly demonstrates that if you close the door of the house of art to feelings, they enter through the window. What’s more, this is valid for the supposedly ‘anaesthetic’ art movements - minimal and conceptual art - that form the contextual background of her case studies: they are no less aesthetic than the art of the past or the most recent present." -- Thierry de Duve, Historian and Theorist of contemporary art and Professor at University of Lille "Susan Best's remarkably lucid and paradoxical project begins the process of recovering feeling and emotion in late modern art. Her landmark study of four women artists - Hesse, Clark, Mendieta and Cha - rescues both the feminine and the aesthetic from the ghetto, by an astute combination of psycho-analysis and art history." -- Dr. Ann Stephen, Senior Curator, Sydney University Museums "Visualizing Feeling develops a compelling argument for focusing on precisely the centrality of affect and feeling in any understanding of the art of the 1960s and 1970s, where it seemed that affect no longer had a place. In exploring the work of four powerful and sometimes neglected women artists, she shows how it is paradoxically where affect is consciously minimized that it nevertheless returns to haunt the art work as its most powerful force. Art works affect before they inform, perform or communicate. Sue Best demonstrates that by restoring the question of affect and emotion to the art work, new kinds of questions can be asked about the feminine in art, questions that affirm the personal and political power of these works of art." -- Elizabeth Grosz, Rutgers University, author of Chaos, Territory, Art: Deleuze and the Framing of the Earth, Columbia University Press, 2008 Reviews: Choice, Feb (2012), Art & Australia, 49.4 (2012), Australian and New Zealand Journal of Art, vol. 12 (2012), Cassone, Feb (2013), Parallax (2013).Save to LibraryDownloadby Susan Best•  17  Psychoanalysis, Aesthetics, Women Artists, Affect/EmotionTFG, PINTORAS DEL BARROCO, BAROQUE WOMEN PAINTERSThe objective of this study is to analyse the most important women painters of the Baroque period, for which it is necessary to adopt the gender perspective, with the purpose of analyzing the women situation during that period, and... moreThe objective of this study is to analyse the most important women painters of the Baroque period, for which it is necessary to adopt the gender perspective, with the purpose of analyzing the women situation during that period, and particularly, the restrictions which determined their artistic creation. It starts by analysing the current state of the issue, in which the evolution of the historiography about the subject is exposed. Afterwards, in a section dedicated to the gender perspective applied to the Art History, the convenience and usefulness of adopting this method is explained, as well as its basic principles. This is followed by an analysis of the women's situation in the Modern Ages, focused mainly on the changes that led to the increase of women artists.

Using the definition of shaman constructed by anthropologist Ruth-Inge Heinze, Benyshek demonstrates how artists shamanically journey to other realms, undergo destruction and rebirth, unite opposites, and receive inspiration from nonordinary states of mind, anomalous experiences, transcendent consciousness, and sacred spirits. Painter Paul Cezanne, choreographer Martha Graham, sculptor Constantin Brancusi, and Mande blacksmiths provide examples of shamanic creative processes. This article may support future studies that find shamanic artists contribute to individual, societal, and planetary healing.Benyshek, D.M. (2015). The contemporary artist as shaman.

In Autoritratto (1969), Lonzi questions official art historical narratives, largely based on formats such as the monograph, or the chronological succession of (male) artists, movements, and categories. In her subsequent feminist writings, she develops an anti-dialectical understanding of historical time where history itself is understood as a male construction from which women are structurally excluded. As she writes in Let’s Spit on Hegel (1970), feminism interrupts both chronological continuity and the monologue of patriarchal history. This essay addresses these issues by focusing on Lonzi’s writings across the 1960s and 1970s and the way she explores alternative modes of knowledge production. I particularly focus on her uses of reproduction technologies (recording, montage and photography) in order to shape a different temporality, her notion of the “Unexpected subject” (Soggetto imprevisto) and the link between past and present, and finally her ideas about women’s history (including women artists). This essay is partly based on archival research and previously unpublished material.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giovanna Zapperi•  7  Women's History, Italian Studies, Feminism, Women ArtistsUndoing ‘homeliness’ in feminist art: The case of Feministo: Portrait of the Artist as a Housewife (1975-7)Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexandra Kokoli•  10  Domesticity, Feminist Art, Women Artists, Mail ArtStudi sull'immagine in movimento.

Although some of these disadvantages resemble gender inequalities in non-artistic work, such as lower pay, underrepresentation, work–family conflict, and symbolic devaluation, others are unique to artistic careers. In this essay, I extend Acker's work on the implicit gendering of the ideal-typical worker to show how gender implicitly organizes social expectations around artists and artistic work. I highlight themes emerging from past research on gender relations in artistic careers, which suggest that the ideal-typical artist builds on a masculine model in at least three ways. First, collective understandings of creative genius center a masculine subject. Second, bias in aesthetic evaluations systematically favors men over women. Third, the structure of artistic careers, particularly the need for entrepreneurial labor and self-promotion, requires artists to engage in behaviors that are more socially acceptable in men than in women.Save to LibraryDownloadby Diana Miller•  8  Cultural Sociology, Women in Art, Women Artists, Women in Contemporary ArtWoman's Reappearance.

A feminist perspective has been nevertheless quite absent from such debates. This article addresses feminist uses of archival documents in the visual arts through the analysis of three works produced in the past two decades: The Fae Richard’s Photo Archive (1997) by Zoe Leonard and Cheryl Dunye, Some Chance Operations (1998) by Renée Green and Queen of the Artists’ Studios (2004–2007) by Andrea Geyer.

Patterson, Vanessa Rocco, Clare I. Rogan, Despina Stratigakos, Brett M. Van Hoesen, Kathleen M. Vernon, and Lisa Jaye Young. Images of flappers, garçonnes, Modern Girls, neue Frauen, and trampky—all embodiments of the dashing New Woman—symbolized an expanded public role for women from the suffragist era through the dawn of 1960s feminism. Chronicling nearly a century of global challenges to gender norms, The New Woman International: Representations in Photography and Film from the 1870s through the 1960s is the first book to examine modern femininity's ongoing relationship with the nineteenth and twentieth centuries' most influential new media: photography and film. This volume examines the ways in which novel ideas about women's roles in society and politics were disseminated through these technological media, and it probes the significance of radical changes in female fashion, appearance, and sexual identity. Additionally, these original essays explore the manner in which New Women artists used photography and film to respond creatively to gendered stereotypes and to reconceive of ways of being a woman in a rapidly modernizing world. The book brings together generations of scholars to analyze the New Woman from her inception in the later nineteenth century through her full development in the interwar period, and the expansion of her forms in subsequent decades. These essays show how controversial female ideals figured in discourses including those on gender norms, race, technology, sexuality, female agency, science, media representation, modernism, commercial culture, internationalism, colonialism, and transnational modernity. Inaugurating a new chapter in the scholarship of representation and New Womanhood and spanning North America, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, and the colonial contexts of Africa and the Pacific, this volume reveals the ways in which a feminine ideal circled the globe to be translated into numerous visual languages.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Otto•  39  Gender Studies, Visual Studies, Women's Studies, Colonialism"Guan Daosheng and the Idea of a Great Woman Artist" (PROOFS)

A brief literature review considers the trajectory of thought that led to such neglect. Utilizing the definition of shaman constructed by Ruth Inge-Heinze (1997), a preliminary definition of the art audience as shamanic community is constructed. The study demonstrates how art can provide for the audience’s psychological, social, and spiritual needs; thus, illustrating the defining constructs of the art audience as shamanic community. The formation of a new subfield in creative studies, the psychology of the art audience, is recommended with specific recommendations for future studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Denita M Benyshek, PhD MFA MA LMHC•  16  Creativity studies, Models of Creativity & of Creative Processes, Diverse Particular Models of Creativity found in Societies, Institutions, Persons Changing, CreativityDaria Berg.

Analysis focuses on representations of the celebrated courtesan, poet and painter Xue Susu (fl. 1575–before 1652) by writers of different backgrounds, gender and class. In late Ming times women participated in elite culture in unprecedented numbers. Courtesans gained prominence in the literati arts, playing a formative role in shaping cultural ideals. Late imperial Chinese discourse embeds the image of the courtesan in the formation of new beauty ideals and social negotiations of gender roles and power. Paradoxes abound, linking the courtesan with notions of chivalry, chastity and loyalism and depicting her in the context of national politics and warfare. The Ming/Qing texts reflect not only current perceptions of women and courtesans, but also the social and cultural aspirations, dreams, anxieties and desires of their authors.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daria Berg•  19  Sociology, Gender Studies, Sex and Gender, Women's StudiesM.

In the last decades, a plentiful bibliography has been produced, investigating on many fields of research: philology, iconography, history of religious Orders and other interdisciplinary works. Since the second half of the twentieth century on, these holy women have been studied not only from a religious perspective. In this article, the most important studies on this subject are mentioned and commented. Our analysis is organized into three categories: critical studies concerning Dominican women, discussion concerning Franciscan women and, in conclusion, general studies about female sanctity(not only penitent and mystic women but nuns and beguine as well). In this work, a "status quaestions" is related to historical, literary and linguistic researches about the religious women: a complex subject that requires further study and analysis.Keywords: female holiness - literary criticism - linguisticsSave to LibraryDownloadby Mattia Zangari•  19  Religion, Gender Studies, Art History, Women's StudiesLucia Re, “The Mark on the Wall: Marisa Merz and a History of Women in Postwar Italy” (pages 36-75) in Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space (2017)Lucia Re, “The Mark on the Wall: Marisa Merz and a History of Women in Postwar Italy” (pages 36-75) in Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space (Ed.

Maryon was appointed by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) at the Christmas Conference of the Anthroposophy Society, December 1923, as the leader of the Section for Sculptural Arts (akna Fine Art). She was an English sculptor who worked with Steiner to create the massive timber sculpture, ‘The Representative of Humanity’, now on display in the Goetheanum, the headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society, at Dornach, Switzerland. Ernesto Genoni trained at the renowned Brera Academy of Fine Art in Milan. He first met Maryon in 1920 on his first visit to Dornach. Genoni returned to Dornach at about the time of the Christmas Conference, December 1923, he successfully applied to Steiner to be in the inaugural First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. Genoni remained in Dornach for most of the year 1924. Edith Maryon died on 2 May 1924 reportedly of tuberculosis (TB). Genoni left Dornach only after Steiner withdrew from public life and retreated to his sick bed (on 28 September 1924). Genoni took the art that he had created at Dornach back to Milan, Italy, and some of it went on to Australia when he emigrated in 1926. Genoni’s portrait of Maryon has remained in the Genoni family in Milan since that time but with the subject long forgotten (or perhaps never known to the family). Genoni painted portraits of significant women in his life, including his sister Rosa and his niece Fanny (in Milan, Italy), and his partner Ileen Macpherson and his niece Anne Fiedler (in Melbourne, Australia). The portrait of this paper, is now identified as of Edith Maryon, thereby reuniting the artwork with its subject, and dating it in the last four months of Maryon’s life (January to April 1924).Save to LibraryDownloadby John  Paull, PhD•  12  Portraits, Art History, Anthroposophy, Rudolf SteinerMarianne Brandt’s Experimental Landscapes in Painting and Photography during the National Socialist PeriodSave to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Otto•  13  Women Artists - Modernist, Modernism (Art History), History of photography, Women Artists(Women) Artists and the Gender Gap (Museum)Save to LibraryDownloadby Britiany Daugherty•  4  Art History, Women Artists, Women and Gender Studies, Joslyn MuseumEntry on ‘Griselda Pollock and Rozsika Parker, Old Mistresses.
