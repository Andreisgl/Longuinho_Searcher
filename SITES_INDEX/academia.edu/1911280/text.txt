Instances of cultural implications of such contacts have been indicated at: https://www.academia.edu/12144939/Indian_sprachbund_of_Sarasvati-Sindhu_Hindu_civilization_and_the_imperative_of_further_Proto-IE_language_studies Indian sprachbund of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization and the imperative of further Proto-IE language studies https://www.academia.edu/10344521/An_Indo-European_god_in_a_Gudea_Inscription An Indo-European God in a Gudea inscription (Indara) There are two relatively ancient sources for the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European: 1. Preservation in Samskritam and contibution made by Samskritam to PIE (as elaborated by Nicholas Kazanas) and 2. Meluhha (cognate mleccha) as elaborated by the identification of about 2000 glosses describing metalwork of Bronze Age and hieroglyphs used in rebus-metonymy layers identified in Indus Script corpora, for trade during the Bronze Age -- in particular, of tin-bronzes and cire perdue (lost-wax) metalcastings using alloys. These sources may provide the base data to promote studies in identifying the PIE urheimat, historical formation and evolution of PIE and IE languages, languages in Indian sprachbund. The indications of Meluhha studies based on Indus Script decipherment point to an east-to-west transmission of metalwork glosses, drawn from Meluhha sources. Two examples of IE (perhaps PIE) glosses may be cited: aya, ayas 'metal' (Rigveda) signified by the hieroglyph ayo, aya, hako 'fish' (Munda). saṁghāṭa m. ʻfitting and joining of timberʼ (Samskritam, Ramayana)Hieroglyphs: sãghāṛɔ m. ʻ lathe ʼ (Gujarati); sãgaḍ f. ʻ a body formed of two or more fruits or animals or men &c. linked together, part of a turner's apparatus ʼ, sã̄gāḍā m. ʻ frame of a building ʼ, °ḍī f. ʻ lathe ʼ(Marathi) Rebus: saṁghāta 'collection' (of metalwork) sanghāta 'holding or binding together' (Pali) Rebus: S سنګر sangar, s.m. (2nd) A breastwork of stones, etc., erected to close a pass or road; lines, entrenchments. Pl. سنګرونه sangarūnah. See باره (Pushto) Since meluhha (mleccha) was the parole, speech or vernacular as distinct from chandas (prosody), the studies may also promote a sharper understanding of the cultures of the Vedic period with particular reference to archaeometallurgy technologies along the Tin Road traversed from Hanoi, Vietnam to Haifa, Israel. That Eastern Mediterranean had regular contacts with Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization in the third and second millennia BCE is a significant pointer to the sources of early glosses of Proto-Indo-European related to Bronze-age metalwork and other cultural phenomena of the times. This explanation for the isoglosses of PIE should be reckoned in reconstructing the urheimat. This reconstruction starting with the glosses identified by the Indus Script decipherment as Meluhha (Proto-Prakritam or parole of Samskritam in Indian sprachbund) has also to take into account the arguments of Nicholas Kazanas in the following and related papers posted at http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/en/indology_en.aspDownload Free PDFView PDFMesopotamia the worlds earliest civilization kathleen kuipermira firaDownload Free PDFView PDFin: Potts (ed.), A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near EastLevantine Kingdoms of the Late Bronze Age (2012)2012 • Peter PfälznerDownload Free PDFView PDF« Die Osttigrisregion im Spiegel der Archive von Mari », dans P.
