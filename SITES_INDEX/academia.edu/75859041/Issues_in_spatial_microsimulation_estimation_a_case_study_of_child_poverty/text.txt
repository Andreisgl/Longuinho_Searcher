This index can be used to identify areas where there is a high risk of homelessness, so policies can be better targeted to these areas. Once an area has been identified using the index, the indicators can pinpoint what risk factors exist in that area which could then create better targeted policies The literature review identified a number of pathways into homelessness, including housing crisis; family breakdown; mental health issues; substance abuse; labour market difficulties; social network influences; economic and social factors; previous homelessness; and being a youth. Indicators were identified for a number of these pathways and grouped into domains. The domains were then combined into an index, using statistical techniques, depending on how correlated the indicators were to each other. The final indexes were mapped, allowing users to ascertain areas with a high risk of homelessness. Two indices were created, due to data limitations in a number of States and Territories. In the literature review, domestic violence was found to be a significant risk factor for homelessness, so where data on domestic violence was available (NSW, ACT and Qld), a separate index was constructed incorporating a domestic violence variable. Because these data were not available in all States and the Northern Territory, the main index uses the proportion of sole parent families as a proxy, which was available for all States and Territories. Overall, we found that the NT and Tasmania had the highest proportion of people living in areas with the greatest risk of homelessness. There was also a greater proportion of people outside of capital cities living in areas with the highest risk of homelessness. Version 2 of the RHI incorporates the following changes over Version 1: 1) Extreme housing stress is now calculated for everyone, rather than only those aged 55 years and over. This reflects a change in thinking that extreme housing stress places people of any age at risk of homelessness. 2) A change to the Public Housing variable from the Census from the proportion of households in public housing, to the proportion of people in public housing, reflecting a person based risk of homelessness, rather than the V1 household based indicator; 3) Public housing now includes renting from Housing co-operatives, community and church groups. In V1, it only included those renting from State/Territory Governments. 4) Housing stress has been changed from households in housing stress to people living in households experiencing housing stress. This reflects the individual nature of the RHI in which everyone in the household is at risk of homelessness.Download Free PDFView PDFAustralian Journal of Regional StudiesThe distributional impact of the Australian Government's Household Stimulus Package2010 • Robert  TantonThis paper analyses the distributional impact of the Australian Federal Governments Household Stimulus package across different types of Australian families and also at a regional level. The paper finds that nearly 7.3 million families benefited from the package with an average gain of $30 per week. In terms of the number of winners, single person families led at 3 million, followed by couple families with children, at nearly 2.2 million. There were 1.5 million married couples without children, and 600,000 sole parent families who also gained. Looking at the proportion of families in these groups that gained, nearly 99 per cent of sole parent families gained something through the package; 95 per cent of married couples with dependants gained; and just over 50 per cent of married couples with no dependants and single persons gained. In terms of absolute gains, the sole parent families gained the most, with $46.80 per week and single person families gained the least, with $17.30 per week. Looking at each of the components of the package, the tax bonus delivered an average gain of more than $22 per week to 6.6 million families. The single income family bonus increased the weekly disposable income for 1.25 million families by $17.30. The back to school bonus gave 1.3 million families an additional disposable income of $31.20 per week. The training and learning bonus, on the other hand, only impacted on about 400 thousand families with an additional income of around $20 per week per family. Regarding the regional picture, our analysis showed that most of the money went to new growth areas on the outskirts of the capital cities. These areas were also areas with young families and young children, and possibly with two income earners, giving them the maximum tax bonus.Download Free PDFView PDFPushing It To The Edge: Extending Generalised Regression As A Spatial Microsimulation Method2010 • Yogi  Vidyattama, Robert  TantonDownload Free PDFView PDFThe distributional and regional impact of the Australian government's stimulus packageRobert  TantonDownload Free PDFView PDFPopulation, Space and PlaceDeveloping Spatial Microsimulation Estimates of Small Area Advantage and Disadvantage among Older Australians2011 • Riyana MirantiDownload Free PDFView PDFThe distributional and regional impact of the Australian Government's Household Stimulus PackageRobert  TantonDownload Free PDFView PDFEconomic Advantage and Disadvantage among Older Australians: Producing National and Small Area ProfilesHal  KendigDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
