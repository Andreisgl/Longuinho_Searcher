In the intervening years, numerous modeling advances have improved the econometric approach to efficiency measurement known as stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and myriad academic studies have analyzed efficiency of various health care providers using SFA. This article takes stock of the current “usefulness ” of applications of SFA in the health care sector and offers suggestions on how this usefulness can be further enhanced.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Post-acquisition bank performance deteriorates with the geographic distance between target and acquirer. In contrast, distance has little effect on bank performance following charter consolidation by a given bank holding company. Distant acquisitions between 2005 and 2007 led to even worse performance during the Great Recession. We argue that distance between target and acquirer harms performance because high information and monitoring costs overwhelm any diversification and growth benefits.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Comparing French and US hospital technologies: a directional input distance function approachHttp Dx Doi Org 10 1080 0003684042000246786,  Aug 21, 2006ABSTRACT French and US hospital technologies are compared using directional input distance functi... more ABSTRACT French and US hospital technologies are compared using directional input distance functions. The aggregation properties of the directional distance function allow comparison of hospital industry-level performance as well as standard firm-level performance with regard to productive efficiency. In addition, the underlying constituents of efficiency - in the short run, congestion and technical inefficiency, and in the long run, scale inefficiency - are analysed by decomposing the overall measure. By virtue of using the directional distance function, it is also possible to obtain an estimate of a lower bound on allocative inefficiency. It is found that French and US hospitals use quite different technologies. Long run scale inefficiencies cause most of the French hospitals&amp;#39; inefficiency, while short run technical inefficiency is the main source of overall productive inefficiency in the US hospitals.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
