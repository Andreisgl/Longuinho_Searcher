The volume takes advantage of the privileged position of cinema to explore and critique religion’s influence on the Italian cultural landscape. This edited anthology thus seeks to probe how religion is experienced, practiced, criticized and represented from various methodological perspectives (historical, philological, aesthetic, psychoanalytical, popular studies, etc.) through four main sections: ‘Propaganda and Censorship’, ‘Framing Belief: Pasolini and Petri’, ‘Religion in Italian Popular Cinema’ and ‘Ancient Rituals, Modern Myths’.Contributors: Roberto Cavallini, Roberto Chiesi, Silvia Dibeltulo, Juan Juvé, Fernando Pagnoni, Laura Rascaroli, Daniele Rugo, Tomaso Subini, Daniela Treveri Gennari, Fabio Vighi.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I begin by illustrating Stiegler’s ideas in relation to cinema, consciousness, memory and technology; making use of the recent and widely acclaimed TV series reboot Westworld, I employ it as an allegory of the functionality of cinema as mnemotechnology. Furthermore, considering how the essay film questions cinema’s industrialization effect through Stiegler’s theorization of cinema qua tertiary memory, I look at the work of Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Mysterious Object at Noon (1999) to argue how the essay film is a radical practice that stages thought in order to de-synchronize the consciousness of cinema.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Heretical anachronisms: framing temporality and tradition in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s essay films [Studies in European Cinema, Routledge, Taylor & Francis, October 2016]Pier Paolo Pasolini’s ventures into the essay film form provide, in films such as La Rabbia (The ... more Pier Paolo Pasolini’s ventures into the essay film form provide, in films such as La Rabbia (The Rage, 1963) and Appunti per un’Orestiade africana (Notes towards an African Orestes, 1970), an interrogation on the experience of temporality and the ways in which it redefines notions of cultural memory and tradition. The aim of this article is to theorize, within Pasolini’s essayistic practice, a conception of temporality based on an expanded notion of writing, in the context of the essay film’s peculiar position in the history of film cultures. Looking at the ways in which tradition as intertexuality is constructed in La Rabbia and how cultural mediation is transformed into poetic necessity in Appunti per un’Orestiade africana, I argue that Pasolini’s essayistic films should be considered as reflections on the way in which we intellectually and historically experience time in our modern world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Becoming Aguirre: Klaus Kinski between exploitation and stylization in Italian Popular Cinema [book chapter, 2016]Klaus Kinski, Beast of Cinema: Critical Essays and Fellow Filmmaker Interviews (Edited by Matthew Edwards)  “Few good actors have made more bad movies than did Kinski”.  This is how William Grance, with s... more “Few good actors have made more bad movies than did Kinski”.  This is how William Grance, with such a straightforward claim has indisputably summarized the figure of Klaus Kinski and his acting career in his "Historical Dictionary of German Theater". It is difficult not to conceive of Kinski’s presence in the history of cinema as one of the few actors who were able to perform exactly such contradiction: an incredible and talented actor in, most of all, quickly crafted movies with poor artistic ambition. The aim of this chapter is to investigate this contradiction embedded in Kinski’s persona, focusing on a comparative study of his performances. I will employ sequences from different films to consider stylization as Kinski’s great contribution to cinema and acting. I am interested in following his transitional trajectory from the exploitation period in Italian Cinema, evaluating his acting presence in these different film productions and finally understand the versatility of his performances which makes him the anti-hero or ‘nihilistic desperado’  par excellence in the work of Werner Herzog.I will look in particular at three films belonging to three different film genres, released few years before Aguirre: the Wrath of God (Werner Herzog, 1972) and directed by three Italian directors: the thriller/psychological drama "A doppia faccia" (‘Double face’, Riccardo Freda, 1969), the gothic horror/nocturnal spaghetti western "E Dio disse a Caino" (‘And God said to Cain’, Antonio Margheriti, 1970), one of the forty movies included in the Spaghetti Western retrospective screened during the 64th Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica Venezia in 2007, and the euro sleaze soft-core giallo "La bestia uccide a sangue freddo" (aka Slaughter Hotel, or Asylum Erotica, Fernando Di Leo, 1971). In these films, which belong to the lower forms of Italian Popular Cinema and are directed by three directors who have a consistent directing style, Kinski plays very different roles: a millionaire husband, a man in search of revenge and a psychiatrist. All three roles are somehow positive roles and present Kinski in different acting dimensions which will allow me to inspect his adaptability to every story he played in. Moreover, the discussion about these movies and Kinski’s performances will be contextualized in relation to the recent debate concerning bad cinema and b-movies and their status in film criticism and film studies. Finally, the aim of this chapter is to trace Kinski’s stylization method and how he was reframed and re-coded by Herzog’s intervention, showing his trajectory without solution of continuity from bad cinema to Herzog’s films.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From acomparative point of view, the key to understanding these introvertedtrajectories is to consider Alonso’s construction of narrative spacearound the misery of a stark void, namely the absence of home. ForAlonso, home is not a peaceful destination, connoting the intimacyof a family, serenity or simply a place where one is allowed to dreamin peace (Bachelard 1994, 6). The absence of home becomes theblind spot of these journeys: home turns out to be a broken horizon.In this essay I will mainly focus on the film Los Muertos and the wayin which it radicalizes narrative space through the combination ofcinematic silence (absence of words and dialogues) and cinematicslowness (the use of long-takes), while formulating a void which coincideswith the protagonist’s homelessness. Moreover, positioningmy effort within the growing field of slow cinema studies, this essayconsiders how Alonso’s radical cinematic realism problematizes theconcept of authenticity in its aesthetic and political dimensions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Füsun is dead, Istanbul is lost: gender, mourning and prosthetic memory in Orhan Pamuk’s ‘The Museum of Innocence’ [essay, 2015]Conference Proceedings - 5T: Gendered Perspective in Design, Yaşar University, Izmir.,  2015In Orhan Pamuk’s novel ‘The Museum of Innocence’, Kemal, the protagonist, while accurately recoun... more In Orhan Pamuk’s novel ‘The Museum of Innocence’, Kemal, the protagonist, while accurately recounting his love story with Füsun, engages with an obsessive act of collecting numerous artefacts of his life with her. The novel is now a museum, which is housed in a building in the Çukurcuma neighbourhood of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, with the 83 chapters transformed into 83 boxes. In this essay I would like to explore the ways in which the gendered objectification of Füsun is enacted in the museum. Füsun is indeed a spectral figure within the museum’s walls: her figure is condensed in every single thing the viewer encounters yet her absence is signified through the fetishism of objects which in turn are transformed into works of art (Box 68, 4213 Cigarette Stubs, which contains all the cigarette stubs discarded by Füsun and collected by Kemal between 1976 and 1984, is a telling example in this sense). Pamuk’s achievement, from a Foucauldian perspective, questions the role of museums as contested sites of knowledge, articulated through the construction of subjectivity and history. However, museums are also gendered spaces of representation and classification. In this sense, various questions should be posited: how is memory performed in the Museum of Innocence? How is the gendering and aestheticization of objects, imposed by Füsun’s spectral absence, played out in this invented and autobiographical wunderkammer of love? This essay is divided in three parts. In the first part my aim is to consider the Museum of Innocence as a contemporary wunderkammer, briefly retracing the origin of this tradition until more recent critical examples such as Joseph Cornell’s sculpture boxes, Sophie Calle’s and Mark Dion’s installations until Damien Hirst’s cabinets like ‘The Void’ (2007), which are usually framed under the caption of the ethnographic turn in contemporary art. The second part will focus on the gendering of space within the Museum of Innocence through the spectral figure of Füsun. My claim is that Füsun’s objectification could be interpreted through Luce Irigaray’s notion of the feminine as an inscriptional space, that is as a mere mirroring of masculinity. The third part of the essay will consider how Pamuk’s artistic endeavour could exemplify an act of secondary memory (Nora) or prosthetic memory (Lindsberg), an interruption of modernity inscribed between the materiality of common things and the traces of personal memories. Through these notions, I will propose a shift in signification from the figure of Füsun to the city of Istanbul, a distant and forgotten image of the city in Pamuk’s personal memories.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Michelangelo Antonioni's 'L'amorosa menzogna' and the labour of fiction [essay, 2012]ANTONIONI AND THE MYSTERY OF REALITY YEAR VIII ~ ISSUE 18 ~ JULY-DECEMBER 2012,  Jul 31, 2012"This essay sets out from a basic premise: to perform a close reading of Antonioni’s short docume... more "This essay sets out from a basic premise: to perform a close reading of Antonioni’s short documentary L’amorosa menzogna (1949), followed by some considerations on Jacques Rancière’s rethinking of the concept of documentary as a mode of fiction and Antonioni’s views on truth and authenticity. L’amorosa menzogna is certainly a minor work within Antonioni’s overall oeuvre. However, I argue that it contains an already fully developed aesthetic dimension that explores the transitional elements, within a documentary perspective, of what Rancière would call the “labour of fiction”. It is somehow difficult and probably hazardous to discuss and theorize on such a minor work without falling into a generalizing discourse. My limited attempt here would be to approach L’amorosa menzogna as one would look at a miniature: I believe that its brevity and dimension do not reduce its refined structure and cinematic intensity. However, choosing to approach the film in this way does not mean to downgrade it as a inaugural, immature work by a young Antonioni preparing for his feature film debut with Cronaca di un amore (1950). On the contrary, the minuteness of a miniature does not conceal the autonomy of its visual composition although the iconography and its construction can be experienced as less direct and straightforward. In the context of Antonioni’s oeuvre, I definitely agree with the inevitable necessity to consider his early films as autonomous works; they not only anticipate strategies of vision and composition that can be found in Antonioni’s later works but, as Leonardo Quaresima insists, they should also be thought as foundational to neo-realism’s poetics, as an intrinsic product of neo-realism.[i]I would argue that Antonioni’s early films in general and L’amorosa menzogna in particular, which is constructed in a style based on an extremely refined mise-en-scene, points precisely towards an understanding of (documentary) cinema as “the labour of fiction”, borrowing an expression from Jacques Rancière’s work which will be developed further throughout the essay."Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cavallini R. and Rugo D., "Sentimental. Note sul serio melodrammatico" [Sentimental. Notes on cinematic melodrama and seriousness - ebook, 2010]Come sottolinea il filosofo americano Stanley Cavell, il cinema, al contrario delle altre arti, a... more Come sottolinea il filosofo americano Stanley Cavell, il cinema, al contrario delle altre arti, afferma qualcosa della propria energia nelle manifestazioni piu’ ‘comuni’ come in quelle di indubbio genio.  Mosso da questa constatazione – che attraversa il cinema per arrivare al discorso filosofico – il contributo qui offerto tenta di fare luce sulla serieta’ del melodramma, o meglio sul ‘serio melodrammatico’.  Esporre il serio al melodrammatico, cio’ che in alcune istanze sfugge ad una semplice caratterizzazione di genere, significa prima di tutto prendere sul serio il genere di per se’ e quindi cominciare ad allentare le sue possibilita’ facendo emergere qualcosa. Significa inoltre rendere giustizia ad una serie di opere il cui contributo va ben al di la’ della risistemazione di un’ipotetica tassanomia cinematografica, imponendo una riflessione sulle possibilita’ stesse del cinema. Annotato l’intento quindi, il procedimento si e’ incentrato sulla possibilita’ di articolare le passioni considerate piu’ trite del melodramma in modo da mobilitare non cio’ che questi films nascondono, ma cio’ che deve la propria marginalita’ all’evidenza. L’ovvio del melodrammatico, cio’ che viene subito esposto –passioni inconciliabili con la realta’ esterna –mette in moto un discorso ‘serio’ sull’esaustione del soggetto. Il melodramma, almeno alcuni casi illuminanti, esprime l’insopportabile tensione di una vita senza vergogna.Il primo contributo di questo volume si concentra in particolare su di uno spostamento decisivo che avviene nel momento in cui il melodramma si sposta (uno spostamento di ritorno) da Hollywood all’Europa. Il confronto in particolare e’ facilitato dall’analisi ravvicinata di un lavoro di Vincent Minnelli e uno del regista tedesco Rainer Werner Fassbinder.La lettura dell’opera di Chabrol ‘Les Biches’ si pone in quest’ottica come problematica pietra di paragone. Il saggio che vi e’ qui dedicato infatti non ne affronta semplicemente l’emblematicita’, ma la spinge ad un momento di rottura, il momento cioe’ in cui il rapporto erotico come rapporto di possesso sfigura di fronte alla propria promessa. A concludere il lavoro, l’intervista a Juliane Lorenz, montatrice degli ultimi film di Fassbinder – nonche’ ex-moglie e presidentessa della fondazione intitolata al regista Tedesco – offre alcuni spunti inediti circa lavori non ultimati e ambizioni insoddisfatte del grande autore capace in poco piu’ che quindici anni di carriera di produrre una quarantina di films.Lo spezzone di sceneggiatura allegato in chiusura – tratto da un lavoro in corso di Daniele Rugo – oltre che come tributo a RWF, intende riaprire idealmente le questioni trattate verso le possibilita’ attuali del melodrammatico.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Füsun is indeed a spectral figure within the museum’s walls: her figure is condensed in every single thing the viewer encounters yet her absence is signified through the fetishism of objects which in turn are transformed into works of art (Box 68, 4213 Cigarette Stubs, which contains all the cigarette stubs discarded by Füsun and collected by Kemal between 1976 and 1984, is a telling example in this sense). Pamuk’s achievement, from a Foucauldian perspective, questions the role of museums as contested sites of knowledge, articulated through the construction of subjectivity and history. However, museums are also gendered spaces of representation and classification. In this sense, various questions should be posited: how is memory performed in the Museum of Innocence? How is the gendering and aestheticization of objects, imposed by Füsun’s spectral absence, played out in this invented and autobiographical wunderkammer of love? This essay is divided in three parts. In the first part my aim is to consider the Museum of Innocence as a contemporary wunderkammer, briefly retracing the origin of this tradition until more recent critical examples such as Joseph Cornell’s sculpture boxes, Sophie Calle’s and Mark Dion’s installations until Damien Hirst’s cabinets like ‘The Void’ (2007), which are usually framed under the caption of the ethnographic turn in contemporary art. The second part will focus on the gendering of space within the Museum of Innocence through the spectral figure of Füsun. My claim is that Füsun’s objectification could be interpreted through Luce Irigaray’s notion of the feminine as an inscriptional space, that is as a mere mirroring of masculinity. The third part of the essay will consider how Pamuk’s artistic endeavour could exemplify an act of secondary memory (Nora) or prosthetic memory (Lindsberg), an interruption of modernity inscribed between the materiality of common things and the traces of personal memories. Through these notions, I will propose a shift in signification from the figure of Füsun to the city of Istanbul, a distant and forgotten image of the city in Pamuk’s personal memories.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Michelangelo Antonioni's 'L'amorosa menzogna' and the labour of fiction [essay, 2012]ANTONIONI AND THE MYSTERY OF REALITY YEAR VIII ~ ISSUE 18 ~ JULY-DECEMBER 2012,  Jul 31, 2012"This essay sets out from a basic premise: to perform a close reading of Antonioni’s short docume... more "This essay sets out from a basic premise: to perform a close reading of Antonioni’s short documentary L’amorosa menzogna (1949), followed by some considerations on Jacques Rancière’s rethinking of the concept of documentary as a mode of fiction and Antonioni’s views on truth and authenticity. L’amorosa menzogna is certainly a minor work within Antonioni’s overall oeuvre. However, I argue that it contains an already fully developed aesthetic dimension that explores the transitional elements, within a documentary perspective, of what Rancière would call the “labour of fiction”. It is somehow difficult and probably hazardous to discuss and theorize on such a minor work without falling into a generalizing discourse. My limited attempt here would be to approach L’amorosa menzogna as one would look at a miniature: I believe that its brevity and dimension do not reduce its refined structure and cinematic intensity. However, choosing to approach the film in this way does not mean to downgrade it as a inaugural, immature work by a young Antonioni preparing for his feature film debut with Cronaca di un amore (1950). On the contrary, the minuteness of a miniature does not conceal the autonomy of its visual composition although the iconography and its construction can be experienced as less direct and straightforward. In the context of Antonioni’s oeuvre, I definitely agree with the inevitable necessity to consider his early films as autonomous works; they not only anticipate strategies of vision and composition that can be found in Antonioni’s later works but, as Leonardo Quaresima insists, they should also be thought as foundational to neo-realism’s poetics, as an intrinsic product of neo-realism.[i]I would argue that Antonioni’s early films in general and L’amorosa menzogna in particular, which is constructed in a style based on an extremely refined mise-en-scene, points precisely towards an understanding of (documentary) cinema as “the labour of fiction”, borrowing an expression from Jacques Rancière’s work which will be developed further throughout the essay."Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cavallini R. and Rugo D., "Sentimental. Note sul serio melodrammatico" [Sentimental. Notes on cinematic melodrama and seriousness - ebook, 2010]Come sottolinea il filosofo americano Stanley Cavell, il cinema, al contrario delle altre arti, a... more Come sottolinea il filosofo americano Stanley Cavell, il cinema, al contrario delle altre arti, afferma qualcosa della propria energia nelle manifestazioni piu’ ‘comuni’ come in quelle di indubbio genio.  Mosso da questa constatazione – che attraversa il cinema per arrivare al discorso filosofico – il contributo qui offerto tenta di fare luce sulla serieta’ del melodramma, o meglio sul ‘serio melodrammatico’.  Esporre il serio al melodrammatico, cio’ che in alcune istanze sfugge ad una semplice caratterizzazione di genere, significa prima di tutto prendere sul serio il genere di per se’ e quindi cominciare ad allentare le sue possibilita’ facendo emergere qualcosa. Significa inoltre rendere giustizia ad una serie di opere il cui contributo va ben al di la’ della risistemazione di un’ipotetica tassanomia cinematografica, imponendo una riflessione sulle possibilita’ stesse del cinema. Annotato l’intento quindi, il procedimento si e’ incentrato sulla possibilita’ di articolare le passioni considerate piu’ trite del melodramma in modo da mobilitare non cio’ che questi films nascondono, ma cio’ che deve la propria marginalita’ all’evidenza. L’ovvio del melodrammatico, cio’ che viene subito esposto –passioni inconciliabili con la realta’ esterna –mette in moto un discorso ‘serio’ sull’esaustione del soggetto. Il melodramma, almeno alcuni casi illuminanti, esprime l’insopportabile tensione di una vita senza vergogna.Il primo contributo di questo volume si concentra in particolare su di uno spostamento decisivo che avviene nel momento in cui il melodramma si sposta (uno spostamento di ritorno) da Hollywood all’Europa. Il confronto in particolare e’ facilitato dall’analisi ravvicinata di un lavoro di Vincent Minnelli e uno del regista tedesco Rainer Werner Fassbinder.La lettura dell’opera di Chabrol ‘Les Biches’ si pone in quest’ottica come problematica pietra di paragone. Il saggio che vi e’ qui dedicato infatti non ne affronta semplicemente l’emblematicita’, ma la spinge ad un momento di rottura, il momento cioe’ in cui il rapporto erotico come rapporto di possesso sfigura di fronte alla propria promessa. A concludere il lavoro, l’intervista a Juliane Lorenz, montatrice degli ultimi film di Fassbinder – nonche’ ex-moglie e presidentessa della fondazione intitolata al regista Tedesco – offre alcuni spunti inediti circa lavori non ultimati e ambizioni insoddisfatte del grande autore capace in poco piu’ che quindici anni di carriera di produrre una quarantina di films.Lo spezzone di sceneggiatura allegato in chiusura – tratto da un lavoro in corso di Daniele Rugo – oltre che come tributo a RWF, intende riaprire idealmente le questioni trattate verso le possibilita’ attuali del melodrammatico.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Going back to Kabul, after a long period, she pitted herself against the city and the people disfigured by more than twenty years of invasions, war and dictatorship. Abdul‘s work is located at the intersection between art and architecture; it invites the viewer to see the unfolding of new forms but never resolves the contradictions and the paradoxes, the purpose of which seems to be to make us doubt our claims of understanding.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These Appunti, conceived as work-in-progress for feature films, share Pasolini’s attempt at reading and confronting reality through a fictional impulse: an Indian legend and the trilogy of Greek tragedies Oresteia, respectively. Situating Pasolini’s films in the context of his ‘authorial intertext’ (Viano 1993) and his 'spectro-poetics' (Ricciardi, 2003), I argue how Pasolini’s lesson configures a fascination with what I would call the 'temporalities of the real', that is his attempt at deconstructing the relationship between past and present. Making use of Bernard Stiegler’s reflections on technics and time and his notion of tertiary memory along with Jacques Derrida’s notion of critical inheritance, I will consider Pasolini’s attempt at engaging with the problem of tradition and cultural transmission, employing the essay film as a documentary research tool, a transient archive that temporalizes our being in the world.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The refusal of not being governed as such price has been a constant preoccupation in the practice of self-organization developed and employed by Autonomia, the autonomous network movement of social self-organization that was prevalent in Italy in the 1970s. This paper will address the short-circuit between Foucault’ s notion of critique and Autonomia’s practice of self-organization in the context of recent creative practices of resistance in Italy today.After a brief examination of the seminal experiences since the 1970s such as Radio Alice (1976-78) and Luther Blissett (1994-1999), I will focus on the recent radical process initiated by a group of ‘creative workers’ with the occupation of Teatro Valle, one of the most prestigious and ancient theatres in Rome, and inspired by the Occupy movement. Since June 2011, throughout Italy, different other occupations occurred (theatres, movie theatres, dismissed factories) to protest against the inefficiency and decline of cultural policies and to actively generate an open platform for educational, cultural and social purposes. These experiences share a similar strategy of self-organization with the previous movements but differ in the ways in which they generate a critical understanding of the conditions of creative production and its distribution.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
