Remains and artifacts ascribed to domesticated horses are limited to Late Harappan times indicating that horses may have been present at Late Harappan times, "when the Vedic people had settled in the north-west part of the subcontinent." Recent genetic studies also indicate the presence of the Steppe People in IVC inlate Harappan times only. Genetic studies indicated the  movement of Iranian Zagros people to IVC and their reach to Dravidian speaking South India .Hence scholars were almost convinced that the IVC civilisation was non-vedic and it was either proto Dravidian or proto Munda. However  studies in comparative religions of South Asia and the Middle East have brought to light stunning similarities among their underlying beliefs and ritual practises to those of the vedic religion.The Kalasa people of Chitral in the Hindukush and the Tamils of South India worship the vedic god “Indra” at the Winter Solstice festivals.The Keralites celebrate the birth of “Lord Ayyappa, the Son of Siva and Vishnu” at this time and the Christians celebrate Christmas to mark the birth of the “Son Of God” at this time. Genetic studies have revealed that these similarities are not accidental, but is the result of  common linguistic and cultural relations of the people of these regions from very ancient times. Tamil and Sanskrit are both ancient languages of India, with a long history of mutual influence. According to linguistic experts, around 50% of Tamil vocabulary is derived from Sanskrit. On the other hand, the influence of Tamil on Sanskrit is Iimited to around 10%.How this is possible if the original settlers of Indus Valley were Dravidian speakers and they migrated to South India afterthe fall of IVC ? So has scholars mistook  the vedic “asva” as the Steppe Horse and the Zagros language as Dravidian? This article  brings to light startling discoveries on the  Harappan language glossary. The ancient Harappan language was Vedic Bharata( Kalasa).The vedic “asva” was not the domesticated Steppe horse.Not only domesticated horse bones,  even domesticated horse images ,were practically absent in Harappan seals.In this article we are presenting the “real vedic asva” which is ubiquitous in Harappan seals.This discovery helps us to understand vedic terms like “Hari Asva”, “VRshan Asva”, “Haya Griiva”, “Asvatthama”, “Asvattha” , “Asvamedha”, “Hastina Pura” etc. An Elamite Rosetta Stone evidence  for this glossary is also presented. A few Harappan seals indicate observance of  vedic vratas. One such vrata is the “Bhiishma Ekadasi vrata”.This article shows that The  Steppe horse  was never the vedic “asva” and the Harappan word for elephant was not “pilu” as proposed by some scholars. Further it explains why Duryodhana  of Hastinapura had a Naaga  (elephant) for his flag and was supported by DroNa, Asvatthama etc.in the Kuru Kshetra war as per the epic Mahabharata.  It also explores  the Pandos , Pandya,Pandala, Philistine  and Canaanite people’s linguistic  connections to the Vedic Harappans .Hope this work will pave way for unbiased scientific study and readings of the vedic IVC texts setting aside the Dravidian ,Munda and such other hypotheses about this civilisation and its language.Save to LibraryDownloadby vijaya bhaarati•  20  History, Ancient History, Archaeology, Prehistoric ArchaeologyA Geophysical Tool for the Conservation of a Decorated Cave - a Case Study for the Lascaux CaveSave to LibraryDownloadby Colette SIRIEIX•  6  Archaeology, Geology, Geophysics, Archaeological ProspectionFolds, fields, and fauna : a Deleuzo-Guattarian approach to the socialising power of religious experiences in Ancient Near Eastern landscapesSave to LibraryDownloadby Neil Erskine•Glasgow University Media GroupThree Cuneiform Texts from the National Museum of Finland: Provenance, Editions, and CommentaryThis paper offers provenance studies and editions of three hitherto unpublished texts stored in the National Museum of Finland collections.

VK 5738:2 is another exemplar of a well-attested clay cone of Gudea of Lagaš. The clay cone bears an M.K. signature in Arabic, indicating that it once was held in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. VK 6400:6 is a fragment of an octagonal prism of Sennacherib. Its text probably is a version of Sennacherib 17 with differing lineation, but other options remain possible. The object has been donated to the National Museum of Finland in 2004 after its re-discovery in the storerooms of the Finno-Ugrian Society. VK 6400:5 is a tablet fragment preserving text from a partially unknown royal inscription of Tiglath-pileser I. It has the same provenance as Sennacherib fragment VK 6400:6. The text on the obverse has its best parallel in the “Extended Five-Year-Annals” of Tiglath-pileser I (A.0.87.2). The reverse contains text thathas its closest parallels in two inscriptions hitherto ascribed to Tiglath-pileser I’s son Aššur-bēl-kala. In 2020, Shibata proposed to rather attribute these two inscriptions to Tiglath-pileser I. The Helsinki fragment provides proof for this thesis, as the text on its reverse apparently also was part of at least some younger versions of the “Extended Five-Year-Annals”.Save to LibraryDownloadby Johannes Bach•  7  Assyriology, Sumerian, Akkadian, MuseologyPopulation Genomics of Stone Age EurasiaSummarySeveral major migrations and population turnover events during the later Stone Age (after c. 11,000 cal.

BP) are believed to have shaped the contemporary population genetic diversity in Eurasia. While the genetic impacts of these migrations have been investigated on regional scales, a detailed understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics both within and between major geographic regions across Northern Eurasia remains largely elusive. Here, we present the largest shotgun-sequenced genomic dataset from the Stone Age to date, representing 317 primarily Mesolithic and Neolithic individuals from across Eurasia, with associated radiocarbon dates, stable isotope data, and pollen records. Using recent advances, we imputed &gt;1,600 ancient genomes to obtain accurate diploid genotypes, enabling previously unachievable fine-grained population structure inferences.

Many studies have been dedicated to this composition, but the fragmentary nature of sources prevented the understanding of several passages, and large portions of the text remain unpreserved or incomplete. The present article attempts a new reconstruction of the third column of the Emar manuscript by placing two fragments at the end of the column, rather than in the middle as in previous editions. Tis placement results in the restoration of the same line order in the Emar, Ugarit, and Hattusa manuscripts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maurizio Viano•  13  Near Eastern Studies, Semitic languages, Assyriology, HittitologySumerian Literary and Magical Texts from HattušaSave to LibraryDownloadby Maurizio Viano•  16  Sumerian Religion, Ancient History, Near Eastern Studies, AssyriologyŚālika ’village of artisans’ ಶಾಲಿಕ śālika ‘village of artificers--Schoyen cylinder seal  catalogues copper-gold metals mint, carpentry equipment trade of helmsman https://tinyurl.com/2y7fj7stMS 2645 Schoyen Collection; Afghanistan, 23rd-21st c.

The inner relations refer to the governors' connections in the oasis of Dakhla itself and to other oases of the area as well as to the royal residence of Memphis in the Nile Valley. The outer relations were directed towards foreign lands reachable via the desert roads of the Sahara leaving from Dakhla. The article also discusses what foreign lands or countries these could have been. Similarly, it aims to touch upon the duties and tasks that would have been carried out by the governors in their complex network of relations inasmuch as it is possible to be reconstructed from the Balat archives and other written or archaeological sources. Balat or Ayn Asil is in Dakhla Oasis about 500 kms from the Nile Valley in the Western Desert of Egypt. From the beginning of ancient Egyptian history expeditions from the Nile Valley targeted the area of the Western Desert Oases and amongst them the Dakhla. The aim of these expeditions must have been the exploration of the desert, of its natural resources and hunting desert game . Signalling that the expeditions had taken place; several rock engravings were left behind. Parallel to the presence of indigenous cultural units, temporary camp sites and watch posts installed by the Egyptians have been attested alongside the routes leading to the southern part of the Dakhla Depression.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rita Simon•  10  Egyptology, International Relations, Government, Local Government and Local DevelopmentEnseñar Asiriología en una universidad sin Asiriología: ¿reto o debacle anunciada?La Asiriología es el campo de estudio que investiga tres milenios de historia del Próximo Oriente Antiguo a partir de los documentos cuneiformes y es, por lo tanto, una disciplina tanto filológica como histórica.

Dicha disciplina se fundamenta en el estudio de textos en numerosos idiomas distintos como el sumerio, el acadio, el hitita y el elamita entre otros. Los especialistas en este campo no son más que unos cientos a nivel global: este dato sugiere que un número limitado de altas casas de estudios tiene la capacidad de garantizar para sus estudiantes una formación asiriológica, y menos son los centros que ofrecen programas de estudio completos en Asiriología y/o en Historia del Próximo Oriente Antiguo.Pese a la existencia de una discreta tradición asiriológica española, la Asiriología no aparece como disciplina independiente en ningún programa docente universitario del país. La enseñanza de las disciplinas proximorientales está casi siempre confinada en cursos de Historia Antigua que reúnen Egipto y Próximo Oriente antiguos – cuando incluso no abarcan todas las antigüedades mediterráneas y proximorientales.En esta ponencia el autor presentará su empeño docente en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid y el reto que presupone la enseñanza de la Asiriología en este contexto, planteando estrategias para el futuro, colaboraciones internacionales y proyectos de innovación docente.

It is in this region that large numbers of kurgans, dating to the Early Bronze Age (that is, the Kura-Araxes period) through to the Iron Age, have been identified. In particular, the funerary tumuli dated to the Kura-Araxes period reveal a common mortuary custom of multiple human depositions inside a large chamber that is burnt at the conclusion of ritual practices; the Late Bronze/ Early Iron Age burials, on the other hand, are smaller in size and usually present single or double human depositions, furnished with bronze objects and, in some circumstances, the skeletal remains of equids.

Here, women students were allowed to study law and female lawyers were allowed to practice professionally several decades later compared to many countries in Europe and the world. Women got access to a wider variety of educational lanes after the Republic of Estonia gained its independence and women students started to be accepted to the university on equal basis with male students. Between the two world wars, several offices in Estonia needed specialists with a higher education in law. The most natural potential career paths for a legal academic are usually working in the court system, bar association or as a notary public. Yet, the prejudices widespread in the society and later the economic crisis of the 1930s, alongside the competition with male lawyers made it difficult for women to get a job that corresponded to their educati...Save to LibraryDownloadby Heli-Triin Räis•  4  Law, Political Science, Professionalization, ApprenticeshipWriting and Cognition in Interdisciplinary Perspective (25-30th August 2024)Call for Papers: We invite talks on topics related to: (1) aspects of script usage from different perspectives; (2) neuroanatomical networks and writing-related pathologies; (3) relationship between writing and language; (4) visual... moreCall for Papers:  We invite talks on topics related to: (1) aspects of script usage from different perspectives; (2) neuroanatomical networks and writing-related pathologies; (3) relationship between writing and language; (4) visual form and eye coordination in reading as constituent factors of writing; (5) cognitive load and the role of behaviors in reading; (6) materiality and spatial arrangement of writing; (7) interaction between mind, body and the material technologies of writing; and (8) role of the visual system and object recognition in writing.Save to LibraryDownloadby Annick Payne•  7  Neuroscience, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Linguistics, Writing Systems (Languages And Linguistics)Ritual Innovation in Numbers 18?Save to LibraryDownloadby Esias Meyer•  3  Sociology, Clarity, ScripturaDrain pipes of Kalibangan had incised symbols Sign 59 fish, Sign 415 chain, or twisted strandKalibangan.

It has no agreed definition and it is impossible to specify a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for membership of the category. The experiences that we call emotions in English are a subset of a wider range of affective experiences. Categories of particular emotions similarly constitute families whose members are by no means homogeneous. As perceptions of the world and of ourselves as experiencers of the world emotions are richly permeated by cognition. As syndromes of multiple factors they have an event-like structure that lends itself to narrative explanation. Historical analysis of emotion(s) thus requires close attention to conceptual history and to contexts, both immediate and cultural/historical. Classicists can explore the historical contingency of concepts analogous to the modern "emotion" in Greek and Latin, both in the theories of the major philosophical schools and in a variety of ancient texts. But the burgeoning field of (ancient) emotion history now uses a much wider range of literary, documentary, visual, and material evidence. Understanding emotion is an essential aspect of a range of contemporary approaches to Classics, especially in ancient history, classical literature and rhetoric, and ancient philosophy, just as the visual and physical remains of the classical world are rich in emotional implications and deeply implicated in the representation, performance, and pragmatics of ancient emotion.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas  Cairns•  8  Emotion, Greek Literature, Greek History, Roman HistoryJHK CV bibliographySave to LibraryDownloadby John H Kroll•Ensaio sobre Rituais Funerários e Morte na Mesopotâmia (Portuguese)Save to LibraryDownloadby Pedro Augusto M B M Gomes•  12  Ancient History, Mesopotamia History, Mesopotamian Religions, Ancient Near EastNADALI VERDERAME 2023 Behind the Cultic Statue: The Materiality of Religion in Ancient MesopotamiaProduction of images, more precisely of statues, is an ancient and common activity in Mesopotamia since the earliest periods.

The archaeological evidence is scant, but cuneiform texts refer directly to statues or indirectly to materials, artisans, and actions related to-and made around-statues. The statues do not properly reflect the need to represent divine and human figures: at the same time, they cannot be considered decorative elements of closed and open spaces, as the statue is not the result of a series of aesthetic choices and solutions intended to attract viewers in admiration of a beautiful masterpiece. Statues were not created to be seen from a distance, untouchable; ancient Mesopotamian temples, where the majority (if not all) of the statues were placed, cannot be compared to museums where items, objects, and images are displayed at a safe distance from visitors.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lorenzo Verderame•  9  Religion, Sumerian Religion, Assyriology, History of ReligionsANCIENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF COLOUR : AN INTRODUCTIONIntroduction to the Proceedings of the conference (coorganised with Matteo Martelli) Ancient science and technology of colour : pigments, dyes, drugs and their perception in Antiquity (Pisa, April 28-29, 2022), published in Technai 13 and... moreIntroduction to the Proceedings of the conference (coorganised with Matteo Martelli) Ancient science and technology of colour : pigments, dyes, drugs and their perception in Antiquity(Pisa, April 28-29, 2022), published in Technai 13 and 14, 2023(Read all the open access articles here: http://www.libraweb.net/articoli.php?chiave=202310501&rivista=105)Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria Michela Sassi•  11  History of Science and Technology, Near Eastern Archaeology, Near Eastern Studies, Ancient Greek PhilosophyAhmed Alhasan (a) en el Facebook 2012Traducción al español de la Página Oficial en la que escribe Ahmed Ismael Saleh, Sucesor y Mensajero del Imam Al-Mahdi (as)https://www.facebook.com/Ahmed.Alhasan.10313/Save to LibraryDownloadby Mariano R Calle•  4  Religion, Facebook, Islam, MahdiDavide Nadali and Andrea Polcaro, 2023, Tell Zurghul, Ancient Nigin, Iraq: Preliminary Report of the New Results from Recent ExcavationsTell Zurghul, the Sumerian city Nigin in the state of Lagash, is currently being excavated by a joint Italian archaeological expedition of Sapienza University of Rome and the University of Perugia since 2014; in 2019, the Iraqi SBAH... moreTell Zurghul, the Sumerian city Nigin in the state of Lagash, is currently being excavated by a joint Italian archaeological expedition of Sapienza University of Rome and the University of Perugia since 2014; in 2019, the Iraqi SBAH granted the expedition with an extension of the permission for archaeological research and study for the period 2019-2021. The paper presents the results of the excavation campaign carried out in the autumn of 2019: excavations focused on the extensive stratigraphic investigation of the two mounds, in order to verify and complete the archaeological evidence of the layers so far exposed (Mound B) and to investigate the morphology, stratigraphy, and occupation of Mound A with two operations on both sides (operation in Area D to the north, operation in Area E to the south).Save to LibraryDownloadby Davide Nadali•  8  Near Eastern Archaeology, Iraqi History, Mesopotamian Archaeology, Ancient Near EastEl Templo de Jerusalén: del omphalos helenístico al foco de rebelión contra RomaSave to LibraryDownloadby Benjamín Toro•  5  Ancient History, Humanities, Art, Ancient Near EastJesus, o Bom Pastor, aquele que dá a vidaSave to LibraryDownloadby Waldecir Gonzaga•Sound Scholarship and the Hurrian H6 Cuneiform TabletSave to LibraryDownloadby Dylan L Gibson•  12  Ancient History, Musicology, Assyriology, Ancient Near EastHacettepe Üniversitesi Türkiyat Araştırmaları Hacettepe Üniversitesi Türkiyat Araştırmaları Enstitüsü adına Sahibi ve Sorumlu Yazı İşleri Müdürü: Ülkü ÇELİK ŞAVKTürkiyat Araştırmaları Dergisi, Hacettepe Üniversitesi Türkiyat Araştırmaları Enstitüsü himayesinde yılda iki kez (Bahar ve Güz) yayımlanan hakemli, yerel ve süreli bir dergidir.

Bloch traces the spread of the West Semitic alphabet from Wadi el-Ḫol to Mesopotamia, where as early as the sixteenth century Bce some clay tablets have been found to contain short alphabetic inscriptions (epigraphs) on their edges. After discussing bilingualism and the important status of Aramaic in the Assyrian empire, Bloch then focuses primarily on alphabetic scribes (henceforth sēpirus) in the Babylonian and Achaemenid empires. Bloch discusses the disputed view that sēpirus were so called "interpreter-scribes" (i.e., scribes who could translate from Aramaic to Akkadian and vice versa). He provides sixteen texts that support the view that "of all the professions attested in the Babylonian society of the sixth-fifth centuries Bce, the profession of sēpiru appears to be almost the only one suited for reading and writing in several scripts and languages" (p. 98). One poignant example of this is a court case involving the litigation over ownership of a slave-woman. The slave's arm is inscribed in alphabetic script "to (the goddess) Nanaya." One of the litigants is a cuneiform-scribe in the Eanna temple. The witness list also mentions three other scribes and six judges. However, none of these cuneiform scribes or judges appears to be capable of reading the alphabetic script on her arm, so that a sēpiru has to be summoned, and based on his testimony alone the verdict is rendered. Of particular interest regarding the ability to speak and read multiple languages is a writing exercise in which a student wrote out, in traditional order, the twenty-two letters of the NorthWest Semitic (NWS) alphabet but in phonetic cuneiform script. This demonstrates that the student and (most certainly) the teacher had a working knowledge of Mesopotamian cuneiform (and presumably the Akkadian language) as well as a NWS language and its alphabet. The alphabetic epigraph on this tablet reads ‫מפי‬ mpy ('from/by my mouth'), which suggests that a teacher dictated an exercise orally to a student. All scholars prior to Bloch asserted that the transcribed alphabet here must be Aramaic. However, Bloch points out that in all dialects of Aramaic, the word for 'mouth' is ‫פם\פום‬ pm/pwm instead of py. Furthermore, Bloch notes that even with pronominal suffixes added, the final m is preserved in Aramaic. Therefore, Bloch concludes that, linguistically, the alphabetic epigraph must belong to a NWS language of the Canaanite branch, such as Hebrew or Phoenician rather than Aramaic. It is indeed quite possible that the teacher and student were Israelite or Judean exiles. The earliest mention of a sēpiru working in the state administration for a king probably involves a Judean (or perhaps Israelite) in the service of Nebuchadnezzar II. In Nebuchadnezzar's southern palace a large archive of cuneiform texts was found in a basement storeroom. Many of the tablets were records of state dependents who received regular rations from the court of Nebuchadnezzar. A few of these texts (the so-called Weidner Texts) record King Jehoiachin as receiving one-half pānu of sesame oil a month and his five sons receiving two and a half qû of sesame oil a month. One of these texts states that there were eight other Judeans who received one-half qû each. Still another mentions a few of these Judeans by name, including a sēpiru whose name might be read Dānī-Yāwa, who is responsible for overseeing delivery of oil rations to captives from Cilicia. Bloch writes, "It is reasonable to suppose that Dānī ?-Yama had served at Jehoiachin's court in Jerusalem where he specialized in writing in Aramaic for the purposes of international communication. .. " (p. 230). Bloch states that any attempt to identify the ethnic background of sēpirus must be based entirely on the individual's personal name or the personal name of a first-degree blood relative.

Portions of Papyrus Amherst 63, the long and complex multi-composition Aramaic text written using Demotic script, also support this view. For instance, Bethel and Yahō seem to be paralleled with each other in two poems on the papyrus; both deities share some attributes otherwise ascribed to Baʕal-Shamayn (i.e., Hadad), yet are superior to that deity; and a priestess of Bethel is termed a khnh, the feminine form of khn, the noun used solely for a priest of Yahō and no other deity in Egypt. Other subtle connections between Bethel and Yahō can also be found.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tawny Holm•  13  Ancient Egyptian Religion, Hebrew Bible, Aramaic, Biblical StudiesAncient Languages and CivilizationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Carlotta Viti•NextLast »Related TopicsAssyriologyFollowFollowingAncient Near Eastern HistoryFollowFollowingNear Eastern ArchaeologyFollowFollowingAncient Near East (Archaeology)FollowFollowingMesopotamian ArchaeologyFollowFollowingAncient Near Eastern LanguagesFollowFollowingAncient HistoryFollowFollowingAnatolian ArchaeologyFollowFollowingMesopotamia HistoryFollowFollowingNear Eastern StudiesFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
