All that without mentioning the ever-haunting specter of automation-induced unemployment and, finally, the outbreak of a world-reaching pandemic: these are some of the ongoing cataclysmic trends that are making an everincreasing number of academics, policymakers and multilateral organizations revisit the adoption of Universal Basic Income (UBI) models. The idea of furnishing guaranteed, unconditional and universal basic income for people within an assigned geographical locality – and potentially the entire globe – has ebbed and flown from the pages of authors of all walks of the political spectrum for over two centuries. It appears, though, that such an idea is regaining momentum at this point in history, a somewhat unexpected moment, given the worldwide rise of nationalistic and illiberalism worldviews. ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersGJ #2020, 2:  Locally Universal: Universal Basic Income Policies in the Post-Pandemic World-Order, by Julio Lucchesi Moraes and Carlos FreireGlocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and InnovationDownload Free PDFView PDFGJ #2021, 1, New Glocal Forms of Financial Participation, by Jeff HymanGlocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and InnovationDownload Free PDFView PDFGJ #2020, 3, The Competing Politics of Austrian Glocalization: Covid-19, Crime and (Anti-)Racism, by Christian KarnerGlocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and InnovationDownload Free PDFView PDF“Resonance as a Constraining Factor in the Glocalization of Religion.” Glocalism.

The two countries share an open border that is nowhere found in a contested South Asia. Meanwhile, as a landlocked country between India and China, Nepal has struggled to keep up with its national interests and global aspirations. With its India centric foreign policy, Nepal has time and again attempted to reduce its dependence on India and sought to improve ties with China and other countries. The advent of globalisation in the 1990s bestowed Nepal to explore opportunities for its economic growth and shift to remuneration and services-based economy from agriculture. The labour migration from Nepal to third countries changed Nepal's foreign policy objectives with India as until now India was the largest recipient of the Nepalese labourers. The arrival of democracy allowed Nepal to interact with China more openly in the last two decades, which has stood as a challenge to India's traditional presence in Nepal. In this light, the present study examines the seventy years of India's Nepal policy and attempts to contextualise China into it. It studies the overriding elements of Nepal's foreign policy, along with India and China's strategic interests in Nepal. With a focus on India's Nepal policy, the paper further argues that India's missteps and assertive stance towards Nepal have caused a great deal of damage, eventually pushing Nepal towards China. These moves have also presented Beijing an opportunity to advance its ties in trade, investment and military relations with Nepal and ensure stability and control in Tibet by putting a stop to anti-China activities in Nepal with the help and support from the Nepalese Government and Army.Download Free PDFView PDFGJ 2020, 3, Glocalization: Self-Referential Remembrances, by Roland RobertsonGlocalism: Journal of Culture, Politics and InnovationDownload Free PDFView PDFGJ #2020, 3, Defining Revolution?
