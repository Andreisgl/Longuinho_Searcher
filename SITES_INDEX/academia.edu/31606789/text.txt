Thanks to his proficiency in both Latin and Greek, he participated as an interpreter in several diplomatic discussions between Rome and Constantinople concerning the ecclesiastical union. The three Syntagmata (ca. 1222–1225) are the result of this experience. The text summarizes the theological dialogue between the two Churches after the Schism (1054) with a focus on the Orthodox argumentation. Nikolaos composed the treatise two-columned in two languages, Greek and Latin. According to R. Jakobson (1953), bilingualism [...] is the fundamental problem of linguistics. It may induce some difficulties in textual criticism, too. The case of bilingual authors that write monolingual texts is customary. What happens, though, when they write bilingually? In which language did Nikolaos first pen the three Syntagmata? Did he compose in both languages simultaneously, or sequentially? Textual signs of the two surviving autographs could answer these questions.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
