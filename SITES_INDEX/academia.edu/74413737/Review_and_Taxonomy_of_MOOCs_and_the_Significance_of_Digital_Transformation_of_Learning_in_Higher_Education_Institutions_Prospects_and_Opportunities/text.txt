Recent research and ICT development efforts have strived to engineer technologies that aim at effectively facilitating and improving the quality of learning anywhere and anytie independently in a stress-free environment. It must be noted that research in open learning environments is still making baby steps and researchers have solely made preliminary initiatives to fathom out the nature and incessant chaniging dynamics of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as a topic of investigation. This interest is fuled by the fact that learning has nearly completely become digital worldwide as it were, and there for eperpetual research efforts to understand the underlying principles of MOOCs is a genuine necessity. More importantly, it has been proven in research that when computer science and education are mixed together, they seem to yield impeccable learning results. Given this, we will both chart a roadmap for t...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInternational Journal of Learning TechnologyMassive open online courses: a review of usage and evaluation2015 • Claire RocksDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Management and ResearchMoocs: A Massive Platform for Collaborative Learning in Globalized Way2015 • Dr.Jayant SonwalkarMOOCs are Massive Open Online Courses. MOOCs started as a form of collaborative online learning with people interacting and learning from each other and being exposed to different perspectives, views and ideas. MOOCs use strategies similar to social networking to connect the masses but with the added benefits of subject matter experts to facilitate the content and to coordinate a vast array of free, online materials. Accessibility, student engagement, and experiences for lifelong learning are recognized as the advantages of MOOCs. Through considering the possible causes of MOOCs in the higher education world, this paper aimed to enlighten a comprehensive picture of MOOCs. Thus, this paper presented a background of MOOCs, difference between MOOC and Open Courseware, emergence of MOOC providers, MOOC&#39;s pedagogy, problems of MOOCs, and significance and sustainability of MOOCs.Download Free PDFView PDFTheories and Applications of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs): The Case for Hybrid DesignAbram AndersInitial studies of learning in massive open online courses (MOOCs) primarily focused on participation patterns and participant experiences. More recently, research has addressed learning theories and offered case studies of different pedagogical designs for MOOCs. Based on a meta-analysis and synthesis of the research literature, this study develops a conceptual model of prominent theories and applications of MOOCs. It proposes a continuum of MOOC learning design that consolidates previous theories into a tripartite scheme corresponding to primary types of MOOCs including content-based, community/tasked-based, and network-based applications. A series of MOOC hybrids are analyzed to demonstrate the value of this model while also clarifying appropriate applications and significant design challenges for MOOCs. Results indicate that hybrid design may support the greatest diversity of learners and scaffold engagement with networked and emergent learning contexts.Download Free PDFView PDFSains Humanik a Design and Learning Strategies Applied in Mooc: A Meta-AnalysisDr. Hanan AlyThe purpose of the study is to examines the dominant design and learning strategy used by various MOOCs platforms to foster students' Self Directed Learning. Method used in the study was based on the search of relevant literature through online database such as IEEE Explore, ProQuest, ScienceDirect and ResearchGate. The keywords in the search for the relevant literature include MOOCs and learning strategy, MOOCs and design strategy, MOOCs and Self Directed Learnig. The result of the meta-analysis revealed that the most frequently used learning strtegies by the various MOOCs platforms are the social construcvist and peer-to-peer approach to learning. These two strategies are found to be related to cMOOCs and xMOOCs. Similarly, of all the designs the dominant design strategy use by MOOCs providers is cMOOC and partially the blended or hybrid MOOCs. The study revealed the dominant learning strategies employed by MOOCs platforms. This may help other MOOCs designers to give emphasis to the use of best learning strategies and perhaps improve on the existing ones. The findings may also have implication to students willling to acquire knowledge through MOOCs to choose the appropriate instruction strategy that will Foster SDL.Download Free PDFView PDFOpen PraxisMetaliteracy as Pedagogical Framework for Learner-Centered Design in Three MOOC Platforms: Connectivist, Coursera and Canvas2017 • Kelsey L O'Brien, Trudi Jacobson, Thomas P. MackeyThis article examines metaliteracy as a pedagogical model that leverages the assets of MOOC platforms to enhance self-regulated and self-empowered learning. Between 2013 and 2015, a collaborative teaching team within the State University of New York (SUNY) developed three MOOCs on three different platforms— connectivist, Coursera and Canvas—to engage with learners about metaliteracy. As a reframing of information literacy, metaliteracy envisions the learner as an active and metacognitive producer of digital information in online communities and social media environments (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; 2014). This team of educators, which constitutes the core of the Metaliteracy Learning Collaborative, used metaliteracy as a lens for applied teaching and learning strategies in the development of a cMOOC and two xMOOCs. The metaliteracy MOOCs pushed against the dominant trends of lecture-based, automated MOOC design towards a more learner-centered pedagogy that aligns with key components of metaliteracy.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Online Learning & Teaching (JOLT)MOOC Pedagogy: Gleaning good practice from existing MOOCs2014 • Maha  BaliThe revolutionary potential of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has been met with much skepticism, particularly in terms of the quality of learning offered. Believing that a focus on learning is more important than a focus on course completion rates, this position paper presents a pedagogical assessment of MOOCs using Chickering and Gamson's Seven Principles of Good Practice in Undergraduate Education and Bloom's taxonomy, based on the author's personal experience as a learner in four xMOOCs. Although most xMOOCs have similar characteristics, the author shows that they are not all offered in exactly the same way, and some provide more sound pedagogy that develops higher order thinking, whereas others do not. The author uses this evaluation, as well as reviews of other xMOOCs in the literature, to glean some good pedagogical practices in xMOOCs and areas for improvement.Download Free PDFView PDFPlanning to Design MOOC? Think First!Tózé Osório, Alaa AlDahdouhOver the last years, educators have been forced to rethink about the whole education system. In 2005, Connectivism, a new learning theory, was emerged. Consequently, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been presented as an alternative powerful educational system. Money was invested and tens of for-profit and non-profit companies involved in producing MOOC. However, integrating and adopting MOOC in educational institutions worldwide is still questionable. This literature review paper addressed and discussed the issues that higher education institutions should consider before adopting MOOC. The findings showed eight considerable, interrelated and controllable MOOC issues: high dropout rate, accreditation, business model, reputation, pedagogy, research ethics, student assessment and language barrier. Policy makers in higher education institutions should be aware of these issues before including MOOC in their development plans. In addition, the paper presented a number of possible future studies.Download Free PDFView PDFPLEs & MOOCs in Language Learning Context: A challenging connection2014 • Maria PerifanouThe appearance of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a turning point in language education and has the characteristics of online and open language learning access and massiveness. However, it is too early to discuss about a successful language MOOC model. Based on the characteristics of a successful language learning environment it is though obvious that the educational philosophy of connectivist MOOCs is closer to the Language Learning’s general philosophy (Perifanou, 2014a). Specifically, it supports the idea that a language is more than just the code: it involves social practices of interpreting (Scarino & Liddico, 2009) and promotes social interactions of language students through contextualized practice with native speakers. But what is the impact of this new educational reality on teaching and learning a Foreign Language and how could language teachers provide an efficient support to language learners combining collaborative and personalized learning? Is there any MOOC sys...Download Free PDFView PDFA redesign of Massive Open Online Courses: Using digital media to stimulate collaboration in MOOCsHelena  NacinovicThis master thesis analyzes the history and way the Massive Open Online Courses are offered in 2014. Covering the structure and methods of the three most popular MOOC initiatives (Coursera, Udacity and edX), I have listed the way they currently use digital media for collaboration and learning. Because this is an instructional design work, I then detail a new proposal of a structure for a MOOC, basing my proposal on research on how the learners experience MOOCs today, the biggest issues and the most positive characteristics.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Maturing of the MOOC Department for Business, Innovation and Skillsdaniel dufourtDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
