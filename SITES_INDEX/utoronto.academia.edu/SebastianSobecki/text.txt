By ascribing to these texts intentional anonymity, we romanticise them and misjudge the social character of their authors. Instead, most medieval poems and manuscripts presuppose familiarity with their authorial or scribal maker. Last Words: The Public Self and the Social Author in Late Medieval England attempts to recover this familiarity and understand the literary motivation behind some of the most important fifteenth-century texts and authors.Last Words captures the public selves of such social authors when they attempt to extract themselves from the context of a lived life. Driven by archival research and literary inquiry, this book will reveal where John Gower kept the Trentham manuscript in his final years, how John Lydgate wished to be remembered, and why Thomas Hoccleve wrote his best-known work, the Series. This book will include documentary breakthroughs and archival discoveries, and will introduce a new life record for Hoccleve, identify the author of a significant political poem, and reveal the handwriting of John Gower and George Ashby.Through its investments in archival study, book history, and literary criticism, Last Words charts the extent to which medieval English literature was shaped by the social selves of their authors.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Beginning with a discussion of biblical, classical and pre-Conquest treatments of the sea, it investigates how such works as the Anglo-Norman Voyage of St Brendan, the Tristan romances, the chronicles of Matthew Paris, King Horn, Patience, The Book of Margery Kempe and The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye shape insular ideologies of Englishness. Whether it is Britain's privileged place in the geography of salvation or the political fiction of the idyllic island fortress, medieval English writers' myths of the sea betray their anxieties about their own insular identity; their texts call on maritime motifs to define England geographically and culturally against the presence of the sea. New insights from a range of fields, including jurisprudence, theology, the history of cartography and anthropology, are used to provide fresh readings of a wide range of both insular and continental writings.Details: http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=11797Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This anthology presents some texts for the first time in a modern edition. The first section consists of sixcompanion essays on ‘Places, Real and Imagined’, ‘Maps the Organsiation of Space’, ‘Encounters’, ‘Languages and Codes’, ‘Trade and Exchange’, and ‘Politics and Diplomacy’.The organising principle for the anthology is one of expansive geography. Starting with local English narratives, the section moves to France, en-route destinations, the Holy Land, and the Far East. In total, the anthology contains 26 texts or extracts, including new editions of Floris &amp; Blancheflour, The Stacions of Rome, The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye, and Chaucer’s Squire’s Tale, in addition to less familiar texts, such as Osbern Bokenham’s Mappula Angliae, John Kay’s Siege of Rhodes 1480, and Richard Torkington’s Diaries of Englysshe Travell.The supporting bibliographies, in turn, take a functional approach to travel, and support the texts anthologised here by elucidating contexts for travel and travellers in five areas: ‘commercial voyages’, ‘diplomatic and military travel’, ‘maps, rutters, and charts’, ‘practical needs’, and ‘religious voyages’.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This will be the first pan-European, Middle Eastern, and global guide through the bewildering maze of medieval travel narratives. The History will also strive for comprehensiveness: its 40+  chapters will cover texts from the entire Continent and from the Middle East, including a majority of European and Middle Eastern writing traditions and literary languages. Each chapter will be written by a leading specialist in his or her geographical area. At the same time, the geographical scope of this collection, with chapters on travel writing produced by Persian, Arabic, and Chinese writers, will challenge the term ‘(late) medieval’ and Western periodisation from the outset. Using the dates 1200 and 1550 CE as boundaries for a global period of intercultural and intercontinental contact, the volume (despite its European epicentre) will not attempt to interpret ‘medieval’ beyond marking a chronological spectrum.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Case of Geoffrey Chaucer and Cecily Chaumpaigne: New Evidence [Edited issue of Chaucer Review 57:4] [OPEN ACCESS]by Sebastian Sobecki and Euan C RogerChaucer Review,  2022This special issue of The Chaucer Review announces the momentous discovery by Euan Roger and Seba... more This special issue of The Chaucer Review announces the momentous discovery by Euan Roger and Sebastian Sobecki of new documents from the Court of King’s Bench that establish the nature of the Chaucer–Chaumpaigne court case. As editors, we are pleased that The Chaucer Review is the venue for making public newly uncovered documents housed at The National Archives in Kew. In addition, three appendices supplied by Roger and Sobecki provide important updates to Chaucer’s extant life-records: (1) a full chronology of the known Chaucer–Chaumpaigne record; (2) transcriptions and translations of all the pertinent documents; and (3) a calendar of the nine Chaucer life-records discovered since the publication of Martin M. Crow and Clair C. Olsen’s Chaucer Life-Records (Oxford, 1966). This historic issue also holds a first-ever survey of the life-records of Cecily Chaumpaigne, compiled and assessed by Andrew Prescott, as well as three critical responses, authored by Sarah Baechle, Carissa M. Harris, and Samantha Katz Seal, which consider scholarly perspectives that may arise in light of these new facts and findings. An afterword composed by Roger and Prescott delineates the strong potential for finding yet more life-records on major medieval authors—records likely to still lie dormant in the archives. With this issue, The Chaucer Review hews close to its tradition as a forum for both new evidence and courageous opinion on the life and writings of Geoffrey Chaucer.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Companion combines accessible essays written by leading specialists in legal history with essays exploring literary conversations with the law in the works of later medieval authorsfrom Chaucer to Malory. The first half of this book contains detailed introductions to legal concepts, practices, and institutions in medieval England. In the second half, experts cover a number of texts and authors from across the later medieval period whose verse and prose can be understood as engaging with the law. In this way, the Cambridge Companion to Medieval Law and Literature forms the basis for students wishing to explore this rich area or for scholars to familiarise themselves with literary uses of the law.ISBN: 9781316632345Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nevertheless, he remains challenging and even contradictory for modern audiences.This book aims to provide an authoritative guide to this complex poet and his works, setting him in his historical, religious, and social contexts. Beginning with an exploration of his life and career, it goes on to cover all the major aspects of his poetry, from the literary traditions in which he wrote and the form of his compositions to the manuscript contexts and later reception.

Brewer, 2011Local and imperial, insular and expansive, both English yet British: geographically and culturall... more Local and imperial, insular and expansive, both English yet British: geographically and culturally, the sea continues to shape changing models of Englishness. This volume traces the many literary origins of insular identity from local communities to the entire archipelago, laying open the continuities and disruptions in the sea's relationship with English identity in a British context. Ranging from the beginnings of insular literature to Victorian medievalisms, the subjects treated include King Arthur's struggle with muddy banks, the afterlife of Edgar's forged charters, Old English homilies and narratives of migration, Welsh and English ideas about Chester, Anglo-Norman views of the sea in the Vie de St Edmund and Waldef, post-Conquest cartography, The Book of Margery Kempe, the works of the Irish Stopford Brooke, and the making of an Anglo-British identity in Victorian Britain.Details: http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=13713Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article shows that London, British Library, MS Harley 219, a literary manuscript discovered in 2018 and thought to have been written mostly in Hoccleve's hand, preceded the composition of the Series. Next, a collation of Harley 219 with the recently published edition of the Anglo-Latin Gesta Romanorum and with Hoccleve's translation of the tales from the Gesta demonstrates that Harley 219 was the source text for Hoccleve's translations. Finally, this article identifies the surviving copy of the Gesta Romanorum that Hoccleve's persona claims to have been using for the translations in the Series. This, in turn, not only strengthens the reliability of Thomas's persona and the credibility of his anonymous interlocutor, the Friend, but it also requires a reassessment of current notions of late medieval authorship in autobiographical settings. I am deeply indebted to Misty Schieberle, David Watt, the anonymous readers for this journal, and the editor and entire team at Speculum.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The new documents also demonstrate the relevance of a known Chaucer life-record that previously had not been associated with this case. Our findings offer a radically different understanding of the documentary evidence and establish that Chaucer and Chaumpaigne were not opponents but belonged to the same party in a legal dispute with Chaumpaigne’s former employer, Thomas Staundon, who had sued them both under the Statute of Laborers. Chaumpaigne’s quitclaims for Chaucer offered the most expedient legal path under the Statute of Laborers for both Chaucer and Chaumpaigne to demonstrate that she had left her employment with Staundon voluntarily, as opposed to being coerced or abducted (raptus), before commencing work for Chaucer.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Communities of Practice: Thomas Hoccleve, London Clerks, and Literary ProductionJournal of the Early Book Society,  2022The explosive growth of Europe’s literary culture in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was u... more The explosive growth of Europe’s literary culture in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was unprecedented as an urban phenomenon. Cities began to emerge as literary centers, and clerks and commercial scribes played a central role in this cultural shift. In London the hub for this activity was the city of Westminster and the area around Rolls House and Chancery Lane. New findings reveal that London's clerks and scriveners, who moved between English, French, and Latin, formed professional “communities of practice,” which played a significant part in the dissemination of literary manuscripts. These findings are transforming our knowledge of the contexts of English literary culture, book production, and ideas of authorship. This article will concentrate on a few connected communities of practice centered on Westminster and civic clerks, and on the use of the secretary script during this period. In the world of London’s communities of practice, the poet and Privy Seal clerk Thomas Hoccleve emerges as a central figure.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An afterword composed by Roger and Prescott delineates the strong potential for finding yet more life-records on major medieval authors—records likely to still lie dormant in the archives. With this issue, The Chaucer Review hews close to its tradition as a forum for both new evidence and courageous opinion on the life and writings of Geoffrey Chaucer.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Companion combines accessible essays written by leading specialists in legal history with essays exploring literary conversations with the law in the works of later medieval authorsfrom Chaucer to Malory. The first half of this book contains detailed introductions to legal concepts, practices, and institutions in medieval England. In the second half, experts cover a number of texts and authors from across the later medieval period whose verse and prose can be understood as engaging with the law. In this way, the Cambridge Companion to Medieval Law and Literature forms the basis for students wishing to explore this rich area or for scholars to familiarise themselves with literary uses of the law.ISBN: 9781316632345Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This volume traces the many literary origins of insular identity from local communities to the entire archipelago, laying open the continuities and disruptions in the sea's relationship with English identity in a British context. Ranging from the beginnings of insular literature to Victorian medievalisms, the subjects treated include King Arthur's struggle with muddy banks, the afterlife of Edgar's forged charters, Old English homilies and narratives of migration, Welsh and English ideas about Chester, Anglo-Norman views of the sea in the Vie de St Edmund and Waldef, post-Conquest cartography, The Book of Margery Kempe, the works of the Irish Stopford Brooke, and the making of an Anglo-British identity in Victorian Britain.Details: http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=13713Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article shows that London, British Library, MS Harley 219, a literary manuscript discovered in 2018 and thought to have been written mostly in Hoccleve's hand, preceded the composition of the Series. Next, a collation of Harley 219 with the recently published edition of the Anglo-Latin Gesta Romanorum and with Hoccleve's translation of the tales from the Gesta demonstrates that Harley 219 was the source text for Hoccleve's translations. Finally, this article identifies the surviving copy of the Gesta Romanorum that Hoccleve's persona claims to have been using for the translations in the Series. This, in turn, not only strengthens the reliability of Thomas's persona and the credibility of his anonymous interlocutor, the Friend, but it also requires a reassessment of current notions of late medieval authorship in autobiographical settings. I am deeply indebted to Misty Schieberle, David Watt, the anonymous readers for this journal, and the editor and entire team at Speculum.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The new documents also demonstrate the relevance of a known Chaucer life-record that previously had not been associated with this case. Our findings offer a radically different understanding of the documentary evidence and establish that Chaucer and Chaumpaigne were not opponents but belonged to the same party in a legal dispute with Chaumpaigne’s former employer, Thomas Staundon, who had sued them both under the Statute of Laborers. Chaumpaigne’s quitclaims for Chaucer offered the most expedient legal path under the Statute of Laborers for both Chaucer and Chaumpaigne to demonstrate that she had left her employment with Staundon voluntarily, as opposed to being coerced or abducted (raptus), before commencing work for Chaucer.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Communities of Practice: Thomas Hoccleve, London Clerks, and Literary ProductionJournal of the Early Book Society,  2022The explosive growth of Europe’s literary culture in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was u... more The explosive growth of Europe’s literary culture in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was unprecedented as an urban phenomenon. Cities began to emerge as literary centers, and clerks and commercial scribes played a central role in this cultural shift. In London the hub for this activity was the city of Westminster and the area around Rolls House and Chancery Lane. New findings reveal that London's clerks and scriveners, who moved between English, French, and Latin, formed professional “communities of practice,” which played a significant part in the dissemination of literary manuscripts. These findings are transforming our knowledge of the contexts of English literary culture, book production, and ideas of authorship. This article will concentrate on a few connected communities of practice centered on Westminster and civic clerks, and on the use of the secretary script during this period. In the world of London’s communities of practice, the poet and Privy Seal clerk Thomas Hoccleve emerges as a central figure.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article is the first attempt to identify and describe the hands of a number of clerks who wrote for the Privy Seal and for the Council in the fifteenth century. In Part 1, I identify the handwriting of Hoccleve’s fellow clerks, including William Alberton, Henry Benet, John Claydon, John Hethe, John Offord, and Richard Priour, adding writs, letters, charters, and manuscripts in their hands. I also identify the hand of the Council clerk Richard Caudray and attribute further records to the Council and Privy Seal clerk Robert Frye. Part 2 offers a reconsideration of the features of Hoccleve’s handwriting in the light of the new findings. This article also identifies the scribal stints and hands in four documents produced by Privy Seal clerks: British Library, MS Add. 24,062 (Hoccleve’s Formulary); BL, MS Cotton Cleopatra F. iii (Part 1 of the Book of the Council); BL, MS Harley 219; and Edinburgh University Library, MS 183 (Privy Seal and Signet formulary, or ‘Royal Letter Book’). This article reveals the extent to which Privy Seal clerks participated in the copying of literature and offers a more nuanced understanding of the varieties of the secretary script used by government scribes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The document, which dates to late January or early February 1425, is of significance because it offers the earliest surviving record of Lydgate's tenure as prior of Hatfield Regis. However, the record only refers to him as “John, prior of Hatfield Regis.” Here the author would like to present three new life-records from 1424, all of which mention Lydgate by name and identify him as prior of Hatfield Regis, therefore pushing back the evidence for his time as prior by a calendar year.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Hares, Rabbits, Pheasants: Piers Plowman and William Longewille, a Norfolk Rebel in 1381Review of English Studies,  2018Since Piers Plowman occupies a central place in the study of medieval English literature, much at... more Since Piers Plowman occupies a central place in the study of medieval English literature, much attention has been paid to the vexed question of the poem's authorship. This justified interest in revealing the human agent behind the family of interrelated versions of the poem, usually named A, B, and C, continues to feed a vibrant industry of speculative scholarship on the person behind the poem. This article reassesses the relevance of the 'Langland' myth for the contemporary reception of the poem, and argues that medieval audiences of the B Version associated the work with a 'Long Will' author-persona. In this context, the case of a previously unnoticed Norfolk poacher in the weeks leading up to the 1381 rising, a William Longewille, and his encroachment on the estate of the former sheriff and tax collector Richard Holdych echo the Ploughing of the Half-Acre in Piers Plowman, in particular as it is presented in the B Version of the poem. As a result, this article proposes that both the A and B Versions of the poem may have been available to (some of) the rebels of 1381, and that the B Version may have circulated in Norfolk along Cluniac and Benedictine networks before and after the unrest.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer's The Canterbury TalesSpeculum,  2017By showing that the General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales was inspired by Harry Bailey's 1381 ... more By showing that the General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales was inspired by Harry Bailey's 1381 poll-tax records for Southwark, this article offers a new interpretive context for Chaucer's best-known work.During the second half of the 1380s, John Gower, the leading fourteenth-century poet and an acquaintance of Geoffrey Chaucer, was working on his longest English poem, the Confessio Amantis. Chaucer, in turn, is believed to have been writing some of the material that would later form The Canterbury Tales. In addition, Chaucer was probably finishing Troilus and Criseyde, which must have been available before March 1388, at least in part, to Thomas Usk, the poet and undersheriff of London, who names the poem and borrows from Chaucer’s Boece in his Testament of Love. It is in the Confessio and in the Troilus, that is, in works written in the second half of the 1380s, that Chaucer and Gower first refer to one another in a literary context. The only other instance that connects the two names is a 1378 legal record, in which Chaucer hands power of attorney to Gower and the lawyer Richard Forster. Rather than reading this document as proof of Gower and Chaucer’s supposed personal friendship, I adduce new evidence for Gower’s legal training that suggests that the 1378 record was a purely professional arrangement—Chaucer might simply have needed a team of lawyers at the time. There is no reason to read this document through the prism of an instance of poetically embedded praise some ten years later, particularly given Gower’s likely career as a lawyer.The new evidence for Gower’s legal training changes what we know of the relationship between the two poets and, by virtue of pushing forward their literary acquaintance to the late 1380s, brings into sharp relief their deep ties to Southwark, where Gower may have resided at the time and where Chaucer launched his Canterbury Tales. Furthermore, on closer inspection, this new focus on Gower’s and Chaucer’s work in Southwark has the potential not only to foreground the role of an emerging literary culture in the area but to challenge existing models of reading The Canterbury Tales and modify our understanding of what Chaucer had in mind when he embarked on this collection of tales.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

He was admitted as fellow commoner of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1594. At Queens' he was an exact contemporary of the poet and later traveller John Weever and there he may have met Nathanial Fletcher, elder brother of the future playwright John Fletcher. Peyton must have acquired excellent Latin, and his later writings certainly exhibit some knowledge of German and Italian.In 1596 Peyton left on a confidential mission for Germany and Bohemia, reaching Poland in spring 1598. His task was to gather detailed information on Spanish activities in the Holy Roman empire and in the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, and his mission appears to have been arranged and at least partly financed by Robert Cecil, who had recently been appointed secretary of state. From Poland, Peyton travelled to Padua, then to Basel, where he was in November 1599, before returning to Italy. Writing to his father from Basel, Peyton complained about his life as a spy: ‘it being … dangerous for a man to bee noted of curious enquiry’ (CUL, MS Kk.5.2., fols. 2r–v). He returned to England between 1601 and November 1602 at the latest.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Other imagined seas were also thought to exist, such as the Libersee (“mare coagulatum”) which marks the northernmost boundary of the North Sea. Besides its exploitation for purposes of commerce, fishing, travel, and warfare (link: seafaring), the sea received considerable attention in the culture and literature of the Middle Ages. Although symbolic uses of the sea are a common feature of medieval art (Jonah and the Whale, the Flood, St Nicholas), it is the literature of the period that has generated the most inventive uses of sea motives.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On 'Raptus', Quitclaims, and Precedents in Staundon vs Chaucer-Chaumpaigne: An Afterwordby Sebastian Sobecki and Euan C RogerLegal History Miscellany ,  2023The 1873 discovery of a quitclaim [deed of release] by Cecily Chaumpaigne, in which she formally ... more The 1873 discovery of a quitclaim [deed of release] by Cecily Chaumpaigne, in which she formally renounced her right to sue Geoffrey Chaucer from any action arising from de raptu meo, fostered the belief that Chaucer may have committed a serious crime. Uncertainty about how exactly to interpret the quitclaim springs from the ambiguity of the term raptus (which translates to "seizure"), used in both rape and ravishment (abduction) suits. What events had led up to this quitclaim? Our new discovery of two previously unknown legal records, presented at a public event in October 2022, transforms our knowledge of the relationship between Geoffrey Chaucer and Cecily Chaumpaigne. The two documents we introduced show that a third known life-record was also linked to the same dispute. The surviving records refute the long-held hypothesis that Chaucer may have raped Chaumpaigne; instead, the new records establish that Chaucer and Chaumpaigne were not opponents but belonged to the same party in a legal dispute with Chaumpaigne's former employer, Thomas Staundon, who had sued them both under the Statute of Laborers (1349). Chaumpaigne's quitclaims offered the most expedient legal path under the Statute of Laborers for both Chaucer and Chaumpaigne to demonstrate that she had left her employment with Staundon voluntarily, as opposed to being coerced or abducted, before commencing work for Chaucer.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The concentration of aristocratic tastes, mercantile capital, and political power and the presence of civic, ducal, royal, or imperial chanceries accelerated the development of literary production in Europe’s cities, including Budapest, Cologne, Cracow, London, Naples, Paris, and Prague. Cities began to emerge as literary centres, and clerks and commercial scribes played a central role in this cultural shift.New findings reveal that London's clerks and scriveners, who moved between English, French, and Latin, formed professional ‘communities of practice’, which played a significant part in the dissemination of literary manuscripts. These findings are transforming our knowledge of the contexts of English literary culture, book production, and ideas of authorship.Were London’s civic, national, and commercial administrative centres involved in the production of literary manuscripts? Which of its urban settings or institutions can be identified as hubs of literary activity? Can comprehensive empirical analysis of the capital’s scribal output reveal the extent to which bureaucratic, commercial, and ecclesiastical scribes shaped England’s intellectual culture and the tastes of a reading public in the city and the country’s regions?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

No stone unturned: what Continental archives can tell us about Middle English literatureThat European libraries often hold important manuscripts of late medieval English texts is well k... more That European libraries often hold important manuscripts of late medieval English texts is well known: there is a copy of Lydgate’s Fall of Princes in Leiden, and manuscripts of The Canterbury Tales have survived in Paris and Geneva. However, we rarely mine other repositories for evidence, particularly beyond the ‘traditional’ areas for Chaucer and Middle English studies such as France or Italy. As my discovery of John Kempe’s 1431 letter in Gdańsk shows, overlooked archives can be rewarding. Such repositories need not be obvious or particularly visible; many are regional, provincial, or municipal. In my paper, I will concentrate on minute books, letters, bookkeeping documents, charters, and custom and toll registers in the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, and Lithuania, in an attempt to open up new avenues for future research.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

My paper presents two pieces of new evidence relating to Margery Kempe’s son and to Robert Spryngolde, her confessor. The first item, a letter prepared for her son in Danzig (modern Gdańsk) in 1431, discloses the son’s name and the reasons for his journey to Lynn. This information, in turn, sheds new light on the account of The Book’s production as given in the Proem. As a result, the discovery of the letter corroborates the theory that the son was Kempe’s first scribe. A second previously unknown document shows the extent of Robert Spryngolde’s ties to Margery Kempe’s family, strengthening his role as the clerical scribe behind much of The Book. Both findings help to anchor the supposedly autobiographical narrative in its immediate historical situation, thereby strengthening the historicity of the work. Finally, I offer a revised explanation for the collaborative model behind the production of this text.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This course will explore the later premodern city (and London in particular) both as a context for literary production and as the subject of literary reflection. Urban synergy – the idea that the city amounts to more than the sum of its parts – and its relationship to individuals and polities will inform our reading of selected texts by Chaucer, Hoccleve, Ashby, More, and Skelton. As we encounter embodiments of the city as a royal bride, as polis, as New Troy, or as a utopia, we will examine how premodern writers negotiate such ‘urban’ concepts as free speech, public/private space, and the political meaning of the city. For last year's essay exam questions, see below.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

His works, composed in the second half of the fourteenth century, reflect and inflect existing English and European literary traditions. French, Italian, and classical influences shimmer through Chaucer’s poems, which engage with an almost encyclopaedic range of topics and interests. Chaucer’s own life is exceptionally well-documented, and his many public roles and jobs offer a window on the social, political, and literary culture of late-medieval London, England, and Europe.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They blend Classical myth with Celtic mystique, and oriental exotica with local concerns. Romances tell stories about King Arthur and his court, the crusades, and ancient English princes, many of which recur in the works of Shakespeare, Tennyson, or Eliot. In this course we will explore the romance tradition in England, with special attention to the origin and development of the Arthurian canon, the political meaning of Englishness and Britishness, the self-examination of courtly ethics and gender relations, and the ideological origins of the British Empire. The course will not only examine the aristocratic culture of medieval England but will also demonstrate how premodern writings inform the literature of later periods.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Starkey, University of Hull, UK; & Philip Stern, Duke University, USAEarly modern oceans not only provided temperate climates, resources, and opportunities for commercial exchange, they also played a central role in cultural life. Increased exploration, travel, and trade, marked this period of history, and early modern seascapes were cultural spaces and contact zones, where connections and circulations occurred outside established centres of control and the dictates of individual national histories. Likewise, coastlines, rivers, and ports were all key sites for commercial and cultural exchange. Interdisciplinary in its approach, Maritime Humanities, 1400–1800: Cultures of the Sea welcomes books from across the full range of humanities subjects, and invites submissions that conceptually engage with issues of globalization, post-colonialism, eco-criticism, environmentalism, and the histories of science and technology. The series puts maritime humanities at the centre of a transnational historiographical scholarship that seeks to transform traditional land-based histories of states and nations by focusing on the cultural meanings of the early modern ocean.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Geoffrey Chaucer and Cecily Chaumpaigne - Rethinking the Recordby Sebastian Sobecki and Euan C RogerUK National Archives,  2022Online event on 11 October 2022
Description:

Few medieval records have received as much atten... more Online event on 11 October 2022Description: Few medieval records have received as much attention from literary scholars as a group of documents dating from May to July 1380 that involve Geoffrey Chaucer and Cecily Chaumpaigne, the daughter of a London baker. At the heart of this group of records is a quitclaim of May 4, enrolled in the Close Rolls of the English Chancery, releasing Chaucer from “all manner of actions related to my raptus”. The word raptus, which in legal contexts can denote “rape,” “abduction,” and much of the spectrum lying between these terms, has challenged Chaucer scholars ever since Frederick J. Furnivall announced this find in 1873. The matter was given significant new impetus in 1993, when Christopher Cannon discovered a second quitclaim by Chaumpaigne – with the word raptus removed – enrolled in the plea rolls of the Court of King’s Bench a few days after the first. Cannon’s discovery has energised foundational strands of Chaucer studies, in particular feminist scholarship, over the last thirty years, but in this time no new documentary evidence has come to light. Now, new research into the medieval legal collections at The National Archives has uncovered two new life-records relating to the dispute of 1380 – including evidence of the original legal accusations brought against the poet – which offer a radically different understanding of the documentary evidence. These finds, which clarify the relationship between Chaucer and Chaumpaigne, and the nature of the charges brought in the King’s Bench, are to be published in a special edition of the journal Chaucer Review alongside responses from three leading Chaucer scholars, a new biography of Chaumpaigne and an article on the importance of understudied legal collections for medieval literature and historical studies. At this virtual launch event for the special issue, join historians and literary scholars as they present and discuss the new documents. In the broader context of how this material serves students of Chaucer’s life and works, the event will emphasise how studying sources across established scholarly boundaries and directly with collections experts can generate new and exciting approaches.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Friday Workshop - The Invention of Colonialism: Richard Hakluyt and Medieval Travel Writingby Centre for Renaissance and Reformation Studies and Sebastian SobeckiFriday Workshop,  2022The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye, a poem written in 1436 against the backdrop of the Hundred Years... more The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye, a poem written in 1436 against the backdrop of the Hundred Years’ War that details European trade routes and ties, pioneers the mercantilist jingoism and protectionist sea-keeping that informs so much of Elizabethan colonial thinking. This poem is also one of the more important summaries of mercantile voyaging, piracy, and maritime travel. As a milestone work in the history of medieval travel writing, the poem has a tradition of being included in anthologies of travel writing, starting with Richard Hakluyt’s monumental second edition of his Principal Navigations (1598-1600). Prof. Sobecki argues that Hakluyt used this work as the cornerstone of his expansionist thought and that the Libelle also serves as the blueprint for his Discourse on Western Planting (1584), one of the founding documents of English settler colonialism.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Lydgate's Kneeling Retraction: The Testament as a Literary PalinodeThe Chaucer Review,  2015This article maintains that John Lydgate’s &amp;#39;Testament&amp;#39; is not a rejection of his ... more This article maintains that John Lydgate’s &amp;#39;Testament&amp;#39; is not a rejection of his secular career but a literary palinode that attempts to impress a sense of coherence onto a diverse body of work. As the language of conversion, the repetitive litaneutical code at the end of the poem is vindicated by the earlier performance of poetic bravado. Lydgate’s textual piety, which I show to be indebted to the devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus, is paradoxically sustained by the displacement of prior secular forms. In a central gesture, the kneeling monk-poet presents his life’s work to God, who acts as his patron. Finally, I demonstrate that manuscript illuminations depicting a kneeling Lydgate confirm the reception of such a pose as simultaneously pious yet secular. As a result, I suggest that we view Lydgate not as a Chaucerian, but first and foremost as a poet dedicated to reconciling the writing of secular literature with a spiritual calling.

Con... more The thirteenth-century poem King Horn is widely regarded as the first Middle English romance. Consequently, a disproportional amount of attention has been paid to the work&amp;amp;amp;#x27;s genre and linguistic features, often at the expense of more complex interpretative concerns. One such aspect of the poem is the structural negotiation of the conflict between Saracens and the londisse men allied to the protagonist. This clash permeates the work and pits the land against the sea, elevating the shore to a defining role. 1 This article is based on a ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The priority of HF suggests that Chaucer set the example here, but Sobecki is not primarily interested in who came first. He instead focuses on the significance of the heart, not as the most efficient target of a suicide, as we might presume, but as the seat of the passion that ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
‘A man of curious enquiry’: John Peyton's Grand Tour to central Europe and Robert Cecil's intelligence network, 1596-1601Renaissance Studies,  2014Between 1596 and 1601 John Peyton the Younger (1579–1635) travelled to Germany, Bohemia, Poland–L... more Between 1596 and 1601 John Peyton the Younger (1579–1635) travelled to Germany, Bohemia, Poland–Lithuania, Switzerland, and Italy. His accounts of the Empire and Bohemia are among the most detailed and best informed reports to have survived from the period, yet they are virtually unknown to modern scholarship. Furthermore, he was the author of the celebrated description of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, A Relation of the State of Polonia and the United Provinces of that Crown, Anno 1598. Based on new evidence, this article shows that John Peyton&amp;#39;s travels in Central Europe formed part of Cecil&amp;#39;s attempts to gather intelligence on Spanish diplomatic activity in the Empire and in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. I argue that Peyton was one of many contemporaries who left England on an Elizabethan Grand Tour; a peculiar mixture of visiting European countries for culture, education and intelligence. His writings, however, belong to the more sophisticated written achievements in Elizabethan intelligence gathering.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
