In "Pride and Prejudice and Patina" I discuss some aspects behind conservation decision-making that often are not often acknowledged, such as human perception thresholds, aesthetic custom or technical inertia. I suggest that these phenomena need to be taken into account in order to fully understand most conservation cleaning treatments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Salvador Muñoz-Viñas•  11  Cultural Heritage Conservation, Heritage Conservation, Art Conservation, Science for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural HeritageIl restauro del ciborio di Arnolfo di Cambio - Basilica di san Paolo fuori le Mura - Roma (The restoration of the ciborium by Arnolfo di Cambio - Basilica of St. Paul Outside-the-Walls - Rome).

The website provides a reference set of images and data for more than 50 Alaskan animal furs used traditionally or commercially, as well as a compilation of practical observations and techniques for analysis. Both guard hair and underfur were examined for many clues, including maximum length in millimeters, diameter range in microns, medullary index, presence/pattern/appearance of the medulla, pigmentation in the cortex or medulla, banding, scale pattern and its change along the length of the shaft, and cross-sections. Slides mounted with Cargille meltmount and scale casts taken with Duco cement were examined under polarized light microscopy (PLM). This paper explains the design and methodology of the project as an example of a regional material identification dataset. It also discusses the possibilities and limitations of fur identification by this method. Many previous attempts to use microscopy for hair identification have suffered from the challenges of acquiring and disseminating good quality images as a reference set for the user, as well as limiting themselves to certain measurements while overlooking others. The project utilizes simple design and vocabulary to be accessible to many users, including museum conservators, archaeologists, biologists, forensic scientists, and students. An index, glossary, and annotated bibliography assist the non-specialist user.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lauren Horelick and +1Ellen  Carrlee•  2  Museum Studies, Art ConservationSirio Luginbuhl.

While cleaning and/or polishing these surfaces may improve the appearance, questions remain regarding which protocol to follow. This ongoing technical study of aged Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) evaluates a commercial product marketed for plastic/acrylic objects, the NOVUS 7100 Plastic Polish system, which includes three compounds (1, 2, and 3) meant to be applied in sequence. Between 2013 and 2018 SBE Conservation LLC, a Brooklyn-based private objects conservation firm, conserved three vacuum-formed reverse painted UVEX (a commercial name for CAB) sculptures by Tom Wesselmann, created in the mid-1960s. These complex, large-scale objects presented a range of condition issues, including those related to fabrication stress, expected plastics degradation, and past restorations. The conservation treatments focused on overall stabilization of the fragile objects, visual reintegration of areas of plastic loss, surface cleaning and polishing, and replacement of the deteriorated backing. This comprehensive project served as the impetus for the study, which utilized samples of both discarded, aged CAB and recently manufactured "fresh" CAB. Samples of both plastics were abraded with 800 and 1500 grit Micro Mesh, in a uni-directional pattern, and then polished with the NOVUS system. Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) was used to document the qualitative results of polishing. Optical profilometry was used to characterize the surface morphology and quantify the surface roughness; specifically, height profiles were obtained using a Nanovea ST400 optical profilometer, which uses chromatic confocal microscopy to determine pixel heights. Results showed that treatment with Novus 1 alone was not very effective as the difference in surface roughness between scratched and treated samples was minimal. Polishing with the addition of Novus 2 and 3 was much more effective as the roughness decreased significantly in these cases.

It looks at two examples of artworks with the objective of unraveling the varying modes of their transition. An event score, event-performance, object, and film drawn from the artistic legacies of George Brecht and Nam June Paik illustrate that ideas of permanence and impermanence are linked with an understanding of artworks in time and duration. While conservation reveals itself as an intervention in the temporal dimension of artworks, the theories of duration allow us to better understand the reciprocal relations between materials and meanings. In doing so, these theories acknowledge and attempt to make sense of the performative materiality of these works.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hanna B .

In an effort to learn more about this impressive work and improve its physical state, art historical research has been combined with technical study and detailed physical examination. This paper is the result of a seven-month collaborative investigation conducted by one student pursuing a Masters in the History of Art and one student pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in the Conservation of Easel Paintings, both at the Courtauld Institute of Art.  The initial goal of this project was to contextualise the painting within the lives of both Pulzone and Granvelle as well as learn more about the materials and techniques of the artist. Subsequently, the exact nature of the commission was investigated and broader themes relating to its intention and function were developed in relation to the panel. This paper summarises the various avenues of inquiry that were pursued and proposes various hypotheses about the panel in the hopes of illuminating its essentially undocumented and unpublished history.Save to Libraryby Alexander J Noelle•  2  Art Conservation, Scipione PulzoneMural Removal From Building in Austin TexasMural removal - art conservation services and consultation to save two 30' Mexican masterpiece murals from demolition in Austin Texas.

The original frame's exterior measurements are  90.5 x 77 cm. The painting is a religious motif with the Crucifixion as the main motif, containing 13 miniature scenes, each portraying the suffering of Christ. An art and cultural history investigation suggests that the painting is one of several which were painted with the same motif and iconography. Today there are about 20 known versions in Norway, whilst in Denmark a lesser number survive. A survey of original materials and comparison of the other dated versions suggests that this painting was executed between the year 1730 and 1780 and that the painting has possibly been used in a religious and scholastic context.  The "Passion Clock" is part of the collection at Glomdalsmuseet. When the painting arrived at the conservation atelier in January 2007 it was clearly visible that it had been treated before. The canvas was buckled and it was stretched onto a thin and unstable original stretcher. A secondary stretching on the original stretcher had been undertaken in the past with metal nails perforating the paint layers on the foreside. The previous repair of a hole and its over-paint was visible. The earlier restoration is suggested as being the main cause of flaking in the paint layers, such as its obvious glue impregnation. The paint layer was suffering from cupping and a substantial amount of paint had become detached, some of which had been lost. The surface of the remaining paint was exceptionally dirty.  The investigation and documentation of the painting’s condition has included examination using: optical microscopy, ultra-violet light and x-ray photography. Small samples have been taken in order to undertake different analysis including SEM-EDX microprobe and FTIR. The stretcher, the frame and the varnish appeared to be original.  Where possible it was considered important to retain these elements whilst providing the canvas with sufficient support. Following a discussion about possible treatment options it was felt that structural stability could only be achieved by replacing the stretcher. The original varnish was cleaned in order to make the script more legible and to make the motif more visually acceptable. This was considered to be important, as the original intention of the painting was to be read and understood. The decisions taken during the project and level of interventive treatment undertaken was based on professional ethical guidelines, including the justification of materials and techniques based on stability and retreatability.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nina Kjølsen  Jernæs•  4  Conservation, Art Conservation, Conservation of Easel Paintings, Master's Thesis2011.

If our answer is affirmative (1), we commit to the idea that authenticity is determined by the work’s creator; thus, it is considered a given, exempt from historical flux. If our answer is negative (2), we take authenticity to be a combination of initial creation and temporal change; inthis sense the work is considered a ‘historical being’. These two conceptions come from opposite ontological perspectives on the identity of artworks. In examining them we will gain insight into how different conservation narratives can be considered and configured in conceptual terms. One’s interpretation of what makes an artwork authentic will greatly influence how to go about preserving or restoring it.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giombini Lisa•  4  Aesthetics, Authenticity, Art Conservation, Philosophy of ConservationTHE SAN VITO WOODEN PULPIT FROM MUSEO DIOCESANO OF PALERMO, ITALY: MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH AND ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR DATING AND RESTORATIONSave to LibraryDownloadby Mauro Sebastianelli and +3Rachele  LucidoFranco  PallaClaudia  Pellerito•  32  Cultural Studies, Art History, Art Theory, ConservationArquitectura y funcionalidad del Gran Templo de Requem/Petra (Architecture and functionality of the Requem/Petra Great Temple)Until 1993 there were conducted first excavations in what promised to be the site of one of the most important buildings of Petra, the stunning capital of the Nabataean kingdom.

This paper will present four case studies that illustrate a new aqueous cleaning system for acrylic paint films on paper supports. It will also address this system’s potential to treat discolored paper and board. Driving this evolution in practice is acrylic works’ sensitivity to aqueous cleaning methods.

Color change has a great importance during the time and treatment process, due to visual and aesthetic values of historic leather relics. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and silicone oil (SiO) are frequently used leather dressings in the conservation procedures. Therefore, color stability of treated leathers with PEG and SiO were investigated before and afterheat accelerated aging. Moreover, application of ascorbic acid was evaluated as an antioxidant additive for PEG (PEG+AA).Color change after treatment and aging were studied by colorimetry technique in the CIE *L*a*b system. Results indicated to severe color alteration in PEG treated and aged leathers with or without ascorbic acid. Whereas, SiO treated samples showed better stability and minimum color shift after aging. Silicone oil was characterized as the best dressing for historical leathers with compared to PEG and PEG+AA, due to its high stability and aesthetical properties.Save to LibraryDownloadby alireza koochakzaei and +1hossein ahmadi•  12  Colorimetry, Heritage Conservation, Art Conservation, Footwear and Leather Garments and IndustriesIl restauro della Crux Vaticana o Croce di Giustino IIPontificia Università Gregoriana - Lezione "Il restauro della Crux Vaticana o Croce di Giustino II" , 19 dicembre 2011, ore 17.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sante Guido•  32  Art History, Cultural Heritage, Heritage Studies, Cultural Heritage Conservation2009 / Utjecaj okoliša i drugi utjecaji na žbuke i kamen [Environmental and Other Impacts on Mortar and Stone] /  PROFESSIONAL REVIEWThe materials of which cultural properties are made are subject to the natural process of aging.

In the environment, however, there are factors that intensify and accelerate the process, factors that can to a certain extent be influenced. A conservator-restorer must recognise the causes of deterioration and understand the mechanisms of their action. Only then is it possible to determine the necessary procedures and course of the conservation-restoration operation that is going to halt, slow down and prevent further deterioration of a cultural property.  This article deals with the impact on the environment on stone and plasterwork as the structural materials of cultural properties. There are other factors that also influence the life of these materials, and their effects are also tested. Using the example of the Peristyle of Diocletian’s Palace in Split (Croatia), various kinds of damage and soiling arising via environmental and other factors on the stone that is the basic structural material of this architectural unit are discussed.- - - - - I wrote two more papers for this project: "The Causes of the Deterioration of the Peristyle of Diocletian’s Palace" and "Stone Restoration Techniques".

During recent treatments at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, furniture and upholstery conservators and mount-makers have worked together to design and construct wood and carbon fiber support frames for various upholstered objects. The examples presented will include a mid-nineteenth century chair made by George Hunzinger that retains the original back upholstery but only the original springs in the seat (all other seat materials were inappropriate for display), a set of Rococo revival parlor furniture c. 1850 with all of the original under-upholstery except the original webbing, and late eighteenth century side chairs with half-over the rail upholstery. Through the process of resolving these different challenges it has become apparent that certain chair types lend themselves more successfully to one material over another due to the mechanical properties of the material and shape of the chair frame. First, this paper will discuss these options and the decision making processes behind their use, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each. A brief description of the previously published Sene furniture at the MFA will be included in order to show how its treatment effectively influenced our own. Second, we will present new ideas to the familiar problem of supporting seat springs, both when they are detached from all other materials and when they remain connected to original layers above. Although final designs for support systems often take time to evolve, the most successful ones are usually simple concepts that are easy to construct using readily available materials and limited tools and machinery. By detailing the production processes for each project, this paper aims to describe how new materials and frame designs can be adopted without difficulty in the treatment of upholstered furniture.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stéphanie  Auffret and +1Heather Porter•  3  Art Conservation, Technical Art History, Conservation, FurnitureRepair of Fashion Objects: An Interview with Sarah ScaturroAn interview between Sarah Scaturro and Sanem Odabasi about sustainable fashion, preservation, fashion and textile conservation, mending, and one's relationship to their clothes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sarah Scaturro•  9  Fashion Theory, Conservation, History of Textiles, Fashion HistoryChallenges Surrounding the Conservation and Replication of Eva Hesse’s SculptureSave to LibraryDownloadby Kaela Nurmi•  4  Conservation, Contemporary Art, Art Conservation, Replication'ART & LAW' Seminar SeriesThe University of Cambridge, Department of History of Art Seminar Series on the theme of 'ART & LAW' will take place every Wednesday from 18 January – 8 March 2017 at 5:00pm in the Department of History of Art, 1-5 Scroope Terrace,... moreThe University of Cambridge, Department of History of Art Seminar Series on the theme of 'ART & LAW' will take place every Wednesday from 18 January – 8 March 2017 at 5:00pm in the Department of History of Art, 1-5 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge CB2 1PX.

In both cybernetic theory and philosophies of sexual difference, there is a common preconception of the body as a physical, stable, material entity. However, the heterogenous experiences of corporeity on cyberspace challenges such preconceptions in that bodies are found to exist in changing, malleable states, produces by processes of writing. In this essay, I propose a reading of Shu Lea Cheang’s web-art work Brandon (1998) and its recent restoration, combined with a critical analysis of philosophical writing on bodies and virtuality by Jacques Derrida and Elizabeth Grosz in order to demonstrate that how the malleable and unstable nature of cyberbodies may help us re-think such notions more generally. In doing so, I propose a reading of bodiliness or corporeity as always-already virtual, made up of local ‘artifactualities’ that produce local realities in and outside cyberspace. This, ultimately, allows us tobegin to re-think and re-define an ethics of the body through the internet, one premised on survival instead of a life/death dichotomy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeppe Ugelvig•  20  Translation Studies, Digital Humanities, Architecture, DeathNostitzův chebský kabinet ze zámku Jaroměřice, Flámský kabinet z Rájce nad SvitavouMATUS, Dominik a Radek RYŠÁNEK.

Using a number of normative ethical frameworks this thesis explores impacts of modern zoos. The impact of zoos include the costs to animals in terms of animal welfare, the loss of liberty and even impact on the value of animal life. On the positive side of the argument are the welfare and health outcomes for many of the animals held in zoos, increased attention and protection for their species in the wild and the enjoyment and education for the people who visit zoos. This paper concludes that zoos and aquariums are ethically defensible when they align conservation outcomes with the interests of individual animals and the interests of zoo operations. The impending extinction crisis requires large scale interventions which address human values and facilitate consideration of wildlife in decision making. Considering the long term relationship zoos have with animals, their extensive reach within communities and their reliance on animals to deliver positive experiences for people, it is appropriate that zoos pay back some of humanity's debt to wildlife by making a meaningful contribution to wildlife conservation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aboh James Ajang•  12  Conservation Biology, Conservation, Wildlife Biology, Conservation Ecologyვიზუალური ლექსიკონილექსიკონში წარმოდგენილია 11 მახასიათებელი მათ ტერმინთან ერთად, რომელიც დაზგური ფერწერის, კონკრეტულად კი ზეთის საღებავების დამაზიანებელ ფაქტორებთან არის დაკავშირებული. ამ მახასიათებლების განმარტებასთან ერთად წარმოდგენილი იქნება მათი... moreლექსიკონში წარმოდგენილია 11 მახასიათებელი მათ ტერმინთან ერთად, რომელიც დაზგური ფერწერის, კონკრეტულად კი ზეთის საღებავების დამაზიანებელ ფაქტორებთან არის დაკავშირებული. ამ მახასიათებლების განმარტებასთან ერთად წარმოდგენილი იქნება მათი ვიზუალური მხარეც.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ella Saakian•  4  Art Conservation, Oil on Canvass, Visual Glossary, Damaged paintings2016.

This raises the question of how to theoretically capture the variability of the work without losing the sense of its artistic identity. The researchers participating in the interdisciplinary project New strategies in the conservation of contemporary art propose to use a biographical approach to investigate and compare the histories of artworks, both before and after they enter museum collections. In this paper the authors claim that not only do decisive turning points in an artwork’s life occur at other moments than those conventionally recognised, but moreover, that they are made up of various and diverging timelines, to be mapped as a river’s trajectory.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hanna B .

After reviewing the meanings of authenticity and its semantic field, its evolving interpretation in the conservation world will be explored. Based on the discussions developed during the Nara Conference on Authenticity in 1994, evaluation criteria of the authenticity of furniture will be suggested. Selected case studies will illustrate the use of these criteria while underlining the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach in the understanding of the authenticity of furniture.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stéphanie  Auffret•  5  Philosophy of Art, Conservation theory and ethics, Art Conservation, FurnitureProtecting museum collections from vibrations due to construction: Vibration statistics, limits, flexibility and cooperationThis is the proof version.

See the citation for the final version. Vibrations due to heavy construction work continue to be a major concern for museums. Although there has been an increase in research on the effect of vibrations on objects of cultural heritage in recent years, selecting measures to protect collections and remain open during construction work continues to be difficult because of a lack of data on what objects can actually take, the complexity of vibration loads, and the uniqueness of each situation. The major renovation of the Central Library in Liverpool, England, which shared walls with National Museums Liverpool’s World Museum and Walker Art Gallery, showed how museums and other institutions can successfully deal with such situations. An integral approach was taken, beginning with an extensive risk analysis to determine which objects could remain on display, which needed extra protection and regular condition monitoring, and which had to be removed. The museums then negotiated a vibration protocol and action plan with the contractors, including continuous monitoring, and trigger-levels requiring consultation or work stoppage. Vibration data were also stored and used for later analysis. This integral approach was successful in protecting the exhibition collections, with only two incidents of damage reported directly related to vibrations. A combination of museum staff experience, excellent communications with the contractors, and some flexibility in defining vibration limits provided a successful recipe for both museums. The analysis of the vibration data using the basic engineering concept of the Palmgren-Miner rule, supports a more flexible approach to setting vibration limits based on recently published guidelines.Save to LibraryDownloadby William Wei and +1tracey seddon•  6  Vibrations, Art Conservation, Preventive conservation, Science for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural HeritageA study into the theory of washing treatments, associated with fugitive and friable watercolour mediaSave to LibraryDownloadby Alexandra Coxall•  3  Book and Paper Conservation, Art Conservation, Conservation of Works of Art on PaperNextLast »Related TopicsScience for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural HeritageFollowFollowingCultural Heritage ConservationFollowFollowingHeritage ConservationFollowFollowingTechnical Art History, ConservationFollowFollowingPreventive conservationFollowFollowingObjects ConservationFollowFollowingConservationFollowFollowingArchaeological ConservationFollowFollowingConservation and RestorationFollowFollowingPainting ConservationFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
