This move is backed by the country’s plan of a Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) initiative to protect the country from the adverse effects of climate change and to build a green economy that will help realise its ambition of reaching middle-income status before 2025. This chapter describes how an ESD Change Project, supported by Sida’s International Training Programmes, has been successfully implemented in a teacher education programme of the Educational and Behavioral Sciences Faculty of Bahir Dar University. The chapter illustrates the contextual factors that contribute to the successful implementation of the Change Project. Moreover, it highlights how important it is for higher officials in institutions, like universities, to be well aware of ESD related issues in order to minimise the challenges and constraints one could face in realising Change Projects.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBook ChapterIncorporating ESD into Teacher Education Incorporating ESD into the Secondary Teacher Education Curricula at Bahir Dar2014 • Dareje Taye, Asrat DerebThe Ethiopian Ministry of Education clearly articulates the need for the integration of the issue of environment and sustainable development into the curricula at all levels of the education system.

It focuses on the evolving policy context for ESD and explores the extent to which, and the ways in which, countries are committed to integrating ESD in their education systems. It pays particular attention to the actual implementation of ESD policies, initiatives and programs in national education systems and in local schools, especially in the curriculum of primary and secondary education. The paper draws upon peer-reviewed journal articles, policy documents published by UNESCO and other international agencies, and several comparative databases reporting evidence on ESD topics. It also analyses a diverse array of national and regional documents. In primary and secondary education, in particular, indications of increasing policy attention to ESD are apparent. And yet, while policy attention to ESD has strengthened, many countries either lack an ESD policy or a viable one. Limited financial resources, and a weak global economy, have constrained the implementation of national ESD commitments. Support from international donors, NGOs and the private sector is considered critical for the successful ESD implementation. A large and diverse array of ESD initiatives has been implemented in primary and secondary schools around the world since 2005. These initiatives range from large-scale trans-national programs and national reforms to small community projects, from NGO initiatives across many schools to teacher-led projects in individual schools. Many SD initiatives in schools primarily focus on the environmental components of ESD; quite a few emerged from earlier programs in environmental education. Moreover, the coverage, scope and depth of SD issues in school curricula have increased significantly. Recent comparative assessments highlight the variability of student knowledge of, and engagement with, ESD topics, especially in secondary educationDownload Free PDFView PDFEducation for Sustainable Development (ESD): A Journey Towards Sustainable FutureDennis MadrigalEducation for Sustainable Development (ESD) becomes an imperative trend among educational institutions, which requires a change in education in this modern society. Consequently, all learning institutions need to revisit its functions if it plays its vital role in transforming society by promoting social and environmental equity. This qualitative research intends to explore the faculty members' experiences in a State College in Negros Occidental of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).

Their relevant ESD experiences were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews, and results were analyzed using a thematic approach of Lichtman. Analysis of the data reveals exciting themes of their experiences. On becoming a greening organization member, their professional advancement and interest in the care for the environment prevailed. On the meaning of ESD, they highlighted the academe's role in promoting sustainability. Lastly, on their ESD experiences in their classes, actions for learning through the inculcation of sustainability competencies among learners were evident.

The implications of plurality of ESD perspectives and methodological approaches as well variations in ESD practice will be addressed. Critical framework for conceptualizing of ESD which takes environmental ethics into account will be proposed through the discussion of The Ecocentric and Anthropocentric Attitudes Toward the Sustainable Development (EAATSD) scale. Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for a general review approach, covering literature which provides an overview of the concepts and practices of ESD, as well as program evaluation studies. Additionally, qualitative evaluation of EAATSD scale with students of higher professional education was conducted, using in-depth interviews and dialogue with individual students as well as classroom discussions. Findings: It was found that there are wide and inconclusive debates about the aims of ESD based on the critique of sustainable development discourse in general and instrumentalism embedded in ESD in particular. According to the qualitative evaluation, EAATSD scale can be used for testing anthropocentric and ecocentric attitudes towards sustainable development in students of higher education. Based on these results, this scale was found to be revealing of the critical view of paradoxes and challenges inherent in multiple goals of sustainable development as well as useful for testing anthropocentric and ecocentric attitudes in students of higher education. Research limitations/implications: Reliability of the scale needs further statistical testing, and as is the case in conventional ESD evaluations, and consequent research is necessary to improve institutional, national, and international applicability to particular cases. Future research should draw from this critical review in order to devise alternative evaluation tools. Practical implications: In practice, this implies that currently administered evaluations of generic ESD, while useful in concrete cultural or institutional settings, might be premature. The article concludes with the reflection upon which conceptual, methodological, cultural, and ethical challenges of ESD which should be useful for ESD researchers and practitioners in different national settings. EAATSD is proposed both as methodological and content-oriented tool to be used for generic ESD programs. Originality/value: This article fulfills an identified need to address the paradoxes of sustainable development and to study how ESD can be more effective.
