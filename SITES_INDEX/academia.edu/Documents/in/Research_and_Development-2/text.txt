Liberalization and globalization of Indian economy have provided challenges and opportunities to our new business and which has necessitated re-engineering of the present management education system. Recently, Union Budget is also decreasing the fund for higher education in India for the last five years. This research is focused mainly on existing problems and challenges which are needed to be addressed and seeks to provide the solution thereabout. At present in India, there exists three-tier management education administration i.e., Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), Entrepreneur's and prestigious industry run best management institutes and management departments of Universities. Besides this, private B-Schools and non-statutory business training institutions also impact business education leading to MBA degree or PGDM diploma. Unfortunately, most of the students don't get the job in the completion of the course. In most of the cases, even the best student doesn't cater to the needs of the market because in the formal education system the gap between what is taught and what is demanded by the market is evident. Hence, an urgent need to rethink and redesign the management courses has arisen. It discusses the rationale of re-engineering of the whole management education system i.e, Admission, Instruction, Infrastructure, Regulation, Examination, Certification, Training and Placement etc.Save to LibraryDownloadby MARIMUTHU KN•  53  Entrepreneurship, Management, The MBA Subculture & Its Economic Instabilities, Quality ManagementIsrael defense industry, what we can learn from it?Israel has positioned itself in the world not only as a high-tech country, start-up nation, the country investing the most in research and development, or the most attractive place for investors but also as top armament exporter.... moreIsrael has positioned itself in the world not only as a high-tech country, start-up nation, the country investing the most in research and development, or the most attractive place for investors but also as top armament exporter. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in 2018 Israel takes 8th place in that regard and stands besides US, Russia, France, China, Germany, UK. This raises a question: how can a small nation succeed in such competitive field of industry? The aim of this study is to investigate Israel defense industry (IDI) context and developments in IDI from 1930s to 2018, as that could possibly indicate a way forward for countries that prefer to develop or enhance national defense industry. Research reveals the importance of IDI for Israel as it enables equipping own Armed Forces with advanced weapons, allows armament exports and facilitates developments in other sectors. Throughout the time Israel defense industry transformed as inner and outer circumstances forced that change. Israel Ministry of Defense acts as a main IDI facilitator in different fields. Well established links between Government, defense institutions, academia, investors and arms manufacturers contribute to arms quality, innovations and availability of export markets. US support remains a powerful instrument to boost IDI. Most authors claim that investment in education, Governmental efforts to encourage innovation and business expenditures on R&D, international cooperation within academia and industry, defense companies adaptability remains crucial factors for successful development of indigenous defense industries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Donatas Palavenis•  6  Israel, Research and Development, Defense Industry, Defence and Security PolicyPhotobiological hydrogen productionThe principles and recent progress in the research and development of photobiological hydrogen production are reviewed.

We assess the scientific content of combinatorial chemistry and biology using citations in patents to scientific journals and compare this research platform with biotechnology. We also identify the institutional affiliation of all the authors of the cited papers, which leads us to an analysis of knowledge spillovers between the main participants in the research network. Finally, we examine the relevance of localisation in the process of knowledge exchange with regard to EU countries and the US. The result of the analysis provides evidence to support the view that the inventive capacity of a country is dependent upon the basic research which is carried out, especially in universities and public research centres located in the inventor&#x27;s country.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stéphane Malo•  16  Sociology, Computer Science, Technology, ScientometricsAnalysis and Prediction of Winds at the Wind Farms in Westcentral US: Modeling Tools and ChallengesAccurate wind and severe-weather forecasts are crucial for wind-energy production and grid-load management.

Most of the prevailing wind power forecast methods rely heavily on statistical approaches that typically do not deal directly with weather processes. Currently employed numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are deemed insufficiently accurate by many industry stakeholders for wind power prediction, even though they have been used for such applications. The reason is partly because the NWP products used for power forecasting are typically produced by the coarse-resolution models at the major operational weather centers. Although a few of high-resolution models are run by some wind energy industries, most of these model do not contain advanced data assimilation capabilities that are required to initialize the model prediction with the important high-resolution weather information.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yubao Liu•  20  Wind Energy, Data Analysis, Data Assimilation, Numerical Weather PredictionWave power--Sustainable energy or environmentally costly?

These interpretations are called `wage gap’ and `innovation gap’. The former follows standard neoclassical thinking and regards high eastern German unemployment as the consequence of too high a wage level. The latter follows endogenous growth theory and regards a lack of product innovations as the main constraint on output and employment growth in the eastern German economy. The paper argues that the `innovation gap’ explains the facts much better than the `wage gap’. From this, the paper draws conclusions for economic policy: given the high interregional mobility of the workforce and the erosion of collective bargaining in eastern Germany, the wage level is not an appropriate policy instrument anymore. Instead, policy should aim at strengthening the innovative power of the eastern German economy by supporting research and development in the region.Save to LibraryDownloadby Karl-heinz Paqué•  8  Economic policy, Product innovation, Labour Market, Research and DevelopmentThe Modern University as a Driver of Economic Growth: Models and MissionsThis article analyzes the modern university as a driver of economicgrowth within the framework of the concept of university 3.0 (education,research, and the commercialization of knowledge).

The results show that family management reduces efficiency in the conversion of research and development expenses into technological innovation outcomes over time. Our findings also suggest that the influence of family management significantly contributes to improving the effect of the achievement of technological innovation on long-term performance.Save to LibraryDownloadby Montserrat Manzaneque•  9  Business, Family Business, Performance Studies, Technological InnovationA Comparison Between South African Agricultural Exports to the European Union and Those of Other Selected Southern Hemisphere CountriesSave to LibraryDownloadby T.

Firms which have high degrees of R&D investment and large numbers of patents are referred to as " high innovation energy corporations ". This study investigates the financial performance of such firms among a sample of Taiwanese high-tech companies from 2000 to 2011. Findings indicate that the lag between R&D expense and benefit, and the lead periods for patents (i.e., the duration of the application process) significantly affect stock returns. Moreover, these delays and a firm's R&D expense rate also impact net sales. In other words, firms with a high level of innovative energy have better stock returns and net sales, but such firms do not have an advantage in terms of operating income. Empirical results indicate that higher R&D expenses increase operating costs which, in turn, decreases operating income despite increased net sales.

It is now routinely used for non-destructive on-line characterization of semiconductor process. SOPRA, leader in commercial spectroscopic ellipsometer for research and development, has already developed an infrared ellipsometer as an option on visible instrument to provide the largest wavelength range available up to now (from deep UV 190 nm to far infrared up to 18 micrometers ). A new design of the instrument is presented here which includes a small spot size to get ride of the problems of back face reflection on silicon wafers, and an improved signal /noise ratio to allow rapid measurements compatible with an industrial environment. Some examples of application concerning dopant density in epilayers and composition of low k dielectrics are presented.Save to LibraryDownloadby jean-louis  Stehlé and +1Christopher Pickering•  7  Thin Film, Research and Development, Infrared, Far InfraredChallenges in Image-Guided Therapy System DesignSystem development for Image-Guided Therapy (IGT), or Image-Guided Interventions (IGI), continues to be an area of active interest across academic and industry groups.

This is an emerging field that is growing rapidly: major academic institutions and medical device manufacturers have produced IGT technologies that are in routine clinical use, dozens of high-impact publications are published in well regarded journals each year, and several small companies have successfully commercialized sophisticated IGT systems. In meetings between IGT investigators over the last two years, a consensus has emerged that several key areas must be addressed collaboratively by the community to reach the next level of impact and efficiency in IGT research and development to improve patient care.

The age demography can overall be divided into two main categories: Category one faculties represent an increased number of younger aged researchers (Catholic-, Protestant Theology, Law, Economics, Information Sciences, and Medicine), category two faculties show an increased number of older aged researchers (Social Sciences, Humanities, and Science). In addition, it can be demonstrated that the personnel costs for full professors are higher within four faculties (Catholic-, Protestant Theology, Law, and Economics and Information Sciences). Inevitably, this leads to savings for habilitated and non- habilitated researchers at these faculties. The faculty of Medicine represents a well-balanced use of personnel costs. Three faculties (Social Sciences, Humanities, and Sciences) have to pay dramatically more for their older aged habilitated and non-habilitated personnel. For the entire university and two faculties, Medicine and Humanities, a positive and significant relationship between age and the average weekly teaching performance is shown. This study suggests that institutions with a high percentage of older researchers, mainly in the categories of habilitated and non- habilitated personnel, must change their policy to become more flexible and attractive for new talented young people. Due to the fact, that this cannot only be realized through the introduction of new laws, each faculty must establish a scientific plan combined with reorganizations of the personnel structure and personnel costs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Martin Fieder•  16  Law and Economics, Scientometrics, Science and Technology, Library and Information StudiesUser experience design guidelines for telecare servicesSave to LibraryDownloadby stf stf•  9  Human Factors, Quality of life, User eXperience, InteractionsOptimal allocation of proposals to reviewers to facilitate effective rankingWade D.
