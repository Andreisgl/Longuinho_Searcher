Due to liberalization of breeding activities and to an increasing complexity of breeding objectives, this cooperative regime is threatened. Adopting a practice-based approach, we analyzed the diversity of individual breeding practices of farmers, revealing the various cooperation relationships between farmers and breeding organisations. We identified six types of farmers&#39; individual strategies and their relationship with the collective level which enabled us to unpack commonly used categories such as &quot;breeders&quot;. Our results also show that farmers combine the use of scientific tools such as genetic values and traditional practices in various manners to meet their individual objectives. The cooperation breakdown can hence be linked to the difficulty of a standardised breeding organisation to take into account this diversit...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Analyzing indicators for combining natural resources management and production-oriented activitiesby Julie Labatut and S. GirardEnvironment, Development and Sustainability,  2014ABSTRACT It is recognized today that production systems can be used for natural resources managem... more ABSTRACT It is recognized today that production systems can be used for natural resources management, whereas it is difficult to implement management that integrates production and natural resources conservation. This difficulty can be explained by the complexity of interactions between production systems and biodiversity dynamics and by the lack of predictability of the impacts of techniques on ecosystems. Designing tools to effectively guide such integration in this uncertain context is therefore a top priority. In this perspective, the aim of this paper is to analyze the indicators used by managers when trying to integrate ecological systems and production-oriented activities and, consequently, to assess their relevance when faced with these new challenges. Our analysis distinguishes indicators- in-theory and indicators-in-use. We studied the first ones with an original analytic grid to decipher their cognitive and management orientation through documents and interviews with indicator designers. We studied indicators-in-use through interviews and ethnographic observations of indicator users in four situations (forestry, pastoral, wildlife and breed management) in southwestern France. Our findings reveal the distance between managed objects and measured objects, thus explaining their effectiveness in terms of management. We also show how the indicators strongly shape practices and how they are adapted by users to their situation, emphasizing the role of experiential knowledge to create situated indicators. Finally, we discuss our results regarding tool design for environmental management.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To better understand of the links between knowing (knowledge as a practice) and knowledge (as a stock), we will here explore the hypothesis that instruments are not mere mediators in learning processes, but also act in knowledge and learning activation processes. Through the study of animal qualification activities in genetic selection organizations, we will show how with the approach through the instruments one can go beyond the dichotomy between opposite types of knowledge in speeches, i.e. scientific knowledge seen as a stock, and local knowledge seen as purely tacit, and assimilated to non-instrumented practices. After developing this lens, we will then offer some implications for the management of learning processes through instrumentationSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The common feature of these approaches is that they consider management instruments as a starting point to study organized, strategic action. This article introduces a framework to distinguish the notion of management instruments from that of management tools or settings. It then proposes a genealogy of these management instrument-based approaches, by placing them in the theoretical and practical contexts in which they emerged. The originality of contemporary developments concerning these instruments, compared to former studies, is thus evaluated. The article concludes by arguing for the broadening of the management science research agenda, beyond the micro-analysis of local instruments, to include the conception of strategic multi-level settings consisting of a combination of actors and instruments.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Design/methodology/approach – The paper focuses on a distributed, knowledge-intensive and instrumented activity at the core of any collective action: qualification. The particular case of breeding activities in the livestock sector has been studied, where collective practices of animal qualification for collective breeding have been studied. Qualitative data stemming from in-depth interviews and observation of daily practices have been analysed, combining practice-based approaches on knowing processes and science philosophers&amp;#39; theories on the use of instruments during action. Findings – The study of instruments used in daily practices allows us to go beyond the dichotomy between opposite types of knowledge, i.e. scientific knowledge seen as a stock, and sensible knowledge seen as purely tacit and equated to non-instrumented practices. Instruments are not merely mediators in learning processes; they also take an active part in shaping and activating knowledge and learning processes. Research limitations/implications – Further research is needed on the designing of reflexive instrumentation, which takes knowing and knowledge articulation into account better. Practical implications – Using instruments as a key concept to analyse knowing-in-practice processes has both methodological and managerial implications for identifying those instruments that favour learning processes. Originality/value – This paper complements more classical practice-based approaches by proposing a new perspective on instruments in learning processes, which is particularly relevant to the study of pluralistic organisations where power is diffuse.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper draws on two fields of literature that remain unconnected so far: participatory approaches and design sciences. It proposes an analysis grid to support a reflexive analysis of cases of implementation of three participatory design methods: ComMod (Companion Modelling for concerted management of natural resources), Forage Rummy (simulation-based board game for designing farming systems) and KCP (collective design workshops to foster innovation). This analysis highlights key features of the methods in view of agroecological innovation challenges, focusing on knowledge management and organisation for exploration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To identify these processes of change and emergence of practices, we propose a combinative theoretical analysis at the interface between institutional and practice-based approaches. Drawing on a rich ethnographic case study, we show how the fact of considering technologies as the combination of three dimensions (technical substrate, managerial philosophy and organizational model) furthers our understanding of institutional change and the creation of new practices. In particular, we examine the internal dynamics between the three dimensions of these technologies and the duality of organizational routines (their ostensive and performative aspects). This enables us to reintroduce practices and agency analysis into an institutional approach to technological change, and to put social history, designers‚Äô assumptions and disciplinary effects of technologies back into the analysis of the micro-dynamics of routine changes. We identify several factors which partially explain divergent technological trajectories concerning institutionalization and emerging structures in two different settings.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
