Employing autoethnography and analyzing secondary literature on historical and contemporary experiences of Black students in higher education, this paper argues that traditional readings of student engagement theory fail to capture the complexities of Black student engagement. In confronting anti-Blackness, these students pay an invisible tax that manifests in the mental, physical, and emotional resources that could be allocated to promote success in the campus environment but are instead utilized to merely survive as students.

These ideologies are not isolated concepts but articulations of a variety of cultural signifiers into a chain of meanings that are presented as statements of nature. Such meanings can produce troubling outcomes on U.S. college campuses when arriving international students' first and often only exposure to race in America is the nation's continued struggle with equality as portrayed in exported film and news spectacles portraying blackness as a social threat. This chapter examines how media representations can flavor cross-cultural interactions, and the implications these interactions may have for campus climate, diversity initiatives, and the increasingly multicultural and globalized work place.Download Free PDFView PDFRacial Spectacle and Campus Climate [Full Paper]Kenneth R RothDownload Free PDFView PDF2017_Bates_Rodney_Dissertation.pdfRodney BatesDownload Free PDFView PDFRacial Spectacle and Campus Climate: The Intersection of U.S. Media Representations and Racial Stereotype Formation Among Asian International Students, and Cross-Racial Interaction on College CampusesKenneth R RothMedia spectacle has become one of the important ways countries, culture, and commerce is expressed in the global marketplace. Media spectacle is a combination of power and capital and in its final form produces ideology. The U.S. is the global leader in the production and distribution of media, accounting for one-third of more than $30 billion annually in worldwide film distribution alone. These U.S. media representations can be distinctive in their racial dialogue and International college students with little exposure to the U.S. outside of its depiction in media arrive here with racial perceptions that may be detrimental to campus climate. Supported by two qualitative studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, this paper interrogates how media representations have implications for cross-cultural interactions, and how campus climate and diversity initiatives may suffer. We identify ways U.S. colleges and universities are addressing campus climate issues that cause racial discomfort, and how those efforts may not be enough. Finally, we call for an increase in required diversity training that cuts across all curricula and addresses the need for greater tolerance of race, gender, age, country of origin, and sexual orientation.Download Free PDFView PDFYou make me wanna holler and throw up both my hands!': campus culture, Black misandric microaggressions, and racial battle fatigueTommy J Curry, William A Smith, Walter AllenDownload Free PDFView PDFEmerging Adulthood"I Wasn't Expecting It": High School Experiences and Navigating Belonging in the Transition to College2019 • Gabriel Velez, Claudia BenzFor emerging adults transitioning to college, normative social and contextual shifts present challenges that are largely a productive aspect of development. But not all students have the same experiences, nor do all students manage similar experiences in similar ways. Black and Latinx emerging adults transitioning to Historically White Institutions must adjust not only to college life but also to feeling different and, sometimes, isolated. There is a dearth of qualitative work examining how students of color make meaning of their racial-ethnic experiences on campus. Our article draws on a mixed-methods study of Black and Latinx emerging adults' transition to college to investigate how high school racial-ethnic contexts shape students' interpretations of experiences of difference on college campuses. There was substantial variation in how Black and Latinx students interpreted experiences of difference on campus and coped with their feelings of otherness, and this variation was predicted by racial-ethnic high school context.Download Free PDFView PDFRacial Primes and Black Misandry on Historically White Campuses: Toward Critical Race Accountability in Educational AdministrationWilliam A Smith, Tara J. Yosso, Daniel SolorzanoRacial primes are an outgrowth and inculcation of a well-structured, highly developed, racially conservative, “race-neutral” or “color-blind” racial socialization process in which children learn race-specific stereotypes about African Americans and other race/ethnic groups. As they get older, they continue to receive—both involuntary and voluntary—corroborating messages of anti-Black stereotypes from adults, friends, games, folklore, music, television, popular media, and the hidden curriculum. A result of this belief system is Black misandry. Black misandry refers to an exaggerated pathological aversion toward Black men created and reinforced in societal, institutional, and individual ideologies, practices, and behaviors.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
