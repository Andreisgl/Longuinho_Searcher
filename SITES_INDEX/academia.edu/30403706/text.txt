Since this tablet was found in the Assyrian capital Nineveh, it stands to reason that this place name could also be mentioned in contemporary (as well as earlier) Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources. This study considers the possible equation of the Elamite toponym Hara(n) with biblical Hara and Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian URU.HAR(.KI), Dur-Abi-Hara and Hara'.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRichard C.

Studies of the Middle Assyrian corpus in general have also contributed to the improvement of our knowledge of the lexicon in use during this period. The aim of this paper is to list nouns and verbs commonly seen in MA and to provide bibliographical references to their discussion. Words listed in the dictionaries as typical for Assyrian or MA are also repeated here; those for which no new attestations are available are further examined, as it frequently occurs that hapax nouns are found to actually be ghost nouns when new and better readings become available. In certain other cases, words from the literary corpus which have been incorrectly labelled as MA are here corrected. Due to the nature of this corpus, a complete list of attestations, or even a complete list of all MA lexemes cannot be guaranteed2. Translations of difficult and disputed terms are tentative, and, while this author attempts to add some observations and find a consensus in the discussion of particular lexemes, it is not the intention of this study to settle these debates finally. Rather, it may be hoped that this study is a step forward in obtaining a better understanding the MA lexicon as a whole. To this effect, selected secondary literary references are included, with emphasis given to studies that focus on Old and Middle Assyrian.Download Free PDFView PDFWiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes Middle Assyrian Nominal Patterns, Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes 110 (2020)  87-101.2020 • Jacob Jan de RidderAs the intermediate stage of the Assyrian dialect, the Middle Assyrian lexicon and type of noun building differs from the classic Old Babylonian on several points. In order to illustrate this, the syllabically attested lexicon (as attested in a restricted corpus) will be arranged according to pattern and derivation (primary, loanword or denominally/deverbally derived). In order to aid comparison, Babylonian variants are also presented. Certain material is highlighted, particularly that which indicates the presence of the PuRRāS-pattern, previously unrecognized in Middle Assyrian (or Akkadian of any period), alongside parallels from other Semitic languages.Download Free PDFView PDFReview of Niek Veldhuis, History of the Cuneiform Mesopotamian Lexical Tradition. Guides to the Mesopotamian Textual Records, Volume 6 (Ugarit Verlag, Münster: 2014).  Review of Biblical Literature 2019: 03/41Adam E. MiglioNiek Veldhuis’ History of the Cuneiform Mesopotamian Lexical Tradition is the sixth volume in the series “Guides to the Mesopotamian Textual Records.” In keeping with the series as a whole, the volume under review is an expert presentation of the sources it treats. Veldhuis ably introduces the particulars of Mesopotamian lexicographic traditions in a user-friendly form and lucidly demonstrates what these traditions teach us about the cultures that produced these scholarly texts. The Mesopotamia lexical traditions are not widely read and studied, even among many cuneiformists, and so this volume is a welcome contribution for those interested in this important topic. At the same time, the volume is comprehensible to more than specialists in cuneiform studies and would be worth the effort for others whose research might intersect with the intellectual traditions from the first half of civilization.Download Free PDFView PDFWest Semitic Names in the Šeḫ Ḥamad Texts.
