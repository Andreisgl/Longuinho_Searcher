 Google Cloud Platform
                      Subprocessors 
Google and its affiliates engage the third-party entities
                      in the table below to perform limited activities in
                      connection with the Google Cloud Platform Services. The
                      table shows what activity each entity performs and
                      indicates if an entity is only relevant to a specific
                      Service or Region. More information about each activity is
                      provided directly below. This explains the limited
                      processing of Customer Data the entity is authorized to
                      perform.
Data Labeling: Human labelers apply
                      labels to datasets submitted by Customer based on
                      instructions provided by Customer. See the
                      AI Platform Data Labeling Service page,
                      Document AI Service page,
                      Human-in-the-Loop AI Service page,

Technical
                        Support: Customer-initiated technical
                      support:
in the case of Apigee as described in
                          the Apigee Technical Support Services Guidelines.
                          The Subprocessor only has access to Customer Data if
                          access is enabled in the Admin Console. See
                          the Trace Overview page for
                          more information.
in the case of all other Google Cloud Platform
                          Services as described in
                          the Google Cloud Platform Technical Support Service Guidelines.
                          The Subprocessor does not have access to Customer Data
                          stored or processed by the Services. The Subprocessor
                          only has access to Customer Data if Customer
                          explicitly elects to share Customer Data in the course
                          of a support case (e.g. screenshots).
Voice Transcription: Human
                      transcribers label and transcribe audio recordings. This
                      activity only occurs if Customer elects to opt in to the
                      Speech-to-Text data logging program. See
                      the Speech-to-Text Data Logging page for
                      more information.
Managing Hosting Environment: Monitoring,
                      troubleshooting and ongoing management of the hosting
                      environment that stores Customer Data. Subprocessor
                      personnel do not require access to Customer Data to
                      perform this activity. See the
                      Bare Metal Solution overview page
                      for more information.
