We compute the production rate both at a semi-classical level, viewing Schwinger pair production as a tunneling event, and at the full quantum level, by extracting the imaginary part of the one-loop amplitude. In contrast to the usual Schwinger pair production in flat space, pair production in AdS_2 requires a sufficiently large electric field E^2&gt; M^2+1/4 in order to overcome the confining effect of the AdS geometry -- put in another way, the presence of an electric field E raises the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound to M^2 &gt; -1/4 + E^2. For E greater than this threshold, the vacuum is unstable to production of charged pairs in the bulk. We expect our results to be helpful in constructing supersymmetric AdS_2 X S^2 perturbative string vacua, which enter in the near-horizon limit of extremal charged black holes.

In unified field theory all the objects are geometrical, for strings the Kalb-Ramond matter field is identical to the asymmetric part of the metric except that the fields contribute to different sides of the field equations. The dilaton is related to the object of non-metricity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark D Roberts•  5  General Relativity, Quantum Cosmology, String Theory, High Energy PhysicsThe ATLAS experiment at the CERN large hadron colliderSave to LibraryDownloadby Saleem M•  4  High Energy Physics, Instrumentation, Large Hadron Collider, Standard ModelThe Cosmological constant and the Wheeler-DeWitt EquationSave to LibraryDownloadby Remo Garattini•  5  Quantum Cosmology, High Energy Physics, Riemann zeta function, Cosmological ConstantWild quiver gauge theoriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Alessandro  Tanzini•  3  High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciencesNon-planar master integrals for the production of two off-shell vector bosons in collisions of massless partonsSave to LibraryDownloadby Vladimir Smirnov•  3  High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciencesThe Fundamental Holographic Uncertainty Principle and its Primary ApplicationsThe fundamental holographic principle is first proposed, then demonstrated in its validity and viability through a thought experiment and then finally derived.

The Heisenberg uncertainty relations are shown to follow from this fundamental relation. The quantum blackhole entropy is then demonstrated using this holographic uncertainty relation along with the application of the Landauer’s principle for the thermodynamic erasure of a bit yielding a formula with a logarithmic correction. The blackhole entropy is found to be half the value normally delivered by any other method. So, it is proposed that there is a real relevant physical horizon at the twice the Schwarzschild radius dubbed the holographic information geometric horizon.Save to LibraryDownloadby Koustubh Kabe•  20  Computational Physics, Gravitation, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, General RelativityHamilton's equations in a non-associative quantum theoryA new non-associative algebra for the quantization of strongly interacting fields is proposed.

The full set of quantum $(\pm)$associators for the product of three operators is offered. An algorithm for the calculation of some $(\pm)$associators for the product of some four operators is offered. The possible generalization of Hamilton&#39;s equations for a non-associative quantum theory is proposed. Some arguments are given that a non-associative quantum theory can be a fundamental unifying theory.Save to LibraryDownloadby Vladimir Dzhunushaliev•  6  Mathematics, Associative Algebra, Physics, Quantum PhysicsConformal invariant strings with extrinsic curvature actionWe study a string theory which is exclusively based on extrinsic curvature action.

It is a tensionless string theory because the action reduces to perimeter for the flat Wilson loop. We are able to solve and quantize this high-derivative nonlinear two-dimensional conformal field theory. The absence of conformal anomaly in quantum theory requires that the space-time should be 13-dimensional. We have found that all particles, with arbitrary large spin, are massless. This pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionless character of the theory and we speculate that it may describe unbroken phase of standard string theory.Save to LibraryDownloadby George Savvidy•  8  Physics, Quantum Theory, String Theory, High Energy PhysicsYukawa couplings and masses of non-chiral states for the Standard Model on D6-branes on $ {T^{{6}}}/\mathbb{Z}_{{6}}^{\prime } $Save to LibraryDownloadby Gabriele Honecker•  3  High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciencesApplications for the scalable coherent interfaceSave to LibraryDownloadby David Gustavson•  6  Computer Architecture, High Energy Physics, Distributed Shared Memory System, Data acquisitionWhy Study Neutrino Oscillations?Neutrino oscillation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which neutrino flavor changes spontaneously to another flavor.

The branching ratios of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays of D0 meson are anomalous since the branching fraction of D0! m mÿ is observed to be suppressed relative to that of D0! K Kÿ by a factor of almost three [1], even though the phase space for the former is larger.

Thesis we concentrate on the study of the extension of the AdS/CFT correspondence to theories with less supersymmetry. In particular, we search for the possibility of adding supersymmetric D-branes in type IIB supergravity solutions which are dual to N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. In the probe approximation we perform a systematic analysis of the possible supersymmetric D-brane configurations in backgrounds dual to N=1 superconformal field theories, firstly in the AdS_5xY^{p,q} solutions and then in their generalisation to the AdS_5xL^{a,b,c} backgrounds. Some checks of the correspondence between D-brane configurations and chiral operators of the dual gauge theory are performed. We also analyse the possible supersymmetric D5-brane configurations dual to defects (of codimension one and two) in N=1 SYM theory in the framework of the Maldacena-Nunez solution.

This approach implements the correct degrees of freedom at high as well as low temperatures and densities. An effective Polyakov loop field serves as the order parameter for deconfinement. We employ a well-tested hadronic flavor-SU(3) model based on a chirally symmetric formulation that reproduces properties of ground state nuclear matter and yields good descriptions of nuclei and hypernuclei. Excluded volume effects simulating the finite size of the hadrons drive the transition to quarks at high temperatures and densities. We study the phase structure of the model and the transition to the quark gluon plasma and compare results to lattice gauge calculations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jan Steinheimer•  5  Quark Gluon Plasma, High Energy Physics, Order Parameter, Degree of FreedomFermion-fermion and boson-boson amplitudes: surprising similaritiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Valeriy Dvoeglazov•  7  Engineering, Quantum Field Theory, High Energy Physics, Physical sciencesFeasibility Study of the Time Reversal Symmetry Tests in Decay of Metastable Positronium Atoms with the J-PET DetectorThis article reports on the feasibility of testing of the symmetry under reversal in time in a purely leptonic system constituted by positronium atoms using the J-PET detector.

The present state of T symmetry tests is discussed with an emphasis on the scarcely explored sector of leptonic systems. Two possible strategies of searching for manifestations of T violation in nonvanishing angular correlations of final state observables in the decay of metastable triplet states of positronium available with J-PET are proposed and discussed. Results of a pilot measurement with J-PET and assessment of its performance in reconstruction of three-photon decays are shown along with an analysis of its impact on the sensitivity of the detector for the determination of T-violation sensitive observables.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pawel Moskal•  4  Physics, High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciencesFIMP and Muon (g-2) in a U(1)_L_μ-L_τ ModelThe tightening of the constraints on the standard thermal WIMP scenario has forced physicists to propose alternative dark matter (DM) models.

One of the most popular alternate explanations of the origin of DM is the non-thermal production of DM via freeze-in. In this scenario the DM never attains thermal equilibrium with the thermal soup because of its feeble coupling strength (∼ 10^-12) with the other particles in the thermal bath and is generally called the Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP). In this work, we present a gauged U(1)_L_μ-L_τ extension of the Standard Model (SM) which has a scalar FIMP DM candidate and can consistently explain the DM relic density bound. In addition, the spontaneous breaking of the U(1)_L_μ-L_τ gauge symmetry gives an extra massive neutral gauge boson Z_μτ which can explain the muon (g-2) data through its additional one-loop contribution to the process. Lastly, presence of three right-handed neutrinos enable the model to successfully explain t...Save to LibraryDownloadby Anirban Biswas•  3  High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciencesNoncommutative Finsler Geometry, Gauge Fields and GravityAbstractThe work extends the A.

We use wavelet coherence to analyze the correspondence between theoretical and experimental data. We examined the 1-D phase space of variable (the case -space). We also compared the wavelet coherence values for -space and -space. It was also shown that the values of the wavelet of coherence depend on the values of the parameters p and q. We discussed our new results for the comparison purpose and findings were in the good agreements.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohammad Ayaz Ahmad and +1Vyacheslav Lyashenko•  2  High Energy Physics, Wavelet Analysis and Subdivision AlgorithmsMapreduce for data intensive scientific analysesSave to LibraryDownloadby Geoffrey  Fox•  11  Parallel Algorithms, Parallel Programming, Data Analysis, High Energy PhysicsAnalytic continuation in QCD-like theories at finite density and finite isospinSave to LibraryDownloadby Leonardo Cosmai•  2  High Energy Physics, Lattice QCDObservational Consequences of a LandscapeSave to LibraryDownloadby Matthew Kleban•  6  High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciences, Lower BoundMHV Lagrangian for N = 4 super Yang-MillsHere we formulate two field redefinitions for N = 4 Super Yang-Mills in light cone superspace that generates only MHV vertices in the new Lagrangian.

Bars (hep-th/9503205) can be investigated by applying the mathematical methods of integral geometry on the Lobachevsky plane, developed previously by Gel&#39;fand, Graev and Vilenkin. All these methods can be used for finding the transformations, leaving the Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras invariant. The near-distance limit of the Conformal Field Theory of the SL(2, R) WZW model of strings on an ADS3 background can also be interpreted in terms of the Lobachevsky Geometry : the non - euclidean distance is conserved and the Lobachevsky formulae for the angle of parallelism is recovered. Some preliminary technique from integral geometry for inverting the modified integral representation for the Kac- Moody algebra has been demonstrated.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bogdan Dimitrov•  5  Quantum Cosmology, High Energy Physics, Conformal Field Theory, Euclidean DistancePhotoproduction at collider energies: from RHIC and HERA to the LHCWe present the mini-proceedings of the workshop on ``Photoproduction at collider energies: from RHIC and HERA to the LHC&#39;&#39; held at the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*, Trento)... moreWe present the mini-proceedings of the workshop on ``Photoproduction at collider energies: from RHIC and HERA to the LHC&#39;&#39; held at the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*, Trento) from January 15 to 19, 2007.

A non-compact real form of the E8 Lie algebra has G2 and F4 subalgebras which break down to strong su(3), electroweak su(2) x u(1), gravitational so(3,1), the frame-Higgs, and three generations of fermions related by triality.

Making use of the event-wise local maxima present in the scalograms, we try to identify the collective behavior in multiparticle production, if there is any. For the first time, the wavelet results are compared with a model prediction based on the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD), where we adopt a charge reassignment algorithm to modify the UrQMD events to mimic the Bose-Einstein type of correlation among identical mesons—a feature known to be the most dominating factor responsible for local cluster formation. Statistically significant deviations between the experiment and the simulation are interpreted in terms of nontrivial dynamics of multiparticle production.Save to LibraryDownloadby Amitabha Mukhopadhyay•  3  High Energy Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Physical sciencesA resolution of spacetime singularity and black hole paradoxes through avoidance of trapped surface formation in Einstein gravitySave to LibraryDownloadby Rituparno Goswami•  5  Quantum Cosmology, High Energy Physics, Gravitational Collapse, Black HoleQuantum criticality and black holesSave to LibraryDownloadby Subir Sachdev•  30  Materials Engineering, Condensed Matter Physics, Thermodynamics, MagnetohydrodynamicsDissipative superfluids, from cold atoms to quark matterSome results about dissipative processes in superfluids are presented.

We focus on fermionic superfluidity and restrict our analysis to the contribution of phonons to bulk viscosity, shear viscosity and thermal conductivity. At sufficiently low temperatures phonons give the dominant contribution to the transport coefficients if all the other low energy excitation of the system are gapped. We first consider a system of cold fermionic atoms close to the unitarity limit. Then we turn to the superfluid phase of quark matter that may be realized at high baryonic density.Save to LibraryDownloadby Cristina Manuel•  3  High Energy Physics, Thermal Conductivity, Quark MatterParallelization of geant4 using top-c and marshalgenSave to LibraryDownloadby Viet Canh Nguyen•  16  Object Oriented Programming, Physics, Parallel Programming, Monte Carlo SimulationNextLast »Related TopicsParticle PhysicsFollowFollowingTheoretical PhysicsFollowFollowingElementary Particle PhysicsFollowFollowingPhysicsFollowFollowingQuantum Field TheoryFollowFollowingTheoretical Particle PhysicsFollowFollowingCondensed Matter PhysicsFollowFollowingCosmology (Physics)FollowFollowingBeyond the Standard Model PhysicsFollowFollowingDark MatterFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
