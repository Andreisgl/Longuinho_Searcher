 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. 
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.
Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)
  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.
This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

"SOME PEOPLE wish to know why certain shop cease to
sell GNU/Linux-powered computers (or sub-notebooks with GNU/Linux),
or in some cases no longer make available GNU/Linux with comparable
hardware. The truth of the matter is that Microsoft systematically
sets the prices to deny GNU/Linux entry into the market.
"We have just pulled an antitrust exhibit which shows what
Microsoft is doing. As far as we are aware, this exhibit was never
published or used by the courts before. The full exhibit (2003)
[PDF] can be found as text at the bottom of this post. Here is the
gist:
"They are considering Mandrake, Debian, Red Hat and Open Office
because of their upfront costs. HP is quoting their system to
include both the Windows O/S ($80) and MS Works ($15) for an
overall software acquisition cost of $95 for the O/S and
Application Suite The Open Source alternatives are $8.50 for the
O/S of choice which is currently Madrake (Open Office is $0.00). As
you can see, we have a price delta of $85 between the MS solution
and the Open Source solution."
