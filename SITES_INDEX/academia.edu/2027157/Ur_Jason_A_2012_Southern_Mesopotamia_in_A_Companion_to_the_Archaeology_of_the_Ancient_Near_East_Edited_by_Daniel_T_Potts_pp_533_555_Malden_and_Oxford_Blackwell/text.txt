McDonal Institute for Archaeological Research. Cambridge.Negotiating Fragility in Ancient Mesopotamia: Arenas of Contestation and Institutions of Resistance2019 • Andrea Seri, Norman YoffeeIt is well-known that there is no Mesopotamia in the political sense of the term. Early Mesopotamia consisted in city-states, ephemeral regional states, and an overarching culture that made Mesopotamia above and beyond the constant internecine political struggles in the land. Armed conflicts among cities and resistance to ruling houses and their goals of regimenting economies and social organizations within cities are characteristic themes in Mesopotamian history. We trace the history of early Mesopotamia outside the “great estates” of temples and palaces and document the persistent powers, especially legal powers, of local authorities in cities and in the countryside. This is the stuff of Mesopotamian fragility.Download Free PDFView PDFHigh Resolution Imagery and the Recovery of Surface Architectural PatternsElizabeth C.
