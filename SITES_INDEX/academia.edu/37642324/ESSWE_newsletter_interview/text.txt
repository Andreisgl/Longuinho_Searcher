University of Amsterdam, 25-27 September 2013. Harald Szeemann (1933-2005) was one of the most prominent curators of his generation, having organized more than 150 art shows during a career that spanned almost 50 years. Far from being concerned only with contemporary art, he organically worked on a body of exhibitions characterized by a vivid interest for topics such as utopia, Gesamtkunstwerk, the history of intentions and obsessions, trying to build an European history of alternatives based on a multi-disciplinary approach and on the study of Art brut, psychoanalysis, pataphysics, religious devotion and, last but not least, Theosophy and Anthroposophy. In this context, a special role is played by his lifelong project of building a museum on Monte Verità, the hill in Ticino which hosted from the second part of the XIX century onwards different groups and colonies of anarchists, vegetarians, nudists, artists and life reformers. In my paper, I will address the role of Theosophy and Anthroposophy in Szeemann’s practice as a curator, as well as in his thinking about modern art, particularly focusing on the exhibitions in which he presented works by Rudolf Steiner, or had Theosophy as a central theme: the already mentioned Monte Verità (1978), Der Hang zum Gesamtkunstwerk (1983) andMoney&Value–The last taboo (2002), that represent mayor examples of mainstream temporary display of Theosophy-related material in the last decades. Special attention will be devoted also to the relationship and professional collaboration with Joseph Beuys, presented in 17 of Szeemann’s mayor exhibitions and considered by the curator to be the most important artist of the second half of the XX century, and to an unrealized project dated 1975, La Mamma, meant to focus on the idea of a feminine deity and to the body of women, which was supposed to present also the life and work of Helena Blavatsky and Annie Besant.Download Free PDFView PDF'Theosophy and orientalism in the artistic legacy of Nikolay Raynov (1889-1954): A belated polymath and Theosophic “heresiarch”’Yuri Stoyanov, Marco PasiDownload Free PDFView PDF'Theosophy, Occultism and Greek Symbolism: the Case of Frixos Aristeus'Victoria FerentinouThe interrelation between Symbolism and occultism was often articulated in the work of Symbolist poets, artists and critics in the turn-of-the-century Greece. Theosophy, in particular, is documented as one of their primary interests. Theosophical ideas were popularized and disseminated in Greece as early as the 1890s through periodicals that sought to acquaint the Greek readership with the cultural developments in France, Germany and other European countries. Moreover, in 1894 the socialist politician, author and academic Plato Drakoulis (1858-1934), who knew Helena P. Blavatsky personally, published Light from Within, the first book in Greek to elaborate on the main ideas of Theosophy as expounded by Blavatsky and Anna B. Kingsford. Drakoulis’s work had an impact upon Greek Symbolists who became intrigued by Theosophical ideas. Yet their interest was usually disguised, infiltrated through or sidelined by other belief systems and forms of religiosity, specific to the Greek milieu of the time, so that Theosophical concepts were not organically embedded in the dominant artistic discourse in Greece. Within this context there were few visual artists associated with Symbolism, who were more receptive to occultism and used ideas drawn from Theosophy and other occult currents for their purposes. An illustrative example is the painter and illustrator Frixos Aristeus (Greek: Φρίξος Αριστεύς, 1879-1951). Aristeus developed a friendship with the Greek author Polyvios T. Dimitrakopoulos (1864-1922), alias Paul Arcas, who was interested, inter alia, in spiritualism and Theosophy. Aristeus himself openly admitted that he believed in a pantheistic world, that he often communicated with ‘supernatural’ entities, and that his images were inspired by his ‘otherworldly’ visions, thus pointing to the supersensible origin of his Symbolist art. The first objective of this paper is to sketch out the peculiarities and complexities of the dissemination and appropriation of Theosophy in Greece at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries and briefly discuss its interaction specifically with the visual arts. The second aim is to trace the Theosophical ideas permeated in the work of Aristeus and explore the ways he revised and integrated his often superficial and eclectic understanding of Theosophy and occultism into his oeuvre.Download Free PDFView PDFESSWE News Letter 6 no. 1.
