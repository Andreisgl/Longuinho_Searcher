Hi all,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.32.3 and 1.31.3. These
releases primarily fixes two issues that were causing some users problems
when using composer and when upgrading from older versions of MediaWiki
if they were using the SQLite database backend. Some other minor fixes are
also included.
* (T226766) Remove jetbrains/phpstorm-stubs from composer dev dependancies.
* (T202211) Fix SQLite patch-(image|page|template)links-fix-pk.sql column
order.
