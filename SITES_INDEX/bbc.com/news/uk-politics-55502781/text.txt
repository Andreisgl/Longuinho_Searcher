Keep the light on."BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said there was a sense of relief in Brussels that the Brexit process was over, "but there is regret still at Brexit itself".The first lorries arriving at the borders entered the UK and EU without delay. On Friday evening, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that border traffic had been "low due to [the] bank holiday" but there had been no disruption in Kent as "hundreds" of lorries crossed the Channel with a "small" number turned back.Six freight loads travelling from Holyhead in Wales to Ireland had to be turned away due to not having the correct paperwork, the Stena Line ferry and port group said on Friday morning.But later on Friday, the group said freight traffic was flowing well through its ports and government customs systems were working well. It added that the fall in freight traffic after the Christmas and Brexit stockpiling period meant "it is too early to draw any conclusions", but the company remained "cautiously optimistic that, as freight volumes begin to rise again, we will be able to ensure the continued free movement of goods".What happens now that a deal's been done?A quick guide to what's in the Brexit dealBrexit: Seven things that will changeUK ministers have warned there will be some disruption in the coming days and weeks, as new rules bed in and British firms come to terms with the changes.But officials have insisted new border systems are "ready to go". As the first customs checks were completed after midnight, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said: "It all went fine, everything's running just as it was before 11pm."Northern Ireland has different arrangements from other parts of the UK, meaning there will be some customs checks on goods moving between Great Britain and the province.On Friday afternoon, the first ferry from Great Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland trading protocol docked in Belfast, on schedule at 13:45 GMT.Seamus Leheny, policy manager at Logistics UK, said six out of the 15 lorries that were on the first ship to arrive into Belfast were brought in for inspection, with one being kept at the port for more than three hours. "Inevitably there are going to be teething problems because with such a new, complex system as this there are going to be issues in the first few days," he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.

The UK officially left the 27-member political and economic bloc on 31 January, three and half years after the UK public voted to leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum.But it stuck to the EU's trading rules for 11 months while the two sides negotiated their future economic partnership.A treaty was finally agreed on Christmas Eve, and became law in the UK on Wednesday.Under the new arrangements, UK manufacturers will have tariff-free access to the EU's internal market, meaning there will be no import taxes on goods crossing between Britain and the continent.But it does mean more paperwork for businesses and people travelling to EU countries, while there is still uncertainty about what will happen to banking and services.The UK and Spain have also reached an agreement meaning the border between Gibraltar and Spain will remain open.Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister, said the deal still needed to be formalised, but by abolishing controls between Gibraltar and the EU's passport-free Schengen area, he said it would prevent queues at the border "which make people's lives a misery and make business difficult".It is a moment that some will regard with huge optimism, others with deep regret.And while this historic move happens at a moment in time, the impact, in some areas, may be less instant or obvious than others - for example, it's expected there'll be relatively little traffic at Dover on the first day of 2021 as new border checks kick in. Nevertheless, significant changes are here - whether on trade, travel, security or immigration - and those changes could well become more apparent in the months ahead. Mr Johnson - who took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister - said it was an "amazing moment" for the UK in his New Year message.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccinesWriting in the Daily Telegraph, he added that the combination of the Brexit deal and rollout of the Oxford vaccine means "we are creating the potential trampoline for the national bounceback".Lord Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, tweeted that Britain had become a "fully independent country again".And the deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbench MPs, David Jones, told the BBC: "We can now say clearly Britain is a sovereign and independent state."This Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

For all of those reasons and more, this is not the end of the EU-UK conversation for the foreseeable future.What is changing?The culmination of the Brexit process means major changes in different areas. These include: The free movement of people between the UK and EU countries has ended - and has been replaced in the UK by a "points-based" immigration systemAnyone from the UK who wants to stay in most of the EU for more than 90 days in any 180-day period now needs a visaDuty-free shopping has returned, with people coming back to the UK from the EU able to bring up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, four litres of spirits and 200 cigarettes without paying taxEU citizens wanting to move to the UK (except those from Ireland) face the same points-based system as people elsewhere in the worldUK police have lost instant access to EU-wide databases on criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.The key points of the dealWhat does the deal mean for fishing?
