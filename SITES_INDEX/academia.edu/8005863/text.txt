These include Baltic nouns with the suffixes -s(e)n-, -im-, -um- and -mē and Slavic nouns with the suffixes -sьm-, -sna- and -ьm-.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe inflexion of the Indo-European o-stems in Balto-SlavicFrederik KortlandtThe Balto-Slavic endings of the o-stems were sg. nom. *-os, acc. *-um, neuter nom.acc. *-o, *-um, gen. *-ō, dat. *-ōi, inst. *-oʔ, loc. *-oi, voc. *-e, pl. nom. *-oi, acc. *-oʔns, neuter nom.acc. *-aʔ, gen. *-um, dat. *-omus, inst. *-ōis, loc. *-oisu, du. nom.acc. masc. *-oʔ, neuter *-oi, gen. *-ōus, dat.inst. *-omoʔ, loc. *-ōu.Download Free PDFView PDFBaltisticaBaltic ē‑stems revisitedFrederik KortlandtDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Indo European StudiesFrom Proto-Indo-European to Slavic1994 • Frederik KortlandtDownload Free PDFView PDFOn Old Prussian poklausīmanas Some thoughts on the origin of the Proto-Balto-Slavic participial suffix *-maPawel  NowakIn Old Prussian there is one famous form, namely, poklausīmanas "heard, answered". The reason for its renown is that it is regarded by some to be a present passive participle, and, by the same token, directly continue the Proto-Indo-European medio-passive participle in *-mh1no- as reflected e.g. in Vedic -māna- and Greek -μενο-. However, such a supposition is problematic in a few regards. Firstly, Baltic, like Slavic, knows only present passive participle in -m-, which makes the Old Prussian form, at the very least, enigmatic. Secondly, if OPr. -manas truly reflects the ancestral PIE morpheme, it sheds doubts on the validity of the hitherto reconstructed Proto-Balto-Slavic participial suffix *-ma as reflecting PIE *-mh1no-. In the present paper it is argued that Old Prussian poklausīmanas indeed is a present passive participle and that the suffix -mana- does in fact derive from an earlier *-mna- which, in turn, continues PIE *-mh1no-. As for the shape of the Old Prussian suffix, it is proposed that -mana- contains a secondary anaptyctic vowel as suggested by other evidence. Furthermore, some light is shed on the possibility of reconstructing the Proto-Balto-Slavic participial suffix not as *-ma- but rather as *-mna-, which would be more consistent with the shape of the reconstructed PIE suffix from which it derives.Download Free PDFView PDFReconstructing Balto-Slavic and Indo-EuropeanFrederik KortlandtThe history of Indo-European studies shows that the reconstruction of the proto-language is likely to have a bias toward the languages on which it relies primarily. It has always been popular to explain the data of more recently attested languages from a reconstruction on the basis of the oldest known languages. As an offshoot of this methodology, there have been attempts to derive the attested data from a postulated system which is beyond what can be reconstructed by the comparative method, often under the assumption that the original system was more regular than what can actually be reconstructed. It is argued that this methodology is wrong and that reconstructions must always be bottom-up, never top-down. The postulation of an Indo-European gen.pl. ending *-ōm has given rise to a whole series of additional hypotheses in order to account for the Italic, Celtic, Germanic and Balto-Slavic data. The reconstruction of a short ending *-om on the basis of Slavic -ъ, Lith. -ų and Prussian -on offers an explanation for the Gothic endings -e and -o, for the short endings of Celtic and Italic, for the circumflex of Greek -ῶν and the disyllabic ending *-aHam of Indo-Iranian, and for the pronominal endings of Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic, all of which can be derived from old neuter forms in *-om which were first used as possessives in predicative constructions.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Slavic LinguisticsNorth Slavic -ě vs. South Slavic -ę: a problem of forward reconstruction2019 • Ronald I KimThe long problematic correspondence of North Slavic -ě ~ South Slavic -ę in the jo-stem accusative plural and jā-stem genitive singular and nominative and accusative plural is best explained by positing a Proto-Slavic contrast within the soft jā-stems between gen. sg., nom. pl. *-ē and acc. pl. *-ę̄ , which was leveled in different directions as NSl -ě and SSl -ę. With its nasal vowel, the acc. pl. ending must go back to *-jāns, thereby demonstrating that the PIE eh2-stem desinence *-eh2s > *-ās was remade to *-āns after the other declensional classes in the early prehistory of Slavic. The Baltic facts are consistent with a Proto-Balto-Slavic date for this innovation.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Proto-Indo-European ū-stems on the basis of Slavic, Indo-Iranian and Greek2020 • Sander van HesThe *-uH-stems present a problematic category in Proto-Indo-European, not only in view of their scarcity, but also their derivational characteristics-or, as it turns out, lack thereof-and ablaut paradigm. This study examines the ū-stems on the basis of these three parameters in the branches in which they are best represented: Slavic, Indo-Iranian and Greek. The results of the study suggest that the ū-stems had their origin in root nouns with root-final *-uH and that they were probably a recent creation within Proto-Indo-European. In support of this conclusion, a new etymology is proposed for PIE *su̯ eḱruH-'mother-in-law', as a compound of su̯ e-'own' and *kruH-'blood'. Seen in this light, this compound may have formed the nucleus for the creation of the ū-stems in Indo-European.Download Free PDFView PDF1970. “On some old Balto-Slavic isoglosses”.

On the one hand, verbs with an infinitive in -ěti represent earlier perfects, statives, optatives, duratives, and athematic i-presents, corresponding to Lithuanian verbs in -ėti with an i-present. These verbs regularly belong to accent class (c) in Slavic, reflecting original accentual mobility. On the other hand, verbs with an infinitive in -iti represent original causatives, iteratives and denominatives and correspond to Lithuanian causatives and iteratives in -yti, present -o, and -inti, present -ina. As a rule, the Slavic causatives and iteratives belong to accent classes (a) or (b) and the denominatives to the accent class of the noun from which they are derived. The Slavic duratives and iteratives correspond to the Lithuanian i- and o-presents, respectively, whereas the denominatives in -iti, -ěti, -ati and -ovati correspond to the Lith. derived thematic ja-presents. The derivation of the o-presents from a paradigm 3rd sg. *stastāti, 3rd pl. *stastinti explains the fact that the Slavic causatives and iteratives belong to accent classes (a) and (b), not (c). The Slavic imperfect, e.g. OCS veděaxъ, veděaše, represents a nominal ē-stem followed by the perfect of the verb ‘to be’. The ē-stem is also found in the Baltic preterit, e.g. Lith. vẽdė. The Slavic jā-stems represent original jā-stems as well as PIE proterodynamic ī/jā- and ī/jē-stems while PIE hysterodynamic ī/jā- and ī/jē-stems are reflected as Slavic ьjā-stems.Download Free PDFView PDFProto-Indo-European *-os in SlavicThomas OlanderOpinions are divided on whether the phonetically regular outcome of pre-Proto-Slavic *‑as (from Proto-Indo-European *‑os) is ‑o or ‑ъ in the attested Slavic dialects. The masc. nom. sg. ending ‑e in the Old Novgorod dialect opens up for a renewed discussion. In this study it is argued that pre-Proto-Slavic *‑as yielded Proto-Slavic *‑ə which is reflected as ‑ъ in all Slavic dialects except the Novgorod dialect where it yielded ‑e. Furthermore it is proposed that pre-Proto-Slavic *‑ās (from Proto-Indo-European *‑ah₂s, *‑ah₂as) regularly became Proto-Slavic *‑ə̄ which yielded ‑y in most of Slavic, but ‑ě in the Old Novgorod dialect.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
