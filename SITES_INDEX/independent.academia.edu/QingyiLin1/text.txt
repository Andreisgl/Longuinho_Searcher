Firstly, we evaluated the efficiency of three storage solutions to preserve porcine zygotes at 25°C for 24 h. Two of these were commercially available defined media for cell storage (Cell-W and Cell-S), and the third was fetal bovine serum (FBS). Thereafter, we examined the effects of storing the zygotes in the Cell-W solution for 24-72 h at 25°C. The Cell-W solution was the most efficient for 24 h storage of porcine zygotes at 25°C, with no apparent effects on blastocyst quality. However, short-term storage of porcine zygotes for 24 h reduced the blastocyst formation rate compared with the fresh control group. As storage duration increased from 24 to 48 or 72 h, blastocyst formation rates were significantly decreased from 11.3% to 4.4% and 0%, respectively. In conclusion, during zygote storage, the developmental competence to the blastocyst stage decreased with time. Storage of zygotes in chemically defined media did not affect blastocyst quality, but the storage in 100% serum had an adverse effect on developing embryos causing apoptosis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This method should be further developed, and a combination of EP and MI methods should be evaluated in pigs. This study aimed to determine that a combination of microinjection (MI) and EP of CRISPR/Cas9 system could increase the rates of biallelic mutation for triple-gene knockout in porcine blastocysts. We targeted the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox1 (PDX1) gene using cytoplasmic MI 1 h before or after EP, which was used to edit alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) and cytidine 32 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) genes in porcine zygotes.

We evaluated the effects of new chemically defined media (cell wash and preservation solution, Cellstor®-W [Cell-W] and cell suspension and preservation solution, Cellstor®-S [Cell-S]) for short-term storage. In the first experiment, in vitro-derived blastocyst were stored at 25ºC for 24 h in Cell-W solution, Cell-S-Solution, and pig embryo culture (PBM) medium. There were no differences in the rates of survival and development of stored blastocysts between the Cell-S and Cell-W solutions, but the total cell number of embryos that survived after storage in Cell-S solution was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that in the Cell-W solution. In the second experiment, Cell-S solution was used to store the in vitro-derived blastocysts at 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. Storage at 20°C resulted in a significant decrease in the rates of survival and development of stored blastocysts compared to storage at 25°C or 30°C. No differences in survival and development rates were observed between storage at 25°C and 30°C, but the damage to the embryo quality after storage and culture was significantly lower at 25°C than at 30°C. In the third experiment, Cell-S solution was supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol and curcumin, either alone or in combination, as antioxidant agents. Although the supplementation with curcumin did not improve survival, it significantly increased the development rate of stored blastocysts compared with the control blastocysts stored without antioxidants. In conclusion, when porcine blastocysts were stored at 25°C for 24 h, a Cell-S solution may be effective for maintaining the survival and development of in vitro embryos.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For this, we evaluated the effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and insulin–transferrin–selenium (ITS) supplementation either alone or in combination during oocyte in vitro maturation on the quality of porcine blastocysts and the embryonic development after injection of mouse iPS cells. Our results demonstrate that, prior to injection of mouse iPS cells, CGA or ITS supplementation either alone or in combination had no effects on the rates of oocyte maturation, oocyte DNA fragmentation, fertilization, and blastocyst formation. However, the combination of CGA and ITS significantly increased the total cell number in blastocysts compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). When mouse iPS cells were injected into porcine blastocysts, CGA supplementation either alone or in combination with ITS had a beneficial effect on the development of interspecies chimera blastocysts. In conclusion, our results indicate that supplementation of maturation medium with a combination of CGA and ITS enhances the ability of porcine oocytes to develop interspecies chimera blastocysts following iPS cell injection.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Various concentrations (0-2 µM) of Scr7 were evaluated; all concentrations of Scr7 including 0 µM resulted in the generation of blastocysts with a point mutation and the wild-type sequence or indels. No significant differences in the blastocyst formation rates of electroporated zygotes were observed among ssODN homology arm lengths, irrespective of the gRNA (gRNA1 and gRNA2). The proportion of blastocysts carrying a point mutation with or without the wild-type sequence and indels was significantly higher in the ssODN20 group (i.e., the group with a ssODN homology arm of 20 bp) than in the ssODN60 group (gRNA1: 25.7% vs. 5.4% and gRNA2: 45.5% vs. 5.9%, p &lt; .05). In conclusion, the CRISPR/Cas9 delivery with ssODN via electroporation is feasible for the generation of point mutations in porcine embryos.

Effects of individual or in‐combination antioxidant supplementation during in vitro maturation culture on the developmental competence and quality of porcine embryosReproduction in Domestic Animals,  2021The oocyte maturation process requires a high supply of energy, which generates reactive oxygen s... more The oocyte maturation process requires a high supply of energy, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), adversely affecting oocyte and embryo development. Balancing ROS by antioxidant supplementation is essential for maintaining oocyte maturation and embryonic quality in vitro. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of four antioxidants: β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), chlorogenic acid (CGA), curcumin, and sericin, when applied individually or in combinations, during oocyte maturation on development of porcine oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected, cultured in maturation medium supplemented with antioxidants for 44 h, and subsequently subjected to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and culture for 7 days. Combining all four (β-ME+CGA+curcumin+sericin) or three (β-ME+CGA+curcumin) antioxidants increased blastocyst formation rates. However, sericin supplementation alone, or in combination with β-ME or CGA, failed to improve blastocyst formation rates. The total cell numbers of blastocysts from the group supplemented with three antioxidants (β-ME+CGA+curcumin) were significantly higher than those from the other groups, except for the curcumin-supplement group. There were no differences in the maturation rates and proportions of oocytes with fragmented DNA between the antioxidant-supplemented and the non-supplemented control groups. In conclusion, supplementation with three antioxidants (β-ME+CGA+curcumin) during the maturation culture enhanced blastocyst formation and improved blastocyst quality.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study, the effects of ZP treatment before electroporation on embryonic development and gene editing in porcine embryos were evaluated. Methods The ZP of zygotes was weakened or removed by exposure to 0.5% actinase E, followed by electroporation of the Cas9 protein with guide RNA targeting GGTA1. Results The blastocyst formation rate of ZP‐free zygotes after electroporation was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of ZP‐intact zygotes. The mutation rate in blastocysts from ZP‐weakened zygotes was similar to that in ZP‐intact zygotes, whereas ZP removal increased the mutation rate. The mutation efficiency in blastocysts from electroporated zygotes did not differ among ZP treatment groups. Conclusions Our results indicate that weakening the ZP does not affect the developmental competence, mutation rate, or mutation efficiency of electroporated zygotes, whereas ZP removal has a detrimental effect on embryonic development but may increase the mutation rate.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the gene editing efficiency is inadequate. The aim of this study was to improve the lipofection-mediated gene editing efficiency by optimizing the timing and duration of lipofection. Results Zona pellucida (ZP)-free zygotes collected at 5, 10, and 15 h from the start of in vitro fertilization (IVF) were incubated with lipofection reagent, guide RNA (gRNA) targeting GGTA1, and Cas9 for 5 h. Lipofection of zygotes collected at 10 and 15 h from the start of IVF yielded mutant blastocysts. Next, ZP-free zygotes collected at 10 h from the start of IVF were incubated with lipofection reagent, gRNA, and Cas9 for 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 h. The blastocyst formation rate of zygotes treated for 20 h was significantly lower (p Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, how this system functions in mammalian oocytes and embryos remains unclear. The present study was conducted to clarify whether blastocyst genome editing can be performed by treatment with lipofection reagent, guide RNA, and Cas9 for 5 h without using electroporation or microinjection. A mosaic mutation was observed in blastocysts derived from zona pellucida (ZP)-free oocytes following lipofection treatment, regardless of the target genes. When lipofection treatment was performed after in vitro fertilization (IVF), no significant differences in the mutation rates or mutation efficiency were found between blastocysts derived from embryos treated at 24 and 29 h from the start of IVF. Only blastocysts from embryos exposed to lipofection treatment at 29 h after IVF co...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Curcumin supplementation was performed at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 µM. At concentrations of 5–20 µM, curcumin had significant positive effects (P &lt; 0.05) on maturation and fertilisation rates compared to the non-treated group. Of the groups cultured with 5–20 µM curcumin, the number of oocytes with DNA-fragmented nuclei after IVM was significantly lower than in groups matured without curcumin. Moreover, curcumin supplementation at 10 µM also gave a significantly higher rate of blastocyst formation compared with oocytes matured without curcumin. Increasing the curcumin concentration to 40 µM yielded negative effects on fertilisation and embryonic development compared with the groups treated with lower concentrations of curcumin.

First, we evaluated and selected guide RNAs (gRNAs) by analyzing blastocyst formation rates and genome editing efficiency. This was performed in embryos electroporated with one of three different gRNAs targeting IL2RG or one of two gRNAs targeting GHR. No significant differences in embryo development rates were found between control embryos and those subjected to electroporation, irrespective of the target gene. Two gRNAs targeting IL2RG (nos. 2 and 3) contributed to an increased biallelic mutation rate in porcine blastocysts compared with gRNA no. 1. There were no significant differences in the mutation rates between the two gRNAs targeting GHR. In our next experiment, the mutation efficiency and the development of embryos simultaneously electroporated with gRNAs targeting IL2RG and GHR were investigated. Similar embryo development rates were observed between embryos electroporated with two gRNAs and control embryos. When IL2RG-targeting gRNA no. 2 was used with GHR-targeting gRNAs no. 1 or no. 2, a significantly higher double biallelic mutation rate was observed than with IL2RG-targeting gRNA no. 3. In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of using electroporation to transfer multiple gRNAs and Cas9 into porcine zygotes, enabling the double biallelic mutation of multiple genes with favorable embryo survival.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the... more The CRISPR/Cas9 system now allows for unprecedented possibilities of genome editing. However, there are some limitations, including achieving efficient one-step multiple genome targeting to save costs, time, and ensure high quality. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of one-step multiple gene modification by electroporation in porcine zygotes using pooled guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting CMAH, GHR, GGTA1, and PDX1. We first selected the best-performing gRNA from three different designs for each gene based on the effect on embryo development and mutation efficiency. The three gRNAs showed equivalent effects on the rates of blastocyst formation in each targeted gene; however, gRNAs CMAH #2, GHR #3, GGTA1 #3, and PDX1 #3 showed the highest biallelic mutation rate, although the total mutation rate of PDX1 #3 was significantly lower than that of PDX1 #1. Therefore, CMAH #2, GHR #3, GGTA1 #3, and PDX1 #1 were used as a mixture in electroporation to further clarify whether multiple genes can be targeted simultaneously. Individual sequencing of 43 blastocysts at the target sites of each gene showed mutations in one and two target genes in twenty-four (55.8%) and nine (20.9%) blastocysts, respectively. No mutation was detected in any target gene in ten (23.3%) blastocysts and no blastocysts had a mutation in three or more target genes. These results indicate that electroporation could effectively deliver multiple gRNAs and Cas9 protein into porcine zygotes to target multiple genes in a one-step process. However, the technique requires further development to increase the success rate of multiple gene modification.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Given the limited time window for delivery, faster and more reliable methods to introduce Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) into target embryos are needed. In pigs, somatic cell nuclear transfer using gene-modified somatic cells and the direct introduction of gene editors into the cytoplasm of zygotes/embryos by microinjection or electroporation have been used to generate gene-edited embryos; however, these strategies require expensive equipment and sophisticated techniques. In this study, we developed a novel lipofection-mediated RNP transfection technique that does not require specialized equipment for the generation of gene-edited pigs and produced no detectable off-target events. In particular, we determined the concentration of lipofection reagent for efficient RNP delivery into embryos and successful...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the first experiment, in vitro-derived blastocyst were stored at 25ºC for 24 h in Cell-W solution, Cell-S-Solution, and pig embryo culture (PBM) medium. There were no differences in the rates of survival and development of stored blastocysts between the Cell-S and Cell-W solutions, but the total cell number of embryos that survived after storage in Cell-S solution was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that in the Cell-W solution. In the second experiment, Cell-S solution was used to store the in vitro-derived blastocysts at 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. Storage at 20°C resulted in a significant decrease in the rates of survival and development of stored blastocysts compared to storage at 25°C or 30°C. No differences in survival and development rates were observed between storage at 25°C and 30°C, but the damage to the embryo quality after storage and culture was significantly lower at 25°C than at 30°C. In the third experiment, Cell-S solution was supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol and curcumin, either alone or in combination, as antioxidant agents. Although the supplementation with curcumin did not improve survival, it significantly increased the development rate of stored blastocysts compared with the control blastocysts stored without antioxidants. In conclusion, when porcine blastocysts were stored at 25°C for 24 h, a Cell-S solution may be effective for maintaining the survival and development of in vitro embryos.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Introduction of a point mutation in the KRAS gene of in vitro fertilized porcine zygotes via electroporation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with single‐stranded oligodeoxynucleotidesAnimal Science Journal,  2021This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of KRAS gene editing via CRISPR/Cas9 delivery by e... more This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of KRAS gene editing via CRISPR/Cas9 delivery by electroporation and analyzed the effects of the non-homologous end-joining pathway inhibitor Scr7 and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) homology arm length on introducing a point mutation in KRAS. Various concentrations (0-2 µM) of Scr7 were evaluated; all concentrations of Scr7 including 0 µM resulted in the generation of blastocysts with a point mutation and the wild-type sequence or indels. No significant differences in the blastocyst formation rates of electroporated zygotes were observed among ssODN homology arm lengths, irrespective of the gRNA (gRNA1 and gRNA2). The proportion of blastocysts carrying a point mutation with or without the wild-type sequence and indels was significantly higher in the ssODN20 group (i.e., the group with a ssODN homology arm of 20 bp) than in the ssODN60 group (gRNA1: 25.7% vs. 5.4% and gRNA2: 45.5% vs. 5.9%, p &lt; .05). In conclusion, the CRISPR/Cas9 delivery with ssODN via electroporation is feasible for the generation of point mutations in porcine embryos. Further studies are required to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the homology-directed repair.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Effects of individual or in‐combination antioxidant supplementation during in vitro maturation culture on the developmental competence and quality of porcine embryosReproduction in Domestic Animals,  2021The oocyte maturation process requires a high supply of energy, which generates reactive oxygen s... more The oocyte maturation process requires a high supply of energy, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), adversely affecting oocyte and embryo development. Balancing ROS by antioxidant supplementation is essential for maintaining oocyte maturation and embryonic quality in vitro. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of four antioxidants: β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), chlorogenic acid (CGA), curcumin, and sericin, when applied individually or in combinations, during oocyte maturation on development of porcine oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected, cultured in maturation medium supplemented with antioxidants for 44 h, and subsequently subjected to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and culture for 7 days. Combining all four (β-ME+CGA+curcumin+sericin) or three (β-ME+CGA+curcumin) antioxidants increased blastocyst formation rates. However, sericin supplementation alone, or in combination with β-ME or CGA, failed to improve blastocyst formation rates. The total cell numbers of blastocysts from the group supplemented with three antioxidants (β-ME+CGA+curcumin) were significantly higher than those from the other groups, except for the curcumin-supplement group. There were no differences in the maturation rates and proportions of oocytes with fragmented DNA between the antioxidant-supplemented and the non-supplemented control groups. In conclusion, supplementation with three antioxidants (β-ME+CGA+curcumin) during the maturation culture enhanced blastocyst formation and improved blastocyst quality.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study, the effects of ZP treatment before electroporation on embryonic development and gene editing in porcine embryos were evaluated. Methods The ZP of zygotes was weakened or removed by exposure to 0.5% actinase E, followed by electroporation of the Cas9 protein with guide RNA targeting GGTA1. Results The blastocyst formation rate of ZP‐free zygotes after electroporation was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of ZP‐intact zygotes. The mutation rate in blastocysts from ZP‐weakened zygotes was similar to that in ZP‐intact zygotes, whereas ZP removal increased the mutation rate. The mutation efficiency in blastocysts from electroporated zygotes did not differ among ZP treatment groups. Conclusions Our results indicate that weakening the ZP does not affect the developmental competence, mutation rate, or mutation efficiency of electroporated zygotes, whereas ZP removal has a detrimental effect on embryonic development but may increase the mutation rate.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Timing and duration of lipofection-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 delivery into porcine zygotes affect gene-editing eventsBMC Research Notes,  2021Objective Lipofection-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in porcine zygotes provides... more Objective Lipofection-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in porcine zygotes provides a simple method for gene editing, without requiring micromanipulation. However, the gene editing efficiency is inadequate. The aim of this study was to improve the lipofection-mediated gene editing efficiency by optimizing the timing and duration of lipofection. Results Zona pellucida (ZP)-free zygotes collected at 5, 10, and 15 h from the start of in vitro fertilization (IVF) were incubated with lipofection reagent, guide RNA (gRNA) targeting GGTA1, and Cas9 for 5 h. Lipofection of zygotes collected at 10 and 15 h from the start of IVF yielded mutant blastocysts. Next, ZP-free zygotes collected at 10 h from the start of IVF were incubated with lipofection reagent, gRNA, and Cas9 for 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 h. The blastocyst formation rate of zygotes treated for 20 h was significantly lower (p Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, how this system functions in mammalian oocytes and embryos remains unclear. The present study was conducted to clarify whether blastocyst genome editing can be performed by treatment with lipofection reagent, guide RNA, and Cas9 for 5 h without using electroporation or microinjection. A mosaic mutation was observed in blastocysts derived from zona pellucida (ZP)-free oocytes following lipofection treatment, regardless of the target genes. When lipofection treatment was performed after in vitro fertilization (IVF), no significant differences in the mutation rates or mutation efficiency were found between blastocysts derived from embryos treated at 24 and 29 h from the start of IVF. Only blastocysts from embryos exposed to lipofection treatment at 29 h after IVF co...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Comparison of the effects of introducing the CRISPR/Cas9 system by microinjection and electroporation into porcine embryos at different stagesBMC Research Notes,  2021Objective Cytoplasmic microinjection and electroporation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into zygotes a... more Objective Cytoplasmic microinjection and electroporation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into zygotes are used for generating genetically modified pigs. However, these methods create mosaic mutations in embryos. In this study, we evaluated whether the gene editing method and embryonic stage for gene editing affect the gene editing efficiency of porcine embryos. Results First, we designed five guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the B4GALNT2 gene and evaluated mutation efficiency by introducing each gRNA with Cas9 protein into zygotes by electroporation. Next, the optimized gRNA with Cas9 protein was introduced into 1-cell and 2-cell stage embryos by either microinjection or electroporation. The sequence of gRNA affected the bi-allelic mutation rate and mutation efficiency of blastocysts derived from electroporated embryos. Microinjection significantly decreased the cleavage rates in each embryonic stage and blastocyst formation rates in 2-cell stage embryos compared with electroporation (p &lt; ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Curcumin supplementation in the maturation medium improves the maturation, fertilisation and developmental competence of porcine oocytesActa Veterinaria Hungarica,  2020This study was conducted to determine the effects of supplementing the maturation medium with the... more This study was conducted to determine the effects of supplementing the maturation medium with the antioxidant curcumin on the in vitro maturation (IVM), fertilisation and development of porcine oocytes. Curcumin supplementation was performed at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 µM. At concentrations of 5–20 µM, curcumin had significant positive effects (P &lt; 0.05) on maturation and fertilisation rates compared to the non-treated group. Of the groups cultured with 5–20 µM curcumin, the number of oocytes with DNA-fragmented nuclei after IVM was significantly lower than in groups matured without curcumin. Moreover, curcumin supplementation at 10 µM also gave a significantly higher rate of blastocyst formation compared with oocytes matured without curcumin. Increasing the curcumin concentration to 40 µM yielded negative effects on fertilisation and embryonic development compared with the groups treated with lower concentrations of curcumin. Supplementation with 10 µM curcumin had...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

First, we evaluated and selected guide RNAs (gRNAs) by analyzing blastocyst formation rates and genome editing efficiency. This was performed in embryos electroporated with one of three different gRNAs targeting IL2RG or one of two gRNAs targeting GHR. No significant differences in embryo development rates were found between control embryos and those subjected to electroporation, irrespective of the target gene. Two gRNAs targeting IL2RG (nos. 2 and 3) contributed to an increased biallelic mutation rate in porcine blastocysts compared with gRNA no. 1. There were no significant differences in the mutation rates between the two gRNAs targeting GHR. In our next experiment, the mutation efficiency and the development of embryos simultaneously electroporated with gRNAs targeting IL2RG and GHR were investigated. Similar embryo development rates were observed between embryos electroporated with two gRNAs and control embryos. When IL2RG-targeting gRNA no. 2 was used with GHR-targeting gRNAs no. 1 or no. 2, a significantly higher double biallelic mutation rate was observed than with IL2RG-targeting gRNA no. 3. In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of using electroporation to transfer multiple gRNAs and Cas9 into porcine zygotes, enabling the double biallelic mutation of multiple genes with favorable embryo survival.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, there are some limitations, including achieving efficient one-step multiple genome targeting to save costs, time, and ensure high quality. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of one-step multiple gene modification by electroporation in porcine zygotes using pooled guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting CMAH, GHR, GGTA1, and PDX1. We first selected the best-performing gRNA from three different designs for each gene based on the effect on embryo development and mutation efficiency. The three gRNAs showed equivalent effects on the rates of blastocyst formation in each targeted gene; however, gRNAs CMAH #2, GHR #3, GGTA1 #3, and PDX1 #3 showed the highest biallelic mutation rate, although the total mutation rate of PDX1 #3 was significantly lower than that of PDX1 #1. Therefore, CMAH #2, GHR #3, GGTA1 #3, and PDX1 #1 were used as a mixture in electroporation to further clarify whether multiple genes can be targeted simultaneously. Individual sequencing of 43 blastocysts at the target sites of each gene showed mutations in one and two target genes in twenty-four (55.8%) and nine (20.9%) blastocysts, respectively. No mutation was detected in any target gene in ten (23.3%) blastocysts and no blastocysts had a mutation in three or more target genes. These results indicate that electroporation could effectively deliver multiple gRNAs and Cas9 protein into porcine zygotes to target multiple genes in a one-step process. However, the technique requires further development to increase the success rate of multiple gene modification.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Given the limited time window for delivery, faster and more reliable methods to introduce Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) into target embryos are needed. In pigs, somatic cell nuclear transfer using gene-modified somatic cells and the direct introduction of gene editors into the cytoplasm of zygotes/embryos by microinjection or electroporation have been used to generate gene-edited embryos; however, these strategies require expensive equipment and sophisticated techniques. In this study, we developed a novel lipofection-mediated RNP transfection technique that does not require specialized equipment for the generation of gene-edited pigs and produced no detectable off-target events. In particular, we determined the concentration of lipofection reagent for efficient RNP delivery into embryos and successful...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
