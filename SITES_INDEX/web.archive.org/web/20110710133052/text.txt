Tobago's Business & Economy
Tobago's economy branches out from tourism Tobago’s  economy is almost equally divided between the public sector/civil service (particularly local and central government) and tourism, each accounting for about 50% of the workforce. The global economic climate, including a new travel tax implemented  in the UK, has significantly impacted the tourism industry.The Airports Authority tallied international visitor air arrivals to Tobago  at 56,517 for 2008, down 15% from 66,266 in 2007. Arrivals have no halved since then in the wake of the global economic downturn. Tobago has also  suffered from inflationary pressures over the last few years,  particularly in the area of food prices. While the tourism industry is  expected to recover and rebound strongly after the downturn, economic  diversification is not only desirable but necessary.            To  this end, the much-publicised Cove Eco-Industrial Estate and Business  Park (CEIDP), brainchild of the Tobago House of Assembly (THA), is  nearing completion. Promoting light industry, CEIDP will accommodate  knowledge-based industry including information technology, light  manufacturing, agro-processing and export as well as selected downstream  activities related to natural gas. It will also house a  receiving/metering facility for natural gas from Trinidad. Investment  is encouraged through various tax holidays, incentives and exemptions,  including those on import duty. Additional incentives apply to the  export-processing zone. Potential investors are invited to apply for  space in the business park and can contact Vernie Shield, Chairman,  Tobago Division of the T&T Chamber of Commerce, for information  concerning investment in Tobago.Further developments will result from a major natural gas discovery in  January 2008. Reports estimate Petro-Canada’s Cassra 1 Well, 14 miles  off Tobago’s northwest coast, could yield between 0.6 and 1.3 trillion  cubic feet of natural gas. Meanwhile, the most fertile investment atmosphere for medium to large businesses is still tourism, though the entrepreneurial sector has plenty of scope for expansion.If you’re looking to do business, a good place to start is the Chamber of Commerce. Official Tobagonian business hours are Monday to Friday 8am–4:30pm.   Some business contacts Cove Eco-Industrial &      Business Park, Tobago House of Assembly (Scarborough): 631-2683,      www.tobagocove.comTobago Hotel & Tourism      Association (Carnbee): 639-9543, www.tobagohoteltourism.comTobago House of Assembly: www.tha.gov.ttTrinidad & Tobago Chamber      of Industry & Commerce: Tobago Division (Scarborough): 639-2669, www.chamber.org.ttTrinidad & Tobago      Entertainment Company: 624-0514,      www.ttentonline.comTrinidad & Tobago Film      Company: 625-FILM (3456),      www.trinidadandtobagofilm.comTrinidad & Tobago Government Portal: www.gov.tt
