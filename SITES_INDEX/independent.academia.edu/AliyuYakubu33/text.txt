As such, anaerobic treatment technologies are being considered to lower net energy costs by reducing air use and increasing methane production. To assess the amenability of PCP wastes to anaerobic treatment, methane yields and rates were quantified in different anaerobic reactors treating typical PCP wastes, including wastes from shampoo and hair colorant products. Overall, shampoo wastes were more amenable to methanogenesis with almost double the methane yields compared with colour wastes. To assess relevant microbial guilds, qPCR was performed on reactor biomass samples. Methanosaetaceae abundances were always significantly higher than Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomicrobiales abundances (P &lt;...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The beta-burr type v distribution: its properties and application to real life dataInternational Journal of Advanced Statistics and Probability,  2017A new distribution called the beta-Burr type V distribution that extends the Burr type V distribu... more A new distribution called the beta-Burr type V distribution that extends the Burr type V distribution was defined, investigated and estab-lished. The properties examined provide a comprehensive mathematical treatment of the distribution. Additionally, various structural proper-ties of the new distribution verified include probability density function verification, asymptotic behavior, Hazard Rate Function and the cumulative distribution. Subsequently, we used the maximum likelihood estimation procedure to estimate the parameters of the new distribu-tion. Application of real data set indicates that this new distribution would serve as a good alternative distribution function to model real- life data in many areas.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
