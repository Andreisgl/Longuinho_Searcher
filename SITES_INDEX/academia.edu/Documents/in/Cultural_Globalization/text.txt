Concomitantly, the politics of identity, operating at local-political and global-commercial stages, propel the search for origins and the production of essential identities, leading to the revitalization and orthodoxy of folk religions as well as their folklorization, following a local—though globally pervasive—heritage discourse.  Why glocal spirituality? My main argument is that both these forces—the actual insertion into global circulations that promote a high degree of ritual eclecticism and the local demand for an essential Puerto Rican national identity that promote orthodoxy—work in tandem creating a complex set of conditions for ritual practice and meaning.How can these apparently contradictory processes be theorized within folklore studies? From a historic-pragmatic perspective to ritual and through an intimate ethnographic account that traces the encounters between practitioners, clients and suppliers of ritual goods, I will show how these two processes work in tandem. That is, without an a-priori public recognition of brujos (witch-healers) as repositories of Puerto Rican wisdom (in the context of the unresolved neocolonial political status of the island), the fame and celebrity that enabled the open incorporation of African based rituals, of bureaucratic gestures and interventions, and transnational religious commodities could not have been viable. Critics of the culture industry and consumerism tend to suggest that commercial forces inherently taint the authenticity of culture, and in this case would taint the spiritual effectiveness of brujería. For practitioners and clients, however, material and spiritual progress not only are not at odds but also are intimately connected. Indeed, practitioners are driven by the attainment of “blessings”—defined by material success as well as spiritual power—which presume the spirituality of commodities and the thinghood of spirituality. Especially in a world guided by capitalist modes of production and the sensuous insatiable consumption of life styles and self-images, brujos and their clients take advantage of the opportunities opened up by multiculturalism and identity politics. They openly expand the pantheon of spirits as well as their ritual expertise, protected by the idiom of heritage—yet outside of its constraints, showing that more than endangered species they are active participants in these glocal forces, speaking to them in their own particular modern yet spiritual idiom.Save to LibraryDownloadby Raquel Romberg•  17  Sociology, Social Theory, Sociology of Culture, Cultural PolicyA Big History of Globalization The Emergence of a Global World System (Springer 2019)Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrey Korotayev and +1sergey  shulgin•  20  Globalization, World Systems Analysis, World History, Global StudiesForging identities in the ‘New World’: a Study of Salman Rushdie’s FuryIn AC Mendes e Cristina Baptista (orgs.), Reviewing Imperial Conflicts.

Se abordan documentos editados por estos organismos y para su lectura se utilizan tres ejes transversales. En primer lugar, se revisan las jerarquías socio-económicas y su impacto en la formulación de los perfiles deseables para ejercer la profesión docente. En segundo lugar, se revisan los supuestos de género que es posible inferir de las orientaciones que proveen. Y, por último, se reflexiona sobre los rasgos culturales supuestos y ponderados como deseables en la formación permanente de los futuros profesores. Al proponer un abordaje filosófico, se abre, respecto de cada uno de estos temas, un campo problemático que permanece disponible para la reflexión, la discusión y el estudio de los actores del sistema educativo en cada contexto. Se proponen también, en las conclusiones, algunas líneas de indagación abiertas, que constituyen apuestas para reformular e intervenir en los procesos de formación docente y, de manera concomitante, en la definición de políticas educativas significativas y emancipatorias en Latinoamérica.Save to LibraryDownloadby Laura Galazzi and +1Muriel  Vazquez•  11  Politics Of Education, Globalization And Higher Education, Cultural Globalization, Formación profesionalThe Directors’ Duties of the UK Companies Act 2006This Paper explores and summarises the Director's Duties of the UK Companies Act 2006 with emphasis on "the duty to promote the success of the company.

Küreselleşmenin kültürel boyutu ise küreselleşmenin, toplumlar üzerindeki belirgin etkilerini ortaya çıkaran tarafıdır. Geçmişten beri ülkeleri ve toplumları birbirlerine yaklaştıran kültür akışları küreselleşme ile birlikte hızlanmış, yoğunlaşmıştır. Bu akışlar ile birlikte ülkelere birçok yabancı kültür unsuru giriş yapmış ve toplum yaşamına sirayet etmiştir. Rock müzik ve onun oluşturduğu rock kültürü de bunlardan biridir.Rock müzik gibi, Batılı ülkelerin ihracı olan unsurlar dışa daha kapalı olan çevre ülkelerde yayılmaya başladıklarında toplum ile aralarında doku uyuşmazlıkları başta olmak üzere birtakım sorunlar meydana gelebilmektedir. Rock’ın Türkiye’deki yaşamı da bu eksende gelişmiştir. Rock müzik ülkemizde birçok formda icra edilmiş, kültürel homojenleşme ve küyerelleşme bağlamında okunabilecek, rock müziğin esas ögeleri ile yerel motiflerin birleştirilmesi suretiyle oluşturulmuş başarılı müzikal üretimlerin yapılmasını sağlamıştır. Bunun yanı sıra rock kültürü de durmaksızın ilerleyen küreselleşmenin etkisiyle dönüşümler geçirmiştir. Bu bağlamda rock’ın bir kültür endüstrisi hâline geldiği, altkültür ve karşı kültür kimliklerinde bozulmalar görüldüğü, protest tavrında yozlaşmalar görüldüğü gibi konular tartışılagelmiştir. Bütün bu gelişmelere mekân ölçeğinde ışık tutan ve bu dönüşümleri kendisi de yaşayan Kemancı Rock Bar, kıraathaneden rock bara evrilen yapısı ile küreselleşmenin yarattığı dönüşüm sürecini özetleyebilecek verimli bir örnek olarak görülmüştür. Bu sebeple Kemancı, rock kültürünün küreselleşme ile ilişkisinin analiz edilebilmesi açısından uygun bir saha işlevi görmüştür.Küresel şehirlerin, küreselleşmenin kültürel boyutunun net biçimde gözlemlendiği alanlar olmasından hareketle İstanbul ve Kemancı tezin odak noktası olarak belirlenmiş, rock kültürünün küreselleşme ile bağlantısının bu pencereden bakılarak incelenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Tezin özgün bir yapı arz etmesi gerektiği düşünüldüğünden bir saha araştırması kurgulanmış, rock kültürüne hâkim ve Kemancı’nın iki dönemine de tanıklık etmiş kişilerle yarı yapılandırılmış mülakat tekniğine dayalı derinlemesine bireysel niteliksel görüşmeler yapılmıştır. Elde edilen bulgular vasıtası ile tezin sorduğu sorular cevaplanmış ve açtığı tartışma başlıklarının altı doldurulmuş, devamında rock kültürünün küreselleşme ve şehirle olan ilişkilerinin nasıl ele alınması gerektiğine dair tartışmacı bir bakış açısıyla yorumlar yapılmış, öneriler getirilmiştir.Save to LibraryDownloadby Can Bulubay•  13  Globalization, Space and Place, Urban Culture, Cultural GlobalizationO NEOLIBERALISMO NO CONTEXTO GLOBAL DA MÍDIA E DOS SISTEMAS DE INFORMAÇÃO.Uma breve análise crítica do neoliberalismo, suas origens e ideologia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Frank M C Kuehn•  16  Sociology, Social Theory, Sociology of Culture, International EconomicsPosition paper: Global Minds, Roots in the CityOn 10th October 2014 (at Beursschouwburg in Brussels), a political scientist and sociologist Patrick Le Gales gave a talk 'Global Minds, Roots in the City' on his recently finished research project in which Alberta Andreotti, Francisco... moreOn 10th October 2014 (at Beursschouwburg in Brussels), a political scientist and sociologist Patrick Le Gales gave a talk 'Global Minds, Roots in the City' on his recently finished research project in which Alberta Andreotti, Francisco Javier Moreno Fuentes and himself explored the mobility practices of European urban upper-middle classes. In his talk, Le Gales presented new empirical qualitative data collected through a comparative research of 480 professionals and managers in 16 neighbourhoods in 4 cities (Paris, Lyon, Madrid, Milan + background data on London and Manchester). This data reveals the upper middle class is transnational only to a limited degree (and substantially less than speculated by some social theorists), mostly adopting partial exit strategies – thus refuting simplistic arguments about the rise of mobility, new barbarians (Agnell) and rootedness of European Bourgeoisie. However, despite expressing strong criticism of simplistic understanding of mobility patterns, gentrification and disembeddedness in Europe, Le Gales himself made some bold statements and generalising interpretations that lead to misleading conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Matevž Straus•  11  Globalisation and Development, Urban mobility, Mobility, MotilityMezzogiorno, guerra fredda e nuova storiografia globale: verso una dimensione transnazionale della questione meridionale?Relazione per l'VIII edizione dei Cantieri di Storia SISSCO "La storia contemporanea in Italia oggi: ricerche e tendenze" Viterbo, 14-16 settembre 2015 Titolo del Panel: Il Mezzogiorno, dalla storia d'Italia alla storia globaleSave to LibraryDownloadby Claudia Villani•  5  Cultural Studies, Contemporary History, Cultural Globalization, Questione meridionaleFilosofia antica per un mondo globalizzato (2017)Filosofia antica per un mondo globalizzato, "L'Indice dei libri del mese" 1 (Gennaio 2017), p. 13.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michele  Curnis•  12  Greek Literature, Globalization, Aristotle, Globalisation and Developmentلعبة الوجود ومواقع الأشياءSave to LibraryDownloadby Samer Akkach•  8  Globalization, Arabic Language and Linguistics, Cultural Theory, Cultural IdentityFueling la Revolución: Itinerant Physicians, Transactional Humanitarianism, and Shifting Moral Economies in Post-Soviet CubaSave to Libraryby P.

This aim is to be able to explain the tendency of the globalization which emerged as a continuation of each other in accordance with the spirit of the era of the Turkish sport institutions. Globalization is a very influential phenomenon on the changes of states, social and economic institutions. Globalization; can be regarded as a concept that deals with a wide variety of disciplines and markets, and establishes relationships that influence and interfere with these disciplines and markets. From this perspective, it is also a fact that the effects of countries on sports institutions are inevitable. In the study, a qualitative method called "descriptive field scanning", documentary or documentary study was followed. In this way, our research has been structured by the historical research method and the historical survey method with qualitative research in terms of content. Historical research methodology has been supported by archival scanning method based on reviewing, translating, reading and evaluating books, documents, files, official and private correspondence documents, foreign language information and documents The sports schools of the Ottoman state's sports institutions were weakened by the loss of their importance by being negatively affected as the economic aims of the establishment causes with the change of trade routes in the first globalization process. In the second globalization process; despite the fact that the Ottoman state was in its recent times, it tried to adapt to the socio-economic changes brought about by Globalization. At the end of this effort, importance has been given to sports and sports institutions in education, social life. He transferred both the sports institutions and the sports workforce to the state of the Republic of Turkey, which is the continuation of the Ottoman state.Save to LibraryDownloadby Open Access Publishing  Group•  12  Globalization, Sports History, Globalization And Higher Education, HIstory of SportGlobalization and Mass migration: Identifying opportunity in the new multi-cultural contextContemporary issues informed by the political and geographic alterations on our planet are demanding new paradigms of approach in design thinking.

The continuous call to address the new social criteria is bringing fresh challenges in the realm of policy, strategy and civilization. The dilemma of globalisation and mass migration has affected the social fabric of the society. From Canada to the Australia, a new postmodern identity awaits its recognition following an integration of peoples from various ethnic backgrounds. The social fabric created by amalgamation of different cultures and ethnic values of varied contrast, has on the other hand brought opportunity for designers to capitalize on the new protocol. The paper is built on the analysis of the situation and its effects particularly in the Australian context.  Among other states and territories, New South Wales has produced new multicultural and multilingual city scapes, who’s main trigger has been the migrants that enriched the commonwealth. The research brings into account design project conducted as part of academic degree coursework that aimed at creating sufficient framework to address the criteria and tangible outcomes as a response towards the need to create the new identity. It also becomes a valid case study where design academics or  practitioners are eyeing for opportunity aiming to produce creative solutions in current times, by giving due significance to the diverse vernacular and regional native identities of the inhabitants of our planet.Save to LibraryDownloadby Salman Afzal•  9  Globalization, Globalisation and cultural change, Design education, Identity (Culture)A territorialidade da língua inglesa-americana e a multiterritorialidade geolinguísticaSave to LibraryDownloadby Diego Barbosa da Silva•  44  English Literature, Self and Identity, Languages and Linguistics, Contact LinguisticsMapping the Global Architect of AlterityDue to globalization, cultural spaces are now developing with no tangible connection to geographical place.

The territorial logic traditionally used to underpin architecture and envision our built environment is being radically altered, forcing the adoption of a new method of conceptualizing space/geography and what constitutes architectural practice. Construction techniques, design sensibilities, and cultural identities are being transformed as technology transports us to places that were previously unreachable. The resultant “globalized” architect must become more than just an artful visionary, but also a master of the art of the political nudge willing to act within multiple mediums and at the simultaneous scales of a chaotic new world disorder.Though fearless they must also be responsible, inherently understanding the necessity to align bold visions with the mundane details of the everyday in ways that are culturally flexible and accepting of change.The potential for what must be considered the legitimate practice of the architect must move from a purely material venue to one more directly engaged in the chaos of the larger economic, political, and social spheres of a globalizing world. The issues and possible interactions with globalization contained in this text exemplify ways that architecture is transforming into a more flexible and fluid interdisciplinary version of its traditional self in order to rise to challenges of this new international terrain. A theme runs throughout in the form of a call: that architects must conceptually reconstruct their frames of reference to better align with the demands of a rapidly globalizing world.Save to Libraryby Michael Jenson•  16  Globalization, Global cities, Place-Identity (Architecture), Global StudiesHinkelammert, Franz (2001) El nihilismo al desnudo.

Yet, the notion of multiple modernities represents a radical transformation in the way modernity and, indeed, the contemporary world is viewed. As such, the central aim of this volume is to explore the implications and hidden understanding of the multiple modernitites research project beyond historical analysis in order to investigate its wide ranging omnipresent implications as they exist in communication and in the social order of societal membership in contemporary societies. This volume collects new research about multiple modernities and globalization. Int shows the new turn of sociological theory in the contemporary scene with respect to multiple modernities, multi-centrism, transglobality, hybridization and multiculturalism, and explores it as a new area of societal communication - one that takes effect in the sectors of a global society as a 'society of societies'. The studies in this book converge to demonstrate that the route of Western modernization, its cultural program and iths institutional structure, does not follow the pathway of modernization that we have that far observed in the emerged new area. Rather, the continuation of the multiple modernities research program is given a new design, researching the social structure and dynamic of postmodern societies, their exchange and the the debate about the flow of free resources.  https://brill.com/display/title/32081Save to LibraryDownloadby Gerhard Preyer•  47  Critical Theory, Sociology, Philosophy, Political PhilosophyEstudo Dirigido - América Latina, Desenvolvimento e Sustentabilidade SocioambientalSome questions/principles about capitalism and globalization since the second.

The role of global capitalism in shaping urban education is, therefore, perhaps not immediately evident. Indeed, global capitalism alone provides us with a far from complete understanding of urban education in the US today. At best, it describes a set of compelling circumstances to which national, state and local decision-makers must respond. Ultimately, the state of urban education is the product of an ongoing political process in which various stakeholders consult, petition and/or protest before the appropriate public officials. As such, it is largely the case that local decisions and activism continue to shape urban education. At the same time, the forces of global capitalism establish important limitations regarding the options available to those who set urban education policy in the US.Save to Libraryby David  Baronov•  4  Globalization, Political Science, Urban Education, Cultural GlobalizationCALL FOR PAPERS Japanese Pop Culture on Aesthetics and CreativityJapan has increasingly become a source of inspiration in many creative fields: from manga illustrations, street fashion, and contemporary art; to storytelling devices such as the 'Rashomon effect' in Hollywood movies, decluttering... moreJapan has increasingly become a source of inspiration in many creative fields: from manga illustrations, street fashion, and contemporary art; to storytelling devices such as the 'Rashomon effect' in Hollywood movies, decluttering lifestyle techniques inspired by Japanese minimalist aesthetics, and even food such as kyaraben. According to Dolores Martinez, " underlying various processes of adaptation and transformation lies a common desire to somehow make art one's one, sparked by an engagement with the ideas contained in the Japanese source products. " Japanese aesthetics, such as kawaii, is shaping the worlds' influencers in art, design, fashion, gaming, and movies. Contemporary artmaking has progressed through many forms, and the current fascination of many young artists is a hybrid combination of the globalizing influences of East and West, technology, and collective and personal memories. This symposium aims to consider the growing influence of Japanese popular culture on contemporary visual arts, trace the process of how it has crossed cultural boundaries, and provide an insight into the dynamics of how culture, memory, and technology can affect the way we view and construct things in the present and future.

The article suggests that cinema, primarily of Hollywood origin, has had a notable influence on the development of Irish society and Irish film. Contemporary Irish film itself also reflects the failure of Irish history to excite the imagination of Ireland's youth as effectively as the seductive depictions of America's past as mediated through the Western and gangster films. Indeed, films made in Ireland today reflect the influence of both these genres. However, as the key to the Hollywood continuity style of film-making is its own self-effacement, this has sometimes been reflected in the effacement of people, politics and place in contemporary Irish film as film-makers endeavor to attract a global audience for their work. Films considered include The Boy From Mercury (Martin Duffy, 1996), Nora (Pat Murphy, 1999), Circle of Friends (Pat O'Connor, 1993), Dancing at Lughnasa (Pat O'Connor, 1998), Saltwater (Conor McPherson, 1999), Ailsa (Paddy Breathnach, 1993), I Went Down (Paddy Breathnach, 1997), The Disappearance of Finbar (Sue Clayton, 1994/95), When Brendan Met Trudy (Kieron Walsh, 2000), High Boot Benny (Joe Comerford, 1993), Broken Harvest (Maurice O’Callaghan, 1993), The Boxer (Jim Sheridan, 1998), Some Mother’s Son (Terry George, 1996), Nothing Personal (Thaddeus O’Sullivan, 1994/95), and Sweety Barrett (Stephen Bradley, 1998)."Save to LibraryDownloadby Seán Crosson•  38  Cultural Studies, Irish Studies, Media and Cultural Studies, GlobalizationRelationship between Globalisation and Terrorism: A critical analysisAccording to Cronin (2003), the terror attacks of 9/11 not only restructured the global power, political, social, and economic structures but also unmasked the paradoxes embedded into the process of globalisation.

The subsequent US-led coalition attacks on Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in the consolidation of the Anti-American and Anti-Western sentiments by illuminating the imperialistic character of the United States of America (Fuchs, 2010; Kellner, 2005). The contradictory character of globalisation has pushed the vast majority of global population against the wall thus, leaving them no choice but to embrace violence and terror as a last resort. This raises an important question that whether terrorism in the globalised world is a reactionary phenomenon or a malice that exists independently? Thus, the objective of this essay is to critically evaluate the relationship between globalisation and terrorism by exploring the political, social, cultural, and economic transformation of the world under the blanket of globalisation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Adnan Hafeez•  12  International Relations, Political Economy, Globalization, TerrorismJamaican attitudes toward the linguistic appropriation of Jamaican CreoleAuthenticity in global reggae and dancehall music: Jamaican attitudes toward the linguistic appropriation of Jamaican Creole The global spread of Jamaican Creole (JC) has been accelerated by the growing international popularity of reggae... moreAuthenticity in global reggae and dancehall music: Jamaican attitudes toward the linguistic appropriation of Jamaican Creole The global spread of Jamaican Creole (JC) has been accelerated by the growing international popularity of reggae music, Rastafarianism, as well as the globalization of the sound system in dancehall culture. Eventually, non-Jamaican artists began to "cross" (Rampton 1995) into JC during their performances (Gerfer 2018). While crossing has already been extensively studied in the context of hip-hop music (Eberhardt & Freeman 2015), attitudes toward the use of JC by non-Jamaican reggae and dancehall artists and the question of authenticity are still understudied fields in sociolinguistic research. In the context of music performances, authenticity proves to be a highly complex concept which depends on multiple factors, such as music genre, an artist's origin and linguistic background, and audience expectations. In order to elicit Jamaicans' attitudes toward the linguistic appropriation of JC by non-Jamaican reggae and dancehall artists, interviews with Jamaican university students are conducted. The participants listen to seven sound samples (six non-Jamaican artists and one Jamaican one) which provide the basis for questionnaire-based interviews. These interviews serve to answer the following research questions: 1) Do the Jamaican participants notice that the majority of the sound samples are taken from non-Jamaican artists? Which linguistic and non-linguistic factors trigger their perception? Do they find the artists' language behavior authentic? 2) How do the Jamaican participants evaluate the use of JC by non-Jamaican artists? Preliminary results show that those artists who use a wide range of phonological, morpho-syntactic, and idiomatic expressions as well as Dread Talk (Pollard 2009) are perceived as more authentic than others. Especially songs dealing with Rastafarian topics are thought to be authentically Jamaican. Jamaican university students tend to welcome the use of JC by non-Jamaican reggae and dancehall artists. They feel the artists appreciate the language, use it successfully, and promote a positive image of Jamaica. Those who perceive it as negative state that the artists do not treat JC with respect but take advantage of it for the purpose of amusement without considering the historical context of Jamaican culture and language.

In this regard, the paper analyses the arrangement of the information on the official websites of some transnational institutions operating in the world, such as the United Nations, European Union, Unasur, African Union and League of Arab States. The analysis is focused on the communication strategies adopted in the websites; however, it is the aim of this paper toobserve whether such information is culturally influenced.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giulia Bedini•  7  Intercultural Communication, Globalization, Identity (Culture), Critical Political Discourse AnalysisSharma, Susheel Kumar, “Culture in a Glo(b/c)al World”,  Kala Saurabh: University Refereed Journal, XV, (2015), pp. 338 -351.

It is here a heuristic tool which opens up possibilities of rethinking literature beyond the boundaries of fiction and autobiography. It also appears as a means of creating an unprecedented intercultural writing. But here travel appears only indirectly; the reader is led to rebuild the signs of an experience of travel which is not explicitly narrated. We would like to demonstrate that the deciphering of this hidden background of the text is nevertheless necessary for the understanding of the novel. Indeed, linguistic elaboration phenomena located in the text take significant effects and call for an experience of reading which is intercultural in itself.Save to LibraryDownloadby Samuel Thévoz and +1Bonoli Lorenzo•  68  Cultural Studies, Urban Geography, World Literatures, French LiteratureFemininity and Flexible Labor: Fashioning Class Through Gender...Save to LibraryDownloadby Carla Freeman•  4  Gender Studies, Globalization, Globalization and Gender, Labor market regulation and workers’ rights, Empowerment and inequality, Social and welfare policy, Cultural GlobalizationComputer-Mediated Communication across Cultures: International Interactions in Online EnvironmentsComputer-Mediated Communication across Cultures: International Interactions in Online Environments provides readers with the foundational knowledge needed to communicate safely and effectively with individuals from other countries and... moreComputer-Mediated Communication across Cultures: International Interactions in Online Environments provides readers with the foundational knowledge needed to communicate safely and effectively with individuals from other countries and cultures via online media.
