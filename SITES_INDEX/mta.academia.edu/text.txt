István WinklerHungarian Academy of Sciences,  Research Centre for Natural Sciences,  Faculty MemberCognitive Psychology+3I study auditory perception and memory using electrophysiological and behavioral measures. My main hypothesis is that auditory objects (units of information in auditory processing) are predictive models which are based on regularities extracted from the acoustic input.less83 Followers47 Following39 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall225 Papers1 PublicationsPapersAnimal models in studying neuronal mechanisms of event related potentialsInternational Journal of Psychophysiology,  1989Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In contrast to the perceptual segregation of two concurrent sounds, the perception of three simultaneous sound objects has not yet been studied systematically. We conducted two experiments in which participants were presented with complex sounds containing sound segregation cues (mistuning, onset asynchrony, differences in frequency or amplitude modulation or in sound location), which were set up to promote the perceptual organization of the tonal elements into one, two, or three concurrent sounds. In Experiment 1, listeners indicated whether they heard one, two, or three concurrent sounds. In Experiment 2, participants watched a silent subtitled movie while EEG was recorded to extract the object-related negativity (ORN) component of the event-related potential. Listeners predominantly reported hearing two sounds when the segregation promoting manipulations were applied to the same tonal element. When two different tonal elements received manipulations promoting them to be heard as separate auditory objects, participants reported hearing two and three concurrent sounds objects with equal probability. The ORN was elicited in most conditions; sounds that included the amplitude- or the frequency-modulation cue generated the smallest ORN amplitudes. Manipulating two different tonal elements yielded numerically and often significantly smaller ORNs than the sum of the ORNs elicited when the same cues were applied on a single tonal element. These results suggest that ORN reflects the presence of multiple concurrent sounds, but not their number. The ORN results are compatible with the horse-race principle of combining different cues of concurrent sound segregation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We studied the association between prenatal exposure to maternal anxiety and infant auditory information processing. Seventy pregnant women filled out the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at between their 9th and 15th week of pregnancy. Two and nine months after birth, we recorded auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) in their infants using an oddball paradigm with a standard tone and three types of deviants, i.e. inter-stimulus interval (ISI)-deviants, white noise, and novel sounds. AERP amplitudes measured from these windows were analyzed by means of repeated measures ANOVAs; maternal State Anxiety was entered as a continuous predictor variable. A consistent result across both ages was that significant positive associations were found between the level of maternal anxiety and infant’s responses to stimuli with low information contents (the standard and ISI-deviant) (p &amp;lt; .05) and that no associations were found for rare, more informative stimuli (white noise, novel sounds). Infants from highly anxious mothers over process sounds with low information. This difference between infants of high and low anxious pregnant mothers may underlie the higher negative reactivity and language problems observed in other studies in children prenatally exposed to high levels of maternal anxiety.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
