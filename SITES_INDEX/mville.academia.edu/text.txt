Joanne Kilgour Dowdy-- not the woman behind the camera, but rather in front of the camera-- has successfully made visible her surroundings, work, and institutional contexts in her new book, In the Public Eye. This 156 page limited edition, with well over 40 photographs and memorabilia spanning the career of Dr. Dowdy, encapsulates her professional life. In this photo autobiography, we see the long journey taken by this Caribbean-born academic; traveling from Trinidad, via Boston Conservatory of Dance and Music, the Julliard School, and Columbia University, to now Professor of Adolescent/Adult Literacy at Kent State University in Ohio. In the introduction by Jeremy Taylor, the reader is provided a narrative sketch of Joanne Kilgour Dowdy‟s life, from Trinidad-born, “precocious dancer an...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this position paper, I ask (and answer) the question, “What might be gained by bringing a feminist lens, and specifically an ecofeminist perspective, to ESD?” I argue that infusing ecofeminism into ESD can develop students’ competence beyond individual level change to thinking and acting systemically; it can develop the critical consciousness, activist skills, and deeper sustainability knowledge needed to foster social change.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, for higher education researchers, critical research is often undertaken within and for the academy, which in turn may endanger one’s career if the dominant power structures are threatened. How might we enact and perform critical research within the academy when the academy itself is our focus? In this piece, we script our dramaturgical relationship with critical theories, to question the meaning of these paradigms in our own work and in our field (of education) as well as to explore the potentials of and limits to the use of critical theories and paradigms that may move beyond critical.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article describes a study designed to measure the impact of graduate professional preparation programs on the development of multicultural competence in graduate students enrolled in two professional preparation programs in student affairs. The authors also consider how different curricular approaches may contribute to the development of multicultural competence.

Policy discourse analysis exposes how some policy assumptions, and dominant discourses framing those assumptions, can serve to undercut intended outcomes of the policy. This finding is particularly troubling when policies are implemented to promote equity and advance social justice. Through analysis of university policies on sexual violence, these authors illustrate how policy discourse analysis can provide researchers and practitioners with a lens for “unthinking” and thinking differently about research questions, analyses, and interpretations of data.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Teaching Leaders to Mobilize Adaptive WorkAcademic Exchange Quarterly,  Jun 22, 2007Abstract Leadership theories, from &quot;great man&quot; theories to calls for leaders to create ... more Abstract Leadership theories, from &quot;great man&quot; theories to calls for leaders to create transformational change, portray an image of leadership as grandiose. Heroic images of leaders may suggest to practitioners that the enactment of these theories is unrealistic and leave students enrolled in leadership education courses feeling disempowered to bridge theory to practice. This article details the use of a problem-based approach in a graduate course on leadership that focused attention on how leaders can mobilize adaptive work to respond to leadership challenges. Introduction Much debate exists over whether leaders are born or made and contributes to the dilemma &quot;can leadership be taught?&quot; Gardner (1990) replies emphatically &quot;yes.&quot; However, scholars note teaching and learning leadership requires more than formal instruction (Cronin, 1995; Gardner, 1990; Rost, 1991). In courses that convey knowledge about leadership, one would need mainly to focus on defining a domain of knowledge and then engage the students in thinking about the subject. However, teachers must go beyond courses that risk portraying leadership as an abstraction rooted in theories void of the context of a leader&#39;s daily practice; absent an understanding about what it means to participate in leadership roles and processes. As an instructor of a graduate course on leadership in educational organizations, I was faced with this instructional challenge: how could I enable students to integrate knowledge and values in leadership behavior, and equip them to use knowledge of leadership and their imagination to create new responses to leadership situations that are not clear-cut. My years of college teaching (2002-07) have been grounded in a commitment to application: cultivating the ability of students to apply scholarship in their daily settings as higher educational administrators. Recent scholarship on teaching and learning illuminates shifts in thinking about college pedagogy; notably it emphasizes a need to rethink the relationship between theory and practice, observing that traditional application-of-theory model appears to be rather ineffective (Korthagen &amp; Kessels, 1999). Studies of student learning are advocating &quot;reversing the long-held strategy of first immersing students in theory and then giving them clinical experience where they are expected to draw from their previous learning&quot; (Yohannes, 2007). Motivated by these calls to rethink existing theory-to-practice models, I sought a teaching and learning strategy that would challenge students to identify a problem facing leaders in higher education, analyze this issue by drawing upon one or more leadership theories, and explicate a position on this issue. This paper describes my use of a problem-based approach in a graduate course on leadership that focused attention on how leaders can mobilize adaptive work to respond to organizational challenges in post-secondary education. First, 1 will provide a brief review of the leadership literature to illuminate a challenge for teaching a survey course on theories of leadership. Next, I will describe course projects designed to empower students to enact leadership. Finally, I will offer considerations for future teaching and research. Overview of Relevant Literature Traditional theories of leadership can be clustered into three categories (see Chemers, 1997, for full discussion of these theories): * Dispositional theories: certain attributes make a great leader (e.g., &quot;great man&quot; theories that assert leadership is an innate ability, trait theories that delineate universal traits common to all leaders). * Behavioral theories: great leadership is based on what someone does; key behavioral patterns result in leadership, and thus leadership capabilities can be learned, rather than being inherent. * Contingency theories: the leader&#39;s ability to lead is contingent upon various situational factors, including the leader&#39;s preferred style, and the capabilities and behaviors of followers. …Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Beyond recycling: Developing deep sustainability competenceby susan iverson and Susan IversonThe Contribution of Social Sciences to Sustainable Development at Universities ,  2016The purpose of this chapter is to advance a competency framework for sustainability, arguing that... more The purpose of this chapter is to advance a competency framework for sustainability, arguing that sustainability initiatives should move beyond basic awareness to deeper knowledge, including understanding of root causes, and development of political skills. This chapter’s discussion and critique of sustainability competence is grounded in data from more than 500 undergraduate residents’ responses to seven open-ended questions about sustainability initiatives in the residence halls; what sustainability means to them; their environmental values, attitudes, and behaviors. These data were analyzed using qualitative methods to determine students’ understanding and definition of sustainability; their green behaviors; and the impact of perceptions about sustainability on green behaviors.  Along the three competency domains (awareness, knowledge, and skills), respondents’ understanding of sustainability was overwhelmingly environmental (recycling, and reducing waste), and skills did not extend beyond individual actions. Sustainability initiatives must not only develop individual-level competencies (i.e. awareness of personal consumption, reduction of personal waste and energy usage), but also equip individuals to act at institutional and structural levels (i.e. advocating for changes in policy and practices). An expanded conceptualization of sustainability competence would be useful for educators to design initiatives that deepen sustainability competence, developing students’ capacity for thinking and acting systemically.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
