Geophys.  …1] The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo algorithm uses multiday, multiband MODIS surface reflectance products from Terra and Aqua to produce a global albedo product at a 500 m resolution (Collection 5). This paper evaluates the ability of the MODIS albedo product to represent albedos at all diurnal solar zenith angles through a comparison with field measurements from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM/SGP) stations. The results show that, for most of the sites, the overall accuracy of the MODIS albedo is within 0.05 and shows an increasing negative bias and increased RMSE as zenith angle increases beyond 70°-75°as compared to the ground observations. The full inversion of the MODIS BRDF/albedo algorithm has a higher inversion quality than the backup algorithm.

The MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model and multidate, multispectral data to provide global 1-km gridded and tiled products of the land surface every 16 days. These products include directional hemispherical albedo (black-sky albedo), bihemispherical albedo (white-sky albedo), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted surface Reflectances (MBAR), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The algorithm has been consistently producing albedo and NBAR for the public since July 2000. Initial evaluations indicate a stable BRDF/Albedo Product, where, for example, the spatial and temporal progression of phenological characteristics is easily detected in the NBAR and albedo results. These early beta and provisional products auger well for the routine production of stable MODIS-derived BRDF parameters, nadir reflectances, and albedos for use by the global observation and modeling communities.Download Free PDFView PDFAssessing the Coupling between Surface Albedo derived from MODIS and the Fraction of Diffuse Skylight over Spatially-Characterized LandscapesPhilip LewisIn this effort, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection V005) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function ( BRDF)/Albedo algorithm is used to retrieve instantaneous surface albedo at a point in time and under specific atmospheric conditions. These retrievals are then used to study the role that the fraction of diffuse skylight plays under realistic scenarios of anisotropic diffuse illumination and multiple scattering between the surface and atmosphere. Simulations of the sky radiance using the MODTRAN®5.1 radiative transfer model were performed under different aerosol optical properties, illumination conditions, and surface characteristics to describe these effects on surface albedo retrievals from MODIS. This technique was examined using a validation scheme over four measurement sites with varied aerosol levels and landscapes, ranging from croplands to tundra ecosystems, and over extended time periods. Furthermore, a series of geostatistical analyses were performed to examine the types of spatial patterns observed at each measurement site. In particular, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) retrievals of surface albedo were acquired to analyze the change in variogram model parameters as a function of increased window-size. Results were then used to assess the degree to which a given point measurement is able to capture the intrinsic variability at the scale of MODIS observations. Assessments of MODIS instantaneous albedos that account for anisotropic multiple scattering, over snow-free and snow-covered lands and at all diurnal solar zenith angles, show a slight improvement over the albedo formulations that treat the downwelling diffuse radiation as isotropic. Comparisons with field measurements show biases improving by 0.004-0.013 absolute units (root-mean-squared error) or 0.1%―2.0% relative error.Download Free PDFView PDFIEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote SensingValidation of the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function and albedo retrievals using combined observations from the aqua and terra platforms2006 • crystal schaafDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentAccuracy assessment of the MODIS 16-day albedo product for snow: comparisons with Greenland in situ measurements2005 • crystal schaafDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentThe MODIS (Collection V005) BRDF/albedo product: Assessment of spatial representativeness over forested landscapes2009 • Thomas KolbDownload Free PDFView PDFIEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote SensingAn algorithm for the retrieval of albedo from space using semiempirical BRDF models2000 • crystal schaafDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
