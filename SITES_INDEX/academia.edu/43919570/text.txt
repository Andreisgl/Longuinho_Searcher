In this paper, we present a blueprint for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Web-based text editors, and show that this contributes towards simplifying the writing task for authors. Our approach utilises the textual content of a document as input into existing artificial intelligence processes, extended with an RDF knowledge graph. The supplementary material from the AI partner is presented to an author for possible inclusion in their document. We separately evaluated two approaches to the presentation of linguistic tone analysis into editors. Our results from unmoderated observational user tests validate the premise that cognitive technology can simplify the writing task, and show that design is critical to the adoption of cognitive technologies. We conclude with lessons learned from deploying informal qualitative research sessions and online observational tests, and share opportunities for future work. We note that merely applying AI or any new technology to a human activity is patently insufficient. Our limited experience and evaluation suggest that design and user testing are necessary activities for adoption and acceptance.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersD6.3 - Learning activities and Units of Learning.

Facilitating knowledge services are needed. This paper explores the theory of converging knowledge, innovation, and practice, and the implications for its facilitation. A trialogical approach to knowledge creation is presented as a viable theoretical starting point. Theoretical considerations are complemented with two examples of novel knowledge services: Opasnet and Innovillage. Eventually, conclusions are drawn upon the main issues to address in future development of services to support convergence of knowledge, innovation, and practice.Download Free PDFView PDFSIG CHI'14: Proceedings of the 32nd annual ACM conference on Human factors in computing systemsWADE: simplified GUI add-on development for third-party softwareXiaojun Meng, Ramanathan  Subramanian, Subramanian RamanathanWe present the WADE Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies interface and functionality modification of existing third-party software without access to source code. WADE clones the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a host program through dynamic-link library (DLL) injection, enabling modifications to (1) the GUI in a WYSIWYG fashion and (2) software functionality. We compare WADE with an alternative state-of-the-art runtime toolkit overloading approach in a user-study, whose results demonstrate that WADE significantly simplifies the task of GUI-based add-on development.Download Free PDFView PDFManaging Web Content Using Linked Data Principles-Combining Semantic Structure with Dynamic Content Syndication2011 • Sören AuerAbstract Despite the success of the emerging Linked Data Web, offering content in a machine-processable way and--at the same time--as a traditional Web site is still not a trivial task. In this paper, we present the OntoWiki-CMS-an extension to the collaborative knowledge engineering toolkit OntoWiki for managing semantically enriched Web content.Download Free PDFView PDFSmart TV - a more interactive way of watching TVKarin Nilsson HelanderDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Semantic Web-ISWC 2006OntoWikiA Tool for Social, Semantic Collaboration2006 • Sören AuerDownload Free PDFView PDFProgramming by a Sample: Rapidly Prototyping Web Applications with d.mixLeslie WuDownload Free PDFView PDFLTfLL-D5. 2 Learning support and feedback2009 • Costin  Chiru, Dan  Mihaila, Mihai Dascalu, Dan BanicaThis report presents Version 1 of the support and feedback services (delivering recommendations based on interaction analysis and on students&#x27; textual production) that can be integrated within an e-learning environment.
