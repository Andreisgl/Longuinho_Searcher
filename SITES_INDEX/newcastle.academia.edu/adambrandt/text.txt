However, the roles that seemingly minor aspects of interaction like minimal response tokens (e.g. ‘Mm’, ‘Mm hm’, ‘Uh huh’, ‘Okay’, ‘Yeah’) play as a feature of these practices have not been investigated in great detail. Studies which have sought to examine what such tokens do in language teaching and learning processes have mostly adopted a discourse analytic perspective, thereby treating them more or less as a homogeneous group (namely, ‘backchannel signals’). However, through ethnomethodological research, each token has been found to be doing distinctive work. This study adopts a multimodal conversation analytic perspective to investigate the uses of ‘Mm hm’ by an English as a Foreign Language teacher in a teacher education context. Analysis demonstrates how the teacher uses the token as a ‘continuer’ to withhold a third-turn evaluation, thereby keeping the channel open for further participation and hence creating space for learning. As such, the study furthers our understanding of L2 teachers’ third-turn feedback practices and has direct implications for L2 teacher classroom interactional competence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Creating an imaginary context: teacher’s use of embodied enactments in addressing learner initiatives in a beginner-level adult ESOL classroomby Prof. Kevin W. H.

Despite a small body of recent research indicating that teachers’ responses to learner initiatives play a significant role in facilitating learning opportunities in teacher–student interactions, more work is needed to understand the resources teachers draw upon in their responses. This study contributes to this by examining how a teacher employs what we term ‘embodied enactments’ as a pedagogical tool to contingently respond to learner initiatives. Using Conversation Analysis, we examine a single case taken from a corpus of video data collected in a beginner-level adult English for Speakers of Other Languages classroom in the United States. The findings reveal that the teacher contingently and multimodally enacts imaginary contexts which help students to understand how the target vocabulary and phrases can be used in everyday life. In doing this, the teacher and students are bridging the gap between classroom discourse and language use outside of the classroom, providing interactional space for promoting L2 learning.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Identity in intercultural interaction: How categories do thingsby Tim Greer and Adam BrandtJALT Pan-SIG Proceedings, 2013,  May 26, 2014Although identity has become a key topic in second language research, it is a problematic notion ... more Although identity has become a key topic in second language research, it is a problematic notion toresearch when considered to exist only in the individual’s head. By operationalizing identity as thesocial display of self in relation to others, discourse analytic approaches such as Conversation Analysis(CA) and Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) instead locate identity in interaction. hus,this makes identity observable through the sequential details of talk. his paper (1) introducesthe CA/MCA approach to identity as a social accomplishment and then (2) applies it to identityascriptions in a study abroad context and an online English-speaking practice chat room. heanalysis initially focuses on the role of epistemics and how discursive displays of knowledge helpaccomplish identity. It then goes on to demonstrate some of the ways that participants use identitycategories as an interactional resource.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our paper builds on this literature by investigating how cultural assumptions of national food-eating practices are deployed, contested and co-constructed in an online, voice-based chat room. Using conversation analysis, findings show how assumptions about cultural practices sequentially unfold in a setting where the interactants are strangers. Additionally, we show how assumptions about cultural practices can be used for rhetorical purposes, and can be treated as simple and complex in a single exchange.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
