This spiritual inquiry into the nature of truth draws on Buddhism and quantum physics to liberate us from limited understandings of ourselves and others.The hopeful teaching of this book is that while everybody suffers, most of this suffering is unnecessary—it can be overcome. The belief that things must be either true or untrue leads us to think in terms of polarities: good or evil, right or wrong. This friend-or-foe approach may seem to make life easier, but in The End of Suffering, Russell Targ and J. J. Hurtak assert that this worldview only increases our experience of suffering.In an effort to overcome the polarity of opposites and the accompanying suffering, Targ and Hurtak combine the wisdom of the East with the findings of quantum physics, uncovering a middle ground that shows opposing sides are really the same.Buddha taught us to live a helpful and compassionate life and to surrender our ego to the peace of spaciousness. The middle path of Buddhism also shows that things may be neither true nor not true, or both true and untrue. The End of Suffering puts the perceived opposites of Buddhism and physics together, showing step-by-step how we can learn to surrender the story of who we think we are and experience an end to our suffering.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextPersonal GrowthNew Age & SpiritualityPhilosophyLanguageEnglishPublisherOpen Road Integrated MediaRelease dateFeb 27, 2006ISBN9781612831145Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleAuthorRussell TargRead more from Russell TargSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextMind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic AbilitiesEbookMind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic AbilitiesbyRussell TargRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities for laterLimitless Mind: A Guide to Remote Viewing and Transformation of ConsciousnessEbookLimitless Mind: A Guide to Remote Viewing and Transformation of ConsciousnessbyRussell TargRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Limitless Mind: A Guide to Remote Viewing and Transformation of Consciousness for laterThe Reality of ESP: A Physicist's Proof of Psychic AbilitiesEbookThe Reality of ESP: A Physicist's Proof of Psychic AbilitiesbyRussell TargRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save The Reality of ESP: A Physicist's Proof of Psychic Abilities for laterMiracles of Mind: Exploring Nonlocal Consciousness and Spritual HealingEbookMiracles of Mind: Exploring Nonlocal Consciousness and Spritual HealingbyRussell TargRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Miracles of Mind: Exploring Nonlocal Consciousness and Spritual Healing for laterPsychic Research and Modern PhysicsEbookPsychic Research and Modern PhysicsbyHarold PuthoffRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Psychic Research and Modern Physics for laterDo You See What I See?: Memoirs of a Blind BikerEbookDo You See What I See?: Memoirs of a Blind BikerbyRussell TargRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Do You See What I See?: Memoirs of a Blind Biker for laterThird Eye Spies: Learn Remote Viewing from the MastersEbookThird Eye Spies: Learn Remote Viewing from the MastersbyRussell TargRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Third Eye Spies: Learn Remote Viewing from the Masters for laterRelated to The End of SufferingRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextOvercoming Spiritual Myopia: A View Toward Peace Among the ReligionsEbookOvercoming Spiritual Myopia: A View Toward Peace Among the ReligionsbyMargaret Placentra  JohnstonRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Overcoming Spiritual Myopia: A View Toward Peace Among the Religions for laterGetting Real About Enlightenment: a modern companion to your journey of sovereign spiritualityEbookGetting Real About Enlightenment: a modern companion to your journey of sovereign spiritualitybyKim SeppäläRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Getting Real About Enlightenment: a modern companion to your journey of sovereign spirituality for laterPlaces Beyond Belief: Book Two of the One Giant Leap TrilogyEbookPlaces Beyond Belief: Book Two of the One Giant Leap TrilogybyMichael K.

Tap to rateWrite a reviewReview must be at least 10 wordsBook previewThe End of Suffering - Russell TargThe hopeful teaching of this book is that while everybody suffers, most of this suffering is unnecessary—it can be overcome. The legacy of Aristotle is that we think that things must be either true or untrue. Thus we tend to think in terms of polarities: good or evil, right or wrong, Democrat or Republican. This friend-or-foe approach may seem to make life easier, but Russell Targ and J. J. Hurtak assert that this worldview only increases our experience of suffering. In an effort to overcome the polarity of opposites and the accompanying suffering, the authors combine the wisdom of the East with the findings of quantum physics, and uncover a middle ground that shows opposing sides have only the meaning we give them. Buddha taught us to live a helpful and compassionate life and to surrender our ego to the peace of spaciousness. The middle path of Buddhism shows that things may also be neither true nor not true, or both true and untrue. Remarkably, recent discoveries in modern physics echo these ancient teachings. This inspiring book puts these perceived opposites—Buddhism and physics—together and shows, step-by-step, how we can learn to surrender the story of who we think we are and experience an end to our suffering. From the foreword: The End of Suffering, by Russell Targ and J. J. Hurtak, is vital for all readers at this time. The authors perform here a great service to humanity by making Nagarjuna's teaching on the end of suffering transparent and accessible to the general reader. They make his profound innovations available and relevant to our lives in roday's world . And readers who enter this work will find powerful tools and insights that will empower them to get right to the source of their existential suffering. This important book fills a void and builds a bridge that helps make Buddha's global teachings and Nagarjuna's spiritual technology on the end of suffering a living reality for all who truly wish to help end individual and collective suffering in our human condition. —Prof. Ashok Gangadean, Philosophy Department, Haverford College Other Books Authored or Coauthored by Russell Targ Limitless Mind: A Guide to Remote Viewing and Transformation of Consciousness (2004) The Heart of the Mind: How to Experience God without Belief (1999, with Jane Katra) Miracles of Mind: Exploring Nonlocal Consciousness and Spiritual Healing (1998. with Jane Katra) The Mind Race: Understanding and Using Psychic Abilities (1984, with Keith Harary) Mind at Large: IEEE Symposia on the Nature of Extrasensory Perception (1979, 2002, with Charles Tart and Harold Puthoff) Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities (1977, 2005, with Harold Puthoff) Other Books by J.

Duality: The idea that I am who I am, and entirely separate from you: two ideas in opposition. Nagarjuna: Indian philosopher who showed that most ideas are neither true nor not true. Nonduality: The nonconceptual view that there is only one of us here in consciousness. Four-Logic: My truth together with your truth, where the middle is not excluded. Madhyamika: Middle Path of Buddhism emphasizing compassion and surrender to emptiness. Einstein: Physicist who perfected relativity but felt uncomfortable with quantum mechanics requiring a ghostly action at a distance. Locality: Physical theory that distant objects cannot have direct influence on one another. J. S. Bell: Physicist who proved that nonlocality could be tested for in the laboratory. Nonlocality: Universal property by which apparently separate items are still entangled. We have tried everything to get rid of suffering. We have gone everywhere to get rid of suffering. We have bought everything to get rid of it. We have ingested everything to get rid of it. Finally, when one has tried enough, there arises the possibility of spiritual maturity with the willingness to stop the futile attempt to get rid of and, instead, to actually experience suffering. In that momentous instant, there is the realization of that which is beyond suffering, of that which is untouched by suffering. There is the realization of who one truly is. —Gangaji Foreword: Nagarjuna and the End of Global Suffering Buddha's Prescription for the End of Suffering Buddha's great insight into the origin of human suffering can be seen as a monumental event that has transformed the course of our evolution. Buddha demonstrated spiritual genius in distilling his discovery into four simple and powerful noble truths, which have had profound global significance through the ages. Simply put, Buddha taught that human existential suffering—our individual and collective pathologies—arises from a fundamental flaw in how we use our minds, which distorts how we shape our selves, our world, and our living realities. Buddha's enlightenment revealed that the egocentric patterns of our minds—judgment of others and attachment to cherished outcomes—are the origin of human pathologies. Buddha's profound prescription for humanity to remove this primal cause of human suffering is summed up in his Four Noble Truths. The principal way to end suffering is to recognize that egoic patterns of thinking directly cause our afflictions. We must become aware that our day-to-day reality is caused by how we use our minds, and we must learn to see clearly that our egocentric habits of mind can be terminated. We have a direct choice to break these negative habits and regenerate new integral patterns of the mind that bring us into alignment and harmony with our Selves and with each other. Buddha's Eightfold Path is precisely this prescription of how to break the old egocentric mind barriers and cross into a new life of awakened mind, or as the authors of this book would say, Give up the story—of who you think you are. Easier said than done. Twenty-live hundred years have passed since Buddha's great awakening, yet planetary history has shown us that we humans are still very much lodged in egocentric patterns of minding. We continue to follow chronic patterns of pathology, violence, and existential suffering. Furthermore, Buddha's deep diagnosis of the origins of human disorders in egocentric minding has been echoed and validated through the ages in an emergent global consensus of diverse spiritual technologies and worldviews. For when we stand back from privileging any one worldview or cultural lens, and cross into the higher global dimension where diverse mystical and experiential worldviews (such as Gnostic Christianity, kabbalistic Judaism, Sulism, and so on) co-originate, we can see that Buddha's findings are strongly vindicated. Through this global lens, it is striking that our great spiritual, religious, and philosophical traditions concur that we humans cocreate our worlds through the conduct of our minds. Furthermore, our egocentric patterns produce fragmentations, dualisms, and existential alienation that generate all sorts of pathologies. So if it is, indeed, a global axiom that egocentric patterns of mind produce suffering, the obvious question is: Why has it been so difficult for us as individuals and as a species to overcome these egomind addictions and to rehabilitate our mind practices in more integral and healthful ways? Why do we continue to choose to suffer individually and collectively—perhaps now more than ever? Can we break through the egomind barrier? Nagarjuna's Historic Breakthrough The last question is all the more compelling in the light of the second-century Buddhist innovator's monumental breakthrough in bringing forth an unprecedented spiritual technology for finding the middle way to cross out of the bondage of egomind. Nagarjuna's new formulation of the Middle Way, the Madhyamika school, teaches that the sacred pathway leads beyond the egomind into the boundless open space of Buddha's dharma (moral law)—the infinite and spacious unified field of Reality. Nagarjuna found that early interpreters of Buddha's radical teaching remained caught up in the tangle of egocentric reasoning, and they fatally missed the essential teaching of Buddha's liberation. While the genius of Buddha diagnosed clearly the origin of human pathologies in the egocentric habits of mind, and prescribed the philosophical therapy essential for rehabilitating the awakened mind, Nagarjuna's spiritual and philosophical genius saw precisely how and why we humans remain entrapped within deep and chronic egocentric habits. He built on Buddha's teaching by innovating an even more potent rational therapy for breaking the ego barrier and bringing to actualization this liberating teaching. In this respect, Nagarjuna stands out in global history as an unprecedented teacher of the highest order whose spiritual and rational innovations and technology deserve supreme acknowledgment and appropriate recognition. Nevertheless, Nagarjuna's name remains virtually unknown on the global scene. His ingenious innovations are still not duly recognized or properly understood by the general public or our academic world. Still, what is most important here is not so much that Nagarjuna's name and work gain appropriate recognition. But rather, it is his clear and decisive teaching of entering the spacious Middle Way out of the bondage and suffering of egocentric mind that is more vital than ever for our individual and collective flourishing as one human family caring for each member. The point is that Buddha's global truths are not just for Buddhists, any more than Nagarjuna's spiritual technology for breaking the egomind barrier is for a select few on the Buddhist path. This teaching is meant for all humans, in all walks of life, of all worldviews and perspectives, who are caught in the force fields of egomind and are suffering the consequences. That is why this book, The End of Suffering, by Russell Targ and J.J. Hurtak, is so vital for all readers at this time. The authors perform here a great service to humanity by making Nagarjuna's teaching on the end of suffering transparent and accessible to the general reader. They make his profound innovations available and relevant to our lives in today's world. And readers who enter this work will find powerful tools and insights that will empower them to get right to the source of their existential suffering. This important book fills a void and builds a bridge that helps make Buddha's global teachings and Nagarjuna's spiritual technology on the end of suffering a living reality for all who truly wish to help end individual and collective suffering in our human condition. —Ashok Gangadean Professor of Philosophy, Haverford College Founder-Director of the Global Dialogue Institute Co-convenor of the World Commission on Global Consciousness and Spirituality Author: The Awakening of the Global Mind www.awakeningmind.org Preface by Russell Targ Everybody suffers, yet most of this suffering is unnecessary—it can be overcome. Suffering results from our delusional cultural conditioning created by family, school, and television from which we create our personal story of who we think we are. From earliest times, it has been known that suffering can be transformed when we finally learn to change our minds. Buddha's first great Truth identifies suffering as caused by our awareness of life's impermanence and fragility. I recognize that from time to time everyone experiences unavoidable pain, which I think of as naked suffering. This can come from intractable poverty, physical illness or injury, or from the grief and pain we feel over the loss of a loved one. Our heart breaks from the death of someone we deeply love or from the loss of a loving partner who simply decides to leave us. We experience these kinds of losses as tragedies in our hearts and in our lives. In fact, it was the untimely death of my beloved daughter and research buddy, Dr. Elisabeth Targ, that motivated me to start examining my own suffering. Such an examination was, no doubt, the natural way for me as a scientist to move through my own grieving process. On the other hand, the suffering we address in this book—the slings and arrows that seem to attack our ego—what I call our precious story—is in essence nonexistent because it doesn't actually exist in present time where we live. Almost all of our suffering is in our mind: guilt or depression over things that have occurred in the past, or anxiety over things that might or might not happen in the future. Unless we happen to be in a concentration camp, our suffering almost always arises from a time frame not of the present, rather than from existential reality. We can carry in our memories anger, guilt, and especially resentment toward people who have mistreated or betrayed us even long after those nasty people have departed or died. But we can also choose to empty this mental backpack instead of lugging around our treasured old garbage. We cling to this garbage because it is part of our story—who we believe we are. Our social environment continually and pervasively conditions us to harbor grudges, to feel resentment, fear, guilt, and revenge, and above all to express judgment about everyone and everything. These learned behaviors cause suffering principally to us, but also to others. It is a well-known psychological dynamic that the more we judge other people, the more we are unhappy ourselves. So why do we continue to behave in ways that cause us suffering? The explanation is not simple and represents the main body of this book. Based on the authors' experience, however, we propose that it is not difficult to learn to consciously transcend fear, resentment, and desperation for Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksPersonal GrowthFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
