There are several Methods for treatment of hydrocarbons such as physical, mechanical, chemical and biological methods. Broth media containing ACF (accommodated fraction), WSF (water soluble fractions) or anthracene were used separately as a sole carbon source. 17 fungal species were isolated from water and sediment of three selected stations (Port-Tawfik, El-Ziaytia and Attaka), then screened in each substrate. Capillary gas chromatography (CGC) analysis used to chemically profiling each substrate after inoculation. Our results showed that, Aspergillus flavus was the most effective of degradation ACF reach to (98.79 %). In case of WSF the isolate Penicillium chrysogenium was the highest percentage of degradation (98.53 %). Anthracene degradation after 2 weeks recorded (56.08 %) by using Cladosporium sp. In conclusion, the Gulf of Suez contain several promising fungal species that could be used in biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons as a save alternatives in marine ecosystem.Save to LibraryDownloadby Catrina The International Journal Of Environmental Sciences•  3  Fungi, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, BiodegredationTechnical and Economic Contributions in the Field of Monitoring and Reducing the Impact of the Oil and Gas Industry on the Environmental FactorsLike any other industrial activity, the production of hydrocarbons affects the environment both through the performance of actual technological process and through undesired accidents, which may occur.The paper presents technical and... moreLike any other industrial activity, the production of hydrocarbons affects the environment both through the performance of actual technological process and through undesired accidents, which may occur.The paper presents technical and economic contributions in the field of monitoring and reducing the ecological impact of petroleum exploitation on the environment and an analysis of technologies used to remove pollution from soils and the subsurface contaminated by hydrocarbons.

Non-exploitation of the bitumen deposits in the areas for commercial purpose has aggravated the level of pollution. The objective of this work was to develop a water decontamination facility for small-to- medium scale operation. A Bitumen Polluted Water Treatment System (BPWTS) was designed and fabricated using acrylic glass (Perspex) material and with appropriate facility for flow kinetics. The BPWTS comprised four columns for filtration and bioremediation. ProcessedChicken feather and African walnut (Plukenetia conophora) seed shells were biosorbents materials at stages 1 and 3, while stage 2 was for bioremediation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as inoculum and stage 4 was for water discoloration using activated charcoal. Bitumen-polluted water obtained from these affected streams and wells were run through the BPWTS and the pollution removal efficiency (RE) was determined. Treated water at each stage was tested for turbidity, pH value, suspended solids, toxicmetals and dissolved petroleum hydrocarbon. Suspended solids reduced from 1.2 × 103 to 6.2 × 10 mg/L in stage 1, indicating PCF’s good oleophilic properties. This prevented the bitumen solids from reaching other stages. At stage 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced concentrations of lead (1.0 × 10−2 to 1.0 × 10−3 mg/L), benzene (3.7 to 2.5 µg/L), p-xylene (3.2 to 1.2 µg/L) and o-xylene (3.2 to 1.2 µg/L). At stage 3, residual solids were removed and in stage 4 discoloration of water reduced from 15.60 to 0.98 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). Pollution indices of treated and untreated water samples were significantly different. The RE of the BPWTS were 95.0% for suspended solids, zinc 82.0%, benzene 70.0%, o-xylene 65.0%, p-xylene 65.0% and lead 62.0%, bringing the treated water to within permissible level for potable water. Decontamination technique developed is able to minimize associated health risks in the area.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eganoosi ATOJUNERE•Water and wastewater treatmentDevelopment of A Filtration and Bioremediation Technique for The Decontamination of Bitumen-Polluted WaterSave to LibraryDownloadby Eganoosi ATOJUNERE•Field Test on Cleaning of Oil Pollution on Nhatrang Beach of VietnamSave to LibraryDownloadby Miên Pham•  2  Environmental Science, BioremediationConstruction of potential bacterial consortia for efficient hydrocarbon degradationSave to LibraryDownloadby Debapriya Sarkar•  12  Chemistry, Hydrocarbon contamination, Hydrocarbon Biodegradation, Biological SciencesBiodegradation of phenol, anthracene and acenaphthene singly and consortium culture of indigenous microorganism isolates from underground coal gasification areaThe gasification of Coal has a potential for long term energy supply in the future by conversion of non-mineable coal seams to syngas for various industrial applications.

However, recalcitrant aromatic compounds such as phenol, anthracene, and acenaphthene from UGC are potential to contaminate groundwater, soil and the broader environment. Therefore, the polluted environment required bioremediation. The purpose of this study was to determine the capability of Bacillus velezensis and Stenotropromonas maltophilia isolated from the area of Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) on biodegradation of phenol, anthracene, and acenaphthene in the single and mixed cultures.

Some bacterial species were isolated from the Sarvestan oilfields (Iran, Fars province), then identified and applied for oil hydrocarbon decomposition. A carbon-free minimum medium (CFMM) containing 1% crude oil was used to isolate bacteria through incubation at 30°C in the dark at 200 rpm for 7 days. Different methods were used to identify the hydrocarbon oil decomposing bacteria: gram staining, squalene hydrolysis, catalase, production of arginine dihydrolase, gelatin liquefaction, hydrogen sulfide production, levan production, methyl red, oxidase, nitrite reduction, oxidative/fermentative, starch hydrolysis and Tween-80 hydrolysis tests. Nine different oil decomposing bacterial species were isolated. All the species grew well at 28 and 35°C, while four isolates containing of Bacillus sp. SA13, Pantoea sp. SA1112, Pseudomonas aeruginosa sp. SA21, and Bacillus sp. SA23 were capable of growing in a temperature of up to around 42°C. The minimum salt tolerance for isolates, except for Enterobacter sp. SA711, was 8%; Bacillus sp. SA212 had the highest tolerance of 15% sodium chloride. Acinetobacter sp. SA172, Enterobacter sp. SA711, Pseudomonas sp. SA75, Bacillus sp. SA212 and Bacillus sp. SA23 had the most growth rate in the CFMM. The highest percentages of oil removal obtained were 89% for Enterobacter sp. SA711, 86% for Acinetobacter sp. SA172, and 68% for Pseudomonas sp. SA75. The three isolated bacterial strains from the contaminated soil of the Sarvestan area had a good ability to degrade oil hydrocarbon. Therefore, they could be used commercially for the bioremediation of this region.Save to LibraryDownloadby Advances in Environmental Technology (AET) Journal•  4  Biodegradation, Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology, Contaminated Soils, Biochemical TestMicrobial community response and migration of petroleum compounds during a sea-ice oil spill experiment in SvalbardSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephane  Le Floch•  11  Environmental Science, Petroleum, Environmental Chemistry, International Marine Environmental LawBiodegradation Ability and Catabolic Genes of Petroleum-DegradingSphingomonas koreensisStrain ASU-06 Isolated from Egyptian Oily SoilPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are serious pollutants and health hazards.

Bioremediation is considered as one of the most promising technologies for the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The present study was investigated to isolate bacteria from contaminated soil of motor mechanic workshop and screened for degradation of kerosene oil by DCPIP test, and gravimetric analysis. The results revealed that THBC, THUBC and THUBC % were found to be 41± 1.7 x 10 5 CFU/g, 14 ± 1x 10 5 CFU/g and 34.15 ± 1.3 %. In the primary screening by DCPIP assay the isolate PHDB3 exhibited highest percentage of degradation 21.42% was identified as Proteus sp. The results of the gravimetric analysis showed that kerosene oil degradation percentage of Proteus sp. was 75% after 30 days of incubation. The Proteus sp. isolated in this study could be a potential agent for effective biodegradation of kerosene oil and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr.Veerapagu.

Previous information about the site revealed arsenic and hydrocarbons affection exceeding soil screening levels. A full characterisation of arsenic affection was thus performed. In this regard, the bioavailable fractions, arsenic speciation and grain-size distribution were determined. Two different polluted types of soils/fillers were identified. The first one is affected by non-bioavailability As(V) concentrations on the finer fraction, and the other one is affected by As(III) and As(V) with higher bioavailability than the other case, affecting all grain-size fractions homogeneously. Notably the textures are very heterogeneous within the site. On the other hand, hydrocarbons affection was also studied.

The distribution of n-alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in surface water contaminated with crude oil and their implications for environmental and human health were analyzed. Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) was determined using Gas Chromatography/Flame Ionization Detector (GC/FID). Four surface water samples were collected from the study area and one from the control site six months after an extensive oil spillage and petroleum-induced fire incidence in June 2016. The mean value of TPH obtained in surface water was 25.885±5.105mg/L. The study area had a significantly higher concentration of TPH than the control site. The concentrations of AHC, PAH, and PHC for the study area were recorded as 16.910±3.018, 8.944±2.122, and 25.885±5.105, respectively, while the concentrations of AHC, PAH, and PHC for the control samples analyzed were 1.716, 0.349, and 2.065, respectively. The study found positive correlations between aliphatic hydrocarbon and petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations, as well as between polyaromatic hydrocarbon and petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations, indicating similar sources and transport mechanisms for the pollutants. However, a weak positive correlation was found between aliphatic hydrocarbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon concentrations, suggesting potential differences in sources and transport mechanisms. The study area is under pollution threat, and the clean-up done previously after the spill was insufficient to restore the integrity of the environment. The findings highlight the need for urgent remediation measures to prevent further damage to the ecosystem and to safeguard human health.Save to LibraryDownloadby Isukuru Efe•  4  Water Pollution, Crude Oil, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, Polyaromatic hydrocarbonsCharacterization of Autochthonous Bacterial Isolates with The Potentiality to Degrade Spent Engine Oil from Contaminated Soil Area Enriched with Glycine maxThis study was conducted to identify and characterize bacteria capable of degrading spent oil contaminated soil.

Its extraction and processing generate processing waters contaminated by hydrocarbons which are harmful to both human health and the flora and fauna that come into contact with it. Hydrocarbon contamination can involve soil and water, and several technologies are used for recovery. The most used techniques for the recovery of spilt oil involve chemical-physical methods that can remove most of the pollutants. Among these, must consider the bioremediation by microorganisms, mostly bacterial capable of degrading many of the toxic compounds contained within the petroleum. Microalgae participate in bioremediation indirectly, supporting the growth of degrading bacteria, and directly acting on contaminants. Their direct contribution is based on the activation of various mechanisms ranging from the production of enzymes capable of degrading hydrocarbons, such as lipoxygenases, to the attack through the liberation of free radicals.

As the spilled oil can negatively affect the coastal-marine ecosystems, its transport and fates captured a significant interest of the scientific community and regulatory agencies. Typically, the environment has natural mechanisms (e.g., photooxidation, biodegradation, evaporation) to weather/degrade and remove the spilled oil from the environment. Among various oil weathering mechanisms, biodegradation by naturally occurring bacterial populations removes a majority of spilled oil, thus the focus on bioremediation has increased significantly.

However extensive use of water in many anthropogenic activities is leading to its pollution. The major concern is of textile industry where the consumption of water is maximum. The way the water is discharged into the water body is of main concern as no proper treatment is done in many cases or one can say that non proper facility is developed for the same. In this review we aim at the bioremediation of textile dyes. The main focus of review is on the microbial use for degrading the dyes that are discharged into the water bodies. Although several techniques are available for dye degradation but the bioremediation is most promising as it is easy to alter and more economical when applied to commercial scale.

Indigenous microorganisms with the capability of biodegrading hydrocarbon components can be used to improve the efficiency of microbial bioremediation technology. Here, oil-contaminated soils were collected from five oil refineries (Abadan, Isfahan, Tehran, Tabriz and Shiraz) for screening and isolation of geographically adaptive indigenous oil-degrading bacteria. Bacterial colonies from oil-contaminated soil samples were isolated, which were able to grow in a medium containing crude oil, light, and heavy diesel, as a sole carbon source. Twelve strains were isolated, purified, and identified, using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The isolates belonged to five species, including Achromobacter spanius, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Ochrobactrum intermedium, Citrobacter amalonaticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These bacterial strains were capable of growing in media containing crude oil, light and heavy diesel for 7 to 9 days and had the potential for biosurfactant production. These bacterial strains can be considered as geographically adaptive bacteria, creating preliminary data for further research to utilize their bioremediation potential.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zahra Alipour Asadabadai1, Mansoureh Malekian2†, Sayed Hossein Mirdamadian3 and Mohsen Soleimani2 and +1Journal of Soil Science Society of Iran•Evaluation of Hydrocarbon Emulsification and Heavy Metal Detoxification Potentials of Sophorolipid Biosurfactants Produced from Waste Substrates using Yeast and MushroomInsolubility challenges have reduced the efficiency and rate of environmental bioremediation of hydrophobic pollutants occurring in hydrocarbons, soil and water environments.
