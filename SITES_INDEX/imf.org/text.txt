The World Economic Outlook (WEO) database contains selected macroeconomic data series from the statistical appendix of the World Economic Outlook report, which presents the IMF staff's analysis and projections of economic developments at the global level, in major country groups and in many individual countries. The WEO is released in April and September/October each year.
Use this database to find data on national accounts, inflation, unemployment rates, balance of payments, fiscal indicators, trade for countries and country groups (aggregates), and commodity prices whose data are reported by the IMF.
Data are available from 1980 to the present, and projections are given for the next two years. Additionally, medium-term projections are available for selected indicators. For some countries, data are incomplete or unavailable for certain years.
The World Economic Outlook (WEO) database is now available in SDMX format from our Entire Dataset page. For more information about SDMX, please visit SDMX.org
Changes to the October 2022 Database
For Algeria, starting with the October 2022 WEO, total government expenditure and net lending/borrowing include net lending by the government, which mostly reflects support to the pension system and other public sector entities.
Ecuador’s fiscal sector projections, which were previously omitted because of ongoing program review discussions, are now included.
Tunisia’s forecast data, which were previously omitted because of ongoing technical discussions pending potential program negotiations, are now included.
Turkey is now referred to as Türkiye.
For Sri Lanka, certain projections for 2023–27 are excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign debt restructuring, following the recently reached staff-level agreement on an IMF-supported program.
For Venezuela, following methodological upgrades, historical data have been revised from 2012 onward. Nominal variables that were omitted from publication in the April 2022 WEO are now included.
