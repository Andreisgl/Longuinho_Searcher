from Wikipedia:
Yahoo! GeoCities is a Web hosting service. GeoCities was originally founded by David Bohnett and John Rezner in late 1994 as Beverly Hills Internet (BHI), and by 1999 GeoCities was the third-most visited Web site on the World Wide Web. In its original form, site users selected a "city" in which to place their Web pages. The "cities" were metonymously named after real cities or regions according to their content—for example, computer-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to "Hollywood"—hence the name of the site. Shortly after its acquisition by Yahoo!, this practice was abandoned in favor of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs.
In April 2009, approximately ten years after Yahoo! bought GeoCities, the company announced that it would shut down the United States GeoCities service on October 26, 2009. There were at least 38 million user-built pages on GeoCities before it was shut down.

      lIkA shuka'sshrii krishna karnAmRitam
With the enthusiasm given by our readers to 
                    proceed further in this long-forgotten lane of Sanskrit 
                    after vAlmIki rAmAyaNa, we are 
                    continuing to present some more legendary works in the 
                    series of word-for-word transliterations. Among them
                    Ritusamhāram, 
                    gīta-govindam are completed, while
                    raghuvamsham, harivamsham are yet 
                    to be completed. 
 
Earlier, bhārata sāvitri, 
                    an extinct text forming part of 
                    mahābhārata, is retrieved and presented here.
All these works are done with the fonts of Omkārananda 
                    Ashram, and the readers are requested to install Sanskrit 99 
                    and URW Palladio IT for works like 
                    Ritusamhāram, gīta-govindam and 
                    raghuvamsham. And fonts Sanskrit 98 and Translit 98 
                    for vālmiki rāmāyaNa. English 
                    text  is composed in Georgia font. All these fonts are 
                    available here:
                    
                    fonts.zip [544kb]
Even though these fonts are installed the 
                    result may be gibberish as main bowsers have stopped 
                    dispalying Indic fonts properly. Hence we suggest the 
                    reraders to use older versions of browsers which are 
                    somewhat faithful in rendering old fonts. In view of the 
                    failure of browsers to render Indic fonts properly, oflate 
                    we have resorted to give texts only in Itrans coding.
