Properties of this collection.
It has been several years since the last time we did this.
For this collection, several things were done:
1. Turned off duplicate detection.   This collection will be complete, as there is a
good chance we will share the data, and sharing data with pointers to random
other collections, is a complex problem.
2. For the first time, did all the different wikis.   The original runs were just against the 
enwiki.   This one, the seed list was built from all 865 collections.

Railroad Map of Trinidad
Description
                    
                        This map, produced by the Transportation Department of the United States Department of Commerce in 1925, shows the railroad network of Trinidad. The main rail line in Trinidad was the Trinidad Government Railway, which originally was built in 1876 to connect the major city of Port of Spain with Arima. It later was extended to other inland towns. In addition to railroad lines and tramways, the map shows towns and counties and county boundaries. Originally claimed for Spain by Christopher Columbus in 1498, Trinidad was seized by Britain in 1797. With its much smaller sister island of Tobago, it became a single British colony in 1889.  In the 19th century, the economy was dominated by agriculture, chiefly the production of sugarcane and cacao. Oil was discovered in 1857 and the petroleum industry developed from the 1860s onward. The colony of Trinidad and Tobago achieved independence in 1962.
