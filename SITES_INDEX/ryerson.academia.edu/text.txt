anika  kozlowskiToronto Metropolitan University,  School of Fashion,  Faculty Member +1Toronto Metropolitan University, School of Fashion, Faculty MemberToronto Metropolitan University, Environmental Applied Science and Management, Graduate StudentFashion ethics and sustainability+12Anika is completing her PhD in environmental sciences at Ryerson University in Toronto. Her dissertation focuses on the design process, sustainable business models and engaging consumers for value and consumption behaviour change. Since 2003 Anika has focused on sustainable fashion design, both through her education and community engagement. From teaching women how to sew and improving on environmental practices in Rwanda to working in numerous collectives locally, highlighting sustainable fashion in Toronto. Anika has won awards for her designs, presents her research at design conferences worldwide while continuing to design and consultant. Anika values the importance in developing research methods and design processes that drive sustainability and cross-disciplinary innovation. As a runner and marathoner, her work has been inspired by the global urban running movement and its community engagement through online social media platforms such as Instagram and Nike+. A global family, under the moniker “Bridge the Gap” empowers women, fosters a healthy lifestyle and creates true bonds that transcends borders. This continues to form the basis of her on-going research which focuses on craftsmanship, technology, consumer behaviours, engagement, value and processes related to the textile and clothing industry.Supervisors: Dr. Michal Bardecki and Dr. Cory Searcyless339 Followers41 Following2 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall14 Papers2 BooksPapersThe reDesign canvas: Fashion design as a tool for sustainabilityJournal of Cleaner ProductionSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An Active Learning approach, using the Think-Pair-Share (TPS) strategy may facilitate a more engaging and productive learning environment. There is a lack of literature that investigates the application of active learning in fashion design education. This study examined whether TPS activities could successfully engage students, facilitate learning, and contribute to a positive classroom experience in a beginner-level APD course.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Responses to these wide-scale impacts have focused on piecemeal strategies that lack a cohesive perspective. The notion of design thinking and a holistic viewpoint are increasingly being seen as valued strategies for developing a sustainable fashion system. Fashion designers generally lack the tools to enable change and are caught within a system that cannot fulfill the potential of design-driven solutions for sustainability. Transformations to the design process, business practices, consumer behaviours and supply-chain sustainability are needed. This dissertation presents a series of manuscripts investigating a re-conceptualization of fashion design for system sustainability. Concepts put forth in the first manuscript, Theorizing the Fashion System provide context for a design focus.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting has ncreased within the apparel industry as a response. This thesis presents a review of the CSR reporting on the websites of the 14 apparel brands belonging to the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. Qualitative and quantitative data are collected on all reported CSR initiatives, actions and indicators. The data are organized into the five elements that represent important aspects in developing a sustainable apparel system: product sustainability, design practice, sustainable supply-chain management, consumer engagement, and business innovation. A cross-case analysis of the apparel brands is conducted. The key findings of the study include a lack of comparability among reported CSR indicators. In addition, a similar distribution pattern of CSR indicators across the five elements was obse...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Micro-sized enterprises represent a significant portion of the fashion industry and can meaningfully contribute to the transition to a more sustainable apparel and textile industry. This paper addresses this gap through the development of an original design tool, the reDesign canvas, to support design entrepreneurs in developing sustainable fashion enterprises. Informed by design thinking and systems thinking, the canvas was developed based on an in-depth review of the academic literature and the collection of qualitative data. Qualitative data were gathered through both participatory action research (PAR) and interviews with 38 sustainable fashion design entrepreneurs and experts in sustainable fashion. Both the PAR and the interviews were used to test and refine the reDesign canvas in order to ensure it meets the needs of sustainable design entrepreneurs operating micro-sized companies. The final version of the canvas is based on 12 building blocks that a design entrepreneur would encounter in building a sustainable fashion brand. The reDesign canvas can help advance both the theory and practice of sustainable fashion design.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Design/methodology: A content analysis of the corporate sustainability reports, other documents and websites of the 14 SAC apparel brands was conducted to identify indicators related to sustainability. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on all reported sustainability initiatives, actions and indicators. A normative business model was developed for the categorization of the indicators and a cross-case analysis of the apparel brand’s sustainability reporting was conducted. Findings: Eighty-seven reported corporate sustainability indicators were identified. The study finds that there is a lack of comparability among them. The majority of the indicators dealt with performance in supply-chain sustainability while the least frequently reported indicators were in the areas of business innovation and consumer engagement. Originality: This paper provides one of the first in-depth reviews of the indicators reported by apparel brands within their websites and other forms of corporate sustainability reporting.

These elements include product sustainability, sustainable supply-chain management, design practice, business innovation, and consumer engagement. The model adopts a systems thinking approach in identifying elements within the fashion system and their organization. Typically within the field of sustainable fashion, the effort has been on technological modifications within the supply chain. Although these efforts can significantly reduce environmental impacts, the outsourced manufacturers are in control, thus limiting the influence of a fashion brand. The emphasis in the model is on those elements within the direct control of the business, particularly design practice. The holistic approach looks at how the design practice can evolve to increase sustainability within the supply chain, the product, innovative business models, and consumer consumption. By shifting focus to the design process, products can be designed to influence consumer behaviour, induce sustainable consumption, and reduce impact from use. Looking beyond the supply chain to include consumer behaviour, the development of sustainability-driven business models can be fostered in support of sustainable production and consumption. This research contributes an analysis of how the design process can support the development of new and competitive business models for a sustainable fashion industry.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
