Isaac and Nneka Moses, program coordinators
Goge Africa was founded by the duo of Isaac and Nneka Moses as a pan African cultural project. The program was conceptualized with aim of promoting African culture, music, food and her ways of life through television, radio and magazines.[1] The name Goge Africa, was culled from a musical instrument common among musicians from Northern part of Nigeria called Goge.[1]
According to AIT, "...every tribe, every African culture and tradition is brought to light in a celebratory and joyous manner. Africa has never looked more beautiful than it does on this wonderful show.".[2]
The TV version of the program started in the year 1999 when African programs were not popular on Nigerian TV.[3]
The show is watched by over 40 million television viewers across the globe.[1] In 2016, the two presenters of the show were inducted into the Hall of Fame by NBMA.[4]
