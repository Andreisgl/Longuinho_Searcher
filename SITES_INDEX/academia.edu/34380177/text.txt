Compared to natural XX females and XY males, XY and YY females and XX males expressed higher level of aggressiveness that could be related to higher levels of 17í µí»½-estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone, respectively. Our results suggest that the presence of a Y chromosome increases aggressiveness in females. However, since the same relationship between aggressiveness and the Y chromosome is not observed in males, we can hypothesize that the differences in aggressiveness are not directly dependent on the genotype but on the sex reversal procedures applied on young fry during their sexual differentiation to produce these breeders. These hormonal treatments could have permanently modified the development of the brain and consequently influenced the behavior of adults independently of their genotype. In both hypotheses (genotype or sex reversal influence), the causes of behavioral modifications have to be searched in an early modification of the brain sexual differentiation.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersMolecular Reproduction and DevelopmentThe sensitive period for male-to-female sex reversal begins at the embryonic stage in the Nile tilapia and is associated with the sexual genotype2014 • jean-francois baroillerDownload Free PDFView PDFLatin American Journal of Aquatic ResearchAtypical feminized male's agonistic behavior relative to males and females of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L2015 • Juan Pablo Alcántar VázquezEarly maturity during tilapia culture is a recurring problem. To avoid this, a series of techniques have been developed, including the production of YY-males. This technique involves the use of hormones to produce phenotypic females (XY genotype). However, incomplete transformations are frequently observed and the produced atypical feminized males (AFM) could display an ambiguity in the phenotypic expression of behavioral patterns. The aim of this study was to measure the frequency and intensity of aggressive behavior as well as the role that initial residence plays when involving three phenotypes (males, females and AFM). The experiment consisted of three stages. Resident fish were AFM in the first stage, males in the second and females in the third. In each stage the resident fish confronted males, females and AFM acting as intruders. Aggressive behavior was exercised more frequently by resident fish. Intersexual confrontations showed higher levels of aggression compared to intrasexual confrontations. The frequency of confrontations was not significantly different in confrontations involving AFM, however, differences were observed in intensity of aggression. It is possible that an incomplete transformation at physiological level could be responsible for an inaccurate decoding of signal during confrontations.Download Free PDFView PDFIOSR Journals   Determination Of The Most Appropriate Day To Introduce 17α- Methyl Testosterone Feed To Swim-Up Fry For Effective Sex Reversal In Nile Tilapia.2019 • IOSR JournalsMono-sex culture of male Nile tilapia is preferred because of their faster growth than females. This study was conducted to investigate fish growth performance and sex reversal efficiencies by oral MT administration. The Feeding on the hormone-treated diets was initiated at 2, 6 and 10 days after the yolk-sac disappearance. Three control treatments were setup for each treatment where fry were not exposed to MT. Water was replaced after every two days. Fry were fed 5% body weight three times daily at 10 am, 12 noon and 4pm. At the end of each experiment all fingerlings were dissected for gonadal sex determination using the aceto-carmine squash method. All the treatments containing MT produced significantly (p<0.05) higher proportion of males compared to the control treatment. The mean proportions of males from 2 and10 day-post hatch treatments were similar but differed significantly (p<0.05) from the day 6 post-hatch treatment. The highest percentage of 92.2 males was obtained from day 6 while the lowest 77.7% was obtained from day 10. The highest growth rate (0.21±0.08 day-1) was observed in day 6 and the lowest (0.13±0.02day-1) in the control treatment. In conclusion, MT influenced the sexual differentiation of in O. niloticus in favour of males. Day six post-hatch was the most effective timing in terms of male conversion rate. Oral feeding of the hormone treated diets enhanced post-fry growth. The day 6 post-hatch is highly recommended for the effective sex reversal of Nile tilapia.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological Genetics and PhysiologyBrief exposure of embryos to steroids or aromatase inhibitor induces sex reversal in Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus )2014 • Bernard UlysseThis study aimed to develop sex reversal procedures targeting the embryonic period as tools to study the early steps of sex differentiation in Nile tilapia with XX, XY, and YY sexual genotypes. XX eggs were exposed to masculinizing treatments with androgens (17α-methyltestosterone, 11-ketotestosterone) or aromatase inhibitor (Fadrozole), whereas XY and YY eggs were subjected to feminizing treatments with estrogen analog (17α-ethynylestradiol). All treatments consisted of a single or double 4-hr immersion applied between 1 and 36 hour post-fertilization (hpf). Concentrations of active substances were 1000 or 2000 μg l(-1) in XX and XY, and 2000 or 6500 μg l(-1) in YY. Masculinizing treatments of XX embryos achieved a maximal sex reversal rate of 10% with an exposure at 24 hpf to 1000 μg l(-1) of 11-ketotestosterone or to 2000 μg l(-1) of Fadrozole. Feminization of XY embryos was more efficient and induced up to 91% sex reversal with an exposure to 2000 μg l(-1) of 17α-ethynylestradio...Download Free PDFView PDFGeneral and Comparative EndocrinologyAndrogen and Estrogen Metabolism during Sex Differentiation in Mono-Sex Populations of the Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus2002 • Gene HinesDownload Free PDFView PDFLatin American Journal of Aquatic ResearchSex proportion in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus fed estrogen mixtures: a case of paradoxical masculinization2018 • Juan Pablo Alcántar VázquezYY technology has been developed in response to the demand of environment-friendly techniques to produce all-male populations in Nile tilapia culture. However, the first part of this technique still requires feminization of XY fry. Use of estrogen mixtures to achieve feminization has never been tested in Nile tilapia, so the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different combinations of the three most important estrogens (17-estradiol E2, diethylstilbestrol DES, and 17-ethinylestradiol EE2) on sex proportion, growth, and gonadal development. Mixtures evaluated were E2-DES, E2-EE2, DES-EE2, and E2-DES-EE2. No significant differences in growth were observed at the end of the experiment between control fish and fish fed estrogen mixtures. However, final survival was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in fish fed E2-DES and E2-DES-EE2. All estrogen mixture-treated groups produced progenies with a significantly higher (P < 0.001) proportion of males than the predicted 1:1 sex ratio. No significant differences were observed in gonadosomatic index between fish of the control group and fish fed estrogen mixtures. The proportion of deformed gonads was higher in groups fed E2-DES and E2-DES-EE2. The paradoxical masculinization observed in all estrogen mixtures was probably provoked by the interaction of estrogens with androgen receptors or the inhibition of aromatase expression, which resulted in testosterone accumulation and testis development. These results address the need for further research towards understanding the role of steroids in sexual development since these findings add to a short list of studies that report paradoxical effects after using steroids.Download Free PDFView PDFFeminization of the Nile tilapia 2015Raúl Moreno de la TorreDownload Free PDFView PDFResearch in agriculture, livestock and fisheriesDose Optimization of 17 α-Methyltestosterone to Maximize Sex Reversal of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis Niloticus)2023 • Sadia Shathi, Shyama DebDownload Free PDFView PDFTheoretical and Applied GeneticsSex determination in Sarotherodon (tilapia)1979 • Ramy AvtalionDownload Free PDFView PDFSteroidogenic and thermal control of sex in tilapia (O. niloticus): A reviewManoj T KambleIn tilapia production, early sexual maturation and unwanted reproduction have been controlled by different techniques (manual sexing, direct hormonal sex reversal, hybridization or genetic manipulation), practices and their appropriate application. Hormonal and environmental factors in sex differentiation can be exploited for commercial value in aquaculture. This paper reviews male and female tilapia differentiation methods and comparison between current treatments and high temperature treatment for the all male tilapia production. Sex reversal in tilapia is a complex process that involves both genetic sex determination and temperature linked sex determination with interplay of hormones and receptor activity. Genetic variation affects adaptation to temperature as seen in evidence of strain differences and ability to respond to temperature induced sex inversion at three different categories of response.
