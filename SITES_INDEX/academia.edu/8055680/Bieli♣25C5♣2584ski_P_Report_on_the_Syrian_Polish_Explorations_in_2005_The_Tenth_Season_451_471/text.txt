The overall objective was to establish the function of particular urban complexes and their continuation over time. Not the least, the stratigraphy of levels exposed in particular sectors of the site had to be correlated.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPolish Archaeology in the Mediterranean 18Bieliński, P., Tell Arbid.

A stepped terrace in front of the temple was investigated, leading to the discovery of a presumed ramp which apparently resolves the issue of access to the building. Another Ninevite 5 period building of possible religious function (‘Southwestern Shrine’) was discovered to the west. Further vestiges of this period in the form of architecture and an infant grave were found north and northeast of the temple. Investigations of a massive wall from the ED III period, pursued from the previous seasons, still failed to identify its function. In the course of work on this structure, an Akkadian house and street were excavated, and a Khabur Ware period chamber tomb was discovered.

Preliminary Report on the Results of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Seasons of Polish-Syrian Excavations, 511-536.2012 • Polish-Syrian Archaeological Expedition to Tell Arbid, Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean PCMA, Piotr  BielińskiAbstract: Excavations at Tell Arbid in the 2008 and 2009 reasons focused on Sector W-East with some work being undertaken in 2008 in Sector S at the top of the tell, near an ED III Public Building. Huge foundations from the Akkadian period were discovered in its vicinity, confirming the prominence of the Tell Arbid citadel in the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. In Sector W-East explorations covered the surroundings of the Southern Temple of Ninevite 5 period date. The temple proved to be standing on a stepped terrace(?), of which two steps were discovered, confirming the idea that some sort of open space in front of the temple entrance stretched to the south. A large L-shaped courtyard was excavated to the northwest of the temple and more Ninevite 5 period architecture was investigated to the northeast of the building. A so-called Great Wall (14 m long and up to 4 m wide), found southeast of the temple, is believed to date to the ED II period; whatever its function, the wall ceased to be used by the Akkadian period, as it was covered by architectural remains of this date.Download Free PDFView PDFPolish Archaeology in the Mediterranean 22Reiche, A., Smogorzewska, A., Ninevite 5 Kitchen from Tell Arbid (Area W), 371-386.2013 • Polish-Syrian Archaeological Expedition to Tell Arbid, Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean PCMA, Anna SmogorzewskaDownload Free PDFView PDFPolish Archaeology in the Mediterranean 22, PAM 22 (Research 2010)  Ninevite 5 kitchen from Tell Arbid (Sector W)  2013 • Andrzej  ReicheA Ninevite 5-period presumed kitchen discovered in 2010 at the site of Tell Arbid in northeastern Syria is discussed from the point of view of specific cooking installations and objects used for cooking and food processing. The kitchen was furnished with two hearths, a storage bin, two jars sunk in the floor and large fragments of pottery vessels, which could have been used for cooking, processing and storing foodstuffs. Cooking pots are the most numerous, but big bowls, common ware jars, lids and a small shovel were also part of the kitchen accessories.
