Over time, as we open our hearts and allow God to do a continued work in us, we’re equipped to develop a new normal, a new way of living. So today we’re looking at how we can live with a constant openness towards forgiveness, equipped to both receive it and offer it, that unforgiveness would no longer have space in our hearts. Our Scripture for today comes from Ephesians 4:26-27, and today's worship is Where Forgiveness Is by Sidewalk Prophets.  --   Thanks so much for listening to today’s podcast on living a lifestyle of forgiveness.  Every command God gives you, is for your benefit as well as the benefit of others. You and I are not meant to live with the weight of unforgiveness. As soon as you sense the need to ask for forgiveness, or offer forgiveness, do it. God has a lifestyle of continual forgiveness for you, that you might live a weightfree, abundant life in him.    Thanks again for listening. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and may God bless you as you seek him.   Released:Aug 17, 2023Format:Podcast episodeTitles in the series (40)First15 is a daily devotional written to help you connect with God.
