CAPE has the potential to be applied as a pharmaceutical as it possesses most of the pharmacological activities of propolis, such as anti-proliferative, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial. Its advantage is that it lacks some of the downsides of total propolis extracts, such as inability for unified standardization, which is cornerstone for implementing its therapeutic potential as a drug. The current paper provides an overview on the pharmacodynamic principles of CAPE. We present literature search outcomes form ClinicalTrials.gov database and from scientific publications, available on Scopus and Crossref databases. We take a round view of CAPE’s potential therapeutic implications in light of approved drugs with related modes of action.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yordan Yordanov•  20  Pharmacology, Immunology, Natural Products, PhytochemistryBacterial Growth Inhibitory Effect of Ceratonia siliqua L.

The business today is getting increasingly pressured to be more productive and efficient with less traditional resources. If we look at a typical production process, for instance, the level of automation and optimization that has permeated into the production floor is quite astounding. Many industries have had a tremendous impact in bringing to the market the automation and optimization solutions to streamline -the production floor. The other ends of the spectrum are the back-office transaction oriented processes like Inventory Management, Materials Management, Financials and so on, Therefore a lab’s ability to process data quickly and its ability to disseminate that information efficiently throughout the plant is vital for the success of the production process. Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) can help in managing the information flow within the lab and can be the modus operandi of connecting the lab with the rest of the organization. For instance, imagine all the information that is generated in a lab.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  17  Chemical Engineering, Pharmacology, Chemistry, Analytical ChemistryAre herbs always good for you?

For thousands of years, nature has been a source of therapeutic agents, and an impressive number of modern medicines have been isolated from natural plant sources. Phytochemicals are referred to as the biologically active compounds found in plants. In the cure and treatment of various diseases, these phytochemicals play a major role. It is necessary to have the means available to carry out a characterization of the crude extract to gain access to the therapeutic benefits of these plant species. As a key response to the challenge of detection, characterization and purification of compounds, this paper examines the advances in the high-pressure liquid chromatographic process. This paper focuses on HPLC, an important qualitative and quantitative technique that is commonly used for pharmaceutical and biological sample estimation. Introduction In traditional medicine, plants produce a wide variety of substances that can be used to treat both chronic and infectious diseases (Boligon et al, 2012) [1, 2]. More than 80 percent of the world's population relies on conventional medicine for their primary healthcare needs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Based on tradition, plants have provided a good source of a wide range of compounds such as alkaloids, phenolics, vitamins, terpenes and a number of other secondary metabolites rich in important bioactivities such as antioxidants, antibacterials, anti-cancer, antihepatotoxics, etc. The study of these plant species plays an important role in the discovery and creation of new drugs that in hope, had no side effects but were more successful than current synthetic drugs. However, in order to validate this conventional assertion, clinical trials are required to show the efficacy of a bioactive compound. Reis, Boligon 2014) [4]. Thus the detection, isolation, purification and characterization of phyto-constituents in plants of the active ingredients in the crude sample by means of analytical techniques plays an important role. The choice of plant material is an essential consideration for the overall success of any inquiry into phytochemical plant constituents. Given the large number of plant species that are potentially available for analysis, efficient systems for the rapid chemical and biological screening of plant extracts selected for investigation must be available. Plant extract contains numerous phyto-compounds of varying degrees of polarity and is still a common problem and key challenge in botanicals and herbal preparations for their extraction, isolation and characterization. By combining basic biological assays with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analyses, this can be accomplished. HPLC is an extremely flexible technique; it is the best, most effective, and quickest chromatographic technique for crude plant species quality control. It is an important qualitative and quantitative technique that is commonly used for pharmaceutical and biological sample estimation. This paper provides descriptions of the extraction, isolation and characterization of bioactive compounds from plant extract with traditional phytochemical screening assays and the use of enhanced HPLC chromatographic techniques.Save to LibraryDownloadby Vicky Oladi•  3  Phytochemistry, Pharmacognosy, HPLCThe Anti-Immobility Effect of Hyperoside on the Forced Swimming Test in Rats is Mediated by the D2-Like Receptors ActivationSave to LibraryDownloadby Andresa Betti•  23  Animal Behavior, Depression, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant BiologyEffect of some Indian herbs on macrophage functions in ochratoxin A treated miceSave to LibraryDownloadby Shekhar Chandu•  23  Immune response, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Traditional Medicine, Plant BiologyPharmacognostical Evaluation of Stem of Cissus Repanda Vahl, a Folk MedicineSave to LibraryDownloadby vinay shukla•PharmacognosyThe anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extractsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ampai Panthong•  16  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Ethnopharmacology, PharmacognosyAntioxidant Activity Assay of Alpha-mangostin for Amelioration of Kidney Structure and Function in Diabetic MiceThis research was aimed to investigate the ability of a alpha-mangostin compound derived from mangosteen pericarp to reduce plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine level, and also to ameliorate the damaged renal proximal tubular... moreThis research was aimed to investigate the ability of a alpha-mangostin compound derived from mangosteen pericarp to reduce plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine level, and also to ameliorate the damaged renal proximal tubular of the kidneys in diabetic mice. An in-vivo antioxidant test was conducted using male BALB/c mice. The mice were divided into two groups; normal control (KN) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Streptozotocin (STZ) induction was performed using multiple low-doses of 30 mg/kg injected for five consecutive days. The diabetic mice were separated again into three sub-groups; diabetic control (KD), diabetic mice treated with Metformin HCl (KM), and diabetic mice treated with alpha-mangostin. The alpha-mangostin treatment group was categorised based on the dose given; P1 (2 mg/kg body weight), P2 (4 mg/kg body weight) and P3 (8 mg/kg body weight). Before and after STZ injection, the body weight and fasting blood glucose were measured.

(roselle) sepals, commonly known as bissap is prepared as a cold drink which is widely drunk in Ghana and across West-Africa for their medicinal and nutritional properties. The plant is known to have anti-hypertensive, anti-hyperlipidemic, anticancer, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. For such a widely sold and used medicinal plant, it is important that simple but reliable parameters can be used to estimate the quality. This will reduce adulteration, improve quality and hence safeguard the consumer. This study was to examine simple parameters that can be employed to estimate the quality of dried whole and powdered samples of H. sabdariffa that are widely sold on the open West-African market. Methods: The parameters investigated were macroscopic, microscopic, phytochemical, physicochemical, microbiological, and fluorescence characteristics.

There are many areas in which titrimetric procedures are invaluable. The term titrimetric analysis refer to quantitative chemical analysis carried out by determining the volume of solution of accurately known concentration which is required to react quantitatively with a measured volume of a solution of the substance to be determined 1 . Indicators are dyes or pigments that can be isolated from a variety of sources, including plants, fungi, and algae. Almost any flower, for example, that is red, blue, or purple in color contains a class of organic pigments called anthocyanin&#39;s that change color with pH. The use of natural dyes as acid-base indicators was first reported in 1664 by Sir Robert Boyle in his collection of essays Experimental History of Colors.

Metformin HCl microspheres were prepared by using ethyl cellulose as a release retardant polymer by solvent evaporation method .Formulations F1, F2 and F3 were prepared using ethyl cellulose in the drug polymer ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. A plasticizer (N-dibutyl phthalate) was added in formulations F4,F5 and F6 .The prepared microspheres were evaluated for the parameters like Percentage yield, Particle size analysis, Micromeritic properties like angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index, Hausner’s ratio, melting point determination, drug content estimation, microencapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release studies. The in vitro release of Metformin HCl was slow and extended over longer period of time. As the concentration of polymer was increased, the drug release was decreased. The drug release was found to be slow in formulations F4, F5 and F6 when compared to F1, F2 and F3. Thus the study clearly indicated a promising potential of sustained release Metformin HCl microspheres containing ethyl cellulose as rate controlling polymer for effectively treating diabetes mellitus.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal for Pharmaceutical Research Scholars  (IJPRS)•  32  Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Pharmacoepidemiology, PharmacogenomicsMacrocyclic Budmunchiamine Alkaloids from Albizia lebbek �Save to LibraryDownloadby Ajay Kumar Dixit•  8  Natural Products, Pharmacognosy, Structural Analysis, Biological SciencesArenosclerins AC and Haliclonacyclamine E, New Tetracyclic Alkaloids from a Brazilian Endemic Haplosclerid Sponge Arenosclera b rasiliensisSave to LibraryDownloadby Eduardo  Hajdu•  15  Natural Products, Brazil, Pharmacognosy, Magnetic Resonance SpectroscopyHypoglycemic activity of Bauhinia candicans in diabetic induced rabbitsSave to LibraryDownloadby Orlando Fuentes•  14  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Pharmacognosy, PhytotherapySafety evaluation of neem (Azadirachta indica) derived pesticidesSave to LibraryDownloadby Joop Van Loon•  25  Animal Studies, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, EthnopharmacologyNovel cyclopeptide and unique flavone from Desmos rostrata.
