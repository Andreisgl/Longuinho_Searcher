Types of biostimulants comprise amino acids, humic substances, algae extracts, microbial -based products and others (Paradikovi et al., 2011; Ertani et al., 2013). The conversion of organic wastes into valuable earthworm fertilizer either in solid as in liquid form is a interesting alternative path for organic fertilizer production (Zandonadi & Busato, 2012). In fact, it was showed that 36,500 tonnes of waste can be transformed per year in vermicompost by an economic and environmental-friendly technique (Quintern et al., 2013). Agro-industrial residues should to be considered as source of nutrients and plant growth regulators for use as alternative fertilizers or fertilizers additives. The present study was undertaken to establish if biostimulants differently extracted from vermicompost causes root development and how mineral nutrients and plant growth substances are associated to different extrac...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRevista Brasileira de Engenharia Agrícola e AmbientalOrganomineral phosphate fertilization in millet in sandy soilRoberto Claudio Fernandes F PompeuEvaluation of fertilizers is an important premise, given the need for knowing new alternative sources to increase the efficiency in the use of nutrients, especially phosphorus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth of millet cultivated in sandy soil under phosphorus doses and sources. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, in Sobral, CE, in soil with low phosphorus concentration in the randomized block experimental design, with two sources (monoammonium phosphate - MAP and organomineral fertilizer prepared with MAP and organic compost of waste from small ruminant production - OMF) and four doses of P2O5 (35, 70, 140 and 210 kg ha-1), plus an additional treatment without phosphate fertilization, with three replicates, conducted in the second half of 2015. The variables measured were dry mass production, phosphorus accumulation in the plant and agronomic, physiological and recovery efficiencies. Evaluations were carried out in two cuts in millet plants(65 and...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Agricultural ScienceOrganic and Mineral Fertilizer on the Initial Development and Nutrition of JatrophaReginaldo Ferreira SantosJatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is an herbaceous plant, perennial, belonging to the family of Euphorbiaceaes. Jatropha’s extract is used for the harvest of fruits, high amount of nutrients and, if not properly fertilized, can lead to the impoverishment of the soil over the years of cultivation. Thus, in this present work, we have a concern with the importance of fertilization. The experiment was conducted under field conditions in the 2014/2015 agricultural year, in São Jorge do Patrocínio, State of Parana, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with five replications and five treatments, totaling 25 installments. The treatments were as follows: organic fertilization (total rate: 2,800 g plant-1), mineral fertilizers with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (total rate: 174.4 g plant-1, and 13.2 g plant-1 of urea, 141.2 g plant-1 of superphosphate and 20 g plant-1 of potassium chloride), 75% organic fertilizer + 25% mineral, 50% organic fertilizer + 50% miner...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Soil ScienceManagement of the Cerrado soils of Brazil: a review1983 • wenceslau goedertDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Plant NutritionMethodology for Evaluation of Lowland Rice Genotypes for Nitrogen Use Efficiency2003 • Virupax  BaligarDownload Free PDFView PDFComunicata ScientiaeChickpea production in response to fertilization with zinc and doses of phosphorus2020 • Maria Nilfa Almeida NetaChickpea cultivation in Brazil has not yet been consolidated, and studies aiming at the adequate nutritional management for this crop are necessary. This work aimed to evaluate the production of chickpea plants (cultivar BRS Aleppo) subjected to fertilization with zinc and P doses. The experimental was completely randomized, with four replications, in a 3 x 5 factorial scheme, corresponding to three fertilization treatments with Zn (without Zn addition; 50% of Zn applied at sowing, via soil + 50% applied at flowering, via leaves; and 100% applied at sowing, via soil) and five doses of phosphorus (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg ha-1 of P2O5). The 100-grain mass (M100), pod mass (MV), number of pods (NV), number of grains (NG), total grain mass (MGT), yield (PROD), dry matter of the shoot part (MSPA) and plant residues (MSRV), and agronomic efficiency (EA) were characterized. There was an isolated effect of the P doses on the M100, MGT, PROD, MSPA, and MSRV characteristics.

Field trial was conducted in the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria on leached chernozem subsoil type and no irrigation. The next treatments were tested: i) for fertilization as follows: N0P0K0 (control); N60P100K80 (an accepted technology); N23P100K35 (nitrogen was applied 1/2 in first year of growing and 1/2 in third year); N23P100K35 (nitrogen was supplied pre-sowing); N35P80K50, and Аmophose - 250 kg/ha, calculated at fertilizing rates N27P120K0; ii) for soil cultivation as follows: soil loosing 10-12 cm, plough at depth 12-15 cm, 22-24 cm (an accepted technology), 18-22 cm and 30-35 cm. It was found that soil cultivation and mineral fertilization had effect on nitrogen use efficiency and life cycle of root nodules in Alfalfa. Nitrogen use efficiency was found to be highest at N23P100K35 and plough at the depth of 22-24 cm....Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
