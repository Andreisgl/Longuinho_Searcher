The question entails, from a Gramscian perspective, the possibility of resolving and organically synthesizing a series of antinomies that State hegemony tends to keep separated, both conceptually and practically: coercion and consent; intellectuals and masses; theory and practice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Focusing primarily on the issue of historicist relativism gleaned first in the Theory of the Novel, the essay argues for a dialectical Lukács intent in avoiding the pratfalls, to paraphrase from History and Class Consciousness, of a dogmatic metaphysics on the one hand, and an equally dogmatic relativism on the other.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing from works on the subject such as Anibal Quijano&#39;s &quot;Coloniality of Power, Eurocentrism, and Latin America&quot; (2000), Raewyn Connell&#39;s Southern Theory (2007), and Boaventura de Sousa Santos&#39;s Conocer desde el Sur (2006) but also from a long Italian Marxist tradition that goes from Antonio Gramsci&#39;s &quot;Some Aspects of the Southern Question&quot; (1926) through Franco Cassano&#39;s Southern Thought and Other Essays on the Mediterranean (1996) to Franco Piperno&#39;s workerist Elogio dello spirito pubblico meridionale [Praise of the Southern Public Spirit] (1997), this essay considers the Global South as a possible commonplace where European Marxism and global post-colonial and de-colonial movements may meet.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Discreet Charm of the Arabist Theory: Juan Andrés, Historicism, and the De-Centering of Montesquieu's EuropeEuropean History Quarterly,  2006Expelled from Spain in 1779, the Jesuit Juan Andrés moved to Parma in Italy, and published a seve... more Expelled from Spain in 1779, the Jesuit Juan Andrés moved to Parma in Italy, and published a seven-volume history of nothing less than the literatures of the whole world – ‘Of the Origins and Progress of all Literatures’. Andrés attempted to found literary historiography as a critical method opposed to the Francocentrism of classicist aesthetics. If French classicism had labeled southern literatures (Spanish and Italian) as unreasonable and unworthy of entering modern Europe&#39;s republic of letters, historicism was the conviction that every civilization and every period has its own possibilities of aesthetic perfection. In so doing, Andrés was pitting a method of critical historiography against Montesquieu&#39;s and the philosophers’ own philosophy of history.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By the middle of the eighteenth century, the monogenetic assumption that humankind was of a single Adamitic origin, created by one God, and universally attending to one divinely ordained natural law, had already fallen into disrepute under the attack of Reason; once Reason too, along with its presumption of one ‘unchanging human nature’, was relativized after the European discoveries of different cultures and ancient civilizations, a new outlook on life, which Meinecke called historismus, ‘rose’ to change once and for all European culture’s very understanding of its world.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
