The method is based on pattern recognition and data analysis algorithms. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the complexity of the data to two or three dimension. PCA involves a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of variables, which may be correlated, into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called&amp;amp;quot; principal components&amp;amp;quot;.

Thi... more Abstract Fault Detection and Diagnostic (FDD) is usually employed for maintenance management. This paper presents an intelligent system applied to FDD. The method is based on a dynamic B-spline approximation. In case that the fault is verified, then the probability of failure is calculated by employing the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) technique. A Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) is used to provide an alternative to the traditional cutest-based methods for FTA. The BDD method does not analyse the FTA directly, but converts the tree to a BDD that represents ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is achieved by developing an algorithm that takes advantage of three empirical criteria simultaneously capable of detecting faults from records of measurements of force against time. The system is dynamic in several respects: the base reference data is computed using all the curves free from faults as they are encountered in the experimental data; the algorithm that uses the three criteria ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
