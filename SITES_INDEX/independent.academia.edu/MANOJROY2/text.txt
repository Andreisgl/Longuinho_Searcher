Quadriparesis due to Gitelman′s syndrome diagnosed with thiazide diuretic test responseSaudi Journal of Kidney Diseases and Transplantation,  2016Gitelman&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s syndrome is characterized by h... more Gitelman&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s syndrome is characterized by hypocalciuria, severe hypomagnesemia, and prominent muscular involvements such as fatigue, weakness, cramps, and tetany. It is due to mutations in the thiazide sensitive NaCl co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubule. The administration of thiazide diuretics may induce a subnormal increase of urinary Cl(-) excretion in patients with Gitelman&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s syndrome, consistent with the hypothesis that less than normal Cl(-) is reabsorbed by the thiazide-inhibitable transporter in Gitelman&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s syndrome. Thus, we report a case of Gitelman&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s syndrome presenting with quadriparesis diagnosed by using thiazide clearance test.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
