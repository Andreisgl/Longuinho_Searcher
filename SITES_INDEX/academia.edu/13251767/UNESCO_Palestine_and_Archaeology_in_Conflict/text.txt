It begins by considering the drafting of the clause, before analysing subsequent agreements between Israel, Palestine, and Jordan. The article then turns to history to explore the origins of Jordan’s special role, which amounted to a particular rule of customary international law, from 1967, when Israel recognised that special role after it occupied East Jerusalem, until 1994, when it was codified in the Peace Treaty. The article concludes by explaining that Jordan’s special role is comprised of its custodianship of the Muslim holy shrines in Jerusalem, with its attendant duties of maintaining, protecting, and regulating access to the shrines and that Israel is obligated to give due regard to Jordan’s primary role in the exercise of these duties within the spaces of these shrines.Download Free PDFView PDFA Companion to Ancient Near Eastern Art, ed.

Until now the duties to protect such identities have been fragmented as the various communities are in charge of what is mostly considered to be their own heritage. This paper discusses the question of whether more neutral and internationalized protection, that would go further than the World Heritage Convention regime, is advisable and feasible.Download Free PDFView PDFFinding Jerusalem: Archaeology between Science and IdeologyFinding Jerusalem: Archaeology between Science and Ideology2017 • Katharina GalorDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
