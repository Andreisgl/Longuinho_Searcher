First, different physical schemes (land-surface process, cumulus, and radiation parameterizations) in RegCM4 were applied to generate 12 single forecasts. Second, the simple ensemble forecasts were generated through the combinations of those different physical formulations. Three subclimate regions (R1, R2, R3) of northern Vietnam were separately tested with surface observations and a reanalysis dataset (Japanese 55-year reanalysis (JRA55)). The highest sensitivity to the mean monthly temperature forecasts was shown by the land-surface parameterizations (the biosphere−atmosphere transfer scheme (BATS) and community land model version 4.5 (CLM)). The BATS forecast groups tended to provide forecast...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Pathways of Oil Spills from Potential Cuban Offshore Exploration: Influence of Ocean CirculationJournal of Marine Science and EngineeringThe DeepWater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) in 2010 raised the public awareness o... more The DeepWater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) in 2010 raised the public awareness on potential spills from offshore exploration activities. It became apparent that knowledge of potential oil pathways in the case of a spill is important for preparedness and response. This study focuses on such scenarios from potential oil spills in the Cuban Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a vast area in the GoM and the Straits of Florida that has not received much attention in oil spill studies, even though this region has been under evaluation for oil exploration. The Cuban EEZ is also in the crossroads of heavy tanker traffic, from the areas of intense oil exploration in the Northern GoM to the adjacent Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The study also evaluates how the oil transport and fate are influenced by the main circulation patterns of the GoM, such as the Loop Current (LC) system and the mesoscale dynamics inside the Straits of Florida, such as the Florida Current (FC) and the ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The model was used to simulate two periods of the 2010 DeepWater Horizon oil spill. Metocean forcing data were taken from the data-assimilative GoM-HYCOM 1/50 ∘ ocean model with realistic daily river input and global forecast products of wind and wave parameters from ECMWF. The simulations were initialized from satellite observations of the surface oil patch. The effect of using a newly developed parameterization for oil droplet size distribution was studied and compared to a traditional algorithm. Although the algorithms provide different distributions for a single wave breaking event, it was found that the net difference after long simulations is negligible, indicating that the outcome is robust regarding the choice of parameterization. The effect of removing the river outflow was investigated to showcase effects of river induced front...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Impacts of Different Physical Parameterization Configurations on Widespread Heavy Rain Forecast over the Northern Area of Vietnam in WRF-ARW ModelAdvances in MeteorologyThis study investigates the impacts of different physical parameterization schemes in the Weather... more This study investigates the impacts of different physical parameterization schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the ARW dynamical core (WRF-ARW model) on the forecasts of heavy rainfall over the northern part of Vietnam (Bac Bo area). Various physical model configurations generated from different typical cumulus, shortwave radiation, and boundary layer and from simple to complex cloud microphysics schemes are examined and verified for the cases of extreme heavy rainfall during 2012–2016. It is found that the most skilled forecasts come from the Kain–Fritsch (KF) scheme. However, relating to the different causes of the heavy rainfall events, the forecast cycles using the Betts–Miller–Janjic (BMJ) scheme show better skills for tropical cyclones or slowly moving surface low-pressure system situations compared to KF scheme experiments. Most of the sensitivities to KF scheme experiments are related to boundary layer schemes. Both configurations using KF or BMJ schem...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The model system is used to simulate the 2010 DeepWater Horizon oil spill. Metocean forcing data are taken from the GoM-HYCOM 1/50° ocean model with realistic river input and ECMWF global forecast products of wind and wave parameters with 1/8° resolution. The simulations are initialized from satellite observations of the surface oil patch. OpenOil includes most of the relevant processes, such as emulsification, evaporation, wave entrainment, stranding and droplet formation. The model takes account of the actual oil type and properties, using the ADIOS oil weathering database of NOAA. The effect of using a newly developed parameterization for oil droplet size distribution is studied and compared to a traditional algorithm.

Monsoon-Induced Surge during High Tides at the Southeast Coast of Vietnam: A Numerical Modeling StudyGeosciencesIn this study, monsoon-induced surge during high tides at the Southeast coast of Vietnam was anal... more In this study, monsoon-induced surge during high tides at the Southeast coast of Vietnam was analyzed based on the observed tide data at the Vung Tau station in the period between 1997—2016. Specifically, the surge was determined by removing the astronomical tide from the observed total water level. The two-dimensional Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS 2D) was applied to simulate the surge induced by monsoons during spring tide. The surge observations showed that the change of peak surge did not follow a clear trend, of either an increase or decrease, over time. A peak surge of over 40 cm appeared mainly in October and November, although the peak of the astronomical tide was higher in December. ROMS 2D was validated with the observational data, and the model could sufficiently reproduce the wind-induced surge during high tides. This study therefor ere commends for ROMS 2D to be used in operational forecasts in this area.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC, NE Atlantic) and adjacent areas have been subject to increased focus by the oil industry. In addition to extreme depths, metocean conditions in this region characterise an environment with high waves and strong winds, strong currents, complex circulation patterns, sharp density gradients, and large small- and mesoscale variability. These conditions pose operational challenges to oil spill response and question the suitability of current oil spill modelling frameworks (oil spill models and their forcing data) to adequately simulate the behaviour of a potential oil spill in the area. This article reviews the state of knowledge relevant to deepwater oil spill modelling for the FSC area and identifies knowledge gaps and research priorities.

The purpose of the tests was to record the noise from controlled explosions of unconfined plastic explosive at various locations in the forest to aid in the development of predictive methodologies for determining noise levels around forested test regions and bombing/firing ranges. This information is valuable to both test organizations and military units as a management tool to control noise output into the neighboring communities. Sound pressure and ground motion measurements were made by agencies from five different countries at locations with distances less than 1 and up to 23 km from an explosive source. At these locations, measurements were also made at various heights up to 30 m and below the ground surface. The source size was varied in yield and the location of the source was moved from test to test. Extensive weather measurements were also made within each measurement array from ground based systems and radiosondes reaching up to several hundreds of meters. In addition to the aforementioned, several measurements were taken to determine the impedance of the ground cover and snow covered ground, the density of the foliage, and the depth and nature of the snow cover „depending on the winter or summer conditions.... Currently, the data from the measurements „numbering nearly 80 000 separate recordings... are being stored in a database which is available for analysis and use by interested agencies. This paper provides an overview of this test series, the measurements made, the current status of the project, and the plans for the future and forms an introduction to the more detailed presentations which follow.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
