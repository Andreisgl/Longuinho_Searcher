Bernard Peters (born Bernhard Pietrowski in 1910 in Posen, Germany - February 2, 1993 in Copenhagen)[citation needed] was a nuclear physicist, with a specialty in cosmic radiation. He was a recipient of the Padma Bhushan, the third highest Indian civilian award.[1]
Life[edit]
Towards the end of the First World War, his father, pharmacology researcher and physician, sent him to the Black Forest to a farmer so he could obtain food in exchange for manual labor.
In 1942, under the direction of Robert Oppenheimer, Peters completed his doctorate in physics.[2] During his time at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory Peters was active in the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians, a labor union affiliated to the Congress of Industrial Organizations.[3]
In J Robert Oppenheimer's 1949 House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Peters was accused of being a communist sympathizer, a "crazy person" and "quite a red" by Oppenheimer. The Rochester Times-Union broke the story a few days later, and Peters soon realized that his academic career in the US was affected. Peters could not find work in the United States.[4] In 1951, he left the country to Mumbai, India, where he continued to study cosmic rays for eight years. Homi J. Bhabha, after consulting Nehru, helped him move out on immigrating to India. Bernard Peters was invited by Bhabha to Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1951. Over the next four decades, he directed several studies on cosmic rays.[5]
Peters died February 2, 1993, in Copenhagen, Denmark.[citation needed]
