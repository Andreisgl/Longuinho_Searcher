Coordinating requirements engineering (RE) and evaluation studies across heterogeneous technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environments is deemed challenging, because each of them is situated in a specific organizational, technical and socio-cultural context. We have dealt with such challenges in the project of ROLE (http://www. role-project. eu/) in which five test-beds are involved in deploying and evaluating Personal Learning Environments (PLEs). They include Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and global ...Download Free PDFView PDFFORGE : an eLearning framework for remote laboratory experimentation on FIRE testbed infrastructure2017 • Johann M Marquez-BarjaThe Forging Online Education through FIRE (FORGE) initiative provides educators and learners in higher education with access to world-class FIRE testbed infrastructure. FORGE supports experimentally driven research in an eLearning environment by complementing traditional classroom and online courses with interactive remote laboratory experiments. The project has achieved its objectives by defining and implementing a framework called FORGEBox. This framework offers the methodology, environment, tools and resources to support the creation of HTML-based online educational material capable accessing virtualized and physical FIRE testbed infrastruc- ture easily. FORGEBox also captures valuable quantitative and qualitative learning analytic information using questionnaires and Learning Analytics that can help optimise and support student learning. To date, FORGE has produced courses covering a wide range of networking and communication domains.
