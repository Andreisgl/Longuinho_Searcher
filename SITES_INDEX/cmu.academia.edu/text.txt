Charting the New Frontier in Library Publishing: Using Janeway as an Open-Source Library Publishing PlatformAs the current institutional repository and publishing landscapes evolve, libraries must assess, ... more As the current institutional repository and publishing landscapes evolve, libraries must assess, adopt, and adapt the tools and platforms available to provide their library publishing services. Additionally, as options in both the vendor-hosted and open-source solution markets evolve and become available, library publishers should strike a balance between adopting and/or adapting solutions that will best meet the needs of their service models and communities efficiently and cost effectively. Beginning in 2017, Carnegie Mellon University began to transition its institutional repository service from Digital Commons to Figshare. Although the new repository service would expand features by also offering a data repository, this would leave Carnegie Mellon without a suitable publishing platform. While satisfied to use a hosted solution for its repository, the University Libraries wanted to diversify its dependence on vendor-hosted platforms by implementing an open-sourced publishing solut...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It documents the first phase (2018-2019) of the &quot;Frakenstein Variorum&quot;, a project to collate the textual changes between multiple editions of Frankenstein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our goal is to digitally collate the five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831. We launched our project in response to the bicentennial of Frankenstein&#39;s first publication in 1818, thinking only to improve the comparison view of the 1818 and 1831 editions available on Romantic Circles.&lt;br&gt; Along the way our project has grown into a more comprehensive effort to revive and rework earlier ambitious digital editions of the novel, from the Pennsylvania Electronic Edition of the mid 1990s onward.

Gothic Science Fiction: 19S0-2010. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2011. xix + 219 pp. ISBN 9781846317071. $95.00 he.Reviewed by Rikk MulliganOn first blush, the title would seem to be an oxymoron, incompatible genres given Gothic&#39;s use of the supernatural, with its underlying irrationality in apparent conflict with the rationality and causality of sf. But to any fan or critic familiar with the Alien franchise (films and graphic novels), the dystopian universe of Warhammer 40K (1987), or the current blending of alternate history and Victorian-era technology in the steampunk subgenre, gothic sf has a long line that runs through Richard Matheson&#39;s I Am Legend (1954), multiple works by H. G. Wells, and to the roots of the genre in Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein (1818).
