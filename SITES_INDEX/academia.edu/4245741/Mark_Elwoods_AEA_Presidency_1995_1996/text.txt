Research and clinical practice evaluations are essential in determining if existing programs to reduce this inequality gap will actually be effective. However, methodological rigour appears to be fundamentally lacking in the current evidence base with concerns that the absence of appropriate evaluations alongside these programs may result in implementation of ineffective practices and poor disease management. This article highlights some of the existing barriers for conducting research in collaboration with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and provides options to consider when addressing these issues.Download Free PDFView PDFAustralasian EpidemiologistThe Australasian Epidemiological Association – membership profile and their views on the Association's future strategic directions 2011 • Rosanne  Freak-PoliDownload Free PDFView PDFAustralia and New Zealand Health PolicyThe epidemiology workforce: are we planning for the future?2009 • Catherine BennettDownload Free PDFView PDFLandscaping capacity building initiatives in epidemiology in India: bridging the demand supply gapSanjay ZodpeyDownload Free PDFView PDFHuman Resources for HealthCentral America Field Epidemiology Training Program (CA FETP): a pathway to sustainable public health capacity development2008 • Augusto LópezDownload Free PDFView PDFConfronting zoonoses through closer collaboration between medicine and veterinary medicine (as 'one medicineLaura KahnDownload Free PDFView PDFHealth SecurityStrengthening Global Health Security Through Africa's First Absolute Post-Master's Fellowship Program in Field Epidemiology in Uganda2018 • Alex R ArioUganda is prone to epidemics of deadly infectious diseases and other public health emergencies. Though significant progress has been made in response to emergencies during the past 2 decades, system weaknesses still exist, including lack of a robust workforce with competencies to identify, investigate, and control disease outbreaks at the source. These deficiencies hamper global health security broadly. To address need for a highly competent workforce to combat infectious diseases, the Uganda Ministry of Health established the Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP), the advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), closely modeled after the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program. The 2-year, full-time, non–degree granting program is the first absolute post-master’s FETP in Africa for mid-career public health professionals. Fellows gain competencies in 7 main domains, which are demonstrated by deliverables, while learning through service delivery 80% of the time in the ministry of health. During 2015-2017, PHFP enrolled 3 cohorts of 31 fellows. By January 2018, PHFP had graduated 2 cohorts (2015 and 2016) of 19 fellows. Fellows were placed in 17 priority areas of the ministry of health. They completed 153 projects (including 60 outbreak investigations, 12 refugee assessments, 40 surveillance projects, and 31 applied epidemiologic studies), of which 49 involved potential bioterrorism agents or epidemic-prone diseases. They made 132 conference presentations, prepared 40 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication (17 published as of December 2017), and produced 3 case studies. Many of these projects have resulted in public health interventions that led to improvements in disease control and surveillance systems. The program has produced 19 issues of ministry of health bulletins. One year after graduation, graduates have been placed in key public health decision-making positions. Within 3 years, PHFP has strengthened global health security through improvement in public health emergency response; identification, investigation and control of outbreaks at their sources; and documentation and dissemination of findings to inform decision making by relevant stakeholders.

This article summarizes findings of the 2009 assessment and analyzes five-year (2004-2009) trends in the epidemiology workforce. Online surveys collected information from all 50 states and the District of Columbia about the number of epidemiologists employed, their training and education, program and technologic capacity, organizational structure, and funding sources. State epidemiologists were the key informants; 1,544 epidemiologists provided individual-level information. The number of epidemiologists in state health departments decreased approximately 12% from 2004 to 2009. Two-thirds or more states reported less than substantial (&lt; 50% of optimum) surveillance and epidemiology capacity in five of nine program areas. Capacity has diminished since 2006 for three of four epidemiology-related ...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational  …Bontempo, K. & Levitzke-Gray, P.
