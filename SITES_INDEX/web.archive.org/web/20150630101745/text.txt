 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. 
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.
Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)
  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.
This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

Copyright Overview
 
What is copyright?
Copyright is a federal law.   It is Title 17 of   the United States Code. 
Copyright is the right of   authors to control the use of their work for a limited period of time. 
A copyrighted work must be   an original work of authorship which is fixed in a tangible medium of   expression. 
  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
Where did copyright law originate?
Copyright law   originated with the United States Constitution. In Article I, Section 8, the   Constitution states that "Congress shall have the power...To promote the   Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors   and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries". 
The Copyright Office of the   Library of Congress is responsible for overseeing the administrative functions   of the copyright law. 
Congress enacts copyright   laws. 
The Federal courts   interpret and enforce the copyright law. 
  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
Why is copyright law important?
Copyright law has a dual role. It   provides exclusive rights to authors in order to protect their work for a   limited period of time but it was also established to promote creativity and   learning.
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
When does a work become copyrighted?
A work becomes copyrighted when it is fixed* in a tangible medium of expression. After March 1, 1989 works no   longer require a copyright notice (© or the word copyright, the author´s name and   the year of publication). Copyright registration is also no longer required.   However, it is wise to affix a copyright notice to works so that the owner of   the copyright can be easily identified.
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
What can be copyrighted?
Eight categories of works   are copyrightable: 
Literary, musical and   dramatic works. 
Pantomimes and   choreographic works. 
Pictorial, graphic and   sculptural works. 
Sound recordings. 
Motion pictures and other   AV works. 
Computer programs. 
Compilations of works and   derivative works. 
Architectural works. 
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
What cannot be copyrighted?
Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, and processes are not copyrightable.
 
Example: The list of ingredients for recipes are not copyrightable. However, the recipes' instructions are protected.
 
 
Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans are not copyrightable.
 
Example:  Nike's slogan "Just do it" is not copyrightable. However, a slogan can receive trademark protection as is the case in the example.
 
 
Facts, news, and research are not copyrightable. 
 
Example:  A standard calendar.
 
 
Works in the public domain are not copyrightable.
 
Example 1:  Works created by United States government employees, where the works they created are a result of what they were hired to do.  
Example 2:  Work published in the United States prior to 1923.
 
 
Works that are not fixed in a                    tangible medium of expression.
 
 
Example:  Extemporaneous speeches that are not written or recorded.

What are the copyright holder's exclusive rights?
The owner of a copyright has   six exclusive rights:
To reproduce the   work. 
To distribute the   work. 
To create derivative   works*. 
To publicly perform* the work. 
To publicly display* the work. 
To publicly perform sound   recordings by means of a digital audio transmission.
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
How long does copyright last?
Works created on or after January 1,   1978 are protected for a term of the life of the author plus 70 years. If it is   a corporate author then the protection is for the shorter of 95 years from publication* or 120 years from creation*. Works created and published prior to 1978 may be protected for different lengths of time. 
For more information regarding the length of a copyright, please see the copyright duration chart.
Example:
Author James Michener died   in 1997. His works such as Alaska, Texas, and The Eagle and the Raven,   which were all created after 1978, are protected under the copyright law until   2067. 
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
 
What is the public domain?
The public domain consists of all   works that never had copyright protection and works that no longer have copyright   protection. The public domain also includes most works created by the United   States government. All works in the public domain are free for the public to   use. Works published in the United States prior to 1923 are in the public   domain.
Example:
Census reports, which are   compiled and published by the United States government are in the public   domain.
