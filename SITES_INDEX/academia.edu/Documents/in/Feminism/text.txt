En effet, la nature du clivage dans lequel s’inscrit la femme indigène est double : par rapport à la société coloniale d’une part et par rapport à la place qui lui est allouée au sein de sa société et culture d’origine d’autre part. Cette bipolarité est apparente au sein des romans à l’étude, à la fois au niveau de la forme, notamment à travers une narration où la dualité occupe une place centrale, mais aussi au niveau du fond. La fiction, qui a ici pour cadre de référence des événements historiques réels, devient ainsi, selon nous, le lieu d&#39;articulation d’un féminisme transculturel et transnational s&#39;inscrivant hors du continuum colonial des idées.Save to LibraryDownloadby Julia Galmiche•  6  Art, Colonialism, Feminism, Post colonial literatureNew Lines of Sight: Perspectives on Women and Photography in AfricaIntroduction to Women and Photography in Africa  ISBN 9781350136564https://www.routledge.com/Women-and-Photography-in-Africa-Creative-Practices-and-Feminist-Challenges/Newbury-Rizzo-Thomas/p/book/9781350136564Save to LibraryDownloadby kylie thomas•  6  African Studies, Women's Studies, Photography, FeminismGeography Gender and the Supine GoddessWhat implications does the Srin-mo, a pre-Buddhist deity who traverses across almost all of the periods of time in Tibetan religious life, have on the social status of women?

Embodying the places and spaces of Tibet, a malevolent demoness called the Srin-mo has been essential in laying the formation of Tibetan Buddhism. The concept of the Srin-mo can be traced back to the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet: Bön. The story of the Srin-mo is not a creation myth in the sense of a worldly inception,  but the story of the demoness does represent the creation of a harmonious society, spurring from the preceding time of primordial chaos found amongst the Bön religion. Looking at the origins of the demoness’ story is necessary in order to understand how and why the Srin-mo holds efficacious power over the land and people of Tibet. Here, I will investigate the case of the Srin-mo, which is controversially one of the most important beings in Tibet, but unquestionably, an irrevocable component of understanding what implications geography holds on Tibet.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lizzie Ruprecht•  23  Religion, Buddhism, Comparative Religion, Mythology And FolkloreExamining the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 1 ostensible absence of women in conflict prevention, management and resolution in AfricaThis essay seeks to examine in parts, the ostensible absence of women’s political participation, particularly in peace processes in Africa.

The essay will draw experiences and examples from a couple of African countries to argue that women’s continuous absence in peace discourses is as a result of political stereotypes, backed by patriarchal norms and masculinity tendencies which usually epitomises maleness to the ‘knower’, ‘protector’, ‘powerful’, ‘leader’. Therefore in instances were women are able to actively participate on equal capacities like their male counterparts, it goes against and threatens the constructed patriarchal systems and its flair of hegemony.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zoneziwoh Mbondgulo-Wondieh, Ph.D.•  13  African Studies, Peace and Conflict Studies, International Law, Human RightsAamft Master Series Tapes: An Analysis of the Inclusion of Feminist Principles Into Family Therapy PracticeSave to LibraryDownloadby David Macphee•  15  Psychology, Family Therapy, Social Work, Content Analysis Feminist Live Art: Why Bodies?

Gender and the Political analyses cultural constructions of the female terrorist, arguing that she operates as a limit case of both feminine and feminist agency. Drawing on an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, this book demonstrates that the development of the discourse on terrorism evolves in parallel with, and in response to, radical feminism in the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Situated at the borderlines between sexuality, threat and abjection, Amanda Third argues that the figure of the female terrorist compels a reexamination of the project of radical politics and the limits of modernity. http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/gender-and-the-political-amanda-third/?K=9781137402752  "A fascinating exploration of the historical twinning of terrorism and feminism in the U.S. By redirecting our attention to these important discourses emerging in the 60's and 70s, this book provides a crucial corrective to counter post 9/11 anxieties that continually project the terrorist as somehow coming from elsewhere." - Jasbir K. Puar, Associate Professor of Women's and Gender Studies, Rutgers University, USA "Amanda Third's Gender and the Political convincingly argues that the modern concepts of terrorism and feminism are historically and conceptually interwoven. The book does this by reading terrorism studies against the grain while simultaneously positioning the concept of terrorism as a central trope of postmodern thought. These two discourses - the former increasingly foundational to, the latter highly critical of, the modern state and social order - are placed in fruitful conversation with one another, resulting in a deeply illuminating study of the contemporary political terrain in the United States." - Mehmet Döşemeci, Assistant Professor of History, Bucknell University, USASave to Libraryby Amanda Third•  26  Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, Media and Cultural Studies, Sex and GenderViolence against Queer People: Race, Class, Gender, and the Persistence of Anti-LGBT DiscriminationViolence against lesbians and gay men has increasingly captured media and scholarly attention.

But these reports tend to focus on one segment of the LGBT community—white, middle class men—and largely ignore that part of the community that arguably suffers a larger share of the violence—racial minorities, the poor, and women. In Violence against Queer People, sociologist Doug Meyer offers the first investigation of anti-queer violence that focuses on the role played by race, class, and gender. Drawing on interviews with forty-seven victims of violence, Meyer shows that LGBT people encounter significantly different forms of violence—and perceive that violence quite differently—based on their race, class, and gender. His research highlights the extent to which other forms of discrimination—including racism and sexism—shape LGBT people's experience of abuse. He reports, for instance, that lesbian and transgender women often described violent incidents in which a sexual or a misogynistic component was introduced, and that LGBT people of color sometimes weren't sure if anti-queer violence was based solely on their sexuality or whether racism or sexism had also played a role. Meyer observes that given the many differences in how anti-queer violence is experienced, the present media focus on white, middle-class victims greatly oversimplifies and distorts the nature of anti-queer violence. In fact, attempts to reduce anti-queer violence that ignore race, class, and gender run the risk of helping only the most privileged gay subjects. Many feel that the struggle for gay rights has largely been accomplished and the tide of history has swung in favor of LGBT equality. Violence against Queer People, on the contrary, argues that the lives of many LGBT people—particularly the most vulnerable—have improved very little, if at all, over the past thirty years.Save to LibraryDownloadby Doug Meyer•  10  Criminal Justice, Gender Studies, Queer Studies, ViolenceGalaxy: International Multidisciplinary Research JournalIn the 21st century, when women have acquired equal rights in all spheres of life, the subject of women empowerment appears by default in literature.

In this regard, Amish Tripathi’s fiction presents certain fascinating aspects. Shiva Trilogy is a mythic Fiction based on mythology related to Lord Shiva, the prime deity in Hindu Religion. He has re imagined a utopian society called Meluha, created by the Hindu God, Lord Ram, as per his ideals. It is interesting to analyse the status Amish assigns to the women in his visualization of Ram Rajya through mythic archetypes like; Shiva and sati, prototype of Lord Shiva and Goddess Sati. The setting of his fiction is 1900 BC, the period when the projected Saraswati Civilization, commonly referred to as Indus Valley Civilization, collapsed. This fiction presents the status of women in the distant past, intuited by today’s ideals of feminism. This article analyses the shades of feminist approach undertaken by Amish in his mythic fiction Shiva Trilogy which includes The Immortal of Meluha (2010), The Secret of Nagas (2011) and The Oath of Vayuputras (2013).Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Neha Kumari•  6  Hinduism, Gender Studies, Mythology, Women's StudiesLilith's Fire: Examining Original Sources of Power Re-defining Sacred Texts as Transformative Theological PracticeSave to LibraryDownloadby Dvorah Grenn•  12  Religion, Gender Studies, Jewish Studies, Women's StudiesLA COSMOVISIÓN FEMENINA EN TRES PINTURAS MEXICANAS DEL SIGLO XX THE FEMININE WORLD VISION IN THREE MEXICAN PAINTINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURYLa figura femenina a dos décadas del siglo XXI ha ocupado un lugar importante en la sociedad, sin embargo, en el arte mexicano del siglo XX el papel más importante de la mujer sólo pertenecía al de la musa.

Hoy en día es posible dar crédito a aquellas mujeres creadoras que fueron subestimadas por su género, a pesar de tener el 1 talento para ser reconocidas. Uno de los propósitos de este texto es analizar tres autorretratos pictóricos realizados por mujeres mexicanas María Izquierdo, Rosa Rolanda y Nahuí Olin para comprender tanto sus biografías como la época en la que vivieron. De tal manera, al analizar cada obra, hay rastros de la identidad mexicana, de un espacio político, de supuestos filosóficos del sujeto que permiten al arte darle un valor trascendental.

Rescaling the local: Multi-academy trusts, private monopoly and statecraft in England. Journal of Educational Administration and History, 49 (2), 171-185For the past six years successive UK governments in England have introduced reforms intended to usher in less aggregated, top-down, bureaucratically overloaded models of service delivery as well as secure conditions for greater school autonomy.  Yet the ‘hollowing out’ of local government has not resulted in less bureaucracy on the ground or less regulation from above, nor has it diminished hierarchy as an organising principle of education governance.  In some cases, monopolies and monopolistic practices dominated by powerful bureaucracies and professional groups persist, albeit realised through the involvement of new actors and organisations from business and philanthropy.  In this paper I adopt a governmentality perspective to explore the political significance of large multi-academy trusts (MATs) – private sponsors contracted by central government to run publicly funded schools – to the generation of new scalar hierarchies and accountability infrastructures that assist in bringing the gaze of government to bear upon the actions of schools that are otherwise less visible under local government management.  On this account, it is argued, MATs are integral to statecraft and the invention and assemblage of particular apparatuses for intervening upon specific organisations, spaces and peoples.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Wilkins•  87  Critical Theory, Business, Management, Business AdministrationOrlando Reade - Fortune is a Mistresse (article)This essay is a survey of the figure Fortune in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English poetry.

It argues that poetry reveals the work of figuration within the construction of gendered and racial difference. First, it looks at some early verses by Thomas More where poetic ambiguity is used to imitate the contingency associated with the pagan goddess. It then identifies, in an overlooked variant spelling of Thomas Wyatt’s lyric ‘They fle from me that sometim did me seke’, an association between Fortune and the poet’s mistress, which is reworked by numerous later poets. It reads the ‘dark mistress’ of Shakespeare’s Sonnets as a refiguration of Fortune: not an anti-Petrarchan conception, as is often assumed, but one inspired by the psychological technique of ‘blackening’ proposed in Petrarch’s De remediis fortunae (Remedies for Fortune). Following recent work in critical race theory, it argues that this refiguration reflects anxieties about and aesthetic fascination with the Atlantic slave trade. It discusses the career of the Elizabethan super-tune “Fortune my foe,” from an exchange of verses between Walter Ralegh and Elizabeth I to its dismissal as misogynistic in a 1668 play by Margaret Cavendish. Finally, it discusses an argument in the poetry of Katherine Philips that a virtuous woman can capture Fortune, observing that this triumph over Fortune mirrors the exploitation of slave labour in England’s Caribbean colonies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Orlando Reade•  7  Musicology, Philosophy, Renaissance Studies, PoetryRe-Framing the Stereotype: The ‘Truth’ of the Black Panther Party through Documentary Cinema  By James WallisThis thesis is a historical and filmic analysis of the Black Panther Party, using two documentaries, All Power to the People: The Black Panther Party and Beyond (1996) and The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution (2015). It is first... moreThis thesis is a historical and filmic analysis of the Black Panther Party, using two documentaries, All Power to the People: The Black Panther Party and Beyond (1996) and The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution (2015). It is first stated what the documentary film should set out to achieve when framing a political narrative. The films will be looked at separately, in regard to the context of their production and release. Power to the People was a reaction to the Rodney King riots. Vanguard of the Revolution was filmed alongside the rise of the Black Lives Matter Movement. The Black Panther origins as a movement are briefly considered to allow for a base understanding of the party’s precepts and aims. This includes the roles of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and an introduction to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The content analysis begins by looking at the main ideologies of the party and its operations. The empowerment of women but also hyper masculinity within the party is then discussed. This follows on to social and survival programs set up by the party. Primarily using two significant cases, the deaths of Bobby Hutton and Fred Hampton, there is an examination of concerted efforts by police and FBI to mobilise and neutralise the party. Comparisons and contrasts are then made between the style and content of the two films. It will be concluded that the films serve two purposes, to give the positive work of the Black Panthers a legitimate platform, but also to address the criticisms levelled at the party. The overarching conclusion will be that the Black Panthers were involved in a vicious cycle. Once they brought any semblance of solidarity to their communities, the FBI and Police would move against them leading to reactionary violence which caused the party’s eventual disbandment.Save to LibraryDownloadby James  Wallis•  13  History, Film Studies, Race and Racism, Civil RightsWomen and Literature: Persian literature from the feminist perspective (In Persian)Save to LibraryDownloadby Mahmoud Hassanabadi•  3  Persian Literature, Feminism, Feminist Research MethodsSymposium on Linda Zerilli's "Feminism and the Abyss of Freedom"Save to LibraryDownloadby Linda M G Zerilli•  5  Feminism, Hannah Arendt, Feminist Political Theory, Monique WittigPolitical representation in Papua New Guinea – The status of women in a Big Men’s WorldEqual representation of women in the political arena and decision-making processes of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the most pressing issues in PNG at present.

Since political Independence on the 16th of September 1975, women continue to feature less in the formal political and decision-making arena of the country. Though PNG’s constitution recognizes the rights to vote and stand for public office, little has been achieved due to the entrenched discrimination against women in PNG’s political system. The patriarchal notions of male leadership simply negate the progression of talented women into positions of leadership at the national level of politics.This paper provides an overview of the political issue of greater women representation in the political and decision-making processes of the PNG. The urgency of having women in this process of decision-making is fundamental to the progression of the country in all spheres of its development. And this can come about through civic-mindedness and the advocacy work, not only of women groups and associations, but equally through men taking ownership of the issue of women empowerment in the areas of decision-making and political representation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Karabuspalau Kaiku•  2  Feminism, Parliaments (in particular, parliamentary opposition and law making process), from a comparative perspective; Political Parties and Party Systems; Content Analysis techniques.Qu(e)erying Sex and Gender in Archaeology: a Critique of the Third and Other Sexual CategoriesIn order to get the complete work, please get in touch with me.Save to LibraryDownloadby Enrique Moral de Eusebio•  5  Queer Theory, Feminism, Queer Archaeologies, Feminist ArchaeologyDIGITAL FEMINIST ACTIVISM Girls and Women Fight Back Against Rape CultureFrom sites like Hollaback! and Everyday Sexism, which document instances of street harassment and misogyny, to social media-organized movements and communities like #MeToo and #BeenRapedNeverReported, feminists are using participatory... moreFrom sites like Hollaback! and Everyday Sexism, which document instances of street harassment and misogyny, to social media-organized movements and communities like #MeToo and #BeenRapedNeverReported, feminists are using participatory digital media as actvist tools to speak, network, and organize against sexism, misogyny, and rape culture. As the first book-length study to examine how girls, women, and some men negotiate rape culture through the use of digital platforms, including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and mobile apps, the authors explore four primary questions: What experiences of harassment, misogyny, and rape culture are being responded to? How are participants using digital media technologies to document experiences of sexual violence, harassment, and sexism? Why are girls, women and some men choosing to mobilize digital media technologies in this way? And  finally, what are the various experiences of using digital technologies to engage in activism? In order to capture these diverse experiences of doing digital feminist activism, the authors augment their analysis of this media (blog posts, tweets, and selfies) with in-depth interviews and close- observations of several online communities that operate globally.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jessica  Ringrose•  15  Women's Studies, Digital Media, Social Activism, Social MediaIntersections: The Simultaneity of Race, Gender and Class in Organization Studiesg wao_400 248..277Save to LibraryDownloadby karina leon•  12  Ethnic Studies, Gender Studies, Women's Studies, Sexuality“The Unbearable Whiteness of Whiteness”Amidst the expected, punning advertisements for data companies lining the drive into San Francisco, one passes a lone cultural billboard depicting Klimt’s The Virgin (1913).

The image advertises Klimt & Rodin: An Artistic Encounter at the Legion of Honor. Below the image of entwined pale, female flesh against a tapestry of vibrant color are the words: “Gives off seriously sexual vibes,” excerpted from a review in San Francisco Magazine. Klimt & Rodin showcases the two male artists’ interest in depicting the white female subject, an art historical mainstay since the splash of Praxiteles’s naked Aphrodite of Knidos. Vibrant colors and gilt dominates the non-figural spaces of Klimt’s canvases, but not the subjects’ bodies, which are rendered in light flesh tones, highlighted with pale yellows and pinks. Rodin’s sculptures, in contrast, are hewn from monochrome materials—marble, bronze, clay—with no surface treatments. If the “seriously sexual vibes” advertised on the billboard come from the expected space of white female (and feminized) subjectivity, the “artistic encounter” on display is one of medium—of painting’s uncontested polychrome in contrast to the insistent monochrome of modern sculpture.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jennifer Stager•  14  Conservation, Race and Ethnicity, Feminism, Modernism (Art History)Philosophy Today TOC Spring 2021: Special issue on automationSave to LibraryDownloadby Ian Alexander Moore and +1Vilde Lid Aavitsland•  16  Artificial Intelligence, Anthropology, Philosophy, Philosophy of TechnologyEL ROL FEMENINO Y LAS VARIANTES TEXTUALES DE 1 CORINTIOS 14:34–35Desde el resurgir del igualitarismo 1 Corintios 14:34–35, escrito por el apóstol Pablo, ha causado un revuelo interpretativo.

According to Laruelle, the ultimate limit of philosophical thought and its self-proclaimed sufficiency lies in its inherent tendency to close itself in a transcendental system of autofetishist conceptions, which presume that one can grasp the Real (“The Real is neither capable of being known or even ‘thought,’ but can be described in axioms. [...]Even ‘immanence’ only serves to name the Real which tolerates nothing but axiomatic descriptions or formulations.”) by a philosophical thought, or that the Real could be mediated only through human thought. Laruelle criticizes this tendency of philosophy, which is usually expressing itself through the structure of “philosophical Decision.” (“To philosophize is to decide Reality and the thoughts that result from this, i.e. to believe tobe able to order them in the universal order of the Principle of Reason [Logos].”) Katerina Kolozova use Laruelle’s non-philosophy to explore more explicitly political topics. In the Cut Of Th e Real (2014),  she criticized certain dogmatism of poststructuralist philosophy and feminist theory, namely their symptomatic rejection of the Real and theOne. In Toward a Radical Metaphysics of Socialism (2015) and The Lived Revolution (2016) Kolozova presented a rereading of Marx, whose work she found relevant for the critique of speculative philosophical dimension of the capitalist economy, embodied in the 2008 global finance crisis, and in the latter book, she explored the possibility of a new political solidarity, based on “bodies in pain.” Kolozova doesn’t call to philosophically reconstruct Marx’s thought for the current situation, but she goes back to Marx with the help of Laruelle’s non-Marxism, contrary to the usual approach of Marxist philosophers, who oftentry to create certain philosophical system of Marx’s work. Together with Eileen A. Joy,  Kolozova edited the anthology After the “Speculative Turn” (2016),  which addressed recent realist and materialist tendencies in feminist philosophy. In her most recent book, Capitalism’s Holocaust of Animals (2019),  Kolozova aimed to explore broader philosophical foundations of neoliberal capitalism, and its dealing with nonhuman animals and their suffering. According to Kolozova, “We have to start by coming to terms with what we did to the animals in the constitutive act of philosophy and via proxy to all those dehumanised that belong to the species of man ‘by courtesy’ only.”Save to LibraryDownloadby Katerina Kolozova and +1Jan Susa•  11  Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, Marxism, PosthumanismLa indigena: Risky Identity Politics and Decolonial Agency as Indigenous ConsciousnessIris Ruiz is a Lecturer in the Merritt Writing Program at UC, Merced, which is located in the heart of the Central Valley and is a designated Hispanic Serving Institution.

I use this notion of gender as a matter of space to compare Stone’s discourse to that of feminist theorist and artist bell hooks, who describes the position of black women as a matter of space as well – a space from which black women develop an oppositional gaze and thus engage in the discourse, instead of being excluded from it. I compare Stone’s strategy of reclaiming the insult and the notion of counter discourse that arises from that with hooks’ notion of the oppositional gaze, as I examine how these new discourses can lead to forms of agency in a context of oppression. I take into consideration philosopher of feminist epistemology Sandra Harding’s Standpoint Theory,  in order to understand Stone’s and hooks’ creation of a critical space that is developed through the deconstruction of oppressive binary systems, and in which knowledge and agency are generated by marginalized groups.Save to LibraryDownloadby Frans  Blokhuis•  15  Discourse Analysis, Gender Studies, Critical Race Studies, Transgender StudiesConstructed FemininityThis dissertation provides an examination of the cultural significance of mannequins during the interwar years.

These ethics delve into deep connections and moral commitments between nonhumans and humans to guide ethical forms of environmental decision making and environmental science. Indigenous and feminist movements such as the Mother Earth Water Walk and the Green Belt Movement are ongoing examples of the effectiveness of on-the-ground environmental care ethics. Indigenous ethics highlight attentive caring for the intertwined needs of humans and nonhumans within interdependent communities. Feminist environmental care ethics emphasize the importance of empowering communities to care for themselves and the social and ecological communities in which their lives and interests are interwoven.

Au cœur de leur débat, de leur relecture critique des textes freudiens et lacaniens se trouvent pensés à nouveau frais le discours et la théorie de la psychanalyse sur “La femme”, “le féminin”, “la sexualité féminine”, “la différence des sexes”. Les dogmes théoriques concernant “le continent noir” romantiquement évoqués ainsi par Freud sont revisités, voire renversés. Les querelles autour du terme même de “féminisme” produisent et ouvrent à d’autres discours. Freud a toujours considéré que la théorie psychanalytique était open to revision et Lacan que la psychanalyse gagnerait à être en “extension”. Que se passe-t-il lorsque la théorie et la pratique psychanalytiques rencontrent les discours féministes? L’horizon s’ouvre-t-il pour le discours psychanalytique, sa théorie, sa pratique? Une ouverture, une révision peuvent- elle s’opérer? Un renversement du dogme, une nouvelle joie de la pratique analytique?In France, in the wake of the movement of May 68, the Women's Liberation Movement (MLF) spontaneously and joyfully emerged, initiated by Antoinette Fouque and Monique Wittig. In their debates and their critical rereadings of the Freudian and Lacanian texts, they think afresh the discourse and theory of psychoanalysis on “Women”, “the feminine”, “female sexuality”, and “sex difference”. e theoretical dogmas concerning "the black continent" romantically evoked by Freud are revisited, and even reversed. e quarrels over the very term of "feminism" produce and give way to other discourses. Freud always considered that psychoanalytical theory was open to revision and Lacan that psychoanalysis would benefit from being in ‘extension’. What happens when psychoanalytic theory and practice meet feminist discourses? Does this encounter imply that the horizon should open up for psychoanalytical discourse, its theory and practice? Can an opening, a revision then take place? A dogma, a new joy in analytical practice?Save to LibraryDownloadby Laurie Laufer•  7  Psychoanalysis, Gender Studies, Gender and Sexuality, MaterialismThe Internal Contradictions of FeminismThis paper explores the way in which feminism, whilst trying to achieve gender equality, has increased inequality between women.

The concept of cryptofeminism which was used for the first time in the press in the 1960s, was referring to some cryptic and unnamed problems experienced by women. However the concept discussed as cryptofeminism within this study is different, the main starting point is similar as it points to a problem that cannot be named. Cryptofeminism as a concept which refers to the blockchain technology is being discussed and added to the academic literature for the first time with this article. Crypto assets are technology products that take their name from the science of cryptography. Crypto assets can store and transfer any kind of data and information with encryption and confidentiality principle. Crypto assets, which entered our lives with blockchain technology and spread very quickly in different areas, have created their own ecosystem and industry. The crypto ecosystem draws attention not only with its players, but also with its unique culture. The culture that develops in this ecosystem is at risk of being knitted around the ideas that feminism has been fighting for years. The perception of technology in the historical process has spread to the field of software, which is a new type of machine, by being built with mainly production equipment and machines after the industrial revolutions. The relatively pessimistic early literature and debates on technology and gender focus heavily on women's inability to develop their technical knowledge and skills. In the following period, discussions about the exclusion of women with higher technical education from the business world and its cultural basis follows. The masculine construction of the language and symbolism of technology carries inclusiveness to a point far away from competence and skills. From this point of view, it would be correct to discuss the cryptofeminism debate over the spread of a male-dominated culture in crypto. The gender of the crypto industry is encoded by symbolic conceptualization and male-dominated. The image of Bitcoin, the first blockchain network and cryptocurrency, is masculine. The fact that almost all of the images produced about the inventor of Bitcoin, whose real identity is unknown today, are male, is an extension of the maledominated culture that has begun to take root. On the other hand, blockchain technology, which provides secure anonymity, allows the construction of gender-neutral virtual identities. The positive reflections of the anonymity and trust issue, which reinforces its place in our lives with crypto through new communication forms, are candidates to open up space for the capture of gender equality in the focus of cryptofeminism.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Çağla Gül Şenkardeş•  6  Gender Studies, Women's Studies, Feminism, Physical EducationThe Beyoncé Effect: Essays on Sexuality, Race, and Feminism (2016) edited by Adrienne Trier-Bieniek [Book Review]Review of The Beyoncé Effect: Essays on Sexuality, Race, and Feminism (McFarland 2016), a collection edited by Adrienne Trier‐Bieniek, is featured in the Journal of American Culture.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jocelyn E.

A travers sa lecture de la marge comme espace de résistance et lieu radical de possibilité, elle nous offrait une vision empowering de la marginalité, vu comme espace de création et non de soumission. Ce renversement du point de vue permettait de penser la marge comme un espace à habiter, dans lequel trouver sa place, où rester et non comme un espace de transit pour atteindre le centre. Il s'agit d'un changement épistémologique fort parce que cette idée transforme les marges en espaces de création, de partage, d'élaboration de stratégies collectives, de contre-espaces (Foucault, 1984) d'élaboration de façons différentes de vivre le monde. La marge comme espace contre-hégémonique est le lieu de la mise en commun des expériences, des conditions, des parcours de vie. La marginalité devient alors non seulement un lieu privilégié de création mais aussi un lieu qui offre un point de vue sur le monde capable de rendre visible l'invisible, de dénaturaliser les processus intériorisés, un lieu où voir les mécanismes qui rendent fonctionnel le système dominant. Un lieu de contre-attaque pour contre-attaquer : la marge devient l'espace privilégié d'élaboration de micro-politiques à diffusion virale. Voix off. (play), bell hooks (1989, p. 148-149) : « These margins have benn both sites of repression and sites of resistance (...). I am located in the margin. I make a definite distinction between that marginality which is imposed by oppressive structures and that marginality one chooses as site of resistance ? as location of radical openness and possibility. This site of resistance is continually formed in that segregated culture of opposition that is our critical response to domination. (...) We are trasformed, individually, collectively, as we make radical creative space which affirms and sustains our subjectivity, which gives us a new location from which to articulate our sense of the world » (musique stop). Est-il possible d'imaginer un centre différent à partir de ses marges ? Est-il sensé de parler des marges du centre ? Et dans ce cas, est-il possible de les occuper ? Est-ce que les marges du centre peuvent être considérées comme des espaces de production de radicalité pour la construction de nouveaux mondes ? #Cadre Je voudrais partager des pratiques que j'ai expérimentées à partir de la marge d'un espace-centre, c'est-à-dire d'un espace qui est central à l'intérieur du système dominant et qui est impliqué directement dans la reproduction des mécanismes de pouvoir et des rapports de domination : l'université.

It therefore comprises the perfect litmus test of any given culture’s prevailing hopes and fears about the future. One such source of anxiety that has been particularly conspicuous in works of fiction since the Industrial Revolution is the development of automata and other machines – specifically, whether they might eventually become strong or intelligent enough to overthrow their creators. As I will try to elucidate in this essay, fears about some sort of robot uprising fit into a more general worry among dominant groups about a reversal of fates between them and an oppressed group. The cyborg character, however, complicates this formula because it is a hybrid of human and machine, a boundary figure. This is a clear, perhaps uncomfortable reminder that the Other is also the Same.In this thesis, I will be looking at five key examples from the last five decades of literature about cyborgs, namely: The Ship Who Sang by Anne McCaffrey; ‘The Girl Who Was Plugged In’ by James Tiptree Jr.; Proxies by Laura J Mixon; ‘Silently and Very Fast’ by Catherynne M Valente; and Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie. Though these texts I will seek out ways in which cyborgs might disrupt binary understandings of identity and thereby challenge real-life social hierarchies. Most important to this investigation is the potential of cyborg disembodiment – that is, any kind of cybernetic separation of the consciousness from an organic body – to confuse how identities are perceived and constructed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Meryl Trussler•  11  Gender Studies, Science Fiction, Feminism, Cyborg FeminismTaking Part: Muslim Participation in Contemporary GovernanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Therese O'Toole and +2Tariq ModoodStephen H Jones•  17  Religion, Comparative Law, Theology, Human RightsPolitics, Protest, Emotion: Interdisciplinary PerspectivesSave to LibraryDownloadby Anastasia  Veneti and +1Paul J Reilly•  9  Social Movements, Health Communication, Politics, Social MediaBad Blood: On Culpability and a Metabolic Approach to Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant FriendThe article contends that Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels occupy a special place among contemporary literature in that they superficially adopt traditional modes of storytelling, typically associated with the nineteenth century... moreThe article contends that Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels occupy a special place among contemporary literature in that they superficially adopt traditional modes of storytelling, typically associated with the nineteenth century Bildungsroman, while destabilizing them through a first-person narrator keenly aware of the manipulative potentialities of plot(ting). It supports this contention in a twofold manner. Firstly, by scrutinizing the text’s apparent linear trajectory and, through Genette’s notion of the arbitraire, coming to the conclusion that such linearity is revealed to be, at the end of the penultimate section, entirely constructed by the protagonist in an effort to exact vengeance on her friend. The article proceeds to examine how the textual apparatus bears the brunt of this revelation. In doing so, it adopts Peter Brooks’s thermodynamic model and reconfigures it into a metabolic model meant to monitor the set of activities and energetic transformations at work in the text. It identifies a metabolic malfunction in the novel’s last section, manifested as a form of textual hypothyroidism whereby the plot becomes, as it were, constipated. The article finally concludes that in halting the progress of the novel’s plot, Ferrante offers a cutting commentary on our exegetic practices and our tendency to read consequence into sequence, while simultaneously advancing a geometry of narrative entanglement that stands in sheer opposition to the linear.Save to LibraryDownloadby Victor Zarour Zarzar•  9  Comparative Literature, Italian Studies, Italian Literature, FeminismAn unsatisfactory trajectory: a critique of gender complementarianismThis was a research paper for a course entitled Feminist and Multicultural Theologies.

I unpack what gender complementarianism is, examine its history, and compare it to how Scripture and earlier Christian Tradition understood gender. This allows me to establish that gender complementarianism is a recent innovation in secular and Christian thinking about gender, and that it can be described as a "trajectory" from Scripture and Tradition on gender, influenced by social, ideological, and intellectual developments in secular societies. I then pursue a critique of gender complementarianism, arguing that it is an "unsatisfactory trajectory" because it has troubling implications for orthodox theology, is not borne out by empirical experience and observation, and has harmful effects on human beings and societies and on ethical development.Save to LibraryDownloadby Caleb M Day•  109  History, Gender Studies, Ethics, Normative EthicsNextLast »Related TopicsFeminist TheoryFollowFollowingGender and SexualityFollowFollowingGender StudiesFollowFollowingQueer TheoryFollowFollowingGenderFollowFollowingSexualityFollowFollowingWomen's StudiesFollowFollowingQueer StudiesFollowFollowingFeminist PhilosophyFollowFollowingSex and GenderFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
