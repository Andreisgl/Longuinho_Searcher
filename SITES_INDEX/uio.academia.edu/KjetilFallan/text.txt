Kjetil FallanUniversity of Oslo,  Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Ideas,  Faculty MemberVisual Studies+27[Disclaimer: I no longer update profile and content on this site] Prof. Dr. Kjetil Fallan is a historian specializing in 20th century industrial design and material culture. He is Professor of Design History at the University of Oslo.Fallan is the author of Designing Modern Norway: A History of Design Discourse (Routledge, 2017) and Design History: Understanding Theory and Method (Berg Publishers, 2010); editor of Scandinavian Design: Alternative Histories (Berg Publishers, 2012), co-editor, with Grace Lees-Maffei, of Designing Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalization (Berghahn Books, 2016) and Made in Italy: Rethinking a Century of Italian Design (Bloomsbury Academic, 2013), and has written numerous book chapters and journal articles on various aspects of design history (see "Papers" link on the left). Prof. Fallan also serves on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Design History and on the Advisory Board of Design and Culture.Having studied engineering design, sociology and history, Fallan holds an MPhil in History and a PhD in Cultural History - both degrees from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).Fallan is interested in the relations between design history and the history of technology, and well as the theoretical insight from science and technology studies (STS) and their value to design history.His teaching is currently centered on running a BA-level survey course in design history, a joint BA/MA-level advanced course in design culture, and a a joint BA/MA-level advanced course in Nordic design history - all offered in the University of Oslo's art history programme. Previous teaching experience includes running a compulsory course in historiography, theory and method in the BA art history program; an introductory course in design history offered in NTNU's MSc programme in industrial design; lecturing on an interdisciplinary course on material culture intended for undergraduates in the humanities; and lecturing on methodological perspectives of material culture to postgraduates architecture and design. Prof. Fallan has also given lectures on the PhD programmes at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, L'Escola d'Arquitectura de Barcelona, and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design.less1,041 Followers381 Following7 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingCVall9 Books48 PapersBooksDesigning Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalization Edited by Kjetil Fallan and Grace Lees-Maffeiby Grace Lees-Maffei, Kjetil Fallan, dipti  bhagat, Patricia Lara-Betancourt, and Livia RezendeOpen Access thanks to the University of Oslo and the University of Hertfordshire: http:// www.ber... more Open Access thanks to the University of Oslo and the University of Hertfordshire: http:// www.berghahnbooks.com/title/FallanDesigning " This is a lively, spirited, and imaginative volume whose editors have assembled an impressive range of contributions.

Designing Modern Norway: A History of Design Discourse (London and New York: Routledge, 2017)Designing Modern Norway: A History of Design Discourse is an intellectual history of design and i... more Designing Modern Norway: A History of Design Discourse is an intellectual history of design and its role in configuring the modern Norwegian nation state. Rather than a conventional national design history survey that focuses on designers and objects, this is an in-depth study of the ideologies, organizations, strategies and politics that combined might be said to have "designed" the modern nation's material and visual culture. The book analyses main tropes and threads in the design discourse generated around key institutions such as museums, organisations and magazines. Beginning with how British and continental design reform ideas were mediated in Norway and merged with a nationalist sentiment in the late nineteenth century, Designing Modern Norway traces the tireless and wide-ranging work undertaken by enthusiastic and highly committed design professionals throughout the twentieth century to simultaneously modernise the nation by design and to nationalise modern design. Bringing the discussion up towards the present, the book concludes with an examination of how Norway's new-found wealth has profoundly changed the production, mediation and consumption of design.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Designing Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalizationby Patricia Lara-Betancourt and Kjetil FallanContemporary design is simultaneously global, regional and national. 'Italian' cars, for example,... more Contemporary design is simultaneously global, regional and national. 'Italian' cars, for example, may be designed by Britons and Brazilians and manufactured in Poland and Pakistan, on behalf of multinational owners, for consumption in Switzerland and Swaziland. At the same time, international developments in higher education, the continuing influence of post-colonial theory, and the contemporary focus on sustainability, have led design historians to critique a bias towards Western industrialised nations based on a definition of design derived from its separation from industrial manufacture. Design historians are now looking further afield in writing Global Design History (to use the title of a 2011 anthology). National histories are criticised as unsuited to a new 'global gaze' in which contemporary society and historical narratives are to be freed from the geo-political straightjacket of nation states. Appadurai (1996) has even claimed that the nation state has become obsolete as a marker of identity construction. Is the nation simply imagined (Anderson, 1983), a modern myth, as Ernest Gellner (1983) claimed? Or can this admittedly complex construction still be a valuable framework for histories of design? The nation state is no longer the only socio-cultural or political-economic unit forming our identities and experiences, but national and regional histories of design have demonstrated cogent frameworks for the discussion of common socioeconomic , cultural and identity issues. With contributions from all five continents, this book will provide a timely examination of the historiographic value of national frameworks and ask whether moves to discard them are premature.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Italy’s glorious design heritage and reputation for innovation mean that goods ‘Made in Italy’, and/or designed in Italy, carry added value. Since 1945, Italian design has commanded an increasing amount of attention from design journalists, critics and consumers. But is Italian design well served by the steady stream of magazine features and coffee-table books through which it is celebrated? Italian design is, to some extent, the victim of its own celebrity in that hagiographic public relations and marketing-driven treatments fail to reward its innovative, delightful and confounding output with properly critical analysis.      Made in Italy offers a history of Italian design told, not through a chronological structure, but rather through a mix of broad survey chapters, which review change over time, and detailed case study chapters, addressing a period of between five and twenty years, arranged into five thematic parts. These parts draw attention to key stories and directions in new scholarship on Italian design, from an international group of scholars with established expertise in the subject, and the book moves forward the discourse surrounding Italian design from the 1920s to the present. Made in Italy functions, therefore, as both an introduction to Italian design for those new to the field, and as a survey of innovative approaches for those familiar with extant secondary material.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The empirical studies follow two paths/levels; the ideology/propaganda debated in and mediated through the design magazine Bonytt, and the strategies/materiality/products developed by the ceramics/earthenware/porcelain manufacturer Figgjo. As such, the thesis is a cultural history of industrial design, where design (as) culture is seen as a sort of dialectic or discourse between ideology and practice. This often uneasy relation between ideology and practice is the leitmotif of the study. The concept of domestication, along with other theoretical frameworks and methodological tools appropriated from STS, becomes valuable when studying this process by following the actors in their construction, negotiation and mediation of these ideologies as played out in their main debate forum, the design magazine Bonytt. However, the domestication of industrial design culture in Norway does not end with the writings of campaigning designers, enthusiastic journalists, ardent academics and organization men. The mediations between ideology and practice is also traced in a domestication perspective. As such, the manufacturing industry - here represented by the ceramic tableware manufacturer Figgjo - represents a second site of domestication, where the ideologies undergo new negotiations and transformations in meeting other users, requirements and circumstances.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Altering a Homogenized Heritage: Articulating Heterogeneous Material Cultures in Norway and SwedenKjetil Fallan and Grace Lees-Maffei (eds.), Designing Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalization (New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2016),  Jun 2016Visitors to the Swedish pavilion at the New York World's Fair in 1939 would have been met by an i... more Visitors to the Swedish pavilion at the New York World's Fair in 1939 would have been met by an introductory photo-mural showing a group of confident, young blond people gazing steadily into the future. In the emerging welfare state this group is approaching the future with the certainty that they belong and will be taken care of. The future is theirs, modernity belongs to them. It is the future of a solid democratic and modern welfare state aiming to harness the entire population into a large, inclusive and harmonious middle class. In this narrative, present as much in Norwegian as in Swedish design history, design is portrayed as democratic, in the service of the many, as building a modern egalitarian society. Yet, it is not just the future that belongs to the ideal citizens represented in the photo-mural but history as well. It is their history that has been privileged in scholarship. The result is a narrative producing and reproducing a self-understanding amongst the population of being part of relatively egalitarian but also homogenous societies in terms of gender, class and race/ethnicity. This sanctioned history thus obscures the considerable heterogeneity of Nordic societies, past and present, and relegates a wide variety of alternative cultural practices and subject positions to the margins. There is a need to question the homogenized heritage of Nordic design and analyse it further through approaches within design historical scholarship articulating hetero-geneity by applying perspectives of gender, class and ethnicity (or through an intersectional perspective). In this chapter we focus on how dominant design history discourse hides the fact that material cultures of ethnic minorities areSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Altering a Homogenized Heritage: Articulating Heterogeneous Material Cultures in Norway and SwedenKjetil Fallan and Grace-Lees-Maffei (eds.), Designing Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalization (New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2016), pp. 172-187.,  Jun 2016The Nordic countries are generally perceived as relatively egalitarian and homogenous societies, ... more The Nordic countries are generally perceived as relatively egalitarian and homogenous societies, in terms of gender, class and race/ethnicity. On closer inspection, however, this image of uniformity starts to crack. The ethnic makeup of the Nordic nations has always been mixed, and is becoming ever more diverse. The Sami constitutes an indigenous population whose homeland cuts across national boundaries, and is considered a (state-less) nation in itself. There are also other older minorities in the region, such as Jews and Romani, as well as the kven population of Finnish decent in Norway and the Swedish population in Finland. Although they have only experienced significant non-European immigration relatively recently, the Nordic countries have now become multi-cultural societies with sizable diaspora from Africa, South America and Asia.The material cultures of ethnic minorities, old and new, are rich and profoundly present in everyday life—from Sami language signage in the northern regions to hijab-wearing women everywhere, as well as in home-making practices where new, hybrid forms of design culture emerge. However, these elements of our environs are completely absent from Nordic design history. Even recent national survey histories, which have incorporated many of the critical and theoretical discourses in international design historiography, are mute on the subject of ethnic minorities. The absence of Sami material culture, which is largely craft-based and traditional, in Nordic design history may be partially due to design history’s preference for industrial manufacture and for aesthetic innovation in the modern sense. The absence of newer minorities’ material culture may also have to do with the bias towards production of commodities at the expense of more mediation- and consumption-oriented approaches.Based on the premise that a more inclusive approach describing a more heterogeneous material culture will lead to a better design history, this chapter explores why Nordic design history has been so 'white' and what strategies can be devised for a more colourful future history. How can the nuances of minority material cultures be articulated and incorporated in new national design histories? Which topics, approaches and methods need to be adopted and developed to foster such new narratives? What role do national contexts play in framing these? How do we make the conceptual maps fit the empirical terrain of culturally heterogeneous modern nation states?The minority populations of the Nordic countries might be small compared to those of other nations, but they are rapidly increasing both in number and percentage. At the same time, the majority populations are small in absolute numbers in a globalizing world. As minor majorities we should, therefore, recognize the importance of writing inclusive and nuanced design histories on a national and regional scale as contributions to a more global discourse.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It demonstrates how the qualities, properties and affordances of materials—especially of plastics—have time and again been at the center of attention when the romance of art and industry has been put to the test. From the late 19th century’s wondrous examples of engineering art, via the mid-20th century’s consolidation of industrial design as a distinct profession, to the industrial nostalgia of contemporary craft, Scandinavian design discourse on art and industry has grappled with how material matters.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There is a need to question the homogenized heritage of Nordic design and analyse it further through approaches within design historical scholarship articulating hetero-geneity by applying perspectives of gender, class and ethnicity (or through an intersectional perspective). In this chapter we focus on how dominant design history discourse hides the fact that material cultures of ethnic minorities areSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Altering a Homogenized Heritage: Articulating Heterogeneous Material Cultures in Norway and SwedenKjetil Fallan and Grace-Lees-Maffei (eds.), Designing Worlds: National Design Histories in an Age of Globalization (New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2016), pp. 172-187.,  Jun 2016The Nordic countries are generally perceived as relatively egalitarian and homogenous societies, ... more The Nordic countries are generally perceived as relatively egalitarian and homogenous societies, in terms of gender, class and race/ethnicity. On closer inspection, however, this image of uniformity starts to crack. The ethnic makeup of the Nordic nations has always been mixed, and is becoming ever more diverse. The Sami constitutes an indigenous population whose homeland cuts across national boundaries, and is considered a (state-less) nation in itself. There are also other older minorities in the region, such as Jews and Romani, as well as the kven population of Finnish decent in Norway and the Swedish population in Finland. Although they have only experienced significant non-European immigration relatively recently, the Nordic countries have now become multi-cultural societies with sizable diaspora from Africa, South America and Asia.The material cultures of ethnic minorities, old and new, are rich and profoundly present in everyday life—from Sami language signage in the northern regions to hijab-wearing women everywhere, as well as in home-making practices where new, hybrid forms of design culture emerge. However, these elements of our environs are completely absent from Nordic design history. Even recent national survey histories, which have incorporated many of the critical and theoretical discourses in international design historiography, are mute on the subject of ethnic minorities. The absence of Sami material culture, which is largely craft-based and traditional, in Nordic design history may be partially due to design history’s preference for industrial manufacture and for aesthetic innovation in the modern sense. The absence of newer minorities’ material culture may also have to do with the bias towards production of commodities at the expense of more mediation- and consumption-oriented approaches.Based on the premise that a more inclusive approach describing a more heterogeneous material culture will lead to a better design history, this chapter explores why Nordic design history has been so 'white' and what strategies can be devised for a more colourful future history. How can the nuances of minority material cultures be articulated and incorporated in new national design histories? Which topics, approaches and methods need to be adopted and developed to foster such new narratives? What role do national contexts play in framing these? How do we make the conceptual maps fit the empirical terrain of culturally heterogeneous modern nation states?The minority populations of the Nordic countries might be small compared to those of other nations, but they are rapidly increasing both in number and percentage. At the same time, the majority populations are small in absolute numbers in a globalizing world. As minor majorities we should, therefore, recognize the importance of writing inclusive and nuanced design histories on a national and regional scale as contributions to a more global discourse.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Match Made in Utopia: the uneasy love affair of art and industry in ScandinaviaThe Routledge Companion to Design Studies, eds.

It demonstrates how the qualities, properties and affordances of materials—especially of plastics—have time and again been at the center of attention when the romance of art and industry has been put to the test. From the late 19th century’s wondrous examples of engineering art, via the mid-20th century’s consolidation of industrial design as a distinct profession, to the industrial nostalgia of contemporary craft, Scandinavian design discourse on art and industry has grappled with how material matters.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

High Fidelity: Visioning Sound at Tandbergs RadiofabrikkDenise Hagströmer (ed.), Ekstrøm Extreme: Norwegian Furniture and Industrial Design (Stuttgart: Arnoldsche, 2016)When Terje Ekstrøm graduated from the National College of Art and Design (Statens håndverks- og k... more When Terje Ekstrøm graduated from the National College of Art and Design (Statens håndverks- og kunstindustriskole, SHKS) in 1968, his first job was at Tandbergs Radiofabrikk. Following a two-year period as full-time, in-house industrial designer, he continued to work for the company on a part-time and freelance basis until 1977. These years with what was then one of Norway’s most prestigious high-tech companies gave Ekstrøm ample experience with the technical and economic contingencies of industrial design practice, but also provided him with an unconventional and imaginative work environment that would leave a lasting legacy in his work. Ekstrøm’s tenure with Tandbergs Radiofabrikk overlaps with a dramatic period in the history of the company and coincides with a transitional period for the hi-fi industry as a whole. In the mid-1950s the company had about 250 employees; a decade later the number was 1000, and in the mid-1970s it had mushroomed to 3000.  Ekstrøm’s hire, then, was part of a massive expansion, and his contract ended only a year before the flagship of the Norwegian electronics industry ran aground and went into receivership in 1978.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Nordic Noir: Deadly Design from the Peacemongering PeripheryThe countries of Scandinavia are routinely touted as peaceful, harmonious societies. Correspondin... more The countries of Scandinavia are routinely touted as peaceful, harmonious societies. Correspondingly, Scandinavian design is promoted as democratic, humane, and friendly. However, the reality is that Scandinavian history is fraught with military conflict, and that not all Scandinavian design is benign. These two less advertised trajectories in Scandinavian culture converge on the region’s military arms industry, which for more than a century dutifully has delivered deadly designs to an eager international export market. This article will ask why these arguably controversial objects seem to be able to “fly under the radar” of the official branding and public perception of Norway and Sweden as peace-nations, and explore how they vehemently challenge the canon of Scandinavian design in that they represent a type of material culture diametrically opposed to the delicate glass and elegant teak furniture normally associated with design from this region.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Along with international developments in higher education, the influence of post-colonial theory, and intellectual endeavours like ‘world history’, design historians are now writing Global Design History (to use the title of a 2011 edited collection). While the nation state is no longer the only socio-cultural or political-economic unit forming our identities and experiences—if it ever were—this article examines the value of national frameworks in writing design history and asks whether moves to discard them are premature. Are national histories of design dependent upon outmoded generalisations and stereotypes? Or do they demonstrate cogent frameworks for the discussion of common socio-economic and cultural conditions and shared identities? Globalizing design history involves writing new histories of neglected regions and nations and revisionist histories informed by the findings and methods of new comparative and global histories, of celebrated industrial nations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Enthusiast's Eye: The Value of Unsanctioned Knowledge in Design Historical Scholarshipby Kjetil Fallan and Paul HazellIf design history research relies solely on institutionalized documentation and academic scholars... more If design history research relies solely on institutionalized documentation and academic scholarship – that is, sanctioned knowledge – not only will its purview be limited to a very narrow segment of design culture, it will also lose out on a vast array of sources to valuable knowledge about our material environment produced by amateurs, collectors, and enthusiasts – what we in this article define as “unsanctioned knowledge.” Because of its dissociation with professional institutions and academic protocols and their – albeit admittedly utopian, but nonetheless upheld – ideals of objectivity, this type of knowledge is typically considered fundamentally subjective in nature and therefore of little or no relevance and value to academic scholarship. In this article, we argue that, to the contrary, design historical scholarship has much to gain from engaging more seriously with the unsanctioned knowledge represented by the enthusiast's eye.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
