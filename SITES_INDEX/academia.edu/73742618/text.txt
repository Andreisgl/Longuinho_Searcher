Although ecological characteristics facilitating the establishment and spread of non-native species are widely recognized, little is known about organismal attributes underlying invasion success. In this study, we tested the effect of thermal acclimation on thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in the invasive Xenopus laevis and the Chilean native Calyptocephalella gayi. In particular, the maximal righting performance (μMAX), optimal temperature (TO), lower (CTmin) and upper critical thermal limits (CTmax), thermal breadth (Tbr) and the area under the performance curve (AUC) were studied after 6 weeks acclimation to 10 and 20°C. We observed higher values of μmax and AUC in X. laevis in comparison to C. gayi. On the contrary, the invasive species showed...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIntegrative and Comparative BiologyRapid Shifts in the Temperature Dependence of Locomotor Performance in an Invasive Frog, Xenopus laevis, Implications for ConservationJulien  CourantTemperature is a critical abiotic factor impacting all aspects of the biology of organisms, especially in ectotherms. As such, it is an important determinant of the potential invasive ability of organisms and may limit population expansion unless organisms can physiologically respond to changes in temperature either through plasticity or by adapting to their novel environment. Here, we studied the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, which has become invasive on a global scale. We compared adults from an invasive population of western France with individuals from two populations in the native range in South Africa. We measured the thermal dependence of locomotor performance in adults given its relevance to dispersal, predator escape, and prey capture. Our results show significant differences in the limits of the 80% performance breadth interval for endurance with the French population showing a left shift in its limits congruent with the colder climate experienced in France.

We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (∼2000 m above sea level) and low (∼ 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (Topt) had a &gt;9°C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0°C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5°C; cross-bred, 25.9°C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8±0.8°C) than pure-b...Download Free PDFView PDFImpact of global warming at the range margins: phenotypic plasticity and behavioral thermoregulation will buffer an endemic amphibianIsmael Álvaro Oyarzo, Manuel Ignacio Ruiz Aravena, Jose  Bartheld, Juan Diego Gaitán-EspitiaWhen dispersal is not an option to evade warming temperatures, compensation through behavior, plasticity, or evolutionary adaptation is essential to prevent extinction. In this work, we evaluated whether there is physiological plasticity in the thermal performance curve (TPC) of maximum jumping speed in individuals acclimated to current and projected temperatures and whether there is an opportunity for behavioral thermoregulation in the desert landscape where inhabits the northernmost population of the endemic frog Pleurodema thaul. Our results indicate that individuals acclimated to 20°C and 25°C increased the breath of their TPCs by shifting their upper limits with respect to when they were acclimated at 10°C. In addition, even when dispersal is not possible for this population, the landscape is heterogeneous enough to offer opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation. In particular, under current climatic conditions , behavioral thermoregulation is not compulsory as available operative temperatures are encompassed within the population TPC limits. However, for severe projected temperatures under climate change, behavioral thermoregula-tion will be required in the sunny patches. In overall, our results suggest that this population of Pleurodema thaul will be able to endure the worst projected scenario of climate warming as it has not only the physiological capacities but also the environmental opportunities to regulate its body temperature behaviorally.Download Free PDFView PDFPlos ONEVariation in Thermal Sensitivity and Thermal Tolerances in an Invasive Species across a Climatic Gradient: Lessons from the Land Snail Cornu aspersum2013 • Juan Diego Gaitán-EspitiaThe ability of organisms to perform at different temperatures could be described by a continuous nonlinear reaction norm (i.e., thermal performance curve, TPC), in which the phenotypic trait value varies as a function of temperature. Almost any shift in the parameters of this performance curve could highlight the direct effect of temperature on organism fitness, providing a powerful framework for testing thermal adaptation hypotheses. Inter-and intraspecific differences in this performance curve are also reflected in thermal tolerances limits (e.g., critical and lethal limits), influencing the biogeographic patterns of species’ distribution. Within this context, here we investigated the intraspecific variation in thermal sensitivities and thermal tolerances in three populations of the invasive snail Cornu aspersum across a geographical gradient, characterized by different climatic conditions. Thus, we examined population differentiation in the TPCs, thermal-coma recovery times, expression of heat-shock proteins and standard metabolic rate (i.e., energetic costs of physiological differentiation). We tested two competing hypotheses regarding thermal adaptation (the “hotter is better” and the generalist-specialist trade-offs). Our results show that the differences in thermal sensitivity among populations of C. aspersum follow a latitudinal pattern, which is likely the result of a combination of thermodynamic constraints (“hotter is better”) and thermal adaptations to their local environments (generalist-specialist trade-offs). This finding is also consistent with some thermal tolerance indices such as the Heat-Shock Protein Response and the recovery time from chill-coma. However, mixed responses in the evaluated traits suggest that thermal adaptation in this species is not complete, as we were not able to detect any differences in neither energetic costs of physiological differentiation among populations, nor in the heat-coma recovery.Download Free PDFView PDFGeographic variation in thermal physiological performance of the intertidal crab Petrolisthes violaceus along a latitudinal gradient.Nelson A. Lagos, Juan Diego Gaitán-Espitia, M A LardiesEnvironmental temperature has profound effects on the biological performance and biogeographical distribution of ectothermic species. Variation of this abiotic factor across geographic gradients is expected to produce physiological differentiation and local adaptation of natural populations depending on their thermal tolerances and physiological sensitivities. Here, we studied geographic variation in whole-organism thermal physiology of seven populations of the porcelain crab Petrolisthes violaceus across a latitudinal gradient of 3000 km, characterized by a cline of thermal conditions. Our study found that populations of P. violaceus show no differences in the limits of their thermal performance curves and demonstrate a negative correlation of their optimal temperatures with latitude. Additionally, our findings show that high-latitude populations of P. violaceus exhibit broader thermal tolerances, which is consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis. Interestingly, under a future scenario of warming oceans, the thermal safety margins of P. violaceus indicate that lower latitude populations can physiologically tolerate the ocean-warming scenarios projected by the IPCC for the end of the twenty-first century.Download Free PDFView PDFConservation physiology{"__content__"=>"Physiological plasticity in a successful invader: rapid acclimation to cold occurs only in cool-climate populations of cane toads ().", "i"=>{"__content__"=>"Rhinella marina"}}2018 • Richard ShinePhysiological plasticity may facilitate invasion of novel habitats; but is such plasticity present in all populations of the invader or is it elicited only by specific climatic challenges? In cold-climate areas of Australia, invasive cane toads () can rapidly acclimate to cool conditions. To investigate whether this physiological plasticity is found in all invasive cane toads or is only seen in cool climates, we measured the acclimation ability of toads from across Australia and the island of Hawai&#39;i. We collected toads from the field and placed them at either 12 or 24°C for 12 h before measuring their righting response as a proxy for critical thermal minimum (CTmin). Toads from the coolest Australian region (New South Wales) demonstrated plasticity (as previously reported), with exposure to 12°C (vs. 24°C) decreasing CTmin by 2°C. In toads from other Australian populations, CTmins were unaffected by our thermal treatments. Hawai&#39;ian toads from a cool, wet site also rapidly ...Download Free PDFView PDFTesting the heat-invariant and cold-variability tolerance hypotheses across geographic gradientsMaria OrellanaChanges in temperature across geographic gradients can occur on a wide temporal range, from fluctuations within hours as a result of day-night to those over many years. These events will drive many organisms towards their physiological limits of thermal tolerance. Recently, many reports support a limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses to high temperatures, meaning a conserved heat tolerance among ectotherms in general. We address this problem and tested the heat and cold tolerance invariant–variant hypotheses in terrestrial isopods. We studied five different populations of Porcellio laevis and three populations of Porcellio scaber, spanning 30° S latitudinal gradient in Chile. The heat tolerance of woodlice was conserved with little variation along latitude and environmental temperatures, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with environmental temperatures and latitudes. Indeed, a significant and negative correlation was observed between cold tolerance and latitude. Also, significant and positive correlations were observed among cold tolerance and environmental temperatures. Conversely, heat tolerance was not significantly correlated with any of the environmental temperatures tested neither with latitude. This macrophysiological pattern indicated that heat and cold-tolerances of species and populations not always change across geographical gradients meaning that thermal tolerance responses to high temperatures may be evolutionary constrained.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Experimental BiologyThermal physiological traits and plasticity of metabolism are sensitive to biogeographic breaks in a rock-pool marine shrimpNelson A.
