I argue that Zarathustra’s teaching of the overman acquires new resonances by reflecting on the context of that origination from Lucian’s Kataplous — which literally means sailing into port — referring to the soul’s journey, ferried by Charon, guided by Hermes, into the afterlife. The Kataplous he tyrannos, usually translated Downward Journey or The Tyrant, is a Menippean satire telling the tale of the “overman” who is imagined to be superior to others of “lesser” station in this-worldly life and the same tyrant after his (comically unwilling) transport into the underworld. As a reflection on the life and the death of Zarathustra, this essay also explores the politics of kingship for Empedocles as reformer in terms of Hölderlin’s Death of Empedocles and Nietzsche’s unpublished drafts on the same topic. In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche points to a perspective beyond the here and now, beyond the “values” of our all-too-worldly and all-too-human concerns, no matter whether in terms of perceived political/economic advantage, or indeed in the pursuit of more quotidian satisfactions.Download Free PDFView PDFBecoming and PurificationBabette BabichA reading of Nietzsche's Zarathustra's teaching of the overman as at once an imitation of Empedocles and a satirical exrcise designed to show that the fantasy of the higher human being is human rather than superhuman. Nietzsche thus exposes the vanity of the idea of the overman as perspective point of view -- his reference is to Lucian's Downward Journey, an account of the soul's perspective on its own all-too-human vanities after death.Download Free PDFView PDFFuture Past: The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra and EternityBabette BabichFuture Past: The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra and Eternity or What is the Weight of the Greatest Heavy Weight? in The Agonist, Vol VI, Issues 1 & 2, Spring/Fall 2013Download Free PDFView PDFEducation and Exemplars: Learning to Doubt the OvermanBabette BabichThis paper first considers Ivan Illich’s challenging book, <Deschooling Society> as a general prelude to a discussion of Nietzsche’s philosophical engagement with his classical philology, a profession which he argued to be essentially pedagogical. Illich argues that schooling is inherently an education in consumption and thus Illich echoes many of the observations of Jacques Ellul. Where Nietzsche argues that it is incumbent upon the individual to become, as it were, his own educator by his or her choice of an exemplar, I take this to a brief re-examination of Nietzsche's ironic use of the overman.Download Free PDFView PDFNietzsche and the Becoming of Life.
