It belongs to the nonSaccharomyces wine yeasts and contributes to the wine aroma by the production of volatile compounds. The ability to grow in preserved food and feed environments is due to its capacity to grow under low pH, high osmotic pressure and low oxygen tension. A new application of P. anomala is its use as a biocontrol agent, which is based on the potential to inhibit a variety of moulds in different environments. Although classified as a biosafety class-1 organism, cases of P. anomala infections have been reported in immunocompromised patients. On the other hand, P. anomala killer toxins have a potential as antimicrobial agents. The yeast can use a broad range of nitrogen and phosphor sources, which makes it a potential agent to decrease environmental pollution by organic residues from agriculture.

RNA samples from R. toruloides CBS14 cell cultures grown on either CG or CGHH were collected at different time points of cultivation, and a differential gene expression analysis was performed between cells grown at a similar physiological situation. Results We observed enhanced transcription of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and enzymes localized in mitochondria in CGHH compared to CG. Genes involved in protein turnover, including those encoding ribosomal proteins, translation elongation factors, and genes involved in building the proteasome also showed an enhanced transcription in CGHH compared to CG. At 10 h cultivation, another group of activated genes in CGHH was involved in β-oxidation, handling oxidative stress and degr...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Bioethanol, the curr... more Liquid biofuels have great potential to replace fossil transportation fuels. Bioethanol, the current major biofuel, is mainly produced using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, present biofuels are largely generated from first generation, i.e. food grade, raw materials. Second generation, lignocellulosic biomass represents an abundant and cheap feedstock for bioethanol production; however, sugars present in cellulose and hemicellulose are difficult to access and not all of these sugars can be assimilated by S. cerevisiae. Other yeast species have been explored to ferment hemicellulose sugars such as xylose or to be specifically competitive in ethanol production. There are still attempts to introduce those species in industrial processes. The major approach has been to express heterologous genes enabling xylose assimilation in S. cerevisiae. Recently, by metabolic and evolutionary engineering in industrial isolates, S. cerevisiae strains applicable for industrial ethanol production from lignocellulose have been constructed. Apart from bioethanol, yeasts have been manipulated to produce butanol. Production of biodiesel and other advanced biofuels by oleaginous yeasts or engineered S. cerevisiae from lignocellulose has been proposed. Yeasts can also be used in side processes of biofuel production, such as preservation and pretreatment of biomass, or co-conversion of biomass to high value products.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method for carotenoid quantification was developed and validated. Saponification effects on individual carotenoid quantification were identified, and lipid and carotenoid kinetics during cultivation were determined. The carotenoids β-carotene, γ-carotene, torularhodin, and torulene were identified; β-carotene was the major carotenoid, reaching a maximum of 1.48 mg/100 g dry weight. Recoveries of the carotenoids were between 66% and 76%, except torulene and torularhodin, which had lower recoveries due to saponification effects. Total carotenoid content in saponified and unsaponified yeast extract, respectively, determined by UHPLC or photometer, respectively, was 1.99 mg/100 g and 4.02 mg β-EQ/100 g dry weight. Growth kinetics showed a positive correlation between carotenoid content and lipid accumulation...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It contains a constitutive respiratory chain which provides NAD(P)+ regeneration, contributing to the rapid catabolism of this bacterium. Although Z. mobilis exerts the most important traits desired in bioproducers, improvements are still required. In recent years elevated thermotolerance has been one of directions in focus. It has been shown, that respiratory chain plays important role for the thermotolerance in Zymomonas mobilis [1]. In this study we examined collection of respiratory mutants of Z. mobilis. Zymomonas mobilis strains Zm6 (ATCC29191) and eight of its respiratory mutant derivates were grown in four different conditions: 30oC aerobic (in shaken flasks), 30oC microaerobic (without shaking), 42oC aerobic and 42oC microaerobic, to compare the oxygen and thermal stress impact on each of these strains.

R. babjevae can produce compounds of biotechnological interest such as lipids, carotenoids and biosurfactants from low value substrates such as lignocellulose hydrolysate. High-quality genome assemblies are needed to develop genetic tools and to understand fungal evolution and genetics. Here, we combined short- and long-read sequencing to resolve the genomes of two R. babjevae strains, CBS 7808 (type strain) and DBVPG 8058 at chromosomal level. Both genomes have a size of 21 Mbp and a GC content of 68.2%. Allele frequency analysis indicated tetraploidy in both strains. They harbor 21 putative chromosomes with sizes ranging from 0.4 to 2.4 Mb. In both assemblies, the mitochondrial genome was recovered in a single contig, which shared 97% pairwise identity.
