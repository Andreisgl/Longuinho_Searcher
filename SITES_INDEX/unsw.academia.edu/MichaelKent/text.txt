Such a link is logical given the apparent similarities between the forms and functions of dialogue and engagement (Taylor & Kent, 2014). Engagement and dialogue share an association to the idea of relationships-a focal concept in public relations, marketing, organizational communication, and other areas. This chapter advances a model of multilevel interconnectedness between engagement and dialogue , where dialogue provides both an orientation within which engagement can occur, and a specific way in which communication is operationalized within that engagement. This dialogic engagement is generated out of a context that draws on principles of dialogue to create an environment within which organizations and their stakeholders hold positive views of each other and the conduct of shared communication, and therefore wish to engage with each other. A mutually beneficial outcome is frequently a consequence of the interaction that is generated out of this environment, but a desire for that outcome is not always a characteristic of the environment. The positive views the participants have of each other make them want to engage. Within their engagement, the dialogic context inclines participants to undertake a process of communication that is distinguished from other forms of communication by the use of dialogic strategies and tactics that not only reach out to but also interest and interact with stakeholders and publics on their own terms. Dialogic engagement is therefore both a context and a process that demonstrate dialogic principles, a rhetorical undertaking requiring relational co-orientation and effort. Linking Engagement and Dialogue Areas of commonality between the concepts of engagement and dialogue have been recognized in extant literature. Foster and Jonker (2005), for example, discuss "the dialogue of engagement ," while Morsing and Schultz (2006) emphasize the significance of dialogue in forms of engagement related to corporate social responsibility. Both dialogue and engagement share a focus on achieving responsive communication between organizations and their stakeholders, but the nature of the connections between dialogue and engagement has not been clearly articulated.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Ritualistic sacrifice in crisis communication: A case for eliminating scapegoating from the crisis/apologia lexiconThe crisis strategy of scapegoating has been part of the crisis and image restoration lexicon for... more The crisis strategy of scapegoating has been part of the crisis and image restoration lexicon for more than four decades. And yet, the practice of scapegoating is a well-known unethical practice that simply deflects deserved blame from one party to a sacrificial other. This essay critiques the "Primary Crisis Response" strategy of scapegoating, conducting an historical and ethical critique of the crisis strategy, and concludes that scapegoating should be removed from the public relations crisis and image restoration lexicon. Over the last several decades, the state of various public relations' reputational measures including corporate social responsibility, organizational ethics counsel, etc. have been examined by more than a thousand scholars-almost a thousand in Public Relations Review alone-in order to understand the impact that reputation and public perception have on organizational success (cf.). Surveys of professional reputation continue to conclude that the reputation of public relations is among the lowest of the professional communicators (lower even than politicians and videogame designers) and the least likely profession for a parent to encourage a child to pursue (https://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/ 2016/04/01/what-most-prestigious-us-jobs-have-in-common-and-its-not-money). Scholars have posited a number of possible explanations for public relations' poor reputation. Possibilities include millennials who have been unprepared for their roles as ethical counselors (Neill & Weaver, 2017), reputational problems caused by poor social media communication (Ott & Theunissen, 2015), a focus on client needs over the good of stakeholders and publics (Yang, Taylor, & Saffer, 2016), our negative reputation being caused by poorly trained professionals and negative portrayals in the media (Bowen, 2009), etc. However, this article posits something that many reputational studies have found but have not stated as bluntly: one of the primary reasons for our less than positive reputation is because we are simply not acting as ethical communicators. Public relations has been organization-centric for decades, particularly when it comes to crisis communication (cf. Heath, 2010; Kent, 2010). For example, in terms of crisis communication, we still advocate for: attacking the accuser, denial, scapegoating, making excuses, justifications, and compensation to victims, as "primary crisis response strategies" (Coombs, 2007). Moreover, scholars of dialogue (Lane, 2014) and engagement (Mahin, 2017) have found that organizations regularly orchestrate faux-engagement and manipulative dialogue as a means of achieving organizational goals at the expense of stakeholder interests and desires. The focus of this essay is on one such well-established and patently unethical crisis communication strategy mentioned above: scapegoating. Scapegoating is an apologia strategy that has been repeatedly examined for more than four decades. We present evidence that scapegoating represents an obviously unethical practice that violates established codes of conduct, including the PRSASave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Many public relations students and professionals now take for granted the use of influencers in strategic messaging, as something that is necessary and "part of the cost of doing business." This article presents an alternative way of thinking about influencers, from a public relations standpoint, positing that communication professionals should become influencers themselves and positioning their organization itself as social influencers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

More recently, scholars have used dialogue as a framework to study mediated communication via the Internet and social media. However, many studies of mediated dialogue have concluded that the communicator/organization failed to be dialogic, or that various social media tools such as Twitter had failed to deliver on their &quot;potential&quot; for dialogue. In this essay, we argue that much of the dialogic scholarship has largely been dialogue in name only, failing to examine most aspects of dialogic communication, and at best having only &quot;dialogic potential.&quot; We conduct a critique of dialogic theory providing suggestions for moving forward.

Dialogue, development communication, and deontological ethicsPublic Relations Review,  2015ABSTRACT Despite being a frequently discussed topic in the public relations literature, dialogue ... more ABSTRACT Despite being a frequently discussed topic in the public relations literature, dialogue is often misunderstood as simply two-way communication and seldom examined in practice. While international development organizations frequently claim to use dialogic and participatory methods, development communication remains a relatively unexplored area in public relations. To further clarify public relations’ understanding of dialogue as well as its potential in development practice, this study examined how a USAID-sponsored international development project adopted participatory communication practices to encourage Bolivian farmers to switch from coca to coffee. Drawing from public relations and development literature on dialogue, the article juxtaposes the approaches to “dialogue” used in the project against normative concepts of the theory. The article argues that using genuine dialogue is a matter of differentiating deontological, means-based approaches to communication practice, from consequentialist, ends-based orientations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An organization’s public is as likely to be half way across the world as it is to be down the block. Time, space, and location matter less in our highly networked world. Yet, time, space, and location also create challenges for organizations as they seek to influence their environments and achieve objectives. Public relations or strategic communication helps organizations work toward their objectives (Botan, 1997).This chapter examines public relations through the theory of inoculation.Inoculation theory is a message-oriented theory that assumes that messages have effects. Public relations professionals work to build relationships with publics and influence those publics. The first part of this chapter explores public relations as a persuasive communication function. The second part of the chapter provides a summary of inoculation theory showing how it is used in a variety of persuasive contexts. The third section of the chapter provides a case study of how inoculation is used by a large consumer products company in its communication with publics. The final section provides conclusions and implications of using inoculation theory in public relations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
