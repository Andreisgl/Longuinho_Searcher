These vacant buildings could serve as a short-term housing solution before transformations for the long-term are realised, which could reduce the pressure on the market in the near future for the ones most in need.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSQUATTING AS A FRAMEWORK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRATEGY2021 • Maurice VerhoefThe Netherlands has a housing shortage since the 1960s. The estimated demand reaches 845.000 new dwellings by 2035. Simultaneously, 6% of all the offices and shops are vacant, which possibly increases even more due to the covid-19 pandemic and due to the rise of freelancers, who generally do not need an office space. Since the 20th century, and especially since the post-war era, the squatting movement counteracted this vacancy by occupying urban space to ensure a living and/or working space. This thesis focuses on the historical framework of squatting practices in Amsterdam starting from the post-war era until now, and how squatting can be a practice for an alternative, affordable housing system. The thesis brings the disadvantages regarding the most acknowledgeable development of affordable housing – social housing – to the foreground. The Dutch housing system is characterized by a strong government involvement. The social housing system is the most acknowledgeable development regarding affordable housing in the Netherlands. However, the social housing system has counterparts, as it has very long waiting lists (up to ten year - within the main cities of the Netherlands) to be allocated to a dwelling, unequal opportunities for middle incomes to obtain a dwelling and landlord levy’s which diminish the affordable housing production and indirectly passes on to the tenant. Squatting emerged mainly because of the housing shortage, aswell as the fact that education became more important after World War II, which led to the increased need of independency and independent housing for youth. People started to take the matter into their own hands, by appropriating urban space. During the mid 1970s, the social movement gained broad societal support because of the preservation of the ‘Nieuwmarkt’ (district in Amsterdam) and became an institutionalized practice with the emergence of squatting agencies, squatting manuals and newspapers. Starting from mid 1980s, the movement declined and lost the societal support due to conflicts and riots with the authorities. During the following decades, the squatter’s movement was put under pressure by the authorities through legal actions. In 2010, the squatting practice was totally banned. The ‘Breeding Ground Act’ (1998) enabled squatted buildings to be legalized in which the squatters’ ambitions were maintained. Two case studies addressed in the thesis - ‘Plantage Doklaan’ and ‘Overtoom 301’ - are squatted buildings which were legalized and transformed to breeding grounds around the 00s, including affordable dwellings, workspaces and public amenities. These examples, which still exist today, show to have a positive influence on the city fabric of Amsterdam – both socially and culturally. The regular housing shortage, the continuing vacancy and the fate of real estate speculation are all interlinked. Squatting challenges these problems as a whole and opened up the conversation about housing shortage, vacancy and real estate speculation. There should be an option in which empty office space can be converted into affordable living space, temporarily or permanent. Governmental zoning plans need to be changed quicker instead of long-term processes. Then, for example an office space, could easier be transformed into a (temporary) home, which put less pressure on the building industry. Collective ownership (for example CLT) could function as a tenure ship in which the needs of the residents are met, instead of private ownership as a speculative tool from which money is made.Download Free PDFView PDFTowards inclusive service delivery through social investment in Italy. An analysis five sectors with particular focus on health care2018 • Daniela BurlliThis report examines trends in social investment in Italy following the financial crisis of 2007/8. The first section considers social investment in relation to four policy areas: early childhood education and care, housing, financial services and water. The second part of the report provides an overview of social investment and disinvestment trends in the healthcare system in Italy since the 1990s. This section includes a detailed account of service users&#39; and professionals&#39; experiences of the impact of liberalisation and austerity measures on health service delivery drawing on qualitative data collection. Throughout the report we identify policy recommendations to address the effects and impacts of emergent trends towards social disinvestment and liberalisation of public services. This study is part of the wider pan-European RE-InVEST project to investigate the impact of the EU Social Investment package on marginalised groups since the 2007 crisis.Download Free PDFView PDFAt Home in the Housing Market: RC43 Conference Book of Proceedings(Un)planning metropolitan urban space2013 • Sofia PagliarinIn metropolitan areas, housing demands of core cities are satisfied through the expansion towards the suburbs. In Southern European countries, which are characterized by the highest rate of home occupancy in Europe, urban sprawl can be considered as a type of spatial organization that facilitates home-ownership. In this context, local governments' decisions emerge as a discriminant factor for sprawled housing provision, as local authorities purposely manage and allocate municipal land in order to provide affordable, suburban housing. Hence, housing preferences have a marginal effect in producing sprawled residential areas, as people tend to conform - or at best choose among - the housing stock that municipalities offer. This claim is supported by the use of European and local data on urban development patterns in two Southern European cities, Barcelona and Milan, during a 30 years timespan. Furthermore, interviews have been carried out to a variety of actors in order to explain the processes of sprawled housing provision in both areas.Download Free PDFView PDFHow Heritage Learns2021 • Nicholas ClarkeHow Heritage Learns explores the dynamics that come into play when public housing becomes valourised as heritage in the Netherlands and how that, in turn modulates the evolution of this protected housing. It builds on the foundation set by the thesis of Steward Brand, that buildings learn through the adaptation of their fabric to external forces: changing fashion, technologies and economy. This dissertation investigates different key drivers for change: Energy, Economy and Comfort (2E+Co). To understand how and why the housing heritage evolved over time, an ecology of ideas is developed that sees buildings as organisms evolving and learning in their environments, providing a multi-sided theoretic model for analysis. Three case studies are extensively explored: the Justus van Effen Quarter in Rotterdam (1921–22) and the King&#39;s Wives of Landlust (1937–38) and Jeruzalem public housing complexes (1949–52), both in Amsterdam. These are all exemplary monuments of Dutch public housing ...Download Free PDFView PDFResearch Programme 2009-2014: OTB Research Institute for Housing, Urban and Mobility Studies2010 • Andre OuwehandDownload Free PDFView PDFAt Home in the Housing Market: RC43 Conference Book of ProceedingsLocal Government does matter: How local taxation increases urban sprawl: the case Of Groane Regional Park (co-authored)2013 • Sofia PagliarinThe analysis of territorial phenomena usually bypasses the role of local political entities as crucial decision-makers and market regulators, focusing instead on the role of developers and housing preferences of home-buyers. In contrast, this article suggests that local administrative units are crucial agents in defining and shaping the processes of urban development at a larger scale. In this article It is argued that, when a given local government is allowed to subsist mainly on local taxation, a fiscal crisis of local government units is a determinant factor of urban growth, as each administration tries to fuel up urban expansion, in the hopes of boosting the local tax base. By employing a multi-method approach, we have ascertained that other characteristics traditionally associated with urban sprawling were not present in the area of Milan, so it has been identified as a least likely case to experience urban dispersion. In this context, we concentrate mainly on the Groane Regional Park. The aim of article is to re--‐focus on the local administrations as powerful agents that shape metropolitan scale urban development.Download Free PDFView PDFHousing StudiesOn Priority and Progress: Forced Residential Relocation and Housing Chances in Haaglanden, the Netherlands2008 • Reinout KleinhansThere is a wide interest in the effects of forced relocation in the context of urban restructuring. This interest is also inspired by debates on gentrification and displacement. The prevailing idea is that the lowest income groups particularly suffer from displacement in terms of their housing quality and increased rents. In addition, increasing proportions of forced movers are assumed to harm the housing opportunities of other house seekers, while competing within the social rented sector. Although several studies deal with the consequences of forced relocation, a broader perspective on housing chances is currently lacking. Moreover, most studies are qualitative, whereas a larger-scale quantitative analysis is needed to test assumptions mentioned above. This paper addresses these matters by analysing housing allocation data of the Haaglanden in the Netherlands and two cross-sectional surveys among forced movers in the region's central city, The Hague. Findings indicate that housing chances for both forced and regular house seekers have not declined substantially since 2000. Moreover, most forced movers experienced dwelling progress, partly thanks to the design of the housing allocation model. However, low-educated, as well as middle- and higher-income households less often report dwelling progress. Explanations for these findings are provided.Download Free PDFView PDFSocial Housing in Europe2007 • Darinka CzischkeCopyright and moral rights for the publications made accessible in the public portal are retained by the authors and/or other copyright owners and it is a condition of accessing publications that users recognise and abide by the legal requirements associated with these rights. • Users may download and print one copy of any publication from the public portal for the purpose of private study or research. • You may not further distribute the material or use it for any profit-making activity or commercial gain • You may freely distribute the URL identifying the publication in the public portal?

It was considered a design laboratory, where research, design, and experimentation would focus on a unique goal: create a space-efficient affordable housing typology, based on minimum quality standards. Empirical evidence indicates a renewed interest in alternative design solutions and minimum dwelling approaches over the last decade: examples include micro-housing solutions and collaborative housing models. This is due to the current affordable crisis and the increasing trend of urbanisation. However, little is known about the current interpretation of Existenzminimum. What does the concept entail today and how has it developed? This article investigates if and how Existenzminimum is currently applied: first, it unfolds the core design principles of the original Existenzminimum. Then, these principles are used to asses...Download Free PDFView PDFMaking room or containing?
