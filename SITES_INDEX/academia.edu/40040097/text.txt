More than twenty years of research have yielded sufficient numismatic material to analyze monetary circulation of one of the most important cities on the Pannonian limes. The coin finds cover a time span from end of the 2nd to the middle of the 3rd century, which is not surprising in itself. It is interesting to observe the end of circulation, with a complete lack of coins of Valerian and Gallienus, otherwise so numerous elsewhere. Another interesting fact is the absence of any destruction layer whatsoever. Monetary circulation within the municipium is in strong contrast to a coin hoard found nearby and also ending in the middle of the 3rd century. However, this unexplained abrupt break in the monetary circulation seems not to be just of local character, but a rather widespread sensation that led to a considerable reshaping of civil settlements in the north of the provinceDownload Free PDFView PDFB.

Proceedings of the International Numismatic Symposium “Circulation of the antique coins in Southeastern Europe”. Belgrade 2018, p. 87-103Kyrylo MyzginUntil recently, finds of Roman provincial coins on the territory of Ukraine were rare (no more than thirty coins). But in recent years, situation has radically changed, due to the active use of metal detectors. Today, we can talk about several hundreds, or even thousands, finds of Roman provincial coins, most dated into the 3rd century AD and minted in the cities of the Balkan provinces. All of them are found in the area of the Chernyakhiv Culture (mainly between the middle reaches of Dnieper and the middle reaches of Dniester), which is associated with Gothic tribes. Inflow of these coins is associated with the events of the mid 3rd century AD exclusively, namely – with participation of the local barbarian population in the Gothic wars. Although the majority of coins originate from Viminacium and Provincia Dacia, among finds there is also a large number of coins from other cities of the Balkan provinces. The largest number includes coins of Marcianopolis, Filippopolis, Deultum, Anchial and Nicopolis ad Istrum. On one side, statistics of these finds draw a picture of their circulation in the Balkans. However, on the other hand, finds of such coins make it possible to clarify certain events of the Gothic wars, which are known in written sources and from archaeological research. In addition, today we can already say that the finds of Roman provincial coins, together with other categories of Roman coins and finds from the 3rd century AD, represent the early horizon of Chernyakhiv Culture.Download Free PDFView PDFJOURNAL OF ANCIENT HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY MONOGRAPHIC SERIES 1 GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL IN ROMAN EUROPE TRAGEDIES The evidence of hoards, epigraphic and literary sourcesROMAN COIN HOARDS OF THE THIRD CENTURY AD FOUND ON THE TERRITORY OF MOESIA SUPERIOR AND SERBIAN PART OF DALMATIA AND PANNONIA INFERIOR: THE REASONS FOR THEIR BURIAL2020 • Mirjana Vojvoda, Saša RedžićThe territory of present-day Serbia comprises the area of the former Roman provinces of Moesia Superior, Pannonia Inferior, Dalmatia and Barbaricum (the region between Pannonia Inferior and Dacia). The turbulent events of the 3rd century, which were frequent in the Balkans, left behind numerous coin hoards as significant historical sources. Thus far, 94 coin hoards have been found, ranging from Septimius Severus and Caracalla to Diocletian.Download Free PDFView PDFPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL NUMISMATIC SYMPOSIUM The monetary circulation of Roman provincial coins from the Viminacium mint in the territory of present-day Slovenia2018 • Alenka MiškecThe subjects of our research were Roman provincial coins from the Viminacium mint, found in the area of present-day Slovenia. To date 443 Roman provincial coins have been found and most of them are from the Viminacium mint, as their share reaches up to almost 40%. Coins from the provincial mint in Viminacium have been documented at 33 sites, particularly situated along the two major traffic arteries. The first led from Savaria to Poetovio, Celeia, Emona, and further towards Aquileia. The second led from Siscia to Emona via Neviodunum. As part of the research, we examined the distribution of coins from the Viminacium mint in the area of present-day Slovenia, their relationships to contemporary coins from the imperial mints, and made comparisons with distribution at other sites, especially in the Roman provinces of Dacia and Moesia.Download Free PDFView PDFViminacium Coins from Aquileia and Venetia et Histria, in V.

Owing to its location, it played a key role as commercial and military outpost from Italy towards the Danubian limes. On this last aspect, new evidences are now provided by archaeological finds such as coins. This paper analyses the coins of the Viminacium mint recovered over decades of archaeological investigations in Aquileia, now kept in the coin cabinet of the local National Museum. Even if these finds make only a small group compared to those struck in the same period at the mint of Rome, they show little or no resemblances to finds coming from other sites of ancient Italy and beyond. Due to the small amount of bronze denominations from the Roman mint that reached the area along the river Danube, issues struck in Viminacium since 239/240 A.D. played a prominent role in supplying bronze coins to the military sites of this territory. Until now, more than 44 specimens of Viminacium coinage are attested in Aquileia. This is only a provisional survey on this presence, since the local numismatic collection is still largely unrecorded. Nevertheless, this assemblage has no comparison in Western Europe, thus making Aquileia the westernmost site in which Viminacium coins are found in a significant number. Owing to commercial ties between Italy and the Danubian limes through Pannonia and along the Amber Road, issues from the Viminacium mint could have easily been brought to Aquileia. Here, they subsequently circulated beside the most represented ones struck in Rome. At the same time, coins could have travelled with the detachments of military units stationed on the limes, garrisoned in Aquileia during the 3rd century A.D., as indicated with epigraphic evidence.Download Free PDFView PDFIvanišević, Borić-Brešković, Vojvoda (eds.), Circulation of antique Coins in Southeastern Europe, Proceedings of the International Numismatic Symposium held in Viminacium, Serbia September 15th to 17th, 2017, Belgrade 2018, 157-175.New information about an old problem (A contribution to knowledge about the distribution and circulation of coins of the so-called “Sirmium” group), in:2018 • Željko DemoMore than ninety years have passed since the Croatian numismatist Josip Brunšmid, followed by his Austrian colleague Friedrich Stefan, presented several examples of unusual silver coins found in the southern part of what was once Late Roman Pannonia to the professional public. According to them, during the first and second thirds of the 6th century, up to 567 or 568 in Sirmium, the administrative and economic center of the province eastern Pannonia Sirmiensis, this coinage had initially been minted by the Ostrogoths (Stefan), and subsequently by the Gepids (Brunšmid). From 1924 and 1925, when the above opinions were first introduced into numismatic circles, new thoughts and theories on this subject have only rarely and indeed only occasionally appeared, along with mere supplementation or refurbishment of the original ideas. Parallel with this, for decades, the number of published examples of coins minted in Sirmium only gradually increased. During the past twenty years though, it has increased greatly, with several hundred examples known today, primarily documented on the internet. The greatest profit from such a large number of coins was seen by the auction houses, followed by various theory-led numismatic typologies, while even today very little is known about the circulation of the Ostrogothic-Gepidic coinage from Sirmium. Today, they are known as the “Sirmium group”, but very little has actually been written about this. Hence on this occasion it would be useful in the light of several new/old finds to consider in more detail various problems and information about distribution and circulation of the “Sirmium group” coins.Download Free PDFView PDFTwo coin deposits from the Roman fort of TrimammiumVarbin VarbanovDownload Free PDFView PDFCoin Circulation AD 193-4232012 • Miroslav NađDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
