Fatigue and perceived stress are commonly experienced by women during the MT and EPM. We sought to discover relationships between these symptoms and to employ these symptoms as possible markers for resilience. Participants were drawn from the longitudinal Seattle Midlife Women&#39;s Health Study. Eligible women completed questionnaires on 60+ occasions (annual health reports and monthly health diaries) (n = 56 women). The total number of observations across the sample was 4,224. STRAW+10 criteria were used to stage women in either in late reproductive, early or late transition, or EPM stage. Change values were generated for fatigue and stress and analyzed with a multilevel structural equation model; slopes indicate how quickly a person returns to homeostasis after a perturbation.

The present review starts with the description of age-associated changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In this context, the possible modulatory role of estradiol is discussed. Later, the influence of rising stress hormone levels for the ageing brain is illustrated and a few intervention strategies are outlined. At the end, the concept of allostatic load (AL) is described, which aims at a broader assessment of the impact of stress on the individual. The strengths and also the current limitations of the AL concept are highlighted.Download Free PDFView PDFNational Journal of Physiology, Pharmacy and PharmacologyEvaluation of association between psychological stress level during menopausal transition period and serum estrogen level among middle-aged women: A cross-sectional study2017 • Dr. Shailaja M KshemaBackground: Menopause is a gradual transition from reproductive to non-reproductive phase in women during which there is substantial fluctuation in estrogen or estrogen deficiency.
