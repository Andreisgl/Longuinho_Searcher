Reggae idol Bob Marley, rap legend Tupac Shakur, and the John Rambo movie character all portrayed an upside-down world, where those in the right are blamed while the powerful attack them. Their collective example found fertile ground in the West African nation of Sierra Leone, where youth were entrapped, inequality was blatant, and dissent was impossible.      When warfare spotlighting diamonds, marijuana, and extreme terror began in 1991, military leaders exploited the trio’s transcendent power over their young fighters and captives. Once the war expired, youth again turned to Marley for inspiration and Tupac for friendship.     Thoroughly researched and accessibly written, "We the Young Fighters" probes terror-based warfare and how Tupac, Rambo, and – especially – Bob Marley wove their way into the fabric of alienation, resistance, and hope in Sierra Leone. The tale of pop culture heroes radicalizing warfare and sculpting post-war peace underscores the urgent need to engage with alienated youth and reform predatory governments. The book ends with a framework for improving approaches to governance, gender, and youth exclusion.   The publication release date is: October 1, 2023.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The challenge is particularly significant in areas where threatening groups — such as violent extremist organizations — are influential, and where surveillance is a concern. It may be much safer for respondents to mislead researchers or conceal vital information.    The research approach detailed in this book aims to address this challenge. It is a practical guide to conducting high-quality, trust-based, qualitative field research on violent extremism. The approach is adaptable for research in development and conflict-affected contexts, as well as research that features youth.     The methods detailed in this manual account for the high degrees of sensitivity and risk that are prevalent in areas where violent extremism is a concern, and where CVE or PVE efforts have relevance. Collectively, they emphasize the cultivation of trust, inquiry with marginalized youth, a focus on understanding gender and class issues, an appreciation of the impact of surveillance and power on local environments, and analysis of youth dynamics in contrasting locations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Their outlier perspective directly informs the fresh and compelling new thinking about war, development, and youth in "The Outcast Majority." Featuring interviews with development experts and young people, this book contrasts forces that shape and propel youth lives in war and post-war Africa with those that influence and constrain the international development aid enterprise.    With an eye on the colossal populations of excluded and profoundly undervalued youth in conflict-affected Africa and far beyond, the concluding framework delivers practical steps for making development work significantly more relevant and effective.   "The Outcast Majority" has received Honorable Mention for the Senior Book Prize from the American Ethnological Society: http://aesonline.org/awards/senior-book-prize/Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At the center of this development are young refugee men who migrate to urban areas. This volume, the first full-length study of urban refugees in hiding, tells the story of Burundi refugee youth who escaped from remote camps in central Tanzania to work in one of Africa's fastest-growing cities, Dar es Salaam. This steamy, rundown capital would seem uninviting to many, particularly for second generation survivors of genocide whose lives are ridden with fear. But these young men nonetheless join migrants in "Bongoland" (meaning "Brainland") where, as the nickname suggests, only the shrewdest and most cunning can survive. Mixing lyrics from church hymns and street vernacular, descriptions of city living in cartoons and popular novels and original photographs, this book creates an ethnographic portrait of urban refugee life, where survival strategies spring from street smarts and pastors' warnings of urban sin, and mastery of popular youth culture is highly valued. Pentecostalism and a secret rift within the seemingly impenetrable Hutu ethnic group are part of the rich texture of this contemporary African story. Written in accessible prose, this book offers an intimate picture of how Africa is changing and how refugee youth are helping to drive that change.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Reliance on the “youth bulge and instability thesis” leads to distorted assessments of everyday realities. Examination of the lives, priorities, and cultural contexts of African youth, and the cases of youth in Rwanda and Burundi in particular, shows that the nature of relations between the state and massive populations of young, marginalized, and alienated citizens directly impacts the governance, security, and development prospects of African nations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper challenges all of these assumptions. In the process, it reviews dominant trends in Africa’s rapid urban expansion and examines what life is like for urban youth. I will argue that African cities are underserved and fiercely competitive economic environments that are negatively impacted by neoliberal development policies. Urban youth life tends to take place in worlds that are largely separate from the rest of society. The pressures and dangers facing male and female youth can be extreme, yet at the same time African cities are exceptionally stimulating places that provide opportunities for re-invention for many urban youth. The paper ends with recommendations for addressing the needs of the marginalized majority of Africa’s urban youth more effectively. Its primary focus is urban areas in the region of sub-Saharan Africa.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Creating Programs for Africa’s Urban Youth: The Challenge of MarginalizationJournal of International Cooperation in Education (Vol. 10, No. 1, pp. 19-31),  2007Urban youth constitute the vanguard of Africa’s twinned demographic transformations. Sub-Saharan ... more Urban youth constitute the vanguard of Africa’s twinned demographic transformations. Sub-Saharan Africa’s youth population growth rate is the highest of any world region (North Africa’s rate is also high). In addition, Africa’s urban growth rate is the world’s highest. Taken together, the need to provide adequate, effective support for urban youth is critical to fostering Africa’s development – and its political, social and economic stability. This article is designed to help address this need in two ways. First, it focuses attention on those comprising the overwhelming majority of this population, urban youth who are poor and marginalized. Second, drawing largely on the author’s extensive professional experience with African urban youth, the article reviews the major challenges this population faces; considers the programming context for Africa’s urban youth; reviews six principles for developing programs for them; provides field-based insights on improving the assessment, monitoring and evaluation of urban youth programming; and suggest ways to enhance the inclusion of female youth in programs. The article concludes with a consideration of the particular challenge of marginalization in meeting the needs of Africa’s huge urban youth population, and a call to respond to this challenge with youth centered policy reforms and investments.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper connects African refugees to two demographic trends that are reshaping the continent: urbanization and Pentecostalism. Drawing on research on refugees, urban migration and religion in Africa, the author argues that young, male refugee youth are surfacing as prominent contributors to dramatic change across Africa. The case of Burundi refugees in Dar es Salaam is used both to illuminate these issues and to consider the impact of fear, sub‐ethnic rivalry and genocidal violence on refugee youth, the mechanics of hiding, state opposition to urban migration and urban youth culture. The author concludes that understanding and recognizing the dynamic role of refugee and other alienated, mobile urban youth as catalysts for transformation is an essential step in the development of peaceful, civil, and truly inclusive post‐war African societies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Young, Male and Pentecostal: Urban Refugees in Dar es Salaam, TanzaniaJournal of Refugee Studies (Vo. 14, No. 4, pp. 347-370),  2001African youth in cities, often overlooked by national governments, civil society members and inte... more African youth in cities, often overlooked by national governments, civil society members and international actors, comprise one of the keys to lasting peace in post‐war Africa. This paper connects African refugees to two demographic trends that are reshaping the continent: urbanization and Pentecostalism. Drawing on research on refugees, urban migration and religion in Africa, the author argues that young, male refugee youth are surfacing as prominent contributors to dramatic change across Africa. The case of Burundi refugees in Dar es Salaam is used both to illuminate these issues and to consider the impact of fear, sub‐ethnic rivalry and genocidal violence on refugee youth, the mechanics of hiding, state opposition to urban migration and urban youth culture. The author concludes that understanding and recognizing the dynamic role of refugee and other alienated, mobile urban youth as catalysts for transformation is an essential step in the development of peaceful, civil, and truly inclusive post‐war African societies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Marc Sommers argues such a view may be failing to take crucial questions of power - and the lack of it - into account.  In the decade of the 1950s, policy changes carried through by the Belgian colonial governments for Rwanda and Burundi shifted the ground beneath the colonized. Shortly before exiting Central Africa as rulers, they altered their previous policy of favoring ethnic Tutsi to one of favoring ethnic Hutu. The Belgians did this after decades of policymaking and pontificating about the superiority of Tutsi over Hutu. Tutsi were considered smart, able rulers and even, perhaps, distant cousins of the European race. Hutu were deemed nothing more than simple African Bantu stock: strong, yet, in virtually every other way, distinctly inferior to their Tutsi neighbors.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Officials consequently learn about the perspectives of refugees from these men. Based upon findings from two years of field research in Tanzania, the history of relations between ethnic Hutu elites and the peasantry in Burundi is outlined and it is explained why education has assumed such pronounced significance in Burundi refugee society. It is concluded that elites may not, as if often claimed, represent the refugee majority.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Even if the field known as “countering violent extremism” (CVE) did not exist, most young people still would not join a violent extremist organization (VEO). At the same time, the overwhelming majority of people who become violent extremists are youth — most of whom are male. The challenge at the center of CVE is thus an unusual one: identifying the fraction of youth populations mostlikely to enter a VEO and thwarting that option.     This paper investigates that challenge, with analysis featuring interviews with 21 experts and over 400 publications on violent extremism, CVE, and youth. Two correlations inform this work: the direct relationship between nations with “youth bulge” populations and state repression, and the connection between state repression and increased violent extremism, with repressive states usually targeting male youth.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

At the same time, although most youth are peaceful, the overwhelming majority of people who become violent extremists are youth — and most are male youth. The lack of clarity about the fraction of youth populations vulnerable to violent extremism makes the practice of countering or preventing entrance into a VEO an exceptionally challenging endeavor.      The purpose of this executive summary (and full report) is to investigate the youth challenge in the CVE field.

The paper also examines youth with reference to violence, conflict, the state, and struggles to achieve adulthood. The analysis features interviews with 21 experts and a review of over 400 publications on violent extremism, CVE, and youth. The primary contexts considered are the Middle East and Africa, particularly what one expert called “the big four” violent extremist groups: ISIS and al-Qaeda (both of which are based mainly in the Middle East) and Boko Haram and al-Shabaab (which are located in sub- Saharan Africa).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These defining characteristics of contemporary Burundi shaped field research on the state of Burundian adolescents and the role of violence in their lives. The research, undertaken in late 2012, found a profusion of young Burundians threatened by deprivation and domestic and sexual violence. Most receive limited social and state protection and have difficulty remaining in school, finding work or securing adulthood. In the countryside, strong cultural traditions and a weak state facilitate the mistreatment of orphans and girls who become unmarried mothers. In Bujumbura, many adolescents arrive alone and are vulnerable to exploitation. Their condition is underscored by girl prostitutes called Toto Show and the Manjema men who “eat” them. "Adolescents and Violence" contrasts factors and specific populations that might fuel violent conflict with countervailing factors that have the potential to promote peace. The discussion paper ends by highlighting twelve lessons, drawn from the field research in Burundi, that promise to powerfully impact post-war development and reconstruction work in other countries.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The evident social distance and dysfunctions that mark many of the professional relationships between international and national personnel (which largely center on technical advice and decision-making responsibilities) could create significant problems in the medium and longer term if underlying issues are not addressed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

After decades of subjugation, isolation and repression, most especially across twenty-four years of occupation by Indonesia, Timor-Leste became independent after the 1999 referendum. Suddenly, the leaders of Timor’s unsinkable independence movement had to transform themselves from determined resistors into the heads of a brand new nation. This transformation has not been easy. One irony emerging from the current crisis is that while some within the Timorese resistance movement have become prominent and even award-winning leaders, they are currently better known for their rivalries and inability to coexist. However, in all the discussions of leadership capacity, one truly significant Timorese resource was scarcely ever noted: the extraordinarily high degree of resilience of the Timorese people. This paper examines the impact of this characteristic on the development of leadership capacity in Timor-Leste and raises questions about how leadership training programs can most effectively address this issue.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It draws mainly from the case of war and postwar Africa, where the distance between youth and governments, and international development agencies, tends to be pronounced, and where inaccurate stereotypes about young people pervade. The changes that are required necessarily move governments and international development agencies out of their comfort zone. The reason is simple: the extensive exclusion of youth underscores how the status quo doesn’t work. The chapter concludes with a series of proposed remedies that promise to address youth exclusion by enhancing inclusiveness, relevance and receptivity in the development response.

Security experts are particularly concerned with young men, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Negative media images on TV and film help reinforce the impression that young men from these two regions are, in general, dangerous. The negative linkage between youth and violence is in fact fueled more by our own fear of male youth than by evidence. A consequence is that the international community and governmental institutions are not doing as well as they could in working with youth in part because of the negative starting point from which they approach youth issues. Drawing on the case of youth in Liberia, this chapter argues that the starting point for engaging youth is to work with the marginalized, economically disempowered youth majority to determine their realities, needs, and priorities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They invested a high degree of expense, effort and time to enhance the leadership, communication and negotiation skills of their trainees. On balance, emphasizing quality for a small number of trainees, given the prodigious contextual and educational constraints confronting most trainees, proved to be the right choice.    Overall, again given the challenges that LCCNR faced in training Timorese, the program proved very successful in its training work.

After serving as the headmaster of a girls’ school in Kenya and directing a Red Cross-sponsored community health program in New York, Marc earned his Ph.D. in anthropology from Boston University, choosing as his dissertation topic the plight of Burundi refugee youth who were hiding illegally in urban Tanzania. In his career as an academic and practitioner, Sommers’ research continues to focus on African youth. He has taught at The Fletcher School, Tufts University and consulted for a wide array of agencies and institutes, carrying out assessment and evaluation work that largely focused on gender, education, child soldier, conflict negotiation, urbanization and coordination issues, in addition to youth. His many publications include "Fear in Bongoland: Burundi Refugees in Urban Tanzania" (Berghahn Books, 2001), which won the 2003 Margaret Mead Award, and "Stuck: Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood" (University of Georgia Press, 2012). His research at the Woodrow Wilson Center contrasts the priorities of youth in war and post-war Africa with government and international agency responses to youth challenges.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The motivation for writing “Outcast Majority,” which grew over two decades of work as a researcher, evaluator, and advisor, is detailed, as it had become clear to Sommers that approaches for addressing the priorities of colossal populations of young people were unlikely to work. The result is "The Outcast Majority," which aims to advance our understanding of Africa’s youth and propose a new way to think about, and respond to, the challenges and promise which youth embody.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

He explained that the term “youth” is a code word for “young men” and largely ignores women. “Interventions targeting women and girls tend to be grouped under the term gender, as a result of which young women are more or less completely left out of youth initiatives despite the fact that many child-headed households are led by girls,” he noted.   The other problem has to do with what he called “the tendency to ignore class differences among youth.”Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

He says that things look, feel, and are interpreted differently from below, and therefore as a scholar-researcher, one must always implicitly deal with social class. There are two types of people: those with power and those affected by power. This is different than the distinction between the powerful and powerless. It has less to do with what people do with power, and more about how they affect lives of the powerless. Professor Sommers listed several contextual factors that affect research among war-impacted people, including: assumptions about neighborhoods and communities (within the same geographic area, varied power dynamics exist), trauma, sexual violence, desperation, power, location (need to work away from people who may change power dynamics, i.e. the driver), reasons for telling the truth, and what the researcher will do with the information gathered.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Despite evidence of success, these approaches give the impression that you can do good development without knowing much about your target group, their countries’ governance, or their culture.  The setting for my new book, "The Outcast Majority: War, Development, and Youth," is this: development work in Africa takes place in a sea of youth exclusion. For many youth, this world of separation is ever-present; it is virtually impossible for most female and male youth in Africa to attend secondary school, meet culturally specific adulthood requirements, or access a youth program.  This post details a prominent youth program weakness and, drawing from the reform framework in "The Outcast Majority," suggests questions that promise to address critical youth program challenges.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

About half the world’s people are under age twenty-five. A billion and a half of them are youth, and 86% of youth live in the developing world. While this situation has created an unprecedented set of challenges for those addressing development issues, the situation is still more pressing in war-torn nations, since virtually all wars in the world today take place in unusually ‘young’ nations and enormous youth cohorts directly challenge efforts to rebuild governments, societies and peace in those nations.     ‘Youth & Conflict’ will consider some of the dimensions of the youth challenge in conflict-affected contexts, probe the views and experiences of youth who have endured wars, and explore possible responses to these challenges. Among the topics that will be addressed are: how, why and whether war-affected youth can become adults; gendered experiences, priorities and possible solutions to youth needs; sexual violence; and child soldiering and returning ex-combatant youngsters to civilian life. Given the enormous and diverse challenges that vast numbers of war-affected youth present, students of this course will be pushed to consider both youth concerns and the colossal program and policy issues they create.

In his book "The Outcast Majority," youth are not the problem. The real problem is a deeper structural dilemma facing many African societies, especially those affected by recent wars. Quite simply, it has become much harder for young people to find opportunities to raise the money they need to get married and take care of a family. This situation puts the prerequisites of social adulthood beyond the grasp of vast numbers of young people.   The central strength of "The Outcast Majority" lies in Sommers’ attention to the lives of youth who have built up a stock of knowledge under conditions of great pressure and rapid change. He drawsfrom his extensive professional experience of talking to and listening to youth. Sommers hits the mark in identifying the paradigms of order andcontrol that appeal to people who have a lot of reasons to hold marginalized youth in contempt. He is also right to point to the emerging logic and practices of marginalized people, which are not easily quantified but are critical indicators of the revolution in social relationships that grows out of war and dislocation. In global historical terms, the unfolding of such a process in Africa is hardly exceptional, but it takes a book like "The Outcast Majority" to begin to bring this new world into focus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Enormous youth cohorts, containing many who feel socially sidelined, call for a response that, at best, is sporadically seen.The too-common separateness of many ordinary youth raises questions about hallowed development concepts like “community” and “civil society.” Popular macroeconomic remedies for post-war African states tend to run counter to youth ambitions, toward developing rural agriculture and the formal sector while youth increasingly rush into cities and the informal economy.The Outcast Majority invites policymakers, practitioners, academics, students, and others to think about three commanding contemporary issues – war, development, and youth – in new ways. It encourages thoughtful reflection on what should be done for booming populations of youth, and not just those in nations affected by conflict in sub-Saharan Africa.

Among voluntary migrants, and, increasingly, involuntary migrants as well, much of this movement is directed at African cities. Some of these cities are expanding at a rate that, according to Eugene Linden, is unprecedented in recorded world history. It is somewhat surprising that the contributors to The Migration Experience in Africa underplay this extraordinary feature of African migration. The breadth of their coverage of migration issues, on the other hand, is impressive.

One group lived in a remote refugee camp and used their terrifying history and displacement to reinterpret past and current experiences and purify themselves as a collectivity of ethnic Hutus. In contrast, the second group lived in a town near the Burundian border and practiced "strategies of invisibility" (p. 155) to avoid refugee identification and focus on the pragmatics of succeeding as individual exiles. While the town case constitutes an important contribution to our knowledge of urban refugees, it is the involved description of the camp refugees' remarkable "mythico-history" that will undoubtedly attract the most attention. After discovering "standard versions of events routinely produc[ing] themselves" (p 58) during interviews, Malkki created "panels" of narrative text to represent the camp refugees' collective thinking. The mythico-history of Purity and Exile is more than an interesting cultural construction: it is a framework that often means life or death in Central Africa.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

He uses Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to underscore the lasting power of Rwanda's ethnic mythology in one passage, and compares French histo- rial revisionism of Rwandan troubles to neo-Nazi tales in another. This effort to make Rwandans and the genocide that took place there accessible and understand- able informs Prunier' s purpose and approach. The Rwanda Crisis is written with clarity and passion. Prunier's essential intent is basic-in challenging the pervasive idea that "Africa is a place of darkness, where furious savages clobber each other on the head to assuage their dark ancestral bloodlusts," he hopes that "If this book does nothing other than dispel this feeling (which sneaks even into the recesses of many 'liberal' minds), it would already have fulfilled its main purpose" (p. xii).

The U.S Institute of Peace Special Report, "Dowry and Division: Youth and State Building in South Sudan," found that most South Sudanese youth are undereducated and underemployed, and their priorities and perspectives are largely unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, the authors conducted field research between April and May 2011 with youth, adults, and government and nongovernment officials in Juba and two South Sudanese states. The increasing inability of male youth to meet rising dowry (bride price) demands was the main research finding. Unable to meet these demands, many male youth enlist in militias, join cattle raids, or seek wives from different ethnic groups or countries.  Meanwhile, skyrocketing dowry demands have negatively and alarmingly affected female youth. They are routinely viewed as property that can generate family wealth.The field research also revealed that excess demand on government jobs, widespread reports of nepotism in government hiring practices, cultural restrictions against many kinds of work, and a general lack of entrepreneurial vision are fueling an exceptionally challenging youth employment situation. There also are potent new postwar identities involving youth returning from Khartoum, refugee asylum countries, and those who never left South Sudan, are stimulating hostility and conflict. Gang activities, in addition, continue to thrive in some urban centers in South Sudan. They are reportedly dominated by youth with connections to government officials and by orphans. Finally and significantly, while most undereducated youth highlighted dowry and marriage as their primary concerns, members of the elite youth minority emphasized vocational training and scholarships for higher education.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the ensuing years, he has returned to Africa routinely as a scholar and analyst, and his growing body of research suggests that the prevailing wisdom about the continent’s youth is misguided and calls for significant reform. As a visiting researcher with the African Studies Center at the Frederick S. PardeeSchool of Global Studies, Sommers has written about postwar youth in Rwanda and South Sudan, among many other nations.His new book, The Outcast Majority: War, Development, and Youth in Africa (University of Georgia Press), invites policymakers, practitioners, academics, students, and others to revise their thinking about war, development, and youth. The book concludes with a framework for reforming international development practice and policy.With 200 million people age 15 to 24, Africa has the youngest population in the world. The current trend indicates that this figure will double by 2045, according to the 2012 African Economic Outlook report prepared by experts from the African Development Bank, the UN Development Program, and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, among others. A new study by the UN children’s agency UNICEF concludes that at current rates, by 2100 almost half the children under 18 in the world will be African. Already, according to the World Bank, youth account for 60 percent of all African unemployed. And Sommers points out that African joblessness disproportionately affects young women, who, even if they have skills, have more difficulty getting jobs compared with young men.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sommers explains in this interview how, almost two decades after garnering attention for the international failure to intervene in one of modern history's greatest human tragedies, the Great Lakes state is the site of two competing narratives: Rwanda as a model of success, in classical development terms, and Rwandan government policies as controlling and constraining its young people. Sommers launched "Stuck: Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood," on these and other challenges facing Rwandan youth, in February at the Woodrow Wilson Center.
