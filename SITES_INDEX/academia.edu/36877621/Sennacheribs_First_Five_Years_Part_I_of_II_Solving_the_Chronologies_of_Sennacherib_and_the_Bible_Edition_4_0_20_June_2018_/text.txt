However, the inscription of Sargon II, found at Tang-i Var in 1968, requires to date this famous campaign during his 10th campaign (in 712 BCE), implying a coregency with Sennacherib from 714 BCE. A thorough analysis of the annals and the reliefs of Sargon and Sennacherib shows that there was only one campaign in Judah and not two. The Assyrian assault involved the presence of at least six kings (or similar): 1) taking of Ashdod by the Assyrian king Sargon II in his 10th campaign, 2) taking of Lachish by Sennacherib during his 3rd campaign, 3) siege of Jerusalem dated 14th year of Judean King Hezekiah; 4) battle of Eltekeh led by Nubian co-regent Taharqa; 5) under the leadership of King Shabataka during his 1st year of reign; 6) probable disappearance of the Egyptian king Osorkon IV in his 33rd year of reign. This conclusion agrees exactly with the biblical account that states all these events occurred during the 14th year of Judean King Hezekiah dated 712 BCE (2Kings 18:13-17, 19:9; 2Chronicles 32:9; Isaiah 20:1, 36:1, 37:9).Download Free PDFView PDFBabylonia 689–627 B.C.:  A Political HistoryGrant FrameDownload Free PDFView PDFAssyrian and biblical chronologies are they reliable?Gerard GERTOUXMainstream historians, without exception, consider that co-regencies never existed among Assyrian dynasties, because according to an ideological dogma “the king never shares power, even with his Crown Prince”, but at the same time, paradoxically, the biblical chronology of Thiele with its 9 fanciful co- regencies is accepted with blind faith. It should be emphasized that this widespread belief is completely contradicted by an accurate chronological analysis. Thus Sennacherib and Tiglath-pileser III, two famous Assyrian kings quoted in the Bible, played a crucial role in Israel during their co-regencies. Sennacherib's campaign to Judah, with the siege of Lachish and Jerusalem and the Battle of Eltekeh, occurred in 712 BCE during the 10th campaign of Sargon II (722-705) and the 3rd campaign of Sennacherib his coregent (715-705), which agrees exactly with the biblical account states that all these events occurred during the 14th year of Judean King Hezekiah (726-697) also dated 712 BCE (2Ki 18:13-17, 19:9; 2Ch 32:9- 10; Is 20:1, 36:1, 37:9). Similarly the Israelite king Menahem (771-760) had to pay a tribute (in 765 BCE) to an Assyrian king Pul (2Ki 15:19-20). The Assyrian word “pulu” means “the heir (ie Crown Prince)”, which is found in the name of Tiglath-pil-eser (2Ki 15:29). King Pul(as) reigned 36 years according to Josephus (Jewish Antiquities IX: 283-287) that exactly matches the Assyrian king (coregent) known by his Aramaic name Bar-Ga’yah “Son of Majesty” who reigned from 782 to 746 BCE. https://www.amazon.com/Assyrian-biblical-chronologies-they-reliable/dp/1326521217/Download Free PDFView PDFDie Welt des OrientsNeo-Elamite Hara(n) and its (non)relation with biblical Hara and URU.HAR(.KI), Dur-Abi-Hara and Hara’ in Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources2016 • Greta  Van BuylaereDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Ancient Near Eastern HistoryWriting History Under Empire: The Babylonian Chronicle Reconsidered2021 • Caroline WaerzeggersThis article proposes to read the Babylonian Chronicle as historical literature. It argues that the text was composed in response to Babylonia's integration in the Persian Empire. The text presents itself as a self-conscious departure from the chronographic tradition by tracing the roots of Babylon's fate to the mideighth century, when a triangle of power is said to have emerged between Assyria, Babylonia and Elam, a configuration that reduced the Babylonian monarch to inaction and incompetence from the very start.Download Free PDFView PDFIn: S.

See especially W.R. Gallagher, Sennacherib’s Campaign to Judah (SHCANE 18, Leiden: Brill 1999); L.L. Grabbe (ed), ‘Like a Bird in a Cage’: The Invasion of Sennacherib in 701 BCE (JSOTSS 363, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press 2004); P.S. Evans, The Invasion of Sennacherib in the Book of Kings: A Source-critical and Rhetorical Study of 2 Kings 18-19 (SupVT 125, Leiden: Brill 2009); I. Kalimi & S. Richardson (eds), Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem: Story, History and Historiography (Leiden: Brill 2014). In the last mentioned volume, F.M. Fales (“The Road to Judah: 701 B.C.E. in the Context of Sennacherib’s Political-Military Strategy,” 223-248) gives misleading information about my article in VT 1995 (p. 237 n. 47). He claims that I would not be familiar with the fact that Assyriologists have treated critically Assyrian inscriptions. However, in my article as well as in my doctoral dissertation (see e.g. Who Is Immanuel? 263 n. 17) that is referred within my article I mention several experts in Assyriology since Olmstead, who deal with Assyrian royal inscriptions critically. My article begins with reference to biblical scholars only (as quoted by Fales but interpreting it as reference to Assyriologists) and it also ends with reference to them with an exhortation that they should treat Assyrian royal inscriptions critically. My critical readers who consult the studies just referred to realize that I agree with the majority of scholars who regard the year 701 BC as having been a great catastrophe for Judah, but my explanation that pestilence would have finally forced the Assyrian retreat from Jerusalem is of course a controversial proposal because it is difficult to evaluate the historicity behind the angel motif in Isa 37:36 as well as the mice-army destroying the Assyrian weapons in Herodotus’ History 2.141. After having consulted with this new literature on the topic I agree with Cogan that it is important to base historical evaluation of Sennacherib’s expedition on the Rassam Cylinder (see M. Cogan, “Cross-Examining the Assyrian Witnesses to Sennacherib’s Third Campaign: Assessing the Limits of Historical Reconstruction” in: Kalimi & Richardson, Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem 51-74). I still argue that Sennacherib’s tendency to downplay all (military) setbacks – as is evident from the Babylonian Chronicle – should be considered when 2 Kings 18-19 // Isaiah 36-37 are related to his own version about the events of 701 BC. The pestilence hypothesis explains why Sennacherib did not managed to take Jerusalem and why he did not take Hezekiah’s tribute with him as he did with other kings’ tribute. Instead he accounts that Hezekiah later sent his tribute to Nineveh. I interpret this so that the pestilence forced the Assyrian retreat and Hezekiah had in this way possibility to remain on the throne by sending a great tribute to Nineveh and swearing loyalty to the Assyrian king. With the pestilence hypothesis I can also explain why the retreat of the Assyrian army was regarded as “miraculous” and why this event gave impulses for the highly idealized stories about Hezekiah documented not only in 2 Kings 18-19 but also in the whole Book of Isaiah. In his article Fales notes that the Assyrian army’s technique to conquer a besieged city was limited and therefore it was possible for Hezekiah to remain in Jerusalem after Sennacherib having subjugated him by destroying large areas in Judah. But Sennacherib managed to conquer Lachish, which according to the opinion of D. Ussishkin (“Sennaceherib’s Campaign to Judah: The Archaeological Perspective with an Emphasis on Lachish and Jerusalem” Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem 75-104) was heavily fortified as Jerusalem. We know that Sennacherib conquered Lachish and this must have taken place in a relatively short period. Ussishkin concludes his article on archaeological evidence by noting that Sennacherib wanted to conquer Lachish but not Jerusalem. Needless to say we can also interpret the archaeological evidence so that Sennacherib managed to take Lachish but failed in the conquest of Jerusalem. Cf., the openness of Cogan in the aforementioned article when he writes “thus a number of alternatives can be considered concerning Sennacherib’s treatment of Jerusalem and Hezekiah” (p. 69) and then mentioning the alternatives presented by H. Tadmor, A.R. Millard and W.R. Gallagher (p. 70). Here we should add W. von Soden, who discusses the plausibility of the pestilence hypothesis. W. von Soden, “Sanherib vor Jerusalem 701 v.Chr.,” in: H-P. Müller (ed), Bibel und Alter Orient: Altorientalische Beiträge zum Alten Testament von Wolfram von Soden (BZAW 162, Berlin: de Gruyter 1985) 149-157.Download Free PDFView PDFRebellion, Sargon II's "Punishment" and the Death of Aššur-nādin-šumi in the Inscriptions of SennacheribBen DewarDespite the frequency of rebellions against the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib, very few events in his annals are described as such. Instead rebels are often described as having never submitted to Sennacherib before. This reluctance to write about rebellion is unusual in Assyrian inscriptions, but has not been commented upon in the previous scholarship. This study investigates the reasons for this peculiarity of Sennacherib's inscriptions. It is argued that the description of rebels in this fashion was intended to draw attention away from the connection between these events and the death of Sennacherib's father, Sargon II. A second instance of a death in Sennacherib's family affecting the content of his inscriptions is also identified. His son Aššur-nādin-šumi's death followed a pair of campaigns to the borders of Tabal, the location of Sargon's death. Because of this it was viewed as a " punishment " for undertaking these campaigns to regions tainted by association with Sargon. After his death, Aššur-nādin-šumi is never mentioned in the same inscription as these campaigns. Although Sennacherib generally avoids mentioning rebellion, overcoming such events was an important facet of Assyrian royal ideology. Because of this, events in some ideologically or historically significant regions are explicitly stated to be rebellions in the annals. Sennacherib's inscriptions therefore demonstrate, perhaps better than those of any other Assyrian king, the two sides of rebellion's ideological importance as both an obstacle overcome by a heroic king, and as a punishment for a poor one. His attempts to obscure some occurrences of rebellion demonstrate a fear of the more negative ideological aspect of rebellion which is not usually present in the inscriptions of other kings. This provides new insight into the factors which influenced the composition of Sennacherib's inscriptions.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Two Dynasties of Assyria, in S. Gaspa et al.
