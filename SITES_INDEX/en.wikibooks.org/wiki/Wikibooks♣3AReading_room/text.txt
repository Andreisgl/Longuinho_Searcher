Warning script
I have adapted a user warning script from the Russian Wikipedia for Wikibooks. It adds a button to the editing toolbar in the source editor, so it is most convenient for redlinked user talk pages, but it can save a click or two otherwise as well, even though it may not be as quick as Twinkle. Unfortunately, it does not work when syntax highlighting is activated. The script can be found at user:1234qwer1234qwer4/warnings.js. 𝟙𝟤𝟯𝟺𝐪𝑤𝒆𝓇𝟷𝟮𝟥𝟜𝓺𝔴𝕖𝖗𝟰 (𝗍𝗮𝘭𝙠) 12:26, 26 May 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]

BookCat
Hello, I've created a simple script that adds the BookCat template to the end of a page in main namespace if it is not yet in any book category; see User:1234qwer1234qwer4/BookCat.js if you are interested. 𝟙𝟤𝟯𝟺𝐪𝑤𝒆𝓇𝟷𝟮𝟥𝟜𝓺𝔴𝕖𝖗𝟰 (𝗍𝗮𝘭𝙠) 20:07, 11 November 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Since JackBot started doing this task again, this is no longer that useful. 𝟙𝟤𝟯𝟺𝐪𝑤𝒆𝓇𝟷𝟮𝟥𝟜𝓺𝔴𝕖𝖗𝟰 (𝗍𝗮𝘭𝙠) 11:59, 15 March 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Reporting script
I have created a script that can report users at the click of a button, which saves maybe 5 - 10 minutes each time you report somebody. Documentation can be found at User:L10nM4st3r/ReportUser. Feedback and suggestions welcome.  — L10nM4st3r / ROAR at me! 11:18, 26 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
