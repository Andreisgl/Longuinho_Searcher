C. N., & Chui, H. L. (2013a). A cultural approach to small talk: A double-edged sword of socio-cultural reality during socialization into the workplace. Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 8(2), 118-133. ISSN: 1744-7143. (Indexed in ESCI, Clarivate Analytics) People transitioning into a workplace usually face the challenge of socializing into their working communities. While small talk is one domain in the process, small talk itself is influenced by ethnicity of participants and norms of the workplace. We present a case study of how a newcomer transitioning toward integral status interacts with small talk in her new workplace. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the discourse of small talk collected from a new expatriate from Philippines, Anna, and her new colleagues in a Hong Kong firm. The analysis illustrates how their small talk is implicitly associated with Filipino core values, Hong Kong social customs, and the local organizational culture. Owing to discrepancies and similarities, small talk can be both a hurdle and an instrument during Anna's socialization. The findings suggest small talk can be an indicator of in/appropriate behavior and un/successful socialization. It can be used for newcomers' development of rapport; it can be used by integral members to mold newcomers into the workplace. Nonetheless, since small talk is not a universal behavior, any attempts can be counterproductive due to various cultural matters. We argue that small talk can be seen as a double-edged sword of socio-cultural reality in workplace socialization.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLanguage and communication: A sociolinguistic study in newcomers' socialization into the workplaceBernie MakMak, B. C. N. (2009). Language and communication: A sociolinguistic study in newcomers' socialization into the workplace. Master dissertation, School of English, The University of Hong Kong. This study investigates how people socialize into their new workplaces from a sociolinguistic point of view. It is launched to account for how people become fully integrated members in the communities of their new workplaces by learning and applying the predominant language use and communication patterns which characterize their new working environments. Specifically, the thesis explores the linguistic processes and communicative events involved in newcomers' learning of jargon, code-switching, humor, social talk, and expletives. Through these five perspectives, it aims to find out what kinds of linguistic phenomena and communicative behavior can indicate newcomers' membership or identity in the workplace. The current research first discusses the importance of workplace socialization and workplace communication, followed by explaining why workplace socialization often occurs informally through the use or practice of jargon, code-switching, humor, social talk, and expletives in communities of practice. In view of the research target, Hong Kong workplaces, it provides a discussion on how the general culture of Hong Kong workplaces can influence newcomers' workplace socialization itself. Data were gathered via audio-recording of authentic workplace discourse and extensive interviews, which provided contextual information and perceptual understanding of workplace socialization. The study finds that newcomers typically socialize in daily face-to-face communication with their colleagues in the workplace. They are aware of the predominant language use and communication patterns in their new workplaces, and they consider some specific communication behaviour as an indicator of their degree of integration into the workplace. The research also finds that jargon, code-switching, humor, social talk, and expletives occur irregularly in on-the-job talk, which implies that workplace socialization in these aspects is hardly linear or straightforward. The authentic data show that newcomers behave differently at different times and in different areas in their new workplaces. With regards to code-switching, the participant socializes from looking for familiar linguistic choices to participating at any transition relevance place. With regards to humor, the participants socialize through active initiation and responses to humor, but sometimes they initiate inappropriate humor or provide inappropriate responses to colleagues' humor. With regard to social talk, the participants socialize through raising appropriate conversational topics at suitable moments, but sometimes they fail to do so. With regard to expletives, the participant socializes through openly swearing at inside colleagues, but sometimes he inappropriately swears at outsiders. Generalizing from the major findings of the interviews and authentic discoursal data, this study proposes that jargon, code-switching, humor, social talk, and expletives are versatile and multifunctional. On the one hand, they help people to informally socialize into their new workplaces; on the other hand, they emphasize newcomers' partial- or non- membership in their new workplaces. The current research on workplace socialization from a sociolinguistic perspective aims to evidence that language use, everyday communication, and social groups play important roles in workplace socialization, so as to raise scholars' interest in the relevant topics, ideas, or theories.Download Free PDFView PDFMultilingua - Journal of Cross-Cultural and Interlanguage CommunicationManaging talk and non-talk in intercultural interactions: Insights from two Chinese–British business meetings2005 • jianyu xingDownload Free PDFView PDFCross-cultural impression management in the multicultural workplace: The special case of Hong KongMashroor NayeerDownload Free PDFView PDFHumor, small talk, and the construction of identity and power in workplace instant messagingBernie MakMak, B. C. N. (2014). Humor, small talk, and the construction of identity and power in workplace instant messaging. Doctoral dissertation, Department of English, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Workplace discourse analysis and computer-mediated discourse analysis have gathered momentum in the broad field of applied linguistics, but analysts have rarely empirically studied workplace discourse and computer-mediated communication simultaneously from a socio-constructionist perspective. Studies of the former have tended to explore face-to-face workplace interaction in non-Asian settings, while studies of the latter have centered on interpersonal and public communication contexts. However, the reality is that the use of digital devices, especially instant messengers, has become a trend in backstage communication in the workplace, including the small-sized enterprises in Sino-settings. This research hence aims to explore how the professionals in three Hong Kong white-collar organizations interact in Windows Live Messenger, Tencent QQ, and Facebook Chat for various transactional and relational purposes. Drawing upon Etienne Wenger's Communities of Practice framework (1998) and James Gee's model of discourse analysis (2011), the study analyzes the participants’ instant messaging chat logs supplemented with interview data, especially concentrating on how their humor and small talk took place functionally and creatively in such a computer-mediated work environment. Results indicate that these discursive strategies contain many fundamental features of Netspeak (e.g., the use of emoticons, non-standardized punctuation) that differentiate themselves from the counterparts in face-to-face settings, and that these speech events co-occur with the utilization of the general and specific instant messenger interfaces. The computer-mediated humor and small talk instances also activate various new dimensions to the reform of identity and the negotiation of power in the workplace. Further discussions reveal that these phenomena have facilitated sheer discourse processes in workplace communication, including the tendency to relational talk vis-à-vis business talk, the circulation of intertextual and multimodal meanings, the regression of social etiquette, the emergence of heteroglossic identity, and the amplification of individual intellectuality, linguistic competency, abilities of information access, and skills of information technology. It is concluded that humor and small talk in workplace instant messaging are socio-computational products of national cultural preferences, community norms, colleagues' personal experience and preference of usage, and that they are informal, interpersonal, multidimensional tools for achieving organizational goals in the long run. It is also argued that the gendered and colloquial, individual and professional characteristics of humor and small talk in workplace instant messaging normally coalesce a fluctuating state of turbulence of workplace identity, and that the discursive strategies often visualize and symbolize the intellectual capital and personal aptitudes for controlling technology of a colleague. This dissertation not only provides insight into workplace discourse analysis and computer-mediated discourse analysis, but also projects novel knowledge, viewpoints, and implications to white-collar practitioners in Hong Kong, if not other career fields and societies.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of PragmaticsIntercultural Conversation2006 • Helen Spencer-OateyDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Intercultural StudiesManaging Rapport in Intercultural Business Interactions: A comparison of two Chinese-British welcome meetings2003 • Helen Spencer-OateyDownload Free PDFView PDFTạp chí Khoa học và Công nghệ - Đại học Thái NguyênA Case Study of Intercultural Communication: Small Talk at Different Stages of Relationship Between a Vietnamese and an American2019 • 21.

However, this phenomenon is under-researched in the ESL classroom context. Attending to this concern, the present study examines various topics, distributions, and functions of small talk in the linguistically and culturally heterogeneous classrooms in an intensive English as a second language program in the United States. The findings show that small talk in the ESL classroom goes beyond its ritualistic function; it serves as an important tool for language learning and a useful resource for developing students' intercultural communicative competence. Based on the findings, we recommend that ESL teachers integrate small talk into their instructional practices in order to achieve various social, intercultural, and pedagogical goals.Download Free PDFView PDF“Where are you from?”:  Interculturality and interactional practicesZhu Hua‘Where are you from?’ I often find it difficult to answer the above question in small talk. Born in the era of Mao’s Cultural Revolution and grown up in one of the coldest cities close to the Russian border in China, I received most of my education in Beijing. About 15 years ago at the time of preparing for the abstract, I arrived at Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, a city known for its mining history, football team and local ‘Gordie’ accent, to carry out a PhD project on language development of Chinese-speaking children. It turned out to be one of the most significant chapters in my life. I stayed on in the UK after the PhD and established myself in academia. I am now a professor of Applied Linguistics and Communication, and recently appointed as Head of Department, in the oldest university department of applied linguistics in London. In this chapter, using the methodology of auto-ethnography, I shall reflect on how I manage and negotiate many different aspects of identity in workplace interactions with reference to my work on Interculturality. As an emerging research paradigm, Interculturality (e.g. Zhu Hua, 2014, Dervin & Risager, 2014) represents a line of investigation that departs from traditions of seeing cultural memberships or cultural differences, largely, if not always, as something ‘given’, ‘static’, or as something one either has or does not have. Instead it argues that cultural memberships (Chinese, Turkish, British, etc) are not always relevant to intercultural interactions and people can do a number of things with cultural memberships through indexical or symbolic interactional resources. These main arguments are particularly useful in my reflection of how I make use of some interactional practices to manage a plurality of my cultural, linguistic, professional and social identities (a transnational de facto, originally coming from China and having lived in the UK for 15 years, working in a British higher education, having travelled and lectured in many different parts of the world, mother of two boys born and grown up in the UK). I shall focus on three kinds of interactional practices. The first one is names of reference. I shall talk about how I have chosen to remain to be known as ZHU Hua, my Chinese name in Romanisation, for my academic life; how my marriage and having children led to new social identities of mine (I am known as Mrs Hua LI in my bank and in the children’s school) and how these name references constantly serve as a reminder of differences in traditions, conventions, and expectations from a female academic between the West and East. The second is address terms. I shall talk about how I, coming from a Chinese culture, have learned to address senior colleagues by their first name without feeling ‘out of order’ and developed and engaged in ways of interactions appropriate to cultures and contexts. The last is nationality and ethnicity talk (e.g. when are you going home?). I shall talk about how I have learned to negotiate identity ascribed or constructed by others through nationality and ethnicity talk, i.e. discourse evokes or orients to one’s ethnicity or nationality either explicitly or implicitly. In my conclusion, I shall discuss the impact of living and working in another culture on my interactional practices and my understanding of the relationship between language, culture and identity and vice versa.Download Free PDFView PDFLanguage and Intercultural Communication‘The cultural stuff around how to talk to people’: immigrants' intercultural communication during a pre-employment work-placement2014 • Prue HolmesDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
