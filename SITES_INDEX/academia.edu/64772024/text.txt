We describe the molecular and biological characteristics of the T. cruzi VD strain isolated from a congenital Chagas disease patient. The VD strain was typified as DTU TcVI; in vitro sensitivity to nifurtimox (NFX) and beznidazole (BZ) were 2.88 μM and 6.19 μM respectively, while inhibitory concentrations for intracellular amastigotes were 0.24 μM for BZ, and 0.66 μM for NFX. Biological behavior of VD strain was studied in a mouse model of acute infection, resulting in high levels of parasitemia and mortality with a rapid clearence of bloodstream trypomastigotes when treated with BZ or NFX, preventing mortality and reducing parasitic load and intensity of inflammatory infiltrate in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Treatment-induced parasitological cure, evaluated after immunossupressi...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersExperimental ParasitologyTrypanosoma cruzi: Biological characterization of a isolate from an endemic area and its susceptibility to conventional drugs2010 • alina  perroneDownload Free PDFView PDFBulletin of Experimental Biology and MedicineIntegral Approach to Evaluation of the Pathogenic Activity of Trypanosoma Cruzi Clones as Exemplified by the Mexican Strain2013 • Bertha Espinoza, Francisco Espinoza-gomezDownload Free PDFView PDFRevista Da Sociedade Brasileira De Medicina TropicalDiversity of Trypanosoma cruzi stocks and clones derived from Chagas disease patients: I-Behavioral characterization in vitro1997 • Fernanda TavaresDownload Free PDFView PDFPloS onePhenotypic diversity and drug susceptibility of Trypanosoma cruzi TcV clinical isolates2018 • Adriana  ParodiTrypanosoma cruzi is a genetically heterogeneous group of organisms that cause Chagas disease. It has been long suspected that the clinical outcome of the disease and response to therapeutic agents are, at least in part, related to the genetic characteristics of the parasite. Herein, we sought to validate the significance of the genotype of T. cruzi isolates recovered from patients with different clinical forms of Chagas disease living in Argentina on their biological behaviour and susceptibility to drugs. Genotype identification of the newly established isolates confirmed the reported predominance of TcV, with a minor frequency of TcI. Epimastigote sensitivity assays demonstrated marked dissimilar responses to benznidazole, nifurtimox, pentamidine and dihydroartemisinin in vitro. Two TcV isolates exhibiting divergent response to benznidazole in epimastigote assays were further tested for the expression of anti-oxidant proteins. Benznidazole-resistant BOL-FC10A epimastigotes had dec...Download Free PDFView PDFCoinfection with Different Trypanosoma cruzi Strains Interferes with the Host Immune Response to Infection2013 • Claudiney RodriguesA century after the discovery of Trypanosoma cruzi in a child living in Lassance, Minas Gerais, Brazil in 1909, many uncertainties remain with respect to factors determining the pathogenesis of Chagas disease (CD). Herein, we simultaneously investigate the contribution of both host and parasite factors during acute phase of infection in BALB/c mice infected with the JG and/or CL Brener T. cruzi strains. JG single infected mice presented reduced parasitemia and heart parasitism, no mortality, levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-a, CCL2, IL-6 and IFN-c) similar to those found among naïve animals and no clinical manifestations of disease. On the other hand, CL Brener single infected mice presented higher parasitemia and heart parasitism, as well as an increased systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators and higher mortality probably due to a toxic shock-like systemic inflammatory response. Interestingly, coinfection with JG and CL Brener strains resulted in intermediate paras...Download Free PDFView PDFBioMed Research InternationalImmunopathological Aspects of Experimental Trypanosoma cruzi Reinfections2014 • Marcos Vinicius SilvaDownload Free PDFView PDFTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and HygieneTrypanosoma cruzi stocks isolated from acute Chagas disease patients lead to lethal murine infection1997 • Anis RassiDownload Free PDFView PDFFrontiers in Veterinary ScienceResponse to Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi in a Murine Model2020 • Enrique A .
