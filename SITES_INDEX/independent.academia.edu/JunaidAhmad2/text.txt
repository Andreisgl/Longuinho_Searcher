The direct impacts of disasters, including earthquakes, have been monitored and documented; however, only limited information is available on the impact of natural disasters on healthcare institutions and communities. Even less information is available on the different ways in which aftereffects of these events are reflected in global and public health indicators. This study aims to assess and analyze earthquake-related public health impacts on communities and their health service-providing institutions. To this end, we conducted a case study of ten districts hit by the October 2015 Hindu Kush earthquake in Pakistan. We grouped these districts into two groups of five each: Group I include the districts most seriously affected by the earthquake in terms of death toll, number of injured and structural collapses; Group II includes the less-affected districts, which experienced lower mortality and injury rates and less structural damage than those in Group I. We retrieved six years of monthly data from the District Health Information System of the selected districts and analysed it to examine trends of ten indicators in pre-and post-earthquake contexts. Findings from both groups revealed that districts in Group I showed significant variation in trends relating to rates of communicable disease, e.g. tuberculosis and hepatitis C; of vector-borne diseases, e.g. malaria; and of psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. On the other hand, trends in indicators relating to health care services including antenatal care, immunization coverage, and postnatal care remained stable. It can be concluded that earthquakes does impact the health status and utilization of health service services within affected communities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the last two decades, a substantial increase in the number of displaced people has been recorded. We measured the social vulnerabilities of displaced populations using a mathematical approach in combination with application of geographical information systems (GIS) tools and techniques to visualise movement and draw attention to the location of significant concentration of vulnerabilities. A retrospective study approach based on datasets collected from governmental and non-governmental organisations working with refugees and internally displaced persons in Pakistan was used. We applied simple mathematical formulas to calculate and map various types of vulnerability, such as refugee population, absorption capacity, unmet needs and overall vulnerability. This approach displays risks and vulnerabilities of displaced populations in an easily understood and straightforward manner that can be replicated in other parts of the world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Using selected global health indicators to assess public health status of population displaced by natural and man-made disastersby Junaid Ahmad and Mokbul AhmadJournal Article,  Mar 13, 2017The United Nations proclaimed the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reductio... more The United Nations proclaimed the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR).Since then the scientific community has undertaken significant research linked to disaster management,primarily focusing on geophysical hazards, risks, vulnerabilities, and early warning systems. However, limitedresearch is available regarding the health status of a population on the move due to natural and manmadedisasters, and how disasters influence key public health indicators. Key health indicators include, but are notlimited to, immunization coverage, malaria incidence rate, measles incidence rate, malnutrition, and birthsattended by trained healthcare professionals. The objective of this research is to assess the health status of adisaster-induced displaced population with respect to specific public health indicators. A retrospective analysisof purposely-selected thirty camps of a displaced population in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan isperformed by means of an outpatient registry database. The study's findings reveal that the levels of risks andvulnerabilities of camps vary regarding different kinds of indicators. Therefore, there is high probability that ifthe same programs and interventions are undertaken for all camps, the desired goals may not be possible toachieve.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Gender-sensitive public health risks and vulnerabilities' assessment with reference to floods in Pakistanby Junaid Ahmad and Arshad  AliDisasters are not discriminatory but affect every one of us irrespective of our age, gender, reli... more Disasters are not discriminatory but affect every one of us irrespective of our age, gender, religion or any other determinant. However, women tend to feel the greater brunt of disaster consequences. It is a need of the day to examine why women are more vulnerable and at a great risk during disasters. In this regard, we conducted this study to assess public health risks and vulnerabilities in the context of floods through gender perspective. The study is a cross-sectional study conducted from September 2013 to January 2014. Two stage sampling techniques were adopted; first, two union councils (administrative units) in the district of Nowshehra were purposively selected as these were the most affected union councils in the floods of 2010 in Pakistan, and in the second stage, 386 households were selected randomly. The data analysis reveals that although more than 51% of the sample population was female, but females make up only 5% of household heads. Antenatal care (45%) and postnatal care (39%) coverage is very low and skilled birth attendants assisted only 26% deliveries. The higher the education status of the mother, the higher was the rate of health facility utilization. We concluded that women's health risks and vulner-abilities can be decrease largely with education in general, specifically with promotion of health education .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
