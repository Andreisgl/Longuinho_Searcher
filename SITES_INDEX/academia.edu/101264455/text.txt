The strength of these interactions can drive population changes in prey species . Therefore, understanding behavioural responses and tradeoffs to different contexts is imperative to generating a mechanistic understanding of consumer-resource interactions. Variation in exhibited levels of these behaviours can successfully predict strength of interactions, diet breadth and prey choice . Often, consumptive trophic interactions are parameterised into encounter rate, attack rate and handling time . These parameters are affected by behavioural traits , which may be grouped together as 'functional foraging traits' . However, for the purpose of measuring individual traits, they can be reduced into more defined parameters, such as activity rate , foraging mode , velocity of movement and duration of movement . All of these mediate...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
