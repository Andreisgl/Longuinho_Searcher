2008 seens to be a sad year for pt.wikisource:
~ 1,200 text-units + dozens of templates and categories going to be deleted due to copyrights misinformations on a Bible translation (see s:pt:Discussão:Ferreira de Almeida Atualizada for a discussion started on 2006). Possible date to deletion: still this week.
~ 600 text-units + some categories and templates due to m:American non-acceptance of the rule of the shorter term (see s:pt:Wikisource:Esplanada/Problemas de domínio público, o retorno for details). Possible date to deletion: unknown but still this semester. 555 01:47, 15 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
