The aim of this study was to test the mediating effect of negative and positive WHI in the relationship between job characteristics (job demands and job resources) and work-related well-being (burnout and work engagement) in a sample of 528 employees in the construction industry in South Africa. Structural equation modelling showed that, as expected, job demands and job resources were partially related to burnout, both directly and indirectly through negative WHI. Similarly, job resources were partially related to work engagement, both directly and indirectly, through positive WHI. It can be concluded that these results extend previous research by showing that the...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersApplying the job demands–resources model to the work–home interface: A study among medical residents and their partners2011 • Arnold BakkerWork–home interference (WHI) is a prevalent problem because most employees have substantial family responsibilities on top of their work demands.

Moreover, we aim to test the role of the negative influence of work upon private life in burnout development. Cross-sectional data was collected during April 2012 from a sample of 327 physicians and nurses in one county emergency hospital from Transylvania. Participants filled out 1) the MBI-GS, 2) the Questionnaire on the Experience and Evaluation of Work, and 3) the corresponding negative work-home interference scale from the Survey Work-Home Interaction Nijmegen. All scales had good psychometric properties. Structural equation modeling with Bootstrapping analysis was used to test the hypothesised relations. Multigroup analyses were computed to test model&#39;s invariance. Results indicate that the model obtained an overall good fit: χ² (11) = 47.21, CFI = .95, NFI = .93, GFI...Download Free PDFView PDFBurnout ResearchMaslach Burnout Inventory – General Survey: Factorial validity and invariance among Romanian healthcare professionals2014 • Florina  SpanuDownload Free PDFView PDFBriaAny CarolinyDownload Free PDFView PDFPsychiatry, Psychology and LawWork Pressure and Sickness Absenteeism Among Judges2014 • stefan bogaertsDownload Free PDFView PDFThe antecedents and outcomes of work-family enrichment amongst female workersAlewyn  NelDownload Free PDFView PDF3 Building engagement in the workplace2009 • Arnold BakkerMany of today's organizations compete and try to survive on the basis of cutting prices and costs through redesigning business processes and downsizing the number of employees. Since there is a limit to cutting prices and downsizing,“New thinking and new approaches have become necessary for organizations to survive and to create sustainable growth and development”(Luthans, Norman, Avolio & Avey, in press; see also, Bakker & Schaufeli, 2008). This chapter proposes such a new approach: building engagement.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of Work and Organizational PsychologyNot all job demands are equal: Differentiating job hindrances and job challenges in the Job Demands–Resources model2010 • Nele CuyperThis study aimed to integrate the differentiation between two types of job demands, as made in previous studies, in the Job–Demands Resources (JD-R) model.
