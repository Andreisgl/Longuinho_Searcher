The union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST and an official notice announcing the death was posted outside.On the Queen's death, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall.Image source, ReutersImage caption, The official notice read: "The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow."The Queen was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926.Few could have foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne.Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada.After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. "I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity," she recalled later.Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. She would later describe him as "my strength and stay" through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99.Image source,  Tim Graham/PAImage caption, The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen's side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen."It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can," she later recalled.Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the Swinging '60s sweeping away social norms at home.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace after the death was announcedImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Charles, as the Prince of Wales, delivered the Queen's speech on behalf of his mother for the first time in MayElizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once.But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen's "annus horribilis", fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children's marriages broke down.After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly.There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society. "No institution… should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't," she acknowledged.Image source, PAImage caption, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of YorkAs a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service. Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: "Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it."That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June.The milestone was celebrated with a mix of state ceremonies and a colourful festival of all things British, as well as lively street parties.Although the Queen's health kept her from some events, she said: "My heart has been with you all."In a moment met with cheers from huge crowds in the Mall, she was joined by three generations of her family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of a pageant.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, On her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen delighted crowds by appearing on the balcony with three generations of her familyKing Charles, aged 73, becomes head of state in 15 Commonwealth realms, including the UK.He and his wife, Camilla, are at Balmoral alongside his siblings, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward.They are accompanied by Edward's wife, Sophie, as well as Princes William and Harry.William's wife, Catherine, remained at Windsor with their children - George, Charlotte and Louis - as it has been their first full day at a new school.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Prince William drove a group of senior royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to BalmoralImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Prince Harry arrived at Balmoral later to join other senior royalsThe Royal Family has now entered a period of mourning.
