Their collections, aptly called “various verses,” greatly range in length and style—including epigrams, polemics, encomia, and more—and their poems were written for a broad range of social occasions such as court ceremonies, horse races, contests between schools, and funerals. Some were inscribed on icons and buildings. Many honored patrons and friends, debunked rivals, or offered satirical portraits of moral types in contemporary society. In some remarkable introspective poems, Mauropous carefully shaped a narrative of his life and career, while Christopher’s body of work is peppered with riddles and jocular wordplay. This volume is the first English translation of these Byzantine Greek collections.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is the first volume to consider this poetic activity as a whole, critically reconsidering modern assumptions about Byzantine poetry, and focusing on Byzantine conceptions of the role of poetry in society. By providing a detailed account of the various media through which poetry was presented to its readers, and by tracing the initial circulation of poems, this volume takes an interest in the Byzantine reader and his/her reading habits and strategies, allowing aspects of performance and visual representation, rarely addressed, to come to the fore. It also examines the social interests that motivated the composition of poetry, establishing a connection with the extraordinary social mobility of the time. Self-representative strategies are analyzed against the background of an unstable elite struggling to find moral justification, which allows the study to raise the question of patronage, examine the discourse used by poets to secure material rewards, and explain the social dynamics of dedicatory epigrams. Finally, gift exchange is explored as a medium that underlines the value of poetry and confirms the exclusive nature of intellectual friendship.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It presents a lively view on contemporary society, is often permeated with wit and elegance, and is concerned with a wide variety of subjects. Only now are we beginning to perceive the possibilities that this poetry offers for our knowledge of Byzantine culture in general, for the intellectual history of Byzantium, and for the evolution of poetry itself. It is, moreover, sometimes in the most neglected texts that the most fascinating discoveries can be made.This book, the first collaborative book-length study on the topic, takes an important step to fill this gap. It brings together specialists of the period who delve into this poetry with different but complementary objectives in mind, covering the links between art and text, linguistic evolutions, social functionality, contemporary reading attitudes, and the like. The authors aim to give the production of 11th-century verse a place in the Byzantine genre system and in the historic evolution of Byzantine poetry and metrics. As a result, this book will, to use the expression of two important poets of the period, "offer a small taste" of what can be gained from the serious study of this period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They are narrowly connected to the production and use of the specific manuscript in which they appear. Book epigrams can be considered as inscriptions on books, sharing many features with inscriptions on other material objects (buildings, works of art, etc.). Book epigrams are paratexts, accompanying the main text of the manuscript. They praise the author of the text, express the motives of the patron, record the work of the scribe, admonish the readers, and structure the content of the book. Book epigrams mostly appear in the margins of the manuscript, or at its beginning or end. They stand visually apart through colour and script. Book epigrams are important sources of information about the patronage of books, reading culture, the reception of literature, and metrical developments, etc. A new online database is hoping to pave the way for new, and more comprehensive, research on this genre.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They infuse their poetry with a high degree of authorial self-awareness, wit, and variety. Contemporary education played a great role in the production of poetry. Michael Psellos specialized in didactic poetry (mainly written in politikoi stichoi) and poetry for court occasions. The collections of both John Mauropous and Christopher Mitylenaios reflect many genres and occasions: epigrams for various dedications; invective poems addressed to rivals; funeral poems for family and friends, etc. Mauropous arranged a well-thought-out collection that supports the self-image he wanted to convey to his readers. Mitylenaios’ poetry has a keen eye for the buildings and events in the city of Constantinople. Both Mauropous and Mitylenaios also wrote a considerable amount of hymnographic poetry.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It played an important role as a model in later Byzantine times. With his letters, Psellos built and maintained an extensive social network with individuals from all levels in society. Particularly in the numerous letters to officials in the province, he dealt with a range of practical matters, including career management, monasteries, and taxes. He couched his letters in a discourse of philia, an ideal of friendship that implied commitment to intellectual ideals. Psellos represented himself as a “philosopher” in his letters, but with many modifications and caveats. The linguistic register varied according to the addressee. Thanks to a new edition and a collective volume (including a list of summaries), the future of the study of Psellos’ letters looks promising.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Epistolary Communication: Rituals and CodesA Companion to Byzantine Epistolography, ed. A.

It focuses on the role of the bearer, not only as a channel for the message, but also as a mediator and go-between. Gifts added a material dimension to letter-exchange, and they were subject to subtle codes that often caused a sender to downplay their value and importance. The reception of letters was a ritualized event, consisting of a fixed sequence of gestures, and involving all the senses. Letters were regularly read by others, a phenomenon that one could call “public intimacy”; the reading of letters often stood at the core of a complex semi-public performance, involving extensive mediation, rhetorical dramatization, and ceremony. The essay also examines the impact of social decorum and hierarchy on letters, notably on the forms of address, formulas of deference, the vocabulary with which the letter-writer introduced requests, etc., for which the term “epistolary codes” can be used.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Both prose and poetry belonged to the category of logoi, the only label that was very frequently used, in contrast to the term “poetry,” which was reserved for the ancient poetry studied at schools. Many authors considered (and exploited) the difference between their own prose texts and poems as a primarily formal one. Nevertheless, poetry did have some functions that set it apart from prose, even if these features are for us less expected. The quality of “bound speech” gained a spiritual dimension, since verse was seen as a restrained form of discourse, also from a moral point of view. Finally, the chapter gives a brief overview of the social contexts for which (learned) poetry was the medium of choice: as an inscription, as paratext in a wide sense, as a piece of personal introspection, as invective, as summaries (often of a didactic nature), and as highly public ceremonial pieces.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Ethics of Authorship: Some Tensions in the 11th CenturyThe acts of taking up the pen and circulating a text under one’s own name were fraught with ethic... more The acts of taking up the pen and circulating a text under one’s own name were fraught with ethical tensions in Byzantium. Assuming authorship of texts contravened the Christian ideals of humility and self-effacement, and could incur the accusations of ambition and self-importance, all the more so if language and style were skilful and sophisticated. Nevertheless, it is exactly skilful writing that displayed the intellectual abilities of the author and could bring social advancement and material profits. This tension between social ambitions and ethical implications is particularly outspoken in the eleventh century, when a new elite of self-conscious intellectuals sought to gather social capital on the basis of their intellectual precedence. At the same time, other cultural and ideological groups made their voice heard.This paper attempts to lay bare the various sets of representations (‘discourses’) that take issue with the ethical implications of authorship in the eleventh century. This can be done through an analysis of the ambiguous terms with which ‘skilful language’ (to use a neutral term) is denominated. The well-known habit to reject erudition and learnedness in prologues is also taken into consideration. On the one hand, the different discourses can be situated along the ideological and cultural fault lines that run through our period. But these tensions are also to be found in one and the same person. I discuss here the examples of Michael Psellos and John Mauropous: these polyvalent intellectuals developed different strategies to cope with the ethical issues that ambitious authorship provoked.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

He remains in touch with his former teachers (mainly Mauropous), and his former classmates, appealing to their shared bond, supported by common manners and memories of jokes. As a teacher, he maintained contact with the relatives and protectors of his pupils, reassuring them that they were in good hands. His teaching is presented as a social asset, helping young candidates in their beginning careers. Many recommendation letters sent to officials in the province introduce his former pupils. Conversely, Psellos used his relationships with former pupils when they had become important officials, in order to circumvent official hierarchies. To this end, he represented their teacher-student relationship as a sacrosanct and eternal union. This is greatly helped by a vocabulary of kinship; especially the uncle-nephew relationship provided a convenient template.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Exploiting the polysemy of alogon and logos  in Greek, Psellos is able to frame this playful representation of a gift exchange in a philosophical opposition between materiality and reason. This allows him to present his intellectual competences as an exclusive kind of cultural capital that deserves material support from other members of society.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In many texts of authors of the intellectual elite, the concept (together with the related concept of politikos) is used to define a certain type of man who is able to combine his education (paideia) with a certain set of behavioural conventions (ethos) that he had assimilated in an unaffected way. Humour, correct pronunciation, physical appearance, and a sensitivity to social decorum were all aspects of this. Asteiotes found a counterpart in the concept of agroikia, a distinction that was based on a spatial opposition between city and countryside. It is important to note that the concept often had ambiguous ethical overtones, which had to be carefully negotiated.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
