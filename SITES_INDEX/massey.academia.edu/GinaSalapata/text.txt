Through the comprehensive study of a distinctive class of terracotta votive offerings from a specific sanctuary, Gina Salapata explores both coroplastic art and regional religion. By integrating archaeological, historical, literary, and epigraphic sources, she provides important insights into the heroic cults of Lakonia and contributes to an understanding of the political and social functions of local ritual practice. This volume received financial support from the Archaeological Institute of America. See more at: http://www.press.umich.edu/3235848/heroic_offeringsSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Does Size Matter in the Serial Production of Terracotta Offerings?“Craft Economy” and Terracotta Figurines: Approaching Systems of Production through Coroplastic Studies (Archaeology and Economy in the Ancient World, Panel 3.14, Propylaeum 16), ed. by S. Huysecom-Haxhi and A. Pautasso. Heidelberg: Propylaeum, pp. 55-67.,  2022Moulds made possible the mass production of numerous inexpensive dedications in the Greek world. ... more Moulds made possible the mass production of numerous inexpensive dedications in the Greek world. The use of derivative moulds in the serial production of terracottas inevitably results in products that are both smaller and less clearly defined than their prototypes since details are often indistinct or obliterated. What factors may have influenced dedicants to choose smaller versions of terracottas? Was it simply a matter of lower cost or could there also have been other considerations such as portability, suitability for mass dedications and groupings, or even availability of display space? Furthermore, the symbolic value of dedications, for example, as tokens of participation in a cult activity, would not be affected by size. And did size matter to the recipient divinity? I argue that small size did not decrease the perceived efficacy or religious significance of an offering. In fact, reduced size would have intensified the significance of the most important features, those that communicate the messages inherent in the form of the dedication. This paper addresses aspects of the economic and social dimension of coroplastic serial production, primarily focusing on a large group of mould-made plaques (6 th-4 th century BC) from the hero sanctuary of Agamemnon and Kassandra in Lakonia. These plaques vary widely in quality and size, ranging from sizeable, detailed images to a large number of small and simplified versions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Be­cause it is well attested in both literary and visual sources, we can follow its evolution and transformations through the centuries from a narrative to a more symbolic represen­tation of the myth. Heracles had to fetch the golden apples from the divine garden of the Hesperides, situated beyond the limits of the known world and assimilated in popular belief with Elysion and the Isles of the Blessed. There are two main versions of how Hera­cles managed to obtain the apples, equally well attested in literature and art, and appar­ently running parallel to each other: he either picked them himself after slaying the guarding serpent; or he was helped by the sky-bearing Titan Atlas, who fetched them for him while Heracles relieved him from the burden of heavens. In other variants, known through the iconographic tradition, Heracles either deceives or is helped by the Hes­perides. Even though no sources specify that the golden apples conferred immortality or youth, their divine associations and location in the paradise-like garden of the gods relate to Heracles’ attainment of immortality and the pleasures of a blessed afterlife.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Itfocuses on dedicatory practices and, in particular, on modest offeringsand the multiple ways these were valued in Greek society. It concludesthat, even though small inexpensive offerings were affordable by poorerpeople, their dedicators likely came from various socio-economic backgrounds. Dedications of low economic value and modest appearance may have had high symbolic value because they embodied social and religious ideas or the desires and identities of the dedicator; or they could derive their value from the function they performed in ritual. If the messages carried by such offerings were of primary concern and their value symbolic and emotional rather than material, the choice of a small or inexpensive offering would not necessarily reflect lower socio-economic status. Moreover, if the main concern of gift giving were communication and reciprocity, the act of giving would have been more important than the offering’s monetary value.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They have the potential not only to illuminate the type of cult and the nature and character of the recipients, but also to help us ascertain popular tastes and cult practices of the average worshipper.The main intention of this paper is to raise the issue of small offerings acquired and dedicated in groups or sets, and presumably also displayed together. In some cases, sanctuary deposits exhibiting similarities in the profile of type of offerings may indicate that objects were dedicated in groups of two or more items during a single visit to the sanctuary. Sets of offerings would have expressed complementary notions about the cult and the recipient, and could have increased the efficacy of the gift-giving ritual. In other cases, generic offerings that were appropriate for several cults could have been dedicated and displayed together in a sanctuary in order to produce more specific images.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The plaques found at several deposits in ancient Messene depend thematically and technically on the Laconian plaques, especially those from the sanctuary of Agamemnon and Kassandra at Amyklai; several were clearly made in the same Laconian or derivative moulds using local clay. The generalised and standardised iconography of the plaques made them versatile offerings that could be offered to a variety of heroes. On the other hand, some unusual subjects seem to be closely related to particular sanctuaries at Messene and Amyklai and would have been created with the specific cult in mind. The original dependence on Laconian prototypes did not preclude local Messenian originality because some types found only at Messene are probably new Messenian creations. Local variations on traditional themes were also introduced in the fourth century BC. These developments may be related to the increased importance of heroes after the liberation of Messenia and an attempt at differentiation from Laconian prototypes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They served a type of cult, the heroic, as shown by both their widespread distribution in this region and their complete absence from divine sanctuaries. Their generalised and standardised iconography made them versatile offerings that could be used in various contexts, with the seated figure acquiring the identity of the locally honoured hero in a specific sanctuary setting. Distribution patterns also show variety. In Laconia, plaque findspots show this type of offering was favoured much more in the region inhabited by the homoioi. By contrast, the Messenian plaques, offered both at Bronze Age tombs and at urban sanctuaries, must have been dedicated primarily by perioikoi. The similarities between Laconian and Messenian types of plaques need not be correlated with the contested ethnic identity of the Messenians. Rather, they should be attributed to the flexibility and variety in their use. The Messenian cults that attracted plaque dedications honoured heroes not necessarily because they were Achaean, but because they were celebrated local mythical or historical figures. Creating a link with the past through heroes was a well-established way to articulate a strong local and communal, but not necessarily ethnic, identity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The conflicting reports about the location of his grave correspond to early variations in the literary tradition about the location of the murder of the king and his consort Kassandra. The Lakonian version of the legend and the cult associated with it may have been promoted by the Spartans when they aspired to become the sovereigns of the Peloponnese. Despite the heroic origins of Agamemnon, a persistent scholarly opinion assumes that the Spartans worshipped him as a manifestation of Zeus, a belief based on the reference of later literary sources to a cult of Zeus-Agamemnon. In this paper I aim to conclusively disprove the divine worship of Agamemnon in Lakonia and argue instead that he received heroic worship from the establishment of the sanctuary at Amyklai along with his consort Kassandra, known locally as Alexandra. The fusion of Zeus with Agamemnon was relatively late and probably the invention of the poet Lykophron."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Female Triads on Laconian Terracotta PlaquesArchaic and Classical terracotta relief plaques discovered in votive deposits in Lakonia and repr... more Archaic and Classical terracotta relief plaques discovered in votive deposits in Lakonia and representing three standing females raise two questions: firstly, whether their appearance in groups of three means that they are a defined triad or is just an indication of unlimited plurality; and secondly, whether they are divine or mortal.It is concluded that no single interpretation can be ascribed to all cases. Most triads seem to represent mortal worshippers rather than a specific divine or semi-divine triad. However, an exceptional triad flanked by snakes may represent the Erinyes. Such an interpretation would harmonize with the nature of the cult at the sanctuary in which they were dedicated—that of Alexandra (Kassandra) and Agamemnon, both murdered in Lakonia, according to a local tradition. An offering with the representation of the avenging spirits would have been very appropriate for Agamemnon and especially Kassandra, who suffered a wrongful death that was never properly avenged.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Embedding religion in epigrammatic poetry: The Adonia in Poseidippos 53 ABAmong the epigrams contained in the Milan papyrus (P. Mil. Volg.

VIII. 309), attributed to the third-century BC poet Poseidippos of Pella, is epitaph no. 53 (Austin-Bastianini), which commemorates the death of the maiden Kalliope, lamented by her female companions. The epigram poignantly expresses sadness for a life cut short, but the circumstances of Kalliope’s death—falling from a rooftop during an all-night festival—are very unusual.This fascinating and carefully crafted epigram has received little attention by literary scholars and has been overlooked by Greek religion specialists studying festivals. In this paper, we argue that most likely this epigram is fictitious and contains a variety of key words, images and clever allusions to archaic poetry that point to the fictional death having occurred at the celebration of the Adonia. During this rowdy nocturnal festival, held annually in various parts of the Greek world, groups of women mourned the death of Adonis, the young lover of Aphrodite.

Male Boiotian Bust-Protomes: From Technique to Religious MeaningThe Athens Greek Religion Seminar, 14 March 2023,  2023Archaic and Classical terracotta bust-protomes of female figures were frequently dedicated in san... more Archaic and Classical terracotta bust-protomes of female figures were frequently dedicated in sanctuaries or placed in tombs throughout the Greek world. Male protomes are rarer and come mainly from Boiotia. Dated from the late 5th through to the 4th c BC, they generally lack specific archaeological context but were very likely found in graves, most plundered during the late 19th century. The vast majority represent a bearded man, usually identified as Dionysos, based on attributes, such as an elaborate headdress, kantharos (or mug), and egg. Most of these protomes were adaptations of common female types by adding facial hair and modifying the attire—an expedient production method for coroplastic workshops.A youthful clean-shaven type is represented by only two surviving protomes: one holding the standard egg and kantharos and the other holding an egg and a rooster. Formal similarities indicate that both were produced from a combination of female and male types, a procedure driven not only by technical necessity but possibly also by religious and ideological reasons: to convey the androgynous quality of either a young Dionysos or, more likely, that of a young initiate of Dionysos, whose identity was intentionally blurred with that of the god during the time of transition from adolescence to adulthood. Depositing a youthful protome (perhaps along with a bearded Dionysos type) in the grave of a prematurely deceased could have helped place him under the protection of the god of transitions who would guide him from life to death and hopefully to a blessed afterlife.The seminar takes place Tuesday March 14, 2023, 17.00 (Athens time)with live presence at the Swedish Institute or via zoom link.To participate, please register at:https://www.sia.gr/en/events.php?eid=317#ParticipationFormSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Abstract Salapata & Kanellou, The Athens Greek Religion Seminar June 5 2018: "Embedding religion in epigrammatic poetry: The Adonia in Poseidippos 53 AB"by Jenny Wallensten and Gina SalapataAmong the epigrams contained in the Milan papyrus (P. Mil. Volg. VIII. 309), attributed to the th... more Among the epigrams contained in the Milan papyrus (P. Mil. Volg. VIII. 309), attributed to the third-century BC poet Poseidippos of Pella, is epitaph no. 53 (Austin-Bastianini), which commemorates the death of the maiden Kalliope, lamented by her female companions. The epigram poignantly expresses sadness for a life cut short, but the circumstances of Kalliope's death—falling from a rooftop during an all-night festival—are very unusual. This fascinating and carefully crafted epigram has received little attention by literary scholars and has been overlooked by Greek religion specialists studying festivals. In this paper, we argue that most likely this epigram is fictitious and contains a variety of key words, images and clever allusions to archaic poetry that point to the fictional death having occurred at the celebration of the Adonia. During this rowdy nocturnal festival, held annually in various parts of the Greek world, groups of women mourned the death of Adonis, the young lover of Aphrodite. The poet may have taken inspiration from celebrations of the Adonia in Alexandria, in which he resided, or even perhaps in Macedonia, and specifically in his hometown of Pella.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Physical and virtual hands-on learning through reproductions of Classical antiquitiesAnthropology of Forgery, Winter School (forthcoming),  2019Unlike other New Zealand universities, Massey University does not have a collection of antiquitie... more Unlike other New Zealand universities, Massey University does not have a collection of antiquities for use in the teaching of Classical Studies. To redress this lack, and being unwilling, as a matter of principle, to buy antiquities in the art market, we decided to create a collection of reproductions of ancient artefacts: in 1998 we acquired several plaster casts of Greek sculptures moulded from originals in Greek museums; and in 2011, through a generous donation from an alumnus of our Programme, we purchased a number of high quality reproductions of Greek vases made using ancient methods of manufacture by the “THETIS Authentics” workshop in Greece. This process differentiates these reproductions from the run-of-the-mill tourist products. The goal of the collection was to improve the learning outcomes of Classical Studies students through the use of direct experience, which is a highly effective method of helping people learn. Students can get a feel of ancient art in three-dimensional form—quite unlike the possibly misleading impressions gained from photos. The great advantage of reproductions over actual ancient artefacts is that our students can use them and experiment with them in a very practical and hands-on way, without the restrictions placed on handling precious antiquities.New technologies assisted in extending the educational value of this hands-on resource to the students who study at a distance and who do not have the opportunity to handle and use the reproductions. Staff at the Massey National Centre for Teaching and Learning designed an interactive online resource allowing the vases to be viewed online, and via iPad, in high-resolution 3D. Thus the tactile experiences provided to students in class, can be partly replicated in the virtual world; for example, students are able to explore the vases in 3D by swiping the surface of the ipad.The physical and virtual reproductions support and facilitate meaningful student learning. They allow learning by doing, stimulate curiosity, provide accessibility and inclusiveness, and overall create a more deeply engaging educational experience.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
