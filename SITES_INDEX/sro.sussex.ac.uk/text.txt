Copy, rip, burn: the politics of copyleft and open sourceBrowseSearchFile(s) under permanent embargoCopy, rip, burn: the politics of copyleft and open source CiteShare book  posted on 2023-06-08, 15:39 authored by David BerryDavid BerryOpen source technology, like OpenOffice, has revolutionised the world of copyright. From downloading music and movies to accessing free software, digital media is forcing us to rethink the very idea of intellectual property. While big companies complain about lost profits, the individual has never enjoyed such freedom and autonomy in the market. Berry explores this debate in a clear and concise way, offering an ideal introduction for anyone not versed in the legalistic terminology that - up until now - has dominated coverage of this issue. Looking at the impact that the open source movement has had on journalism, printing, music and design, they show how the ideas that inspired the movement have begun to influence wider cultural and political transformations. This is a key text for students of media studies, journalism and anyone interested in new opportunities for creating a truly independent and democratic media.HistoryPublication statusPublishedFile VersionPublished versionPublisherPluto PressPublisher URLhttp://www.plutobooks.com/display.asp?K=9780745324142&st1=copy+rip+burn&sf1=kword_index,publisher&sort=sort_pluto&m=1&dc=2Pages270.0Place of publicationLondonISBN9780745324159Department affiliated withMedia and Film PublicationsFull text availableNoPeer reviewed?YesLegacy Posted Date2013-09-11First Compliant Deposit (FCD) Date2016-03-22Usage metrics            CategoriesNo categories selectedKeywordsUncategorised valueLicenceCopyright not evaluatedExportsSelect an optionRefWorksBibTeXRef. managerEndnoteDataCiteNLMDCHide footerAboutFeaturesToolsBlogKnowledgeContactHelpPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTermsAccessibility StatementDisclaimerSitemapfigshare. credit for  all  your research.
