In addition to the introductory essay, the catalogue provides a brief overview of the history of the Games and discusses over 130 objects, including ancient Greek coins, vases and sporting equipment, as well as modern medals, coins, and Olympic ephemera.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersStephan Wassong, Karl Lennartz and Thomas Zawadzki (2008) Olympic art contests 1912-1948, their invention and demise (Chapter 25: pp.241-251).

Liverpool Hope University Press, UK.Clive Palmer (National Teaching Fellow)This paper is divided into two sections: the first section discusses how the Olympic Art Competitions were created by Baron Pierre de Coubertin at the beginnings of the Modern Olympic Movement. The second section discusses the reasons for the International Olympic Committee to set an end to the Art Contests. Furthermore it displays which ideas the successors of the Art Contests namely the Cultural Olympiads are based on.Download Free PDFView PDFThe 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics, Japan, The Asian Olympics and The Olympic Movement, by Sandra Collinssandra  collinsDownload Free PDFView PDFOur distinguished Son: The New Zealand Olympic Committee and the re-appropriation of Jack Lovelock  Geoff  KoheIn what follows I examine how New Zealand's Olympic Committee (NZOC) capitalised on the expertise and popularity of Jack Lovelock - one of the country’s top scholars and emerging middle-distance running star of the 1930s – to help develop the organisation and prepare it for future adversities. NZOC effectively used Lovelock as a positive symbol of the achievements of the nation’s sporting culture. Lovelock was, aside from being an athlete extraordinaire, a competent scholar who benefited from an elite English tertiary education and the vigorous competition afforded him by the Northern hemisphere sporting circuit (which though amateur by name was certainly professional by nature). Through his experiences, education, socialisation, and travels Lovelock amassed a wealth of knowledge which, among other feats, culminated in his 1500 metres triumph at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. However, prior to and beyond this 'famous' moment, Lovelock appeared keen to offer NZOC advice which, he believed, might help them to improve the organization and preparation of Olympic teams for competition abroad. Conversely, by re-appropriating Lovelock for their own purposes, I contend, NZOC fortified their own public persona (by basking in reflected glory), and, showed their professional responsibility by demonstrating an attentiveness to athlete concerns; both of which became enduring issues for the organisation.Download Free PDFView PDFSandra Collins, The 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics, Japan, The Asian Olympics and the Olympic Movement (New York and London: Routledge Press, 2007)sandra  collinsDownload Free PDFView PDF9th Joint atti IOA 2008 arte etruscaAngela  TejaDownload Free PDFView PDFPolitics and Sport don't mix – or do they? National Identity and New Zealand's Participation in the Olympic GamesMicheal D WarrenSports matter. Today sport is one of the most enduring social events that humans from across the world participate in, no matter their race, religion or gender. Moreover, the biggest of all those sporting events is the Olympic Games, which is held every four years. The modern version of the Games was founded by Frenchman Baron Pierre de Coubertin and first took place in Athens in 1896. New Zealand first competed alongside Australia as Australasia in London 1908 and Stockholm 1912. Following the games of 1916 which were cancelled due to World War I, New Zealand has competed as a sovereign nation since Antwerp 1920. Since 1908, over 1200 New Zealanders have competed at the Olympic Games, winning more than 100 medals. That performance in itself makes New Zealand one of the most successful nations in Olympic history on a per capita basis. That statistic alone underscores the relationship between the Olympics and national identity, as an embodiment of New Zealanders believing they ‘punch above their weight’ on the world stage. Benedict Anderson wrote about the imagined community, where the nation is imagined because it is impossible for every citizen to know each other. This research has found that sporting teams like the All Blacks and the New Zealand Olympic Team are perfect avenues to help create this imagined community. New Zealand’s national identity is not fixed, it has evolved, but the one mainstay of that identity is the sense of being an underdog on the world stage. The research has found that over the past three decades New Zealand governments have increasingly woken up to the importance of high-performance sport and following the disappointment of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, funding was increased, which has led to better results and more medals. Today New Zealand athletes are funded on a per-capita basis just as well as many other nations we would compare ourselves with. New Zealand politicians have been quick to associate themselves alongside sportsmen and women and often speak about the close link that exists between sport and identity in New Zealand. However, unlike Australia, New Zealand does not have a national sports museum, and also unlike Australia, and the United Kingdom, New Zealand legislation does not allow for free-to-air television coverage of games of national significance. New Zealand does not adequately showcase its sporting history, and this has the potential to negatively affect the importance New Zealanders place on sport and the Olympic Movement as an important part of its national identity. Ultimately this research has found that the New Zealand Olympic Team epitomises what it means to be a New Zealander and has found that across multiple levels of analysis, the Olympic Movement has significantly contributed to the development of New Zealand’s national identity. More broadly, the Olympic Games have become a key avenue in which that national identity can be projected to the world.Download Free PDFView PDFFROM ATHENS TO BEIJINGOLYMPISM: ART AND CULTURE A HISTORICAL REVIEW THROUGH TIMEVasiliki FailadiDownload Free PDFView PDFNational identity narratives in the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games 2010Doiara SantosDownload Free PDFView PDFIssues of the Pan American Games: The Case of Rio 2007Leonardo  MatarunaDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Cultural PolicyOne hundred years of cultural programming within the Olympic Games (1912–2012): Origins, evolution and projections2008 • Beatriz GarciaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
