As is shown in this paper, its rise to fame was not only a product of the particular political-economic context in which it was borne, but was also a product of the impact evaluations produced by the World Bank, which served as the evidence base through which this and other international institutions could legitimately promote the neoliberal model of community involvement represented by EDUCO. Problematically, however, a reappraisal of these impact evaluations reveals, first, that their findings and conclusions around significant effects were not warranted and, second, that the entire impact evaluation enterprise is fundamentally flawed due to the financial-political-intellectual complex out of which these studies emerged and back into which they fed as they were used to advocate for market-oriented policy solutions around the world. Thus, in addition to explaining the reform dynamics that gave rise to EDUCO, this paper (a) systematically reviews the findings and limitations of each of the six impact studies that constitute the international knowledge base around this policy, (b) reconsiders what we can reasonably claim to know about EDUCO, (c) reflects on the national and international implications of the critical review presented here, and (d) remarks on the shortcomings of—and the alternatives to—impact evaluations as ameans to produce policy-relevant findings.Save to LibraryDownloadby D.

In recent years, changing market scenario, globalization, ethical consumerism all are adding heat to the CSR concept. Making profit and is the primary goal of all organizations; thus the companies target to increase their sales every year. In this CSR driven business scenario, it becomes vital to analyse the effect of CSR investments on the sales of the company. This paper gives an theoretical overview of the legal framework of CSR in India, discusses the trends of CSR in India that how CSR once considered as charity by a company has now transformed as a responsibility of the company towards society. This paper also analyzes whether there is any significant relationship between CSR investment and sales and finally, the possible impact of CSR investments on the sales of few companies selected at random for 3 years 2012 to 2015.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Maria Tresita Paul V. and +1Dr. N.

This year's theme is " The Role of the Academic Community in Scaling the B Corp Movement. " This event is open to university faculty and students and other researchers conducting research on Certiied B Corporations and/or Beneet Corporations (hereafter " B Corps "). We are especially interested in research that examines impact assessment methodologies and the impact of B Corps. Additionally, our preference is for empirical studies, whether qualitative or quantitative. In addition to presenting groundbreaking research on B Corps, the Roundtable will provide opportunities for researchers to discuss data sources and methods for studying B Corps, provide updates on their research in progress, and allow the academic community to develop a roadmap of current and future research opportunities.Save to LibraryDownloadby maria emilia correa•  3  Impact Evaluation, Social Impact Assessment, B CorpsEvaluating The Impact Of Egyptian Social Fund For Development ProgramsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jonathan Haughton•  7  Impact Evaluation, Rural Poverty, Propensity Score Matching, Health monitoringLas Evaluaciones Estandarizadas Desde Una Visión FreireanaSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan Francisco Remolina Caviedes•  34  Critical Theory, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, Evaluation ResearchThe Socio-Economic Impacts of Framework Programmes in Transition Countries: A Systemic Approach of Assessment MethodsSave to LibraryDownloadby Lajos Nyiri•  9  Policy Analysis/Policy Studies, Evaluation Research, Industrial Relations, Impact EvaluationImpact Evaluation of the Environmental User Fee System: A Stakeholder PerspectiveSave to LibraryDownloadby Asa Sajise and +1Paul Ramirez•Impact EvaluationIs Irrigation Rehabilitation Good for Poor Farmers?

According our approach, the improvement might be achieved by adopting a results-based and a project portfolio approach, and assuring a research and technology development (RTD) indicators documentation through a standard and comprehensive indicator description, named indicator template. The results-based approach will assure a consistent indicators structure, according to the results chains and a strong connection between ex ante and ex post impact evaluation. The project portfolio approach will assure a tight integration of the research performance indicators, especially between policies goals and program results.

The scope of such evaluation is now being extended to include the ‘relevance’ or ‘impact’ of academic research outside the academy.  We address how evaluation of non-academic research impact can promote more such impact without undermining academic freedom and research excellence.  Five questions on evaluation design are considered: (1) What should be the object of measurement? (2) What should be the timeframe? (3) How should non-academic users of research inform evaluation processes? (4) How should controversial impacts be managed? (5) When in funding cycles should impact evaluation occur? We conclude that non-academic impact should be selectively promoted and evaluated.  This is how greater gains from research might be best captured without imposing misguided and onerous reporting requirements on individuals and institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michael Mintrom and +1Andrew  Gunn•  3  Knowledge sharing, Impact Evaluation, Policy DesignDesenvolvimento de uma metodologia para avaliação de impactos qualitativos dos fogos nas águas subterrâneas: aplicação aos casos de estudo do Vale de Manteigas e de MaçãoNo Projecto POCI/AGR/59180/2004, concluído em 2009 (cf.

Donors – whether making large or small contributions – increasingly say that they want transparency as to where their money goes and want to know that their contributions make a difference (AFP et al. (2016); Muttart (2013)). United Ways and many private foundations are transforming themselves into " impact funders " , interested in making systemic change by addressing root causes of social issues, making grants more strategically to organizations that can deliver results on their change agendas, and assessing their performance (Fulton et al. (2010)). The new tools of social impact investing, by which contributors expect both a financial and social return, and the growing popularity of social impact bonds depend on measurement of " impacts. " Consequently, a surfeit of new metrics is being generated, a cottage industry for developing and comparing them has arisen, and there are multiple efforts to establish greater commonality and coherence among these measures (SEIMTF, 2017). Rather than being passive subjects of such external pressures, charities, nonprofits and social enterprises recognize that in order to serve their beneficiaries as effectively as possible and remain financially viable in a highly competitive environment, they need to know which programs are effective and how to improve them.Save to LibraryDownloadby Susan Phillips•  2  Impact Evaluation, EvaluationNon-experimental methodologies for quantitative analysisSave to LibraryDownloadby Robert Poppe and +1Markus Olapade•  2  Impact Evaluation, Applied EconomectricsDriving Agricultural Transformation with the Power of Information and Communication Technology: The Performance of Nigeria's Growth Enhancement Support SchemeNigeria liberalized input distribution and established the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) in 2011 to deliver subsidized inputs to farmers as part of its Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA).

Despite the relevance of the GESS as a subsidy delivery mechanism, its achievements during the first year of implementation (2012) were below expectations. In 2015, as the first phase of the GESS is ending, has there been any significant improvement in its implementation? What improvements have occurred in redemption and participation rates? Even though the GESS is known to be making contributions in terms of ensuring direct access by farmers to subsidized inputs, the main determinants of farmers’ participation remain unknown.

We investigated whether pesticide control regulations had an impact on suicide rates. A graphical approach and regression analysis was used to identify time trends in suicide from 1980-2016 and determine the impact pesticide control regulations had on suicide rates while considering other economic variables. A gradual decrease was seen in suicide rates from 1996 to 2016. Mean numbers of suicides have decreased steadily between the time-intervals significant bans on pesticides were imposed. The regression model showed that with the enactment of each regulation, suicide rates were likely to reduce by 9 times when considered with population and economic changes. Restrictions on the use of harmful pesticides in Sri Lanka where pesticide poisoning is a common method of committing suicide has been useful in curtailing suicide rates.Save to LibraryDownloadby Madhushka  Kannangara•  13  Criminal Law, Comparative Law, Social Policy, Impact EvaluationImpact Evaluation Report 114 Evaluating the impact of infrastructure development Case study of the Konkan Railway in IndiaOperational since 1998, the Konkan Railway is one of the biggest railway construction endeavour in independent India, traversing over 760 km along the Konkan region of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka – a hitherto backward region,... moreOperational since 1998, the Konkan Railway is one of the biggest railway construction endeavour in independent India, traversing over 760 km along the Konkan region of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka – a hitherto backward region, characterized by out-migration for employment. The region is also known to be ecologically sensitive, which is why the railway was frequently contested for its potential impacts on the local ecosystem. We employ a theory-based evaluation approach to provide empirical evidence and explore causal mechanisms of the socio-economic and environmental impacts of the Konkan Railway. We find that the Konkan Railway had a positive effect on population sizes, female to male sex ratio and a negative effect on male main workers leading to the plausible conclusion that the railway access has reinforced the pre-existing pattern of high levels of male migration. We also find an increase in crude workforce participation rate driven by an increase in marginal workers and other workers. However, the results are insignificant for cultivators and agricultural labour. These results led us to conclude that the railway has encouraged diversification into non-agricultural economic activities and also of workplaces through easier access to employment opportunities via daily rural-urban commutes and seasonal migration. We only find insignificant changes in forest cover and water bodies in close proximity to the railway stations. The analysis, hence, could not substantiate the concerns raised during the time of the construction of the Railway regarding environmental degradation, at least not on a large scale. The findings encourage policymakers to take into consideration the risk and uncertainty which characterize the attainment or non-attainmet of desired benefits and expected outcomes. and the impact of transport infrastructure on migration, geographic labour mobility and labour market outcomes in sending and receiving regions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sreeja Jaiswal•  6  Sustainable Development, Rail Transport and Infrastructure, Impact Evaluation, Environmental SustainabilityDeterminants of Cross-Country Income Inequality: An ‘Augmented’ Kuznets HypothesisSave to LibraryDownloadby Branko Milanovic•  5  Impact Evaluation, Economic policy, Inequality, Social ChoiceEvidence for the Effectiveness of Rehabilitation-In-the-Community Programmes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bassey Ebenso•  21  Program Evaluation, Poverty, Community-Based Mental Health Services, Monitoring And EvaluationLas Evaluaciones Estandarizadas Desde Una Visión Freireana a Avaliação Padronizada Desde O Foco Freireano the Standard Evaluation from the Freirean PerspectiveSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan Francisco Remolina Caviedes•  20  Critical Theory, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, Evaluation ResearchChiara Colagiacomo, Elena Ragazzi, Lisa Sella, Stefano Signorini, (2019), “Evaluation of policies on Occupational Safety and Health: methodological approaches and critical issues”.

In 2008, a system of economic incentives has been introduced (d.lgs. 81/2008, art. 11), which assigns to various public entities the provision of grants addressed to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMEs) that realize investment projects in the field of health and safety at work. The most important intervention, in terms of both the number of beneficiaries and the provided amounts, has been realized by Inail. Since 2010, Inail has financed OSH projects for about 2 billion euros, which go under the name of "ISI calls".Up to now, the evaluation analyses performed by Inail on the ISI calls mainly concerned implementation processes and performance monitoring, reporting, and accounting. Recently, the need for an ex-post evaluation of the effects emerged, in order to improve the policy effectiveness. Therefore, Inail intends to plan a research aimed at identifying the appropriate models to assess the impact of the incentives and to highlight their strengths and criticalities as an economic support to SMEs.This paper overviewes the main theoretical and methodological aspects in the counterfactual evaluation of OSH policies. This overview is fundamental because the topic is not sufficiently addressed by both national and international literature, while studies on this topic are not so widespread. In particular, we reflect on: the possible evaluation questions that emerge when studying the impacts of OSH policies and their implications; the most appropriate evaluation designs that could answer the evaluation questions; and the consequent methodological issues (e.g., internal and external validity, feasibility of an evaluation based on administrative data, etc.).Save to LibraryDownloadby Elena  Ragazzi•  2  Occupational Health & Safety, Impact EvaluationEnd-of-term Evaluationof UNICEF’s Solomon Islands Solar Power Pilot ProjectThis report presents the findings of an end-of-term evaluation of UNICEF’s Solar Power Pilot Project: Improving education outcomes by using solar-powered lighting and fans in primary schools in Solomon Islands (SPP project).

The pilot project was implementedfrom September 2012 to March 2015 with funding from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand National Committee for UNICEF and UNICEF Pacific. According to the project document, the aim was to “improve education outcomes by installing solar-powered lighting and fans in ten primary schools in Guadalcanal and Choiseul provinces”. The evaluation was mandated by UNICEF andconducted by a private consultant who visited Solomon Islands for 20 days in December2014. UNICEF directed the evaluator to focus on the five schools in Guadalcanal provincebecause the solar systems there had been in operation for two years by the time of theevaluation.The evaluation aimed to establish the extent to which the project achieved the outcomesand outputs outlined on page 3 of the project design document and was organized around eight areas: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, equity, quality of project design, quality of implementation and cross-cutting issues (gender responsiveness and environmental sustainability). The evaluation report will be used by UNICEF Pacific to understand what worked and what did not work and to document lessons learned that could be applied to similar projects. Other audiences include project partners and other agencies seeking to improve education in developing countries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patrick Fong•  8  Pacific Island Studies, Monitoring And Evaluation, Impact Evaluation, Solomon IslandsHelping former foster youth graduate from college through campus support programsSave to LibraryDownloadby Amy Dworsky•  6  Social Work, Foster Care, Impact Evaluation, Washington StateRede CUCA : impactos sociais e econômicosImpact and cost-benefit evaluations of the Centers for Urban Culture, Arts and Sports in Fortaleza using mixed methods research techniques.Save to LibraryDownloadby Plan  Avaliação and +3Fernando gonçalves marquesFabrizio RigoutCristiana Martin•  4  Program Evaluation, Monitoring And Evaluation, Impact Evaluation, EvaluationCurrent practice in the evaluation of cross-sector partnerships for sustainable developmentWithout a more systematice and comprehensive approach to evaluating cross-sector partnerships, further investment in the development and implementation of partnership approaches is likely to be curtailed in coming years. This is because... moreWithout a more systematice and comprehensive approach to evaluating cross-sector partnerships, further investment in the development and implementation of partnership approaches is likely to be curtailed in coming years. This is because the effectiveness and desirability of the cross-sector partnership approach is likely to be judged not just in relation to the impact of well-designed and well-run partnerships, but on the results of a myriad of initiatives and activities labelled as partnerships. Many of these underperform and do not achieve what is expected of them because they are badly conceived or poorly implemented. This is why more emphasis needs now to be placed on evaluation of the performance, effectiveness and impact of cross-sector partnerships.  With this motivation in mind, The Partnering Initiative (TPI) canvassed the views of partnership practitioners on current practice through a combination of desk research, literature review, questionnaire surveys and face-to-face interviews sought to answer the following quesitons: (1) DEFINITIONS: is there a consensu on the terminology related to evaluating cross-sector partnerships? FINDING - there is no consensus both within and across civil society, business and public sectors as to definitions as to what constitutes "evaluation" and what does not. A variety of terms are used including evaluation, tracking, assessing, monitoring, reviewing with no consistency of terminology; (2) ASPECTS OF EVALUATION: Which aspects of of partnering are considered to be the most important in evaluations of cross-sector partnerships? FINDING - The focus on 'producing tangible results' or assessing impacts dominates current practice in evaluating cross-sector partnership performance. More intangible or unexpected outcomes resulting from cross-sector partnering are not well addressed and are often ignored altogether. Partnership performance is seldom monitored and evaluated in relation to the potential advantages or benefits, which can be achieved. (3) PLANNING EVALUATION: In what ways do partnership practitioners plan to evaluate their partnerships and what is the focus of such evaluations? FINDING - Few cross-sector partnerships are subjected to formal evaluation. Of these only a minority are evaluated in a systematic or comprehensive way in terms of their overall performance and impact. Alternatives to partnership approaches are seldom considered in evaluations. Most partnerships are evaluated from the perspective of one of the partners in relation to financial investement and related reputation risks/benefits. (4) TOOLS: What tools are used for evaluating cross-sector partnerships? FINDING - Evaluations ofr cross-sector partnerships most commonly rely on judgement of specialist consultants, who make use of a wide range of specialised tools, frameworks, techniques and approaches. There is no single most favoured or accepted tool, framework or approach. Evaluators opt for the evaluation tools, which are most appropriate or relevant to meeting the needs, circumstances, purposes and organizational cultures of specific sectors. Frameworks and tools are typically selected by the agency, partner funding or commissioning the evaluation; (5) IMPROVING EVALUATION: What are the most important barriers to improving evaluations of cross-sector partnerships? FINDING - The most frequently cited barrirer to undertaking evaluations of cross sector partnerships relates to securing adequate resources. The availability of resources is closely related to the way evaluations are organised and carried out. In other words, who decides on their scope, who funds them, who carries them out and who uses and  interprets the results are crucial questions that must be dealt with by the partners working together in a cross-sector partnership. A key aspiration for partnership practitioners relates to finding ways of designing evaluations of cross-sector partnerships as a whole in ways, which draw on or include all partners, as well as those who have been affected by the activities of the partnership. The aspiration isn this regard is to ensure evaluation results contribute to improving partnership performance and impact.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rafał Serafin and +1Darian Stibbe•  10  Monitoring And Evaluation, Collaboration, Measurement and Evaluation, Impact EvaluationImproving evaluation of anti-crime programs: Summary of a National Research Council report★Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark Lipsey•  9  Criminology, Program Evaluation, Criminal Justice, Impact EvaluationIMPACT OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF SELECTED BANKS IN INDIA: BASED ON CAMEL MODELThe concept of CSR has been witnessing a sharply rising trend since last decade.

From a subject of interest mainly for the academicians, it has now emerged as a strategic corporate practice adopted both by the banking and non-banking institutions. CSR is purely based on the philanthropy on voluntary basis on the part of the organization, aiming to contribute towards the well-being of all its stakeholders, including the environment, to attain sustainable development. India is the first country in the world to render it mandatory for the companies fulfilling specific criteria, to spend a minimal percentage of 2% of their average net profits of last three preceding financial year. Indian commercial banks play a crucial role in contributing towards the growth of Indian economy as a whole. These banks, public and private, both have been incurring expenditure on CSR. Most of the researches are showing that the companies who operate in a socially responsible manner are experiencing better financial results in terms of increased profitability. The present paper is an attempt to examine the impact of CSR on the financial performance of the commercial banks of India, based on CAMEL Model, using Return on Assets (ROA) and Net Interest Margin (NIM) as performance indicators. The sample of 16 banks where considered for seven years period from 2015-2021 and STATA 15 was employed for panel data evaluation. The results show that there exists a positive correlation between the independent variables (CSR, Capital adequacy ratio, Liquid Assets to Total Assets, Total Loan to Total Assets and Total Deposit to Total Assets) and dependent variables (ROA and NIM).Save to LibraryDownloadby SHAKEB AKHTAR•  5  Performance Studies, Impact Evaluation, Panel Data, Corporate Social ResponsilityThe application of geographical information systems (GIS) in sustainable tourism planning: A reviewSave to LibraryDownloadby Nor Arina Aris•  46  Information Systems, Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Civil EngineeringLAND USE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON PRODUCTION_ARTICULO-2-9.pdfIn recent years, the municipality of Tapalpa, Jalisco, has suffered a gradual deterioration of natural resources (water, forest, soil).

There has been a growth of population and an increase in tourism activities that do not consider natural resources, types of landscape or their socio-economic implications. One of the most relevant changes in the municipality, in addition to deforestation, is the change of land use by another type of agriculture. Change and the availability of new foods can lead to change the consumption habits of the community. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the impact of agribusiness strawberry with respect to changes in the environment, and its impact on the feeding process, since this depends largely food security. For this purpose, a multi-temporal analysis of Landsat ETM+satellite images from 2000 and 2017 respectively was carried out in the municipality of Tapalpa, Jalisco. Likewise, a Food Consumption Frequency Questionnaire (FCFC) was applied, taking a sample of 264 adults distributed between 18 and 60 years of age, toevaluate strawberry consumption in the municipality. The results showed an evolution of landscape fragmentation at all levels with a reduction in the percentage of hectares of forest land use and a significant increase in hectares of protected agriculture. Regarding consumption, the results indicated that 67% of the sample consumes strawberry and that the amount depends on the harvest period.Save to LibraryDownloadby Norma Helen  Juárez•  3  Social Change, Consumption, Impact EvaluationAdditionality and design of forest conservation programs: Insights from Ecuador's Socio Bosque ProgramEcuador has experienced one of the highest rates of deforestation in South America over the turn of the century with consequent threats to the provision of essential life-supporting environmental services.

The Ecuadorian government instituted the ‘Socio Bosque Program’ (PSB) in 2008 in an effort to incentivize the conservation of privately-owned native forests. This study is the first to examine PSB additionality in preventing deforestation through use of a geographic information system. Moreover, face-to-face surveys were conducted and analyzed to create a typology of forest owners based on their estimated likelihood to engage in forest land changes and elicit corresponding preferences for PSB-like forest conservation program participation. The survey data were collected from individual Ecuadorian forest owners in the Western region of the province of Pichincha. We estimate that less than 1% of forestland enrolled in the PSB would have been deforested were it not enrolled in the program. Landowners more likely to engage in deforestation practices denoted greater interest in participating in a conser- vation program when contracts allowed for the sustainable harvesting of timber. Landowners likely to conserve, showed greater interest in participating in a conservation program contingent on the amount of financial incen- tive provided. A design strategy, counter to the traditional focus, points to the allowance of sustainable forest har- vesting, as a means of more effectively preventing deforestation in the Tropics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Phillip M Mohebalian•  4  Impact Evaluation, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), Socio Bosque Program, Forest Owner TypologyNew Challenges in Agricultural Advisory Services from a Research Perspective: A Literature Review, Synthesis and Research AgendaSave to LibraryDownloadby Guy Faure•  6  Program Evaluation, Impact Evaluation, Context Effect, Agricultural ProductionInvestor protections and economic growthUsing objective measures of investor protections in 170 countries, I establish that the level of investor protection matters for cross-country differences in GDP growth: countries with stronger protections tend to grow faster than those... moreUsing objective measures of investor protections in 170 countries, I establish that the level of investor protection matters for cross-country differences in GDP growth: countries with stronger protections tend to grow faster than those with poor investor protections.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Ibrahim Haidar•  361  Business, Entrepreneurship, Industrial And Labor Relations, Collective Bargaining (Industrial And Labor Relations)Relatório sobre a proposta de construção da Barragem no Rio Guapiaçu – Cachoeiras de Macacu, Rio de JaneiroO presente relatório é resultado de uma construção coletiva do Grupo de Trabalho em Assuntos Agrários da Associação dos Geógrafos Brasileiros (GT Agrária-AGB), das seções Niterói e Rio de Janeiro, em parceria com organizações... moreO presente relatório é resultado de uma construção coletiva do Grupo de Trabalho em Assuntos Agrários da Associação dos Geógrafos Brasileiros (GT Agrária-AGB), das seções Niterói e Rio de Janeiro, em parceria com organizações comunitárias, universidades e pesquisadores independentes e se insere no contexto de análise dos riscos e impactos da implantação de grandes projetos de desenvolvimento no espaço agrário fluminense.Save to LibraryDownloadby Luiz Jardim Wanderley•  4  Water resources, Impact Evaluation, Social impact, Environmental ConflictsThe impacts of the Russo-Japanese war (1904-5) on Russia’s economy, society, & politicsThe Russo-Japanese war's social, economic, and politcal impacts upon Russia.History Coursework A2 Part ASave to LibraryDownloadby Alisha  Rogerson•  23  History, Economic History, Japanese Studies, Russian StudiesAn Economic & Social Impact Study of Australian Agricultural ShowsThe Economic and Social Impact Study of Australian Agricultural Shows set out to identify and measure the economic and social impact of Australian agricultural shows with the aim of providing valuable information to those who support the... moreThe Economic and Social Impact Study of Australian Agricultural Shows set out to identify and measurethe economic and social impact of Australian agricultural shows with the aim of providing valuableinformation to those who support the show movement through participation, sponsorship andvolunteerism.To learn about the impact of agricultural shows, this study completed a document analysis and gatheredfeedback from 1,900 people.

This allows for a more nuanced understanding of how different combinations of factors can lead to success, and the influence context can have on success.- QCA allows evaluators to test theories of change and answer the question ‘what works best, why and under what circumstances’ in a way that emerges directly from the empirical analysis, that can be replicated by other researchers, and is generalizable to other contexts.- While it isn’t appropriate for use in all circumstances and has limitations, QCA also has certain unique strengths – including qualitatively assessing impact and identifying multiple pathways to achieving change which make it a valuable addition to the evaluation toolkit.Save to LibraryDownloadby Barbara Befani•  5  Impact Evaluation, Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), Impact evaluation, causality and evaluation methodologies for public policies, programs, and development projects, Impact evaluation of development interventionsThe impact of foresight on innovation policy-making: recent experiences and future perspectivesForesight has evolved as a distinct prospective analytical tool: it considers alternative futures of various S&T fields or socio-economic systems by bringing together the perspectives of various stakeholder groups, and thus assists the... moreForesight has evolved as a distinct prospective analytical tool: it considers alternative futures of various S&T fields or socio-economic systems by bringing together the perspectives of various stakeholder groups, and thus assists the decision-making processes at different levels. However, in order to avoid hypes – and subsequent disappointments – about what foresight can deliver, the potential contributions to decision-making processes by foresight should be clearly understood. The paper puts foresight into this broader context of policy-making processes, with a particular emphasis on innovation policy: it describes the evolution of different policy rationales since the 1950s, develops a framework to classify the impacts of various types of prospective analyses, and reviews the evaluation results of several national foresight programmes by using this framework. On that basis, future directions of how foresight might evolve are considered to spur discussions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Attila Havas and +1Doris Schartinger•  12  Policy Analysis/Policy Studies, Evaluation Research, Strategic Foresight, Strategic StudiesRailway Network Timetabling and Dynamic Traffic ManagementSave to LibraryDownloadby Ingo Hansen•  4  Civil Engineering, Impact Evaluation, Traffic Management, Stability AnalysisUrban Regeneration and Surveillance in Post-Olympic East London A Survey-Based Study of Local Residents AttitudesSave to LibraryDownloadby Susi Lovati•  7  Urban Planning, Gentrification, Impact Evaluation, Surveillance StudiesTHE IMPACTS OF NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNDING IN THE UK: A PUBLIC MANAGEMENT EVALUATION SUMMARYThis Impact Report identifies and summarises the diverse impacts, resulting from the £500m of UK funding of Science and Technology in 2013, using numerous quantitative metrics and short case study extracts.

The claims are evaluated, under a range of criteria derived from the Utilitarian ethic. Firstly, if aid or charity money is diverted from the very poorest people to the quite poor, or the rich, there is an increase in death and destitution. It is shown that little of the extra paid by consumers for Fairtrade reaches farmers, sometimes none. It cannot be shown that it has a positive impact on Fairtrade farmers in general, but evidence suggesting it harms others is presented. Many of the weaknesses are due to an attempt to impose political views on farmers and others.Secondly, the unfair trading criteria require that sellers do not lie about their product, nor withhold information that might alter the decisions of a substantial proportion of buyers. It is argued that the system only can exist because of the failure of the Fairtrade industry to give the facts on what happens to the money and what it can be proved it achieves. This unfair trading compromises the reputation of charities in general.Much of the trading may constitute the criminal offence of Unfair Trading in the EU.Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter Griffiths•  9  Marketing, Development Economics, Development Studies, Monitoring And EvaluationTraci.: The Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental ImpactsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jane Bare•  5  Environmental Science, Industrial Ecology, Impact Evaluation, MultidisciplinaryCurso de Especialización en Monitoreo y Evaluación de Programas y Proyectos SocialesCurso dictado entre 2013 y 2017.

The theoretical and methodological ideas behind the book, inspired by Aristotelian phronesis, represent an original perspective within the social sciences, and this volume gives readers for the first time a set of studies exemplifying what applied phronesis looks like in practice. The reflexive analysis of values and power gives new meaning to the impact of research on policy and practice. Real Social Science is a major step forward in a novel and thriving field of research. This book will benefit scholars, researchers, and students who want to make a difference in practice, not just in the academy. Its message will make it essential reading for students and academics across the social sciences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg and +1Sanford  Schram•  1613  Screenwriting, Critical Theory, Critical Theory, Critical TheoryAssessing the Applicability of Participatory Multi-Criteria Analysis Methodologies to the Appraisal of Mega Transport InfrastructureThe topic of ‘how mega transport projects should be assessed’ continues to generate disputes amongst academics, infrastructure specialists, investors and governments alike.

This Ph.D. research sought to explore the applicability of participatory MCA methodologies to the (economic, environmental and social) appraisal of such projects. Although very popular amongst academics, participatory MCA techniques seem to have enjoyed limited practical application and there are no studies assessing their effectiveness. This research entailed several steps, where different methods of investigation and multiple sources of information, both primary and secondary, were combined together in an effort to increase the reliability of the results. Firstly, a comprehensive review of the literature, whose findings were validated and integrated by means of an expert focus group interview, was undertaken in the attempt to determine the key features of mega transport projects. An investigation into transport appraisal practice and traditional appraisal methodologies was then carried out through a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, complemented with unstructured interviews and informal discussions with some international experts. Successively, an examination of over 60 publications on participatory MCA methodologies was performed with the objective of determining the main attributes and critical aspects of such methods. An analysis of the current trends in mega transport infrastructure planning and decision-making practice was also undertaken based on a series of interviews with several infrastructure practitioners and the analysis of three large-scale port and port-related projects, namely the Alameda freight rail corridor (US), the expansion of the Port of Rotterdam (Holland) and the London Gateway port complex (UK). The London Gateway port complex was also adopted as case study for a practical application of participatory MCA methodologies. Overall, the outcomes of this multi-actor multi-criteria appraisal exercise, together with the findings from the previous steps of research, led to the identification of several (methodological and non-methodological) issues potentially surrounding the practical application of such methods. These issues were ultimately explored through a survey questionnaire carried out amongst specialists and proponents of participatory techniques. The overall conclusion of the thesis is that participatory MCA methodologies represent an under-researched area, where some critical themes have received limited consideration; contrasting views still exist on many fundamental aspects; and where, in many cases, the disconnection between theory and practice is apparent. In particular, the key principles, steps and structure of such methods are (directly or indirectly) based on the rational-comprehensive planning model, which hardly reflects the way projects are developed. Therefore, while, in principle, multi-actor multi-criteria procedures might be carried out to complement and integrate the information derived from conventional ex-ante analyses, it is difficult to see how such methods could significantly improve the decision-making process of major transport infrastructure.Save to LibraryDownloadby MARCO DEAN•  9  Decision Making, Infrastructure Planning, Transport Planning, Impact EvaluationImpact of Farmer Field Schools on Agricultural Productivity and Poverty in East AfricaSave to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Ayalew Mekonnen•  11  Human Geography, Economics, Impact Evaluation, East AfricaDesign Economy 2021 – Environmental and Social Value of DesignThis paper proposes a methodology for Design Economy 2021 that will provide data and stories on the environmental and social value of design in the UK, in addition to economic value.
