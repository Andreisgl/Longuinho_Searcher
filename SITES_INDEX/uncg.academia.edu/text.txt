Gwen Robbins SchugUniversity of North Carolina at Greensboro,  Biology,  Faculty MemberForensic Anthropology+39I am a bioarchaeologist, meaning I study human skeletal remains from archaeological sites as a source of evidence about the past. The majority of my work is focused on understanding human health and biocultural adaptations during periods of climate and environmental change. I am very interested in addressing questions of contemporary relevance using archaeological sources of evidence and have primarily worked in South Asia but recently, I have done some work in Oman and Italy.Supervisors: John Lukacsless2,163 Followers1,427 Following50 Co-authorsTotal Views ;1276 Public MentionsFollowFollowingCVall41 Publications4 Book Reviews15 Selected Media Coverage1 Laboratory Manuals1 Peer Reviewed Journal ArticlesMore  1 Conference Presentations42 Papers2 Recent/Popular PapersPublications2023_Climate change, human health, and resilience in the Holoceneby Gwen Robbins Schug, Brenda  Baker, Lynne  Goldstein, Lesley Gregoricka, and Megan PerryPNAS,  2023Climate change is an indisputable threat to human health, especially for societies already confro... more Climate change is an indisputable threat to human health, especially for societies already confronted with rising social inequality, political and economic uncertainty, and a cascade of concurrent environmental challenges. Archaeological data about past climate and environment provide an important source of evidence about the potential challenges humans face and the long-term outcomes of alternative short-term adaptive strategies. Evidence from well-dated archaeological human skeletons and mummified remains speaks directly to patterns of human health over time through changing circumstances. Here, we describe variation in human epidemiological patterns in the context of past rapid climate change (RCC) events and other periods of past environmental change. Case studies confirm that human communities responded to environmental changes in diverse ways depending on historical, sociocultural, and biological contingencies. Certain factors, such as social inequality and disproportionate access to resources in large, complex societies may influence the probability of major sociopolitical disruptions and reorganizations—commonly known as “collapse.” This survey of Holocene human–environmental relations demonstrates how flexibility, variation, and maintenance of Indigenous knowledge can be mitigating factors in the face of environmental challenges. Although contemporary climate change is more rapid and of greater magnitude than the RCC events and other environmental changes we discuss here, these lessons from the past provide clarity about potential priorities for equitable, sustainable development and the constraints of modernity we must address.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2022_Theoretical Approaches to the Paleopathology of Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Structural Violence as a Holistic Interpretive Tool in PaleopathologyTHE ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF PALEOPATHOLOGY,  2022Research on infant and child paleopathology is central to understand the human condition. This ch... more Research on infant and child paleopathology is central to understand the human condition. This chapter demonstrates how structural violence is useful for exploring the multivocality of infancy and childhood in paleopathology. We highlight relevant examples from the paleopathological literature, beginning with a brief description of the framework of structural violence. We review some of the work that has been conducted on traumatic injuries and explore debates about applying the concept of structural violence to evidence for past violence. Next, we briefly examine the recent focus in paleopathology on the maternal-fetal nexus as a contributor to infant and child health and lifelong experience, and how this approach can be extended using the structural violence framework. Finally, we highlight research on the varied and adaptive nature of family relationships and structures and how these support systems may be constrained and/or provide resilience in the face of structural violence.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the School of Human Evolution and Social Change (ASU), and the Center for Bioarchaeological Research (CBR, ASU), the Workshop's overall goal was to explore reasons why research proposals submitted by bioarchaeologists, both graduate students and established scholars, fared disproportionately poorly within recent NSF Anthropology Program competitions and to offer advice for increasing success. Therefore, this Workshop comprised 43 international scholars and four advanced graduate students with a history of successful grant acquisition, primarily from the United States. Ultimately, we focused on two related aims: (1) best practices for improving research designs and training and (2) evaluating topics of contemporary significance that reverberate through history and beyond as promising trajectories for bioarchaeological research. Among the former were contextual grounding, research question/hypothesis generation, statistical procedures appropriate for small samples and mixed qualitative/quantitative data, the salience of Bayesian methods, and training program content. Topical foci included ethics, social inequality, identity (including intersectionality), climate change, migration, violence, epidemic disease, adaptability/plasticity, the osteological paradox, and the developmental origins of health and disease. Given the profound changes required globally to address decolonization in the 21st century, this concern also entered many formal and informal discussions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet the toll of the virus on public health has been uneven globally and within nations to an extent that has led STEM professionals to inevitably conclude that a truly effective response requires insights and mobilization from across the social sciences and humanities. It is hard to express how much the pandemic has impacted almost every aspect of life in human communities and how it has laid bare longstanding social problems, like social inequalities. The pandemic has also illuminated the extent of more recent pernicious social forces, such as disaster capitalism, and provides an ominous window into how some governments and societies will meet challenges such as climate change. This introduction presents six commissioned articles that demonstrate the power of an anthropological approach to the biocultural and evolutionary aspects of pandemic and epidemic diseases in the past. In this article, we also frame a path for bioarchaeologists to contribute to incredibly important questions and debates about the global pandemic by situating the articles into holistic theoretical approaches.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2021_Moving beyond Weiss and Springer's Repatriation and Erasing the Past: Indigenous values, relationships, and researchby Gwen Robbins Schug and Sian HalcrowInternational Journal of Cultural Property,  2021This commentary debunks the poor scholarship in Repatriation and Erasing the Past by Elizabeth We... more This commentary debunks the poor scholarship in Repatriation and Erasing the Past by Elizabeth Weiss and James Springer. We show that modern bioarchaeological practice with Indigenous remains places ethics, partnership, and collaboration at the fore and that the authors' misconstructed dichotomous fallacy between "objective science" and Indigenous knowledge and repatriation hinders the very argument they are espousing. We demonstrate that bioarchaeology, when conducted in collaboration with stakeholders, enriches research, with concepts and methodologies brought forward to address common questions, and builds a richer historical and archaeological context. As anthropologists, we need to acknowledge anti-Indigenous (and anti-Black) ideology and the insidious trauma and civil rights violations that have been afflicted and re-afflicted through Indigenous remains being illegally or unethically obtained, curated, transferred, and used for research and teaching in museums and universities. If we could go so far as to say that anything good has come out of this book, it has been the stimulation in countering these beliefs and developing and strengthening ethical approaches and standards in our field.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2021_3D Dead: Ethical Considerations in Digital Human Osteologyby Gwen Robbins Schug and Krista BaronBioarchaeology International ,  2021Humans have interacted with the remains of our dead for aesthetic and ritual purposes for millenn... more Humans have interacted with the remains of our dead for aesthetic and ritual purposes for millennia, and we have utilized them for medical, educational, and scholarly pursuits for several centuries. Recently, it has become possible to use digital technologies such as 3D scanners and printers for reconstructing, representing, and dis- seminating bodies. At the same time, there is growing interest among academics and curators in taking a more reflexive approach to the ethical and social dimensions of conservation. This paper considers theoretical and practical aspects of ethics as they apply to the 3D scanning and printing of human skeletal remains for curation or dissemination, provides case studies from our work in the United States, and suggests guidelines for best practices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2021_Indus Mortuary Behavior: Between Action and Symbolic MeaningCulture, Continuity and Tradition: Disquisitions in Honour of Prof. Vasant Shinde,  2021Archaeologists and anthropologists have long been interested in mortuary and other ritual behavio... more Archaeologists and anthropologists have long been interested in mortuary and other ritual behavior as a window into the symbolic, social, and political lives of pastpeople. It goes without saying that the interpretation of mortuary behavior provides an opportunity to examine spiritual and secular meaning; it contains elements of collective and individual identity, memory, tradition, ritual performance, and ideas about the afterlife (Rappaport, 1999). This window into the social relations of the past, provides a vision of structure refracted through agency (Inomata & Coben, 2006; Turner, 1982). Mortuary tradition is enacted to transform; we interact with the dead to remember but also to renegotiate and finally, to separate (Duncan et al., 2005; Van Gennep, 1960). In this process, power relations are both reified and renegotiated (Bell, 1997).

Bioarchaeology—the study of archaeological human skeletons—provides direct evidence of the human experience of past climate and environmental changes and serves as an important complement to paleoclimate, historical, and archaeological approaches to changes we may expect with global warming.Comprising 27 chapters from experts across a broad range of time periods and geographical regions, this book addresses hypotheses about how climate and environmental changes impact human health and well-being, factors that promote resilience, and circumstances that make migration or interpersonal violence a more likely outcome. The volume highlights the potential relevance of bioarchaeological analysis to contemporary challenges by organizing the chapters into a framework outlined by the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Planning for a warmer world requires knowledge about humans as biological organisms with a deep connection to Earth's ecosystems balanced by an appreciation of how historical and socio-cultural circumstances, socioeconomic inequality, degrees of urbanization, community mobility, and social institutions play a role in shaping long-term outcomes for human communities.　Containing a wealth of nuanced perspectives about human-environmental relations, book is key reading for students of environmental archaeology, bioarchaeology, and the history of disease. By providing a longer view of contemporary challenges, it may also interest readers in public health, public policy, and planning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Governments and non-governmental organizations are considering potential future impacts and creating plans for managing natural disasters, global warming, and associated environmental changes (DoD, 2015; EPA 2016a; b; c; d). The ability to understand global warming and predict and plan for the future relies on historical sciences. Paleoclimate science uses proxies to infer climatic and environmental fluctuations in the past, examining correlations among CO 2 levels, mean global surface temperatures, ice coverage, sea-level rise, and paleoecology to develop models for prediction (Bender, 2013). Historical social sciences, including anthropology and archaeology, are also uniquely situated to contribute to these conversations based on our examinations of past human perceptions of and responses to climate and environmental change. For many decades, archaeologists and bioarchaeologists--who study human remains as a source of archaeological evidence--have been conducting scientific research on human-environmental interactions in the past and studying phenomena that will be highly valuable for contemporary planning and policymaking. Our scholarship addresses the socio-cultural-political dimensions of climate change over the last 12,000 years. Our data allow for nuanced interpretations of short-term strategies and long-term trajectories of human responses to environmental change. The 27 chapters in this volume demonstrate there are no grand narratives in the arc of human history; however, these chapters also demonstrate a historical perspective on four major challenges facing contemporary human communities. Anthropogenic climate and environmental changes are occurring at a scale and magnitude unprecedented in human history and they are already a significant threat to health and well-being. However, it is critical we recognize humans are biological organisms, enmeshed within an ecological system, and completely interdependent on other species across the Kingdoms of life. Global warming is accompanied by the sixth mass extinction, which threatens the maintenance of life on Earth. We are also in the midst of an epidemiological transition, where modernity has brought sedentism, poor diets, obesity, and a rise in morbidity due to degenerative conditions. Unfortunately, we are also facing powerful challenges from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases as we increasingly disturb wild spaces, interact with other species in detrimental new ways, and have misused antibiotic therapies....Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Bioarchaeology takes an evolutionary and biocultural approach to human health that puts these scholars in a unique position to provide nuanced perspectives on human behavioral responses in the face of these challenges; this is particularly true in the recognition that social inequality represents a significant risk factor for human health in the context of climate and culture change. Despite its potential, bioarchaeological research has not played a visible role in the scholarly or popular discourse regarding behavioral responses to climate change. In the hopes of generating further discussion and research, this chapter offers a framework—structured by these IPCC categories—for understanding the human impact of climate change in the past, highlighting potentials and acknowledging limitations for making predictions about its impacts in the future.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2020_A Bioarchaeology of Madness: Modernity, pellagra, and the rise of the manicomio system in the Veneto Region of Italy (download from link)Routledge Handbook of the Bioarchaeology of Climate and Environmental Change,  2021Human environments in the Modern period are characterized by a complex set of political, economic... more Human environments in the Modern period are characterized by a complex set of political, economic, social, cultural, ecological, co-evolutionary, and biocultural interactions. This chapter uses historical and bioarchaeological evidence to understand the human experience of pellagra at the intersection of these forces in the 19th and 20th century in the Veneto region of Italy. As new foods were imported from across the Atlantic, socio-political and economic forces conspired to make a growing class of people particularly vulnerable to micronutrient deficiency and disease. In the context of Enlightenment and positivist values, medicalization and institutionalization were also a growing force for understanding and coping with strange, inconvenient, or disturbing differences in human health and behavior. These combined forces shaped the reality for sufferers of pellagrous mania. This chapter considers the human skeletal material from pellagra sufferers confined to Sant' Anna Ospedale in the century between 1850–1950 and situates them in the context of asylum records from two nearby manicomio to trace the embodiment of disease ideology and treatment in the context of a changing social environment. These data have implications for understanding how environmental change opens a space for changing disease landscapes, which in cases of highly disfiguring conditions or deeply disturbing behavioral changes, creates an opening for deepening marginalization, social division, and social control.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2020_Ritual, Urbanism, and the Everyday: Mortuary Behavior in the Indus CivilizationThe Bioarchaeology of Urbanization,  2020Human skeletal material from archaeological sites is the most important source of evidence about ... more Human skeletal material from archaeological sites is the most important source of evidence about embodied experience, habitual behaviors, and aspects of health in past people. Within bioarchaeology's broad area of inquiry, analysis of mortuary behavior (particularly when combined with paleopathology) is potentially the most critical tool for archaeologists to reconstruct ritual and meaning in the past. This work typically combines embodiment and practice theory to examine the importance of ritual, its contours, and its social function. This chapter asks what we mean by "ritual" and how "ritual" emerges from mortuary artifacts and features. This chapter seeks to move away from mortuary ritual as a distinct category of behavior in the Indus context, separate from a secular life in the urban environment. I argue that mortuary behavior for individuals in the Indus civilization varies because of the nature of the heterogeneous populations that occupied these urban settlements in the Indus Age but perhaps also that mortuary and other ritual behaviors in the Indus civilization were entangled, enmeshed, and interacted with the everyday heterogeneity of people's life in the urban environment. While there is no common tradition apparent within or among all Indus cities, what is clear is that the urban lifestyle and environment participated in creating diverse rituals that were performed here in a funerary context and that participation would contribute to memories of the cities long after their decline. Evidence is drawn from mortuary archaeology and objects, bodies and emergent behaviors, pathophysiology and health. These ritual and everyday dimensions of life in South Asia's first urban period speak to the deepest anthropological questions we can ask about the past and how it was lived in the urban context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Anthropologists broaden the definition to include sociocultural, behavioral, and emotional aspects of the developmental environment. This chapter describes the differential diagnosis and bioarchaeological interpretation of crania from two children, approximately five years old at death, interred in an ossuary (Area G) at the prehistoric city of Harappa, Pakistan (2000-1900 BCE). Both children were affected by variation in cranial shape known as plagiocephaly; viewed from above, the crania are asymmetrically distorted by flattening on one side of the frontal or occipital region. This striking variation in shape results from postnatal deformation or in cases where cartilaginous sutures that typically separate the bones of the cranial vault fail to form or prematurely close. This paper describes a biomedical method to tease apart intrauterine and post-natal etiological factors that result in plagiocephaly—genetics, epigenetic factors, intrauterine constraints, plural birth, prolonged vertex molding, post-natal sleeping posture, supine positioning, and/or conditions that limit movement in young infants and children, such as torticollis—and then describes a biocultural interpretation of these two individuals using a theoretical approach rooted in an archaeology of emotion to explore social identity, motherhood, and the emotional response to childhood plagiocephaly at Harappa. Introduction Philosophers have long explored the connection between perception, sensation, emotion, memory, and time. Sensation (e.g., seeing, hearing, etc.) and sensory modalities (e.g., thermoception, proprioception, nociception, etc.) are the basis for human interactions with the world and each other. If archaeologists can identify a material signature of sensation and emotion in the past, we can imagine how these processes drive the constitution of daily existence and social life (Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

More than that, analysis of paleo-pathology (study of trauma and disease in the past) and mortuary behavior is critical data for reconstructing meaning in the past. Evidence for traumatic injuries has been demonstrated at six Harappan sites. We have also found that stigmatizedinfectious diseases appear in the subcontinent at this time. Patho-physiological variations, including congenital differences, dental diseases, arthritis, and nutritional insufficiency, have also been discovered in the remains from Harappan cities. These human experiences, contextualized within mortuary treatment, have revitalized research into the socio-cultural dimensions of life in South Asia’s first urban period. This chapter demonstrates the evidence from some of the major Harappan cities that have been thoroughly studied—Harappa, Rakhigarhi, Farmana—and for some of the Harappan cities that deserve more thorough attention--Mohenjo Daro, Kalibangan, and Sanauli. I provide details about the skeletal evidence and its interpretation with the goal of encouraging the burgeoning field of bioarchaeological research in the subcontinent.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An empirical global assessment of land use from10,000 years before the present (yr B.P.) to 1850 CE reveals a planet largely transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists by 3000 years ago, considerably earlier than the dates in the land-use reconstructions commonlyused by Earth scientists. Synthesis of knowledge contributed by more than250 archaeologists highlighted gaps in archaeological expertise and data quality, which peaked for 2000 yr B.P. and in traditionally studied and wealthier regions. Archaeological reconstruction of global land-use history illuminates the deep roots of Earth’s transformation and challenges the emerging Anthropocene paradigm that large-scale anthropogenic global environmental change is mostly a recent phenomenon.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2018_Changing the Climate: Bioarchaeology Responds to Deterministic Thinking About Human-Environmental Interactions in the PastBioarchaeologists Speak Out: Deep Time Perspectives on Contemporary Issues,  2018As members of the global public become increasingly concerned about climate change, popular press... more As members of the global public become increasingly concerned about climate change, popular presses promote " scientific " narratives about the success or failure of past societies (e.g., Diamond 2011), human security literature perpetuates a narrative that violence is a " natural " outcome of increased competition in such circumstances (e.g., Barnett 2007), and generally, neither the public nor policy-makers are exposed to information about the topic of human-environmental interactions from those who know it best, anthropologists. This chapter explores the development of the human security field and the development of pseudo-evolutionary, ahistorical, adaptationist narratives about human behavior in the face of changing climates. The chapter also demonstrates implications of these narratives as they have been adopted by policy-makers at the EPA and DoD. Finally, the chapter provides an example of a bioarchaeological approach to research on human-environmental relations in the past and the complex dynamics that shaped the human experience of climate, social, and economic changes in the first and second millennium BCE in South Asia. Human security literature is the basis for planning for a warmer world. Anthropological perspectives are the necessary antidote to narratives of competition and violence that promote a governmental agenda to prevail at all costs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this short report, we examine the hypothesis that the so-called “Atacama skeleton” has skeletal abnormalities indicative of dysplasia, critique the validity of the interpretations of disease based on genomic analyses, and comment on the ethics of research on this partially mummified human foetus. The current paper acts as a case study of the importance of using an anthropological approach for aDNA research on human remains. A critical evaluation of the ethically controversial paper by Bhattacharya et al. highlights how an understanding of skeletal biological processes, including normal and abnormal growth and development, taphonomic processes, environmental context, and close attention to ethical issues of dealing with human remains, is vital to scientific interpretations. To this end, close collaboration with palaeopathologists and local archaeologists through appropriate peer-reviewed journals will add to the rigour of scientific interpretation and circumvent misinterpretation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Stigma has significant social consequences, including surveillance , exclusion, discipline, control, and punishment; biologically speaking, internalized stigma also compounds the disfigurement and disability resulting from this disease. Stigma results from an othering process whereby difference is recognized, meaning is constituted, and eventually, sufferers may be negatively signified and marked for exclusion. This paper traces the history of leprosy's stigmatization in South Asia, using archaeology and an exegesis of Vedic texts to examine the meaning of this disease from its apparent zero-point—when it first appears but before it was differentiated and signified—in the mature Indus Age. Results suggest that early in the second millennium BCE, leprosy was perceived as treatable and efforts were apparently made to mitigate its impact on the journey to the afterworld. Ignominy to the point of exclusion does not emerge until the first millennium BCE. This paper uses archaeology to create an effective history of stigma for leprosy, destabilizing what is true about this disease and its sufferers in South Asia today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

2021_Moving beyond Weiss and Springer's Repatriation and Erasing the Past: Indigenous values, relationships, and researchby Gwen Robbins Schug and Sian HalcrowInternational Journal of Cultural Property,  2021This commentary debunks the poor scholarship in Repatriation and Erasing the Past by Elizabeth We... more This commentary debunks the poor scholarship in Repatriation and Erasing the Past by Elizabeth Weiss and James Springer. We show that modern bioarchaeological practice with Indigenous remains places ethics, partnership, and collaboration at the fore and that the authors' misconstructed dichotomous fallacy between "objective science" and Indigenous knowledge and repatriation hinders the very argument they are espousing. We demonstrate that bioarchaeology, when conducted in collaboration with stakeholders, enriches research, with concepts and methodologies brought forward to address common questions, and builds a richer historical and archaeological context. As anthropologists, we need to acknowledge anti-Indigenous (and anti-Black) ideology and the insidious trauma and civil rights violations that have been afflicted and re-afflicted through Indigenous remains being illegally or unethically obtained, curated, transferred, and used for research and teaching in museums and universities. If we could go so far as to say that anything good has come out of this book, it has been the stimulation in countering these beliefs and developing and strengthening ethical approaches and standards in our field.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2021_3D Dead: Ethical Considerations in Digital Human Osteologyby Gwen Robbins Schug and Krista BaronBioarchaeology International ,  2021Humans have interacted with the remains of our dead for aesthetic and ritual purposes for millenn... more Humans have interacted with the remains of our dead for aesthetic and ritual purposes for millennia, and we have utilized them for medical, educational, and scholarly pursuits for several centuries. Recently, it has become possible to use digital technologies such as 3D scanners and printers for reconstructing, representing, and dis- seminating bodies. At the same time, there is growing interest among academics and curators in taking a more reflexive approach to the ethical and social dimensions of conservation. This paper considers theoretical and practical aspects of ethics as they apply to the 3D scanning and printing of human skeletal remains for curation or dissemination, provides case studies from our work in the United States, and suggests guidelines for best practices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2021_Indus Mortuary Behavior: Between Action and Symbolic MeaningCulture, Continuity and Tradition: Disquisitions in Honour of Prof. Vasant Shinde,  2021Archaeologists and anthropologists have long been interested in mortuary and other ritual behavio... more Archaeologists and anthropologists have long been interested in mortuary and other ritual behavior as a window into the symbolic, social, and political lives of pastpeople. It goes without saying that the interpretation of mortuary behavior provides an opportunity to examine spiritual and secular meaning; it contains elements of collective and individual identity, memory, tradition, ritual performance, and ideas about the afterlife (Rappaport, 1999). This window into the social relations of the past, provides a vision of structure refracted through agency (Inomata & Coben, 2006; Turner, 1982). Mortuary tradition is enacted to transform; we interact with the dead to remember but also to renegotiate and finally, to separate (Duncan et al., 2005; Van Gennep, 1960). In this process, power relations are both reified and renegotiated (Bell, 1997).

Bioarchaeology—the study of archaeological human skeletons—provides direct evidence of the human experience of past climate and environmental changes and serves as an important complement to paleoclimate, historical, and archaeological approaches to changes we may expect with global warming.Comprising 27 chapters from experts across a broad range of time periods and geographical regions, this book addresses hypotheses about how climate and environmental changes impact human health and well-being, factors that promote resilience, and circumstances that make migration or interpersonal violence a more likely outcome. The volume highlights the potential relevance of bioarchaeological analysis to contemporary challenges by organizing the chapters into a framework outlined by the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Planning for a warmer world requires knowledge about humans as biological organisms with a deep connection to Earth's ecosystems balanced by an appreciation of how historical and socio-cultural circumstances, socioeconomic inequality, degrees of urbanization, community mobility, and social institutions play a role in shaping long-term outcomes for human communities.　Containing a wealth of nuanced perspectives about human-environmental relations, book is key reading for students of environmental archaeology, bioarchaeology, and the history of disease. By providing a longer view of contemporary challenges, it may also interest readers in public health, public policy, and planning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Governments and non-governmental organizations are considering potential future impacts and creating plans for managing natural disasters, global warming, and associated environmental changes (DoD, 2015; EPA 2016a; b; c; d). The ability to understand global warming and predict and plan for the future relies on historical sciences. Paleoclimate science uses proxies to infer climatic and environmental fluctuations in the past, examining correlations among CO 2 levels, mean global surface temperatures, ice coverage, sea-level rise, and paleoecology to develop models for prediction (Bender, 2013). Historical social sciences, including anthropology and archaeology, are also uniquely situated to contribute to these conversations based on our examinations of past human perceptions of and responses to climate and environmental change. For many decades, archaeologists and bioarchaeologists--who study human remains as a source of archaeological evidence--have been conducting scientific research on human-environmental interactions in the past and studying phenomena that will be highly valuable for contemporary planning and policymaking. Our scholarship addresses the socio-cultural-political dimensions of climate change over the last 12,000 years. Our data allow for nuanced interpretations of short-term strategies and long-term trajectories of human responses to environmental change. The 27 chapters in this volume demonstrate there are no grand narratives in the arc of human history; however, these chapters also demonstrate a historical perspective on four major challenges facing contemporary human communities. Anthropogenic climate and environmental changes are occurring at a scale and magnitude unprecedented in human history and they are already a significant threat to health and well-being. However, it is critical we recognize humans are biological organisms, enmeshed within an ecological system, and completely interdependent on other species across the Kingdoms of life. Global warming is accompanied by the sixth mass extinction, which threatens the maintenance of life on Earth. We are also in the midst of an epidemiological transition, where modernity has brought sedentism, poor diets, obesity, and a rise in morbidity due to degenerative conditions. Unfortunately, we are also facing powerful challenges from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases as we increasingly disturb wild spaces, interact with other species in detrimental new ways, and have misused antibiotic therapies....Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Bioarchaeology takes an evolutionary and biocultural approach to human health that puts these scholars in a unique position to provide nuanced perspectives on human behavioral responses in the face of these challenges; this is particularly true in the recognition that social inequality represents a significant risk factor for human health in the context of climate and culture change. Despite its potential, bioarchaeological research has not played a visible role in the scholarly or popular discourse regarding behavioral responses to climate change. In the hopes of generating further discussion and research, this chapter offers a framework—structured by these IPCC categories—for understanding the human impact of climate change in the past, highlighting potentials and acknowledging limitations for making predictions about its impacts in the future.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter uses historical and bioarchaeological evidence to understand the human experience of pellagra at the intersection of these forces in the 19th and 20th century in the Veneto region of Italy. As new foods were imported from across the Atlantic, socio-political and economic forces conspired to make a growing class of people particularly vulnerable to micronutrient deficiency and disease. In the context of Enlightenment and positivist values, medicalization and institutionalization were also a growing force for understanding and coping with strange, inconvenient, or disturbing differences in human health and behavior. These combined forces shaped the reality for sufferers of pellagrous mania. This chapter considers the human skeletal material from pellagra sufferers confined to Sant' Anna Ospedale in the century between 1850–1950 and situates them in the context of asylum records from two nearby manicomio to trace the embodiment of disease ideology and treatment in the context of a changing social environment. These data have implications for understanding how environmental change opens a space for changing disease landscapes, which in cases of highly disfiguring conditions or deeply disturbing behavioral changes, creates an opening for deepening marginalization, social division, and social control.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Within bioarchaeology's broad area of inquiry, analysis of mortuary behavior (particularly when combined with paleopathology) is potentially the most critical tool for archaeologists to reconstruct ritual and meaning in the past. This work typically combines embodiment and practice theory to examine the importance of ritual, its contours, and its social function. This chapter asks what we mean by "ritual" and how "ritual" emerges from mortuary artifacts and features. This chapter seeks to move away from mortuary ritual as a distinct category of behavior in the Indus context, separate from a secular life in the urban environment. I argue that mortuary behavior for individuals in the Indus civilization varies because of the nature of the heterogeneous populations that occupied these urban settlements in the Indus Age but perhaps also that mortuary and other ritual behaviors in the Indus civilization were entangled, enmeshed, and interacted with the everyday heterogeneity of people's life in the urban environment. While there is no common tradition apparent within or among all Indus cities, what is clear is that the urban lifestyle and environment participated in creating diverse rituals that were performed here in a funerary context and that participation would contribute to memories of the cities long after their decline. Evidence is drawn from mortuary archaeology and objects, bodies and emergent behaviors, pathophysiology and health. These ritual and everyday dimensions of life in South Asia's first urban period speak to the deepest anthropological questions we can ask about the past and how it was lived in the urban context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Anthropologists broaden the definition to include sociocultural, behavioral, and emotional aspects of the developmental environment. This chapter describes the differential diagnosis and bioarchaeological interpretation of crania from two children, approximately five years old at death, interred in an ossuary (Area G) at the prehistoric city of Harappa, Pakistan (2000-1900 BCE). Both children were affected by variation in cranial shape known as plagiocephaly; viewed from above, the crania are asymmetrically distorted by flattening on one side of the frontal or occipital region. This striking variation in shape results from postnatal deformation or in cases where cartilaginous sutures that typically separate the bones of the cranial vault fail to form or prematurely close. This paper describes a biomedical method to tease apart intrauterine and post-natal etiological factors that result in plagiocephaly—genetics, epigenetic factors, intrauterine constraints, plural birth, prolonged vertex molding, post-natal sleeping posture, supine positioning, and/or conditions that limit movement in young infants and children, such as torticollis—and then describes a biocultural interpretation of these two individuals using a theoretical approach rooted in an archaeology of emotion to explore social identity, motherhood, and the emotional response to childhood plagiocephaly at Harappa. Introduction Philosophers have long explored the connection between perception, sensation, emotion, memory, and time. Sensation (e.g., seeing, hearing, etc.) and sensory modalities (e.g., thermoception, proprioception, nociception, etc.) are the basis for human interactions with the world and each other. If archaeologists can identify a material signature of sensation and emotion in the past, we can imagine how these processes drive the constitution of daily existence and social life (Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

More than that, analysis of paleo-pathology (study of trauma and disease in the past) and mortuary behavior is critical data for reconstructing meaning in the past. Evidence for traumatic injuries has been demonstrated at six Harappan sites. We have also found that stigmatizedinfectious diseases appear in the subcontinent at this time. Patho-physiological variations, including congenital differences, dental diseases, arthritis, and nutritional insufficiency, have also been discovered in the remains from Harappan cities. These human experiences, contextualized within mortuary treatment, have revitalized research into the socio-cultural dimensions of life in South Asia’s first urban period. This chapter demonstrates the evidence from some of the major Harappan cities that have been thoroughly studied—Harappa, Rakhigarhi, Farmana—and for some of the Harappan cities that deserve more thorough attention--Mohenjo Daro, Kalibangan, and Sanauli.

An empirical global assessment of land use from10,000 years before the present (yr B.P.) to 1850 CE reveals a planet largely transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists by 3000 years ago, considerably earlier than the dates in the land-use reconstructions commonlyused by Earth scientists. Synthesis of knowledge contributed by more than250 archaeologists highlighted gaps in archaeological expertise and data quality, which peaked for 2000 yr B.P. and in traditionally studied and wealthier regions. Archaeological reconstruction of global land-use history illuminates the deep roots of Earth’s transformation and challenges the emerging Anthropocene paradigm that large-scale anthropogenic global environmental change is mostly a recent phenomenon.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
2018_Changing the Climate: Bioarchaeology Responds to Deterministic Thinking About Human-Environmental Interactions in the PastBioarchaeologists Speak Out: Deep Time Perspectives on Contemporary Issues,  2018As members of the global public become increasingly concerned about climate change, popular press... more As members of the global public become increasingly concerned about climate change, popular presses promote " scientific " narratives about the success or failure of past societies (e.g., Diamond 2011), human security literature perpetuates a narrative that violence is a " natural " outcome of increased competition in such circumstances (e.g., Barnett 2007), and generally, neither the public nor policy-makers are exposed to information about the topic of human-environmental interactions from those who know it best, anthropologists. This chapter explores the development of the human security field and the development of pseudo-evolutionary, ahistorical, adaptationist narratives about human behavior in the face of changing climates. The chapter also demonstrates implications of these narratives as they have been adopted by policy-makers at the EPA and DoD. Finally, the chapter provides an example of a bioarchaeological approach to research on human-environmental relations in the past and the complex dynamics that shaped the human experience of climate, social, and economic changes in the first and second millennium BCE in South Asia. Human security literature is the basis for planning for a warmer world. Anthropological perspectives are the necessary antidote to narratives of competition and violence that promote a governmental agenda to prevail at all costs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this short report, we examine the hypothesis that the so-called “Atacama skeleton” has skeletal abnormalities indicative of dysplasia, critique the validity of the interpretations of disease based on genomic analyses, and comment on the ethics of research on this partially mummified human foetus. The current paper acts as a case study of the importance of using an anthropological approach for aDNA research on human remains. A critical evaluation of the ethically controversial paper by Bhattacharya et al. highlights how an understanding of skeletal biological processes, including normal and abnormal growth and development, taphonomic processes, environmental context, and close attention to ethical issues of dealing with human remains, is vital to scientific interpretations. To this end, close collaboration with palaeopathologists and local archaeologists through appropriate peer-reviewed journals will add to the rigour of scientific interpretation and circumvent misinterpretation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Stigma has significant social consequences, including surveillance , exclusion, discipline, control, and punishment; biologically speaking, internalized stigma also compounds the disfigurement and disability resulting from this disease. Stigma results from an othering process whereby difference is recognized, meaning is constituted, and eventually, sufferers may be negatively signified and marked for exclusion. This paper traces the history of leprosy's stigmatization in South Asia, using archaeology and an exegesis of Vedic texts to examine the meaning of this disease from its apparent zero-point—when it first appears but before it was differentiated and signified—in the mature Indus Age. Results suggest that early in the second millennium BCE, leprosy was perceived as treatable and efforts were apparently made to mitigate its impact on the journey to the afterworld. Ignominy to the point of exclusion does not emerge until the first millennium BCE. This paper uses archaeology to create an effective history of stigma for leprosy, destabilizing what is true about this disease and its sufferers in South Asia today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Panel regression formulas for estimating stature and body mass from immature human skeletons: a statistical approach without reference to specific age estimatesby Libby Cowgill and Gwen Robbins SchugJournal of Archaeological Science,  2013Anthropologists require methods for accurately estimating stature and body mass from the human sk... more Anthropologists require methods for accurately estimating stature and body mass from the human skeleton. Age-structured, generalized Least Squares (LS) regression formulas have been developed to predict stature from femoral length and to predict body mass in immature human remains using the width of the distal metaphysis, midshaft femoral geometry (J), and femoral head diameter. This paper tests the hypothesis that panel regression is an appropriate statistical method for regression modeling of longitudinal growth data, with longitudinal and cross-sectional effects on variance. Reference data were derived from the Denver Growth Study; panel regression was used to create one formula for estimating stature (for individuals 0.5e11.5 years old); two formulas for estimating body mass from the femur in infants and children (0.5e12.5 years old); and one formula for estimating body mass from the femoral head in older subadults (7e17.5 years old). The formulas were applied to an independent target sample of cadavers from Franklin County, Ohio and a large sample of immature individuals from diverse global populations. Results indicate panel regression formulas accurately estimate stature and body mass in immature skeletons, without reference to an independent estimate for age at death. Thus, using panel regression formulas to estimate stature and body mass in forensic and archaeological specimens may reduce second stage errors associated with inaccurate age estimates.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Use of TCA for early Holocene specimens from India demonstrated systematic biases in the morphological methods, had a demonstrable impact on the age pyramid, and significantly changed paleodemographic statistics. While TCA may provide greater accuracy and precision for age estimation of skeletally healthy specimens, it is unclear the magnitude to which specific pathologies affect the accuracy of different techniques for age determination. We hypothesized that age determination methods based on gross morphological changes in the skeleton will not accurately predict age-at-death for individuals with bone growth pathologies (achondroplasia, osteomalacia, osteogenesis imperfecta). Conversely, for adult individuals with chronic and severe rhino-maxillary infections, acellular cementum formation may be disrupted and thus morphological methods should be preferred. We compared age estimates from TCA with estimates made using standards for determination from the pelvis, fourth rib, dental attrition, and cranial stenosis. Results demonstrated significant differences among age estimates obtained using morphological and histological techniques that confirm the utility of TCA for pathological specimens in archaeology. Our results confirm the utility of cementum annulations for age estimation in bioarchaeology and suggest directions for additional research on the effects of pathology on the accuracy of various aging techniques.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Understanding Heterogeneity in Urban Mortuary Behavior: Between Action and Symbolic Meaning in the Indus AgeArchaeologists have long been interested in mortuary and other ritual behavior as a window into t... more Archaeologists have long been interested in mortuary and other ritual behavior as a window into the symbolic, social, and political lives of past people. It goes without saying that the interpretation of mortuary behavior provides an opportunity to examine spiritual and secular meaning; it contains elements of collective and individual identity, memory, tradition, ritual performance, and ideas about the afterlife (Rappaport, 1999). This window into the social relations of the past, provides a vision of structure refracted through agency (Inomata and Cohen, 2006; Turner, 1982). Mortuary tradition is enacted to transform; we interact with the dead to remember but also to renegotiate and finally, to separate (Duncan et al., 2005; Van Gennep, 1960). In this process power relations are both reified and renegotiated (Bell, 1997). The material symbolism of the burial and the body provides a rich field for anthropological ventures. Nomothetic approaches to archaeological mortuary data use inter-individual variation to define common rules or generalizations that can then be applied to interpret social structure from death assemblages (Binford, 1972; Saxe, 1970). This approach has been widely criticized in the anthropological literature (see for example Pearson, 1982; Rakita et al., 2005) yet still predominate because there is value in initially approaching these data in this way. However, heterogeneity in burial treatment may be best understood as a coherent, meaningful mortuary program that reflects social structure, politics, status, and power relations. Variants reflect different community identities and biographical contingencies; they are predicated upon historical, social and cultural ideas of the body (Robb, 2007:287). Normative Indus mortuary practice has been portrayed as consisting of primary, secondary, and &amp;#39;symbolic&amp;#39; single burials of adults, interred within formal cemeteries. In fact there is a tremendous amount of variation in mortuary behavior across the mature (2600-2000 BCE) and the post-urban (2000-1800 BCE) periods. Consideration of the full range of variation in mortuary traditions demonstrates the heterogeneity of the Bronze Age urban population in South Asia and ties with other Bronze Age societies across the exchange network. Conclusion and Discussion Archaeologists have often noted that many Mature Period Indus cities were built on sterile soil. These huge settlements of tens of thousands of people were built from the ground up, often in fewer than 150 years. Indus exchange relationships stretched across the Arabian peninsula and the civilization flourished for more than 500 years. The prime motivation for moving to the cities was economic (Wright, 2010). Isotopic analyses of human remains from Harappa (Price et al., 2013) suggested most of the males buried in the urban period cemetery (R-37) were not local. Additional analyses on material from Farmana, Rakhigarhi, and Sanauli suggested that immigrants came to the cities early in life, traveling from the hinterlands of Indus territory and as far away as Mesopotamia, typically between the ages of 3-5 years (Valentine, 2016) to settle and perhaps to apprentice in manufacturing and mercantilism in the urban centers. Despite the standardization for which this civilization is famous-in the layout of their settlements, weights and measures, brick sizes, script and seals-the Indus cities also contain a diverse set of mortuary behaviors. A survey of treatment of the dead in Indus settlements demonstrates incredible diversity across time and space. Single, extended, supine, primary inhumations of adults, secondary, and &amp;#39;symbolic&amp;#39; burials are not the normative tradition. Infants and children are present. Cenotaphs, ossuaries, double and multiple burials, prone burial, and many other traditions are present. Acknowledgement of these diverse practices better represents the heterogeneous communities that lived and worked in these cities. Osteobiographical and isotopic studies are required to better understand the heterogeneity that is deeply part of the urban phenomenon and perhaps to demonstrate that there was no common &amp;#39;Indus identity&amp;#39;.

3D DeadBioarchaeology International,  2021Humans have interacted with the remains of our dead for aesthetic and ritual purposes for millenn... more Humans have interacted with the remains of our dead for aesthetic and ritual purposes for millennia, and we have utilized them for medical, educational, and scholarly pursuits for several centuries. Recently, it has become possible to use digital technologies such as 3D scanners and printers for reconstructing, representing, and disseminating bodies. At the same time, there is growing interest among academics and curators in taking a more reflexive approach to the ethical and social dimensions of conservation. This paper considers theoretical and practical aspects of ethics as they apply to the 3D scanning and printing of human skeletal remains for curation or dissemination, provides case studies from our work in the United States, and suggests guidelines for best practices.   Los seres humanos hemos interactuado con los restos humanos de nuestros muertos por razones estéticas y rituales por milenios.

Bioarchaeology takes an evolutionary and biocultural approach to human health that puts these scholars in a unique position to provide nuanced perspectives on human behavioral responses in the face of these challenges; this is particularly true in the recognition that social inequality represents a significant risk factor for human health in the context of climate and culture change. Despite its potential, bioarchaeological research has not played a visible role in the scholarly or popular discourse regarding behavioral responses to climate change. In the hopes of generating further discussion and research, this chapter offers a framework—structured by these IPCC categories—for understanding the human impact of climate change in the past, highlighting potentials and acknowledging limitations for making predictions about its impacts in the future.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The timing of first infection, geographic origin, and pattern of transmission of the disease are still under investigation. Comparative genomics research has suggested M. leprae evolved either in East Africa or South Asia during the Late Pleistocene before spreading to Europe and the rest of the World. The earliest widely accepted evidence for leprosy is in Asian texts dated to 600 B.C. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report an analysis of pathological conditions in skeletal remains from the second millennium B.C. in India. A middle aged adult male skeleton demonstrates pathological changes in the rhinomaxillary region, degenerative joint disease, infectious involvement of the tibia (periostitis), and injury to the peripheral skeleton. The presence and patterning of lesions was subject to a process of differential diagnosis for leprosy including trepone...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Infection, Disease, and Biosocial Processes at the End of the Indus CivilizationIn the third millennium B.C., the Indus Civilization flourished in northwest India and Pakistan. ... more In the third millennium B.C., the Indus Civilization flourished in northwest India and Pakistan. The late mature phase (2200-1900 B.C.) was characterized by long-distance exchange networks, planned urban settlements, sanitation facilities, standardized weights and measures, and a sphere of influence over 1,000,000 square kilometers of territory. Recent paleoclimate reconstructions from the Beas River Valley demonstrate hydro-climatic stress due to a weakened monsoon system may have impacted urban centers like Harappa by the end of the third millennium B.C. the impact of environmental change was compounded by concurrent disruptions to the regional interaction sphere. Climate, economic, and social changes contributed to the disintegration of this civilization after 1900 B.C. We assess evidence for paleopathology to infer the biological consequences of climate change and socio-economic disruption in the post-urban period at Harappa, one of the largest urban centers in the Indus Civiliz...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this short report, we examine the hypothesis that the so-called &quot;Atacama skeleton&quot; has skeletal abnormalities indicative of dysplasia, critique the validity of the interpretations of disease based on genomic analyses, and comment on the ethics of research on this partially mummified human foetus. The current paper acts as a case study of the importance of using an anthropological approach for aDNA research on human remains. A critical evaluation of the ethically controversial paper by Bhattacharya et al. highlights how an understanding of skeletal biological processes, including normal and abnormal growth and development, taphonomic processes, environmental context, and close attention to ethical issues of dealing with human remains, is vital to scientific interpretations.

An empirical global assessment of land use from 10,000 BP to 1850 CE reveals a planet largely transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers and pastoralists by 3,000 years ago, significantly earlier than land-use reconstructions commonly used by Earth scientists. Synthesis of knowledge contributed by over 250 archaeologists highlighted gaps in archaeological 10 expertise and data quality, which peaked at 2000 BP and in traditionally studied and wealthier regions. Archaeological reconstruction of global land-use history illuminates the deep roots of Earth's transformation through millennia of increasingly intensive land use, challenging the emerging Anthropocene paradigm that anthropogenic global environmental change is mostly recent. 15 One Sentence Summary: A map of synthesized archaeological knowledge on land use reveals a planet transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers and pastoralists by 3,000 years ago. Authors not found on Academia: Torben Rick, Tim Denham, Jonathan Driver, Heather Thakar, Amber L.
