World overview
Welcome to Brits Abroad – a comprehensive guide to where Britons live around the world.
Use the tabs above to explore the information, compiled by the Institute for Public Policy Research.
Highlights
An estimated 5.5m British people live permanently abroad – almost one in 10 of the UK population. The emigration of British people has happened in cycles over 200 years. The trend is now rising again: some 2,000 British citizens moved permanently away from the UK every week in 2005.
This unique project aims to explain where people have gone. On the regional and country pages you will find data on what we know about that part of the world. For more on the methodology and the key issues about emigration, click on the links at the bottom of these pages.
