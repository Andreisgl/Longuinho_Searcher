[MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki 1.24.0 released

Hello everyone,
I am happy to announce the availability of the first stable release of the new MediaWiki
1.24 release series.
MediaWiki 1.24 is a large release that contains many new features and bug fixes. This is a
summary of the major changes of interest to users. You can consult the RELEASE-NOTES-1.24
file for the full list of changes in this version.
Our thanks to everyone who helped to improve MediaWiki by testing the release candidates
and submitting bug reports.
== What's new? ==
MediaWiki 1.24 includes all changes released in the smaller 1.24wmfX software deployments
to Wikimedia sites.
== Preferences made easier ==
MediaWiki is known to be extremely flexible and customisable, but few users use its full
potential. In 1.24, we aim to make dozens obscure preferences easily discoverable and
obvious to use.
== New features ==
* Category pages can now be moved (bug 5451).
* MergeHistory for all administrators by default (bug 66155).
* Improvements have been made to the password storage system, allowing improved security
against offline attacks should a wiki's database be compromised by attackers. Then,
the default password storage algorithm was changed to PBKDF2. PBKDF2 and Bcrypt have
built-in support in PHP. The new extensible password API makes it trivial to implement
scrypt support if we wanted to.
== Usability == 
* The move feature and other actions are now discoverable in Vector, thanks to a label for
the dropdown where they're hidden by default (bug 44591).
* Specify default language on a per-page basis
* Redirect to Special:UserLogin when logging is in required to proceed, instead of showing
an error message
== Performance ==
In 2014, MediaWiki development has a new focus on frontend performance.
* (bug 39035) Improved Vector skin performance by removing collapsibleNav, which used to
collapse some sidebar elements by default. This removes -list id suffixes like
p-lang-list: instead of using things like #p-lang-list, you can do #p-lang .body ul. If
you would like CollapsibleNav back please use the CollapsibleVector extension.
==Upgrade notices for MediaWiki administrators==
=== Breaking changes ===
* Upgrade jQuery to version 1.11.x: [[mailarchive:wikitech-l/2014-June/076842.html]]
* Support for register_globals (deprecated 5 years ago) was dropped, MediaWiki will no
longer run with it enabled.
* {{!}} is now a magic word that results in |, mainly for use in templates and other
complex templates. If your wiki has another template at Template:!, you will need to
change the name and update any usage of it. If your Template:! is just |, it can be safely
deleted.
=== API changes === 
Starting with MediaWiki 1.24, we're cleaning up the API, and working towards an API
2.0. See the roadmap for more details.
* Rarely used formats deprecated: dbg, dump, txt, wddx, yaml. These may be removed in a
future release.
* Token handling overhauled: the action=tokens module is now deprecated and replaced by
action=query&meta=tokens. Most actions now just take a generic "csrf" token,
and the token type is now properly documented in the auto-generated documentation.
* And more! See the RELEASE-NOTES-1.24 file for a full list.
=== Directory changes ===
* The legacy '''skins/common/''' directory has been emptied and
deleted as part of the skin system cleanup. Files that have been present in it have been
moved elsewhere or deleted (if they were unused). If you loaded any of these files as part
of your custom skin or on-wiki CSS/JS, you should make a copy of the old files in a
non-MediaWiki directory. See the RELEASE-NOTES-1.24 file for the full list of
moved/deleted files.
=== Browser support deprecated or removed === 
* Full support for Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7  has been removed: it will
browse MediaWiki without JavaScript. JavaScript fixes specific to it have also been
removed. Additional IE6  and IE7 fixes that exist in MediaWiki:Common.js and similar can
be safely removed.
=== Skins no longer loaded after upgrade? ===
MediaWiki 1.24 no longer uses the skin autodiscovery mechanism to load default skins,
instead requiring that the skins be manually loaded in LocalSettings.php, much like
extensions (see [[Manual:Skin configuration#Installing skins]]).
This will require you to update LocalSettings.php after the upgrade - a prominently
displayed warning message should guide you through the process, suggesting the exact
configuration that you need to add. If you're upgrading via a tarball release, that is
all you need to do. If you're upgrading via git or otherwise from source, note that
the skins themselves have been each moved to a separate repository and will need to be
installed separately (much like extensions, some basic ones are included in the tarball).
=== Composer ===
If you are using extensions managed by composer, make sure to backup your existing
composer.json file as it will be overwritten on upgrade.
