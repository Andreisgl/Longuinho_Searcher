It differentiated education based on whether or not the participant had received other, formal information technology training. It examined the relationship between information technology training and information system security effectiveness through the intervening variables of information system security experience, information system security selfefficacy, information system security task initiation, and information system security task persistence. The study found that systems librarians with prior information technology training were more effective at implementing information system security than those without.

It differs from cyber harassment in that performative hactivism is politically motivated.We found that there are contagion and other social effects among hactivists and that hactivism exhibits feature patterns that define them as subcultures. To conduct our research, we created a provocative Website and blog and then promoted it on the Internet. Using sentiment analyses and logistic regression, we identified features associated with performative hactivism. We then studied the blog remarks and used Website analytics to gain a better understanding of the implications for business security. The results from this work should help business and information security researchers (especially in social engineering), as well as business practice managers, strategists, and security analysts, to predict the lifecycles and impacts of hactivism on their operations and assist them in the creation of interventions.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
