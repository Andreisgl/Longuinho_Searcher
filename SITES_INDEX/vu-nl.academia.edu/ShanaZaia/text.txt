Everything Must Go: Consequences of State Projects and Controlling the Levant for the Eanna Temple (591-590 BCE)Altorientalische Forschungen 48.1,  2021This paper presents a study of YOS 17, 360, a collection of 30-33 administrative records from the... more This paper presents a study of YOS 17, 360, a collection of 30-33 administrative records from the Eanna temple in Uruk that are dated to Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur (Nebuchadnezzar) II's 14th year. The first few columns contain transactions concerning gold, while the rest are largely related to prebendary payments. In addition to providing an edition of YOS 17, 360 and related texts, this study seeks to understand why these particular transactions were collected and what insight it gives us into the historical circumstances. The evidence suggests that Eanna experienced a financial crisis at this time, during which it sold off its assets and had difficulties paying its priests. The cause of the crisis seems to have been royal demands put on the temple to provide money and manpower in support of the king's building and/or military endeavors, possibly including Babylonian movements into the Levant and resulting clashes with Egypt.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Using four case studies, this paper analyzes situations in which priests are accused of misconduct or crimes to better understand the powers and expectations of individual priestly offices as well as the realities of everyday life that might have rendered these boundaries more flexible or surmountable. These cases of irregularities reveal that cul-tic personnel had distinct economic, legal, and judicial roles and were sometimes able to extend their powers when necessary to manage issues such as crime and shortages in resources, only requesting royal intervention as a last resort.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Previous Assyrian rulers who had control over Babylonia were recognized as kings of both polities, but Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's father, Esarhaddon, had decided to split the empire between two of his sons, giving Ashurbanipal kingship over Assyria and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn the throne of Babylonia. As a result, Šamaš-šuma-ukīn is an intriguing case-study for how political, familial, and cultural identities were constructed in texts and interacted with each other as part of royal self-presentation. This paper shows that, despite Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's familial and cultural identity as an Assyrian, he presents himself as a quintessentially Babylonian king to a greater extent than any of his predecessors. To do so successfully, Šamaš-šuma-ukīn uses Babylonian motifs and titles while ignoring the Assyrian tropes his brother Ashurbanipal retains even in his Babylonian royal inscriptions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Aššur and His Friends: A Statistical Analysis of Neo-Assyrian Texts (JCS 71, 2019)by Tero Alstola, Shana Zaia, A.

The present article applies social network analysis to an electronic corpus of 1,532 texts to study the god Aššur and his position in divine networks in the Neo-Assyrian period. Our results show that the performance of social network analysis can be improved by using a small window size and calculating tie strengths with pointwise mutual information. This allows us to study the co-occurrences of gods in semantic contexts. From a network perspective, Aššur is not a very central god in our corpus despite his importance in Assyrian royal theology, but he rather joins the existing networks of gods without altering them. Available at https://doi.org/10.1086/703859 and https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/a%C5%A1%C5%A1ur-and-his-friends-a-statistical-analysis-of-neo-assyrian-text.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Martti Nissinen & Leena Vähäkylä (toim.), Kiveen hakattu? Pyhät tekstit ja perinteet muutoksessa. Helsinki: Gaudeamus, 2018.by Elisa Uusimäki, Mika Pajunen, Miika Tucker, Gina Konstantopoulos, Shana Zaia, Jason M.

Tekstien muutoksiin ovat vaikuttaneet myös kulttuuriset ja yhteiskunnalliset muutokset, esimerkiksi väestönsiirrot, kaupunkien tuhoutumiset sekä erilaisten kulttuuriperinteiden kohtaamiset ja sulautumiset.Kiveen hakattu? raottaa pyhien tekstien historiaa ja teksteihin tehtyjä perusteltuja ja dokumentoituja muutoksia vieden samalla pohjaa fundamentalismilta. Esimerkiksi Raamatun muuttumattomuus on illuusio: vanhat käsikirjoitukset ovat aina olleet erilaisia sekä kokoonpanoltaan että sisällöltään. Muinaiset tekstit ovat suodattuneet meidän aikaamme lukuisten kirjureiden ja kääntäjien kätten kautta.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
