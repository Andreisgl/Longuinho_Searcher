These factors will address issues of pedagogy and interaction (e.g. how can actors be used to structure a learning session in virtual environments) rather than underlying technological concerns (e.g. the suitability of particular computer graphics rendering techniques). This paper focuses on issues concerning the elicitation of requirements for the development of the framework.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersTowards a user-centred method for studying CVLEs2000 • Daphne EconomouDownload Free PDFView PDFUser centred virtual actor technology2001 • Daphne EconomouDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Network and Computer ApplicationsProblem driven CVE technology development2002 • Daphne EconomouDownload Free PDFView PDFA Component-Oriented Approach for Mixed Reality Applications2004 • Michael HallerAbstract This chapter introduces a component-oriented approach for developing mixed reality (MR) applications. After a short definition of mixed reality, we present two possible solutions for a component-oriented framework. Both solutions have been implemented in two different MR projects (SAVE and AMIRE). The first project, SAVE, is a safety training system for virtual environments, whereas the goal of the AMIRE project is to develop different authoring tools for mixed reality applications.Download Free PDFView PDF…  Future Interactive SystemsAn agent-based architecture for virtual environments for training2004 • Angélica de AntonioDownload Free PDFView PDFPersonal and Ubiquitous ComputingUser experience evaluation of human representation in collaborative virtual environmentsNektarios GeorgalasDownload Free PDFView PDFUsability of technology supported social competence training for children on the Autism Spectrum2011 • Sue CobbWe present the results of two usability studies evaluating the use of collaborative technologies designed to facilitate children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) learning social competence skills through technology-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The first study examined a co-located games (Join-In Suite) run on a multi-user tabletop shared active surface (SAS). The second study collaborative virtual environment (CVE) designed to support understanding and practice of social conversation skills. Both prototypes were developed following a participatory design process that included focus groups of occupational therapists and teachers as well as children with ASC. Usability studies were then conducted where occupational therapists used the systems for social competence training during a single one hour session with pairs of children with high functioning ASC, aged 9–13 years. Outcome measures included two usability questionnaires, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and interviews with the children. Therapists' responses to the System Usability Scale were also recorded. Results for SAS and CVE prototypes showed great enjoyment of the games, preferences amongst them and proficient use of the technology. For both technologies, the collaborative nature of the activities appeared to be effective in leveraging the engaging power of computer games as well as capturing a level of ecological validity which is often not sufficiently present in computer games alone.Download Free PDFView PDFCoDesignVosinakis, S.
