The specific continuum model used to develop and analyse the YouTube case study is the Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (CHCM). Research outcomes include: •Multiple interpretations of the CHCM and extension of continuum understandings of online cultural spaces. •Presentation of a new cultural heritage continuum model titled: Mediated Recordkeeping: Culture-as-evidence. •Interpretation of the Information Continuum Model (ICM) to support research design and knowledge generation. •Presentation of a continuum-influenced Research Design ModelThis research is significant to the archival discipline as it addresses a gap in the research and theory concerning the applicability of continuum theory and continuum models in an emergent, complex social phenomenon as it exists in online cultural heritage. This research also demonstrates that continuum theory can be applied to research design, opening up possibilities for a more critical, inclusive and participatory model for community-based and tools-oriented research in archival science.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Mediated Recordkeeping model was developed from a deep understanding of continuum informatics and as a result of an exploration into the numerous and simultaneous transactional and evidential processes involved in the creation, use and value of cultural expression on YouTube. The Mediated Recordkeeping model challenges and extends continuum informatics, and presents a framework for understanding memory-making and recordkeeping as a node in a pluralized network. The opportunity this model presents is for heritage and memory institutions to connect, collaborate and facilitate an active, participative shared memory-making network that is diverse, yet inclusive of multiple narratives, including those that are dispersed, hidden and incommensurate.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Testing the continuum: user-generated cultural heritage on YouTube. Archives & Manuscripts, 37 (2).The web 2.0 phenomenon has introduced new ways for internet users to interact with online spaces and content. The online culture that web 2.0 has spawned is inherently social, interactive and portable, where users create and share their own and other people’s creations across online spaces. Cultural heritage institutions have begun to collect the outputs of these social media interactions, adding them to fast-growing and often massive collections of born-digital culture. However, the captureand organisation of web 2.0 cultural production by institutions is actioned with website archiving models of practice. These practices do not take into account the complexity inherent in social media as continuously re-created cultural production.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Book chaptersExploring Social Complexity: Continuum Theory and a Research Design Model for Archival ResearchResearch in the Archival MultiverseApproved chapter submission for Research in the archival multiverse - forthcoming
Over the past ... more Approved chapter submission for Research in the archival multiverse - forthcomingOver the past 25 years, archival science as a field has grown in volume, sophistication, and construction. Of particular interest are trends in archival research focusing on communities and their archival needs, as well as the broader social issues that impact these communities. How might a researcher conceptualise and account for their position within the research project? How might the researcher design the project in a way that balances the needs and interests of communities and those of the researcher? In response to such questions, this essay describes a model for reflexive research design based on continuum theory. Utilising a case study exploring the social media platform YouTube, this essay presents a research design model that emphasizes continual and iterative reflection on the part of the researcher before, during, and after the processes of research. The purpose of the model is to provide the researcher with a tool for construction, to help design the plan, approach and goals of a research project, to draw out potential research methods, methodologies, tools and community knowledge through an interwoven and non-linear development process. The model addresses complexity in developing research projects across disciplines and stakeholders by providing a means to understand or “see” the mix of contexts brought to and created as a result of research. The model is an outcome of the YouTube case study research I performed, but is also part of it as working with it played a significant role shaping the research as an ongoing process.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This means to engage with multiple methods, practices and actions to identify and make sense of what is significant, including most of all, active and continuous engagement with all kinds of people at all aggregations who undertake and are interested in memory-making and their role in it. This raises questions about whether it is ethical at all to document or manage any records without consent or allowing them to have an active, collaborative role in the processes including decisions about access, rights and description over time. In building the model I began to see more clearly the role of facilitation as an active role that acknowledges that archives and archivists shape memory.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Web archiving raises several major and complex challenges for archives,including how to conceptualize web contents and formats, how to preserve content and make it accessible in a meaningful way, and how to design and deliver policy and processes to identify and support the creation, selection and management of a cultural heritage archive.In this poster I show something of how information continuum theory helps to explore interconnected and complex dimensions and systems of information and heritage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The internet and in particular, social media, allows people to create, keep and share memory in pluralized spaces, playing the accidental role of archive. But these systems are not designed for preservation. Yet, to preserve these interactions serious intervention is required that dis-embeds and ruptures the structure, content and context: the essence of constructing evidence and memory. For memory institutions interested in preserving social media this means the rich and idiosyncratic complexity of the online experience and its interconnectedness with people, technologies and information is lost. Further challenges faced by individuals and institutions include private, corporate ownership and control of social media systems and content. In this poster I present a proposed research project designed to explore the processes and experiences of individual memory-making online. The goal is to empower memory-making and to redefine what it means to preserve collective and shared memory. This project builds on previous work into personal memory-making and co-creation that found these interactions were not just about making and sharing content online, but also concern interaction with community. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the experiential link between personal memory-making and community interaction and how this can help inform what it means to preserve personal, community and shared memory as cultural heritage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Individuals who contribute their small stories directly participate in online culture, providing content for an exponentially expanding collection of data, information and knowledge. Traditional forms of moving image, suchas film and TV, have influenced the formats, content and look of how small stories are being told, particularly on Youtube. Formats and styles from social media have in turn, influenced traditionalmass media genres and content.As a continuum theorist, I question how these small stories might fit into the world of cultural heritage? In what contexts can these stories be understood? I wonder if there is some way tounderstand cultural heritage as it is being made? Rather than look at how archivists deal with social media from within established institutional practices, I want to investigate YouTube from acontinuum perspective to develop an understanding of the ‘archive’ and the ‘record’.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Memory-making plays a significant role in the identification of social and cultural standards, as well as values and factors that influence recordkeeping across multiple plural (and contested) memoryspaces including personal, community, collective and networked memories.In my research I saw that YouTube was an enabler, facilitator and platform of personal curation, mediation and memory-making, hence providing a space for recordkeeping that supports the ongoing use of records through spacetime - an emergent archiveThe Mediated Recordkeeping model (Figure 1) represents a framework to support the emergent archive to facilitate, enable and engage memory-making, rather than focus on selection, collection, and protection of cultural heritage within the bounds and custody of the institution.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
