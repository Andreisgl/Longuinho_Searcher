Performing Resistance: Horon and Chanted Poetry in Turkey's Transregional Environmental ActivismZeitschrift für Ethnologie /Journal of Social and Cultural Anthropology 145(2),  2020This article examines how folk dance is deployed as an innovative tool of urban and rural contemp... more This article examines how folk dance is deployed as an innovative tool of urban and rural contemporary protests in Turkey. It specifically focuses on horon, a popular folk dance genre characterised by the eastern Black Sea region and popular across the country. I investigate how environmental activists transregionally circulate the genre during their coordinated protests in the city of Istanbul and the Rize province against a massive infrastructural project called the Green Road in the summer of 2015. The project has become a symbol of the state’s forced developmentalism,violent histories of ethnic and religious minorities and capitalist dispossession, against which multiple iterations of horon seek to create solidarity, social mobilization and political participation. Ethnographic and choreographic methods guide this study to explore the dance as a complex space of physical and social interactions. Its varying aesthetics, contested meanings, and forms of reproduction and circulation provide a lens through which to discuss how protesters negotiate their identities both in horon circles and protests. The improvisational quality of horon helps merge dance, music and chanted poetry together into political action and enables urban and rural protesters to find flexible ways of resistance across the Black Sea.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Combining choreographic research and analysis with ethnography, and foregrounding interviews with activists in feminist and LGBTQI+ demonstrations, anti-emergency decree vigils, and the 2017 Presidential Referendum protests, the study discusses how dissenters undermine mobilization of violence through converting hegemonic choreographies of repression into tactical acts for resistance. Hannah Arendt’s concepts of “isolation” and “politics” are employed to examine how dissenters recast the exigent circumstances of dispersal produced by the authorities to creatively reorganize themselves and craft alternative forms of relational politics and peripheral public assemblies at times of political vulnerability. The transience of folk dance facilitates the creation of ephemeral political assemblies and fosters activists' ability to move collectively. Whenever protesters depart from folk dance groups to create new ones, they perpetually re-configure the area and initiate novel actions contingent upon their temporal and positional assessments during the dance. Such tactical applications of dispersal characterized by the smaller scale and transitory gatherings with ever-changing combinations of bodies manifest a great potential for collective agency and plural politics.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
"Education of Mothers" in Turkey: Discourses on Maternal Propriety and Neoliberal Body Politics on Motherhood"Mothering in the Age of Neoliberalism,  Nov 2013The term “neoliberal” has come to define our current global age, yet de- finitive understandings ... more The term “neoliberal” has come to define our current global age, yet de- finitive understandings of what “neoliberal” means remains a contested terrain. In the past three decades, neoliberal economic/political/social ideology has created a world governed by free-market principles. The authors of this edited collection explore the meanings and reveal the of- ten detrimental effects of neoliberalism from the perspective of mothers. Neoliberal policies and austerity measures have unequivocally al- tered the landscape of women’s rights globally, placing increasing pressure and responsibility on mothers with decreasing resources. However, while “neoliberalism” may be a global phenomenon, the particular ways in which neoliberal policies become instituted are lo- cal and contingent upon specific social/political/economic/histori- cal processes. Whether the discussion is about mothers from India using existent maternalist narratives to fight environmental deg- radation, or mothers in rural Canada struggling to find affordable, quality daycare within a gendered de-industrializing “flexible” em- ployment framework, there must be active acknowledgement for the positionality of mothers within the global neoliberal narrative. Diverse works from an assortment of geographical areas including Ni- geria, France, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, India, the UK, Australia, Canada and South Korea are represented. This col- lection provides a crucial starting point. By identifying the sources of neoliberal failure toward mothers, we can begin to collectively formu- late an alternative paradigm in which mothers voices are no longer rendered invisible, but rather predominate in the global landscape.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Ziya Azazi’s Dervish-In-Progress and contested choreographies of ‘whirling’ in TurkeyDance, Movement & Spiritualities,  2017For over a decade, Turkey has witnessed a growth in its number of contemporary Sufi communities. ... more For over a decade, Turkey has witnessed a growth in its number of contemporary Sufi communities. Some of them follow traditional religious practices held in convents. Some others detach the whirling practice from the traditional sema ceremony and perform it in cultural centres, associations and dance studios, giving new meanings to the movement and to the social and political relations tied to this practice, and constituting alternative communities based on a kinaesthetic experience of whirling. Among these, Ziya Azazi’s movement technique discerns with the performer’s emphasis on the body’s constant research in a repetitive act of spinning to find deep emotions towards the potential for trance. This article focuses on Azazi’s solo performance, Dervish-In-Progress (D.I.P.), in two different instances: The Ankara State Opera and Ballet concert in 2012 and Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park resistance in 2013. By investigating his movement technique through workshops, media footage and individual interviews, this article examines how whirling has the potential to mobilize both performer and audience towards individual and social transformation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It explores intersections between aesthetics of politics, philosophy of non-violence, and technologies of improvisation, aiming to work on artistic research while questioning the conventions of the 'artistic.' We would offer meetings in which we can discuss and put in motion terms such as violence, art of cruelty, (passive) resistance, refusal, consent, and coerced consent. Drawing on feminist scholarship, we approach non-violence as a "process, strategy, and philosophy" and a "stubborn noncooperation." We will explore questions such as, how do our bodies compete, resist, and non-cooperate and also practice forms of non-violence? The concept of "satyagraha" ("soul force"), a strength found in nonviolent embodied act, and the conceptualization of nonviolence as political and ethical power primarily inspire our questions and artistic explorations in this seminar.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
