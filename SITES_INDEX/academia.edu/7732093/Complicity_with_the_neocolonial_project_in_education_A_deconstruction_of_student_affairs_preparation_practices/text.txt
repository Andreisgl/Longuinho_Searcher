We explored linkages between Black literacies and epistemic credibility as indicators of Black mattering by analyzing 24 syllabi of foundational courses in HE/SA graduate preparation programs using Muhammad’s (2020) Historically Responsive Literacy (HRL) framework. The HRL framework is a four-layered equity framework with the following learning goals: (a) identity development; (b) skill development; (c) intellectual development; and (d) criticality. Across the four layers, we found little evidence of Black mattering in our data. To meaningfully situate Black mattering within curriculum development, we suggest instructors use their syllabus to begin unframing white supremacy and framing the curriculum with Black mattering.Download Free PDFView PDFUnderlying Paradigms in Student Affairs Research and PracticeFlorence GuidoStudent affairs professionals benefit from understanding paradigms, world-views, and ways of being among diverse faculty, staff, and students. It is challenging to understand core differences of paradigms, design student affairs practice and research in congruence with or across specific philosophies , and work effectively with individuals operating in paradigms different from our own. For most, it is more comfortable to develop practiceDownload Free PDFView PDFEDAD 925: Law and Higher Education—A Peer Review of Teaching Project Benchmark Portfolio2017 • Stephanie BondiThis portfolio documents three learning outcomes of the EDAD925 Law and Higher Education course taught Spring 2017 in the Department of Educational Leadership. The learning outcomes include (a) understanding the role of the higher education administrator within the legal context, (b) using professional standards to inform decision-making, and (c) examining social justice concepts within professional practice in the legal context of higher education. The portfolio shows what was done and how students demonstrated learning on the outcomes. The portfolio includes suggestions of how to better address the three learning outcomes.Download Free PDFView PDFStudent-Centered Transformative Learning in Leadership Education: An Examination of the Teaching and Learning ProcessDan  Tillapaugh, Paige Haber-CurranInnovative and learner-centered approaches to teaching and learning are vital for the applied field of leadership education, yet little research exists on such pedagogical approaches within the field. Using a phenomenological approach in analyzing 26 students’ reflective narratives, the authors explore students’ experiences of and process of learning within a student-centered and inquiry-focused leadership capstone course. The process of this transformative learning experience is represented in five themes, which include the following: (1) challenging mental models of learning, (2) building trust, (3) finding freedom and empowerment, (4) deepening commitment to learning, and (5) reframing learning and self. Additionally, the students’ approach to learning changed throughout the course, shifting from dependence/independence toward interdependence. Implications for the use of this pedagogy and areas for future research are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal on Excellence in College TeachingInvestigating the Development of Graduate Students' Multicultural Competence in Student Affairs Professional Preparation2017 • Susan Iverson, Christin SeherGraduate programs typically provide the diversity coursework needed for students to develop the multicultural competencies necessary to fulfill their roles, yet the overall effectiveness of these educational experiences and their influence on the development of multicultural competence is unclear. This article describes a study designed to measure the impact of graduate professional preparation programs on the development of multicultural competence in graduate students enrolled in two professional preparation programs in student affairs. The authors also consider how different curricular approaches may contribute to the development of multicultural competence. Following a description of results, implications for practice and future research are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFThe International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher EducationNavigating the use of cogenerative dialogues: Practical considerations for graduate facultyNo Title2016 • Ginny BossIn this study, we explored cogenerative dialogue (cogen) as a tool for learner-centered teaching in graduate education. Cogen consists of small group dialogues among instructors and students for the purposes of improving course processes. We engaged cogen during a semester-long, graduate-level campus environments course. Using the theoretical framework of cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) and case study methodology, we explored cogen’s use in highlighting ways in which our course processes were enhanced or impeded. Our analysis resulted in the prominent themes of the role of physical space, power dynamics, and internal and external influences on the potential for learning in our classroom. We conclude by offering considerations for educators interested in using cogen in a graduate education course as a result of our study.Download Free PDFView PDFTeaching in Higher EducationLearning through personal connections: cogenerative dialogues in synchronous virtual spaces2016 • Stephanie BondiDownload Free PDFView PDFCoteaching In Science Education Courses: Transforming Teacher Preparation Through Shared ResponsibilityChristina SiryDownload Free PDFView PDFMulticultural competence for doing social justice: Expanding our awareness, knowledge, and skillsSusan IversonDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal for the Study of Postsecondary and Tertiary EducationExamining Scholar-Practitioner Identity in Peer-Led Research Communities in Higher Education ProgramsGeorge MwangiAim/Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore how research skills and communities can be promoted in student affairs and/or higher education graduate preparation programs through a peer-led, team-based model. Background: Numerous scholars emphasized a lack of empirical research being conducted by student affairs professionals, even though integration of scholarship with practice remains of critical importance to field of higher education. Methodology: Though a descriptive case study of a graduate research course, we engage both quantitative and qualitative data points in a convergent parallel mixed methods design. Contribution: This study provides an important contribution in understanding how graduate programs may better prepare students to engage within a spectrum of scholar-practitioner identity. Findings: Findings suggest that while participants see value in a scholar-practitioner identity and its impact on their future goals, there is often a discrepancy between the perc...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
