Gajda and Editors 2018: 18-31.Barbara ZającAntonino CrisàHaving defeated the Celts in northern Italy, the Romans built the Via Postumia, a vital road connecting Aquileia (east) and Genova (Genoa, west), in 148 BC. On that occasion, the Romans founded Bedriacum, a small vicus close to the present town of Calvatone (Cremona), which past and current excavations by the University of Milan are revealing as a vital centre of Roman Gallia Cisalpina (Cisalpine Gaul). Recent investigations have shed new light on coin circulation and offer fresh data to be compared with hoarding trends and old finds. The aim of this paper is to analyse the Calvatone Hoard 1942, a significant reserve of 16 Roman coins. First, the paper assesses the discovery of the hoard and its coins, dated from the second century BC to the early age of Augustus, which offer a great deal of information concerning hoarding trends in Gallia Cisalpina and contribute to greater knowledge of the history and archaeology of northern Italy. Then the essay compares the Calvatone hoard with the circulation of the coins of Bedriacum and new archaeological data from excavations.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSome considerations of the Roman coin finds in the hinterland of the provinces of Dacia and Moesia Inferior, in M.

Local police forces seized the hoard and alerted the Coin Cabinet of Brera in Milan, where the numismatist Serafino Ricci (1867–1943) evaluated and finally acquired selected coins to increase the museum collections. The “Calvatone (1911) hoard” is an essential case study in the history of Italian numismatic collections, museum studies, and archaeology. These records are particularly worth studying for two main reasons. They show how local and regional authorities dealt with casual archaeological discoveries in northern Italy during the post‑Unification period (1861–1918). They also help us to better understand how the Italian government acted to safeguard antiquities according to contemporary law, and how the state collections could be increased by judicial seizures and fresh acquisitions.Download Free PDFView PDF(Full text) Living by the coins.

It was replaced by a rural villa of Imperial Age, which was abandoned in the second half of the 4th century AD. The 70 coins which were found during the researches allowed the dating of the settlement’s phases. The aim of my paper is to submit a catalogue of a group of these coins. It shows what kind of currency circulated in a rural area of Roman Age and how the Imperial propaganda used it.Download Free PDFView PDFRBNLate Roman Coin Hoards in the West: Trash or Treasure,2007 • Antony KropffThe late third century AD yielded many Roman coin hoards in the west, and especially the hoards closing after 274 AD stand out. Traditionally, these hoards have been linked to raids and invasions during this period: the ‘troubles hypothesis’. This hypothesis presents a problem: numerous hoards are found in Britain, an area not suffering from invasions at the time. The ‘troubles’ hypothesis fails to explain the accumulation of these hoards and their geographical distribution. An alternative explanation, the ‘monetary’ hypothesis, stating that the hoarded coins were abandoned because they had been demonetized or had otherwise lost their value is also tested and rejected. Coins similar to those hoarded circulated until the beginning of the fourth century AD. The present survey proposes that the hyperinflation of the period was the main cause of the high number of hoards. The huge number of low value coins in circulation meant that more individuals had to conceal more units of coins more often. Leaving aside all possible external causes for non-recovery (invasions, war, plague etc) a certain more or less fixed percentage of non-recovery due to unexpected natural death, forgetfulness etc should always be expected. The ‘inflation hypothesis’ proposed in this survey seems to be a more probable explanation of the post-274 AD peak of hoards than the ‘monetary’ and ‘troubles’ hypotheses discussed here.Download Free PDFView PDFReview TERESA GIOVE  Pompei.
