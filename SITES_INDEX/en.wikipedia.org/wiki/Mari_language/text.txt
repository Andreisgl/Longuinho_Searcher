The Mari language (Mari: марий йылме, marij jylme; Russian: марийский язык, mariyskiy yazyk), formerly known as the Cheremiss language, spoken by approximately 400,000 people, belongs to the Uralic language family. It is spoken primarily in the Mari Republic (Mari: Марий Эл, Marij El, i.e., 'Mari land') of the Russian Federation as well as in the area along the Vyatka river basin and eastwards to the Urals. Mari speakers, known as the Mari, are found also in the Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Udmurtia, and Perm regions.
Mari is the titular and official language of its republic, alongside Russian.
The Mari language today has three standard forms: Hill Mari, Northwestern Mari, and Meadow Mari. The latter is predominant and spans the continuum Meadow Mari to Eastern Mari from the Republic into the Ural dialects of Bashkortostan, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Udmurtia), whereas the former, Hill Mari, shares a stronger affiliation with the Northwestern dialect (spoken in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and parts of the Kirov Oblast). Both language forms use modified versions of Cyrillic script. For the non-native, Hill Mari, or Western Mari, can be recognized by its use of the special letters "ӓ" and "ӹ" in addition to the shared letters "ӱ" and "ӧ", while Eastern and Meadow Mari utilize a special letter "ҥ".
The use of two "variants", as opposed to two "languages", has been debated: Maris recognize the unity of the ethnic group, and the two forms are very close, but distinct enough to cause some problems with communication.[citation needed]
Ethnonym and glottonym[edit]
The Mari language and people were known as "Cheremis" (Russian: черемисы, черемисский язык, cheremisy, cheremisskiy yazyk). In medieval texts the variant forms Sarmys and Tsarmys are also found, as well as Tatar: Чирмеш, romanized: Çirmeş; and Chuvash: Ҫармӑс, Śarmăs before the Russian Revolution. The term Mari comes from the Maris' autonym марий (mari).
Sociolinguistic situation[edit]
Most Maris live in rural areas with slightly more than a quarter living in cities. In the republic's capital, Yoshkar-Ola, the percentage of Maris is just over 23 percent. At the end of the 1980s (per the 1989 census) Maris numbered 670,868, of whom 80% (542,160) claimed Mari as their first language and 18.8% did not speak Mari. In the Mari Republic, 11.6% claimed Mari was not their first language. In a survey by the Mari Research Institute more than three quarters of Maris surveyed considered Mari language to be the most crucial marker of ethnic identity, followed by traditional culture (61%) and common historical past (22%), religion (16%), character and mentality (15%) and appearance (11%) (see Glukhov and Glukhov for details). A gradual downward trend towards assimilation to Russian has been noted for the Communist period: the 1926 census indicated more than 99% of Maris considered Mari their first language, declining to less than 81% in 1989. Some qualitative evidence of a reversal in recent years has been noted.
There was no state support for Mari language in Imperial Russia, and with the exception of some enthusiasts and numerous ecclesiastical texts by the Russian Orthodox Church, there was almost no education in Mari language. After the October Revolution, there was a period of support of all lesser national cultures in the Soviet Union, but eventually Russification returned. While the development of Mari literary language continued, still, only elementary-school education was available in Mari in the Soviet period, with this policy ending in village schools in the 1970–1980s. The period of glasnost and perestroika in the 1990s opened opportunities for a revival of efforts expand the use of Mari in education and the public sphere. In the 1990s, the Mari language, alongside Russian, was proclaimed in the republican constitution to be an official language of Mari El. By the beginning of the 21st century, Mari language and literature was taught in 226 schools. At the History and Philology Department of the Mari State University and the Krupskaya Teachers' Training Institute (Yoshkar-Ola), more than half of the subjects are taught in Mari.
Dialects[edit]
The four main dialects of Mari.   Hill Mari   Northwestern Mari   Meadow Mari   Eastern Mari
The principal division between Mari varieties is the West and the East. According to the Soviet linguist Kovedyaeva (1976:9-15, 1993:163-164) the Mari macrolanguage is divided into four main dialects:
Hill Mari, spoken mainly on the right upper bank of the Volga River around Kozmodemyansk (hence the name), but also on the left bank and in the mouth of Vetluga.
Northwestern Mari
Meadow Mari, spoken on the left Volgan bank on the central and eastern plain ("meadow") of Mari El around the republican capital, Yoshkar-Ola.
Eastern Mari is scattered to the east of Mari El from Vyatka through Kama to Ufa.
Each main dialect is divided into their own smaller local subdialects. Only Hill and Meadow Mari have their own literary written standard varieties, based on the dialects of Kozmodemyansk and Yoshkar-Ola respectively.
Eastern and Meadow Mari are often united as a Meadow-Eastern supra-dialect. Northwestern Mari is transitional between the Hill and Meadow dialects, and its phonology and morphology are closer to Hill Mari.

The schwa /ə/ and its fronted counterpart are usually transcribed in Finno-Ugric transcription as ə̑ (reduced mid unrounded vowel) and ə (reduced front unrounded vowel) respectively. The former has sometimes been transcribed in IPA as /ɤ/, but phonetically the vowel is most strongly distinguished by its short duration and reduced quality. Descriptions vary on the degree of backness and labialization.[3]
The mid vowels /e/, /ø/, /o/ have more reduced allophones [e̽], [ø̽], [o̽] at the end of a word.
Word prosody[edit]
Stress is not phonemic in Mari, but a dynamic stress system is exhibited phonetically, the stressed syllable being higher in pitch and amplitude and greater in length than an unstressed syllable. Generally, there is one prominent syllable per word and prominence may be found in any syllable of the word. Post- and prefixes behave as clitics, i.e., they do not have their own stress. For example, пӧ́рт (pört, "house") гыч (gəč, "out of") ([ˈpørt ɣɤt͡ʃ]); or му́ро (muro, "song") дене (dene, "with") ([ˈmuro ðene]).

Only in Russian loanwords, in Hill Mari also onomatopoeia and Chuvashian loanwords.
Palatalisation is marked in different ways. A ⟨у⟩ following a palatalised consonant is written as ⟨ю⟩, and ⟨а⟩ following a palatalised consonant is written as ⟨я⟩. If the vowel following a palatalised consonant is an е or an и, palatalisation is not marked at all. In other cases, the soft sign ь is used to mark palatalisation.
The modified Cyrillic letter for the velar nasal (ŋ) combines the Cyrillic letter ⟨Н н⟩ with and ⟨Г г⟩, where the rightmost post of Н is conflated with the vertical post of ⟨Г⟩: ⟨Ҥ, ҥ⟩. Although Hill Mari has this sound too, this character is only used in Meadow Mari.
In Russian loanwords and after nasals, /b d ɡ/ are voiced stops. Word-finally and before a consonant, there is free variation between voiced fricatives ([β ð ɣ]) and voiceless stops [p t k].
Phonological processes[edit]
Like several other Uralic languages, Mari has vowel harmony. In addition to front/back harmony, Mari also features round/unround harmony. If the stressed vowel in the word is rounded, then the suffix will contain a rounded vowel: for example, кӱтӱ́ ([kyˈty] 'herd') becomes кӱтӱ́штӧ ([kyˈtyʃtø], 'in the herd'); if the stressed vowel is unrounded, then the suffix will contain an unrounded vowel: ки́д ([kid], 'hand') becomes ки́дыште ([ˈkidəʃte], 'in the hand'). If the stressed vowel is back, then the suffix will end in a back vowel: агу́р ([aˈgur], 'whirlpool') becomes агу́рышто ([aˈgurəʃto], 'in the whirlpool').[4]
Declension[edit]
Like other Uralic languages, Mari is an agglutinating language. It lacks grammatical gender, and does not use articles.
Case[edit]
Meadow Mari has 9 productive cases, of which 3 are locative cases. The usage of the latter ones is restricted to inanimate objects.
Many cases, aside from their basic function, are used in other situations, such as in expressions of time.
Nominative, used for subjects, predicatives and for other grammatical functions.
Genitive, is used for possessive constructions.
Dative, the indirect object's case.
Accusative, the direct object's case.
Comitative, used when a subject or an object can be split up into parts, or in adverbials expressing the involvement of an object in an action.
Comparative, used to express the likeness to something.
Inessive, used to state where something is.
Illative, used to state where something is going.
Lative, used to express into what something is going.

^ The illative has a short form, equivalent to the long form in meaning.
If a locative statement was to be made about an animate object, postpositions would be used.
Additionally, terms denoting family members have vocative forms. These are, however, not created with a specific paradigm, and only exist in a few pre-defined cases.
Hill Mari has these cases, plus the abessive case (of the form -де), which is used to form adverbials stating without the involvement or influence of which an action happens.
Number[edit]
Mari, though an agglutinative language, does not have a separate morpheme to signify plurality. There are three particles, which are attached to the end of words with a hyphen, used to signify plural.
-влак (-vlak) – Standard plural form.
-шамыч (-šamõč) – Alternative standard plural, used in many dialects. There is no difference in meaning between these two.
-мыт (mõt) – Sociative plural. Used to signify a group of people: the members of a family, a person and their family and friends.
Possessive suffixes[edit]
Every grammatical person in Mari has its own possessive suffix.

Additional suffixes[edit]
Additional particles, falling into none of the categories above, can be added to the very end of a word, giving it some additional meaning. For example, the suffix -ат (-at), means 'also' or 'too'.
Arrangement of suffixes[edit]
The arrangement of suffixes varies from case to case. Although the case suffixes are after the possessive suffixes in the genitive and the accusative, the opposite is the case for the locative cases. In the dative, both arrangements are possible.

пӧртышкем – 'into my house'
пӧрт-влакышкем – 'into my houses'
Lative
пӧртешем – 'into my house'
пӧрт-влакешем – 'into my houses'
There are many other arrangements in the plural—the position of the plural particle is flexible. The arrangement here is one commonly used possibility.
Comparison[edit]
Comparison happens with adjectives and adverbs. The comparative is formed with the suffix -рак (-rak). The superlative is formed by adding the word эн (en) in front.
Comparative
Superlative
кугу – 'big'
кугурак – 'bigger'
эн кугу – 'biggest'
Conjugation[edit]
Morphologically, conjugation follows three tenses and three moods in Meadow Mari.
Conjugation types[edit]
In Meadow Mari, words can conjugate according to two conjugation types. These differ from each other in all forms but the infinitive and the third-person plural of the imperative. Unfortunately, the infinitive is the form denoted in dictionaries and word lists. It is, thus, necessary to either mark verb infinitives by their conjugation type in word lists, or to include a form in which the conjugation type is visible—usually, the first-person singular present, which ends in -ам (or -ям) for verbs in the first declination, and in -ем (or -эм) for second-declination verbs.
Tense[edit]
The three tenses of Mari verbs are:
Present
The present tense is used for present and future actions, for states of being and for habitual actions, among others.
First preterite
The first preterite is used to express observed, recent actions.
Second preterite
The second preterite is used for actions that are in the more-distant past.
Additional tenses can be formed through periphrasis.
First periphrastic imperfect
Second periphrastic imperfect
First periphrastic perfect
Second periphrastic perfect
Mood[edit]
The moods are:
Indicative
The indicative is used to express facts and positive beliefs. All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative. It can be formed in all persons, in all times.
Imperative
The imperative expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. It only exists in the present tense, and exists in all persons but the first person singular.
Desiderative
The desiderative is used to express desires. It can be formed for all persons, in the present tense and in the two periphrastic imperfect.
Negation[edit]
Negation in Mari uses a 'negative verb', much like Finnish does. The negative verb is more versatile than the negative verb in Finnish (see Finnish grammar), existing in more grammatical tenses and moods. It has its own form in the present indicative, imperative and desiderative, and in the first preterite indicative. Other negations are periphrastic.
The negation verb in its corresponding form is put in front of the negated verb in its second-person singular (the stem-only form), much as it is in Finnish and Estonian.

In the first conjugation, the imperative second-person singular is formed by removing the -аш ending from the infinitive. Four consonant combinations are not allowed at the end of an imperative, and are thus simplified—one consonant is lost.  кт → к, нч → ч, чк → ч, шк → ш

Syntax[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (August 2018)
Word order[edit]
Word order in Mari is subject–object–verb.[5] This means that the object appears directly before the predicate.[5] Word order in Mari is affected by information structure.[5] However, the position of the verb is not affected.[5] The focus position is directly before the verb. [5] Subjects, objects, adverbial, and secondary predicate can appear in this position.[5] The examples below quoted in Saarinen (2022)[5] show the different elements that can appear in the focus position. 
Element in the focus position
Object
Чачи корно мучко Сакарым шонен кайыш.
t͡ɕɑt͡ɕi korno mut͡ɕko sɑkɑr-əm ʃon-en kɑjə-ʃ
Chachi road end-illU Sakar-acc think-cvb go-1pst.3sg
‘Chachi walked to the end of the road, while thinking of Sakar.’
Subject
Школым мый ыштенам мо?
ʃkol-əm məj əʃt-en-ɑm mo
school-acc 1sg make-2pst-1sg Q
‘Was it I who built the school?’
Adverbial
Игече келге шыжыш тошкалын.
iget͡ɕe kelge ʃəʒə-ʃ toʃkɑl-ən
weather deep autumn-ill step-2pst.3sg
‘The weather changed to that of a true autumn.’
Secondary predicate
Мам нулевой мычаш маныт?
mɑ-m nuleβoj mət͡ʃɑʃ  mɑn-ət
what-acc zero ending say-3pl
‘Which (elements) are called zero endings?’
Question particles мо /mo/ and ма /mɑ/ are clause-final.[5]
However, Georgieva et al. (2021) point out that Mari also allows backgrounded material to occur after the verb.[6]
Example taken from Georgieva et al. (2021)[6] showing that backgrounded material can occur after the verb
məj kert-am kušt-en
1SG can-1SG dance-GER
‘I can dance (e.g. as opposed to you).
Moving the verb to other positions in the sentence is possible for stylistic reasons or for emphasis.[7]
Nominal predication[edit]
Two nouns can be put against each other to form nominal predication.[8] According to Saarinen (2022) both nouns and adjectives appear in the nominative case and do not agree with the subject in number  in nominal predication.[5] Saarinen (2022) notes that when the sentence is in the indicative mood with 3sg, a copula is not used.[5] However, a copula is obligatory and appears clause-final and in other persons, tenses, and moods.[5]
Verbal predication[edit]
Saarinen (2022) points out that the object is marked with the accusative in transitive clauses.[5] However, the object can appear in the nominative case in non-finite constructions.[5] When the clause is ditransitive, the direct object appears in the accusative case and the indirect takes the dative case.[5] However, Saarinen (2022) notes that in dialects and with verbs such as йӱкты- /jyktə-/ ‘water’ and пукшы- /pukʃə-/ ‘feed’ both objects appear in the accusative case.[5]
Some common words and phrases[edit]
Observation: Note that the accent mark, which denotes the place of stress, is not used in actual Mari orthography.
