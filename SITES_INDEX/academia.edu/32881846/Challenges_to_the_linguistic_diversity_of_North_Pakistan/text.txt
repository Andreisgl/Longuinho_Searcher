Some of these languages are Khowar, Shina, Indus Kohistani, Torwali, Gawri, Palula, Kalasha, Dameli, Gawar-bati, Bateri, Chilloso, Dumaki, Brushaski, Ushojo, Balti, Wakhi, Yidgha et el. They are the known indigenous languages spoken in northern Pakistan. All of these languages are ‗endangered‘ according to the UNESCO‘s Atlas of the World‘s languages in danger. These languages are endangered because of a number of challenges the languages and their speakers face. Crucial among these challenges are lack of political organization, marred identities, no written tradition, and marginalization, globalization, especially the rule of dominant languages over these languages, rough terrain, poverty and so forth. The aforementioned cultural, political, linguistic and ecological milieu adds to the ‗language and cultural loss‘ among these communities. Notwithstanding the toughest challenges, there are some good initiatives carried out in these communities that are focused on reversing the language and cultural loss by documenting the languages and cultures in question, transmitting the languages and cultures to the coming generation; and by trying to make the languages relevant in pedagogical setting. This study explores the challenges and threats faced by these communities along with the few good initiatives carried out by individuals and organizations for the documentation, preservation and promotion of these languages.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLokaratna Vol-VIII ff Journal of Folklore Foundation, IndiaTeachers' Attitude and Belief in Use of L1 in ESL Classroom2015 • Subhasis NandaDownload Free PDFView PDFFolklore Foundation Managing Trustees Dr MK Mishra, Director TrusteesSadanand MeherDownload Free PDFView PDFLokaratna An  E   journal of   Folklore   Foundation, India Dr.Mahendra K U M A R Mishra, Tatyana  Fedosova, Ivy Hansdak, Krishna Kbs, Subhendu Mund, Ruth Z HauzelThis volume is contributed by the eminent folklorists across the globe.

B. Yeats, who realized the strength and significance of their Irish literary and folk tradition to galvanize the Irish people’s penchant for complete freedom. The Gaelic folk tradition and literature were exploited to the highest artistic degree in the form of ballad, elegy, songs, speeches, vision poems, ethnographic accounts, and plays with an intention to be used as literary crusaders against the protestant English colonizers whose aim was to convert and colonize the Irish Catholics. For the first time, Irish nationalism became tinged with Gaelic colour due to increasing incorporation and representation folk heroes and heroines in nationalist literature in Ireland.Download Free PDFView PDFCV  Hemanga DuttaDr. Hemanga DuttaDownload Free PDFView PDFLokaratnaBinti: Re-Thinking Santal Identity through the Creation Myth2019 • Nandini TankSantals are one of the highly significant and well-studied tribes of India which belongs to ProtoAustoroid community. (Guha, 1944). Creation myths of Santals revolve around the creation of the world from the perspective of cosmology. Since the creation myths of santals are of human civilization, it is important to look at the genesis of oral narratives on creation to trace the historiography of the Santal tribe and their culture. At this juncture, most of the tribal communities have been listed as endangered (Census 2011); scholars of humanities and social sciences in the contemporary scenario have started focusing on studying and preserving the tribal languages and cultures in India. There have been several translations of the santal literature, scholarships such as W.H.Archer’sThe Blue Groove, SitakantMahapatra’sThe Awakened Wind: The Oral Poetry of the Indian Tribes. The scholarship has been focusing to locate and validate the tribal literature as a genre. Santals are rich in oral narratives such as songs, poems, and stories on cultivation, nature, marriage, and festivals but there is a lack of knowledge about the dawn of human civilisation among the tribal scholarship. Since tribal community have come in contact with several amalgamations of the colonial penetration, Hindu institution of idol worship, Christian missionaries, and the dawn of technological advancement, it is important to be aware of one’s root in order to conquer the identity conflict among the tribals. There are several variations on the Santal creation myth, particularly in the process of telling, retelling and sharing across generations and shifting socio-cultural environment. The study seeks to move backward to the inception of the world as believed by the Santal tribe, focusing on Binti, literally translated as ‘prayer’ or ‘plea’, a song of cosmology, generally recited by a group of three or more singers at marriage ceremonies. This study primarily examines the creation myth called ‘Binti’, documented and translated into English by Sitakant Mahapatra in his work ‘The Awakened Wind: The Oral Poetry of the Indian Tribes’ focusing on re-stabilizing tribal identity and analyses the Santal folklore tradition, oral narratives as performative arts and creation myths in translation from the aspect of ethnic culture and its significance among Santals. The paper also focuses on the historiography of the Santal world view and Santal culture.
