[MediaWiki-announce] Maintenance release: 1.31.10 / 1.34.4

The 1.31.10 and 1.34.4 versions fix the issue with the backports in the
1.31.9 and the 1.34.3 releases.
The patches linked here need applying on top of the previous patches for
1.31.9 and 1.34.3. See the previous email for those patches. The full
downloads here contain all the previous fixes from the security and
maintenance release.
1.35.0 will still be released tomorrow.
Once again, I apologise for the inconvenience of the issues with the
previous release.
