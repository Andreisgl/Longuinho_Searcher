Technology of iron anchor-frame production in the Age of Exploration, in A. Crespo Solana et al. (eds.), 2022, Heritage and the Sea (Volume 2), pgs. 273-295Heritage and the Sea (Volume 2): Maritime History and Archaeology of the Global Iberian World (15th–18th centuries),  2022It is evident that iron anchor-frame sizes and construction undergo considerable changes in the s... more It is evident that iron anchor-frame sizes and construction undergo considerable changes in the second millennium CE into the Age of Exploration. Their construction changes from baton-assembled or laminated-beam to lone-bar then bundled-bars construction. Although numerous complex factors are involved, it is suggested that the most significant factor was the inclusion of waterpower, and its successive development, for iron production technology. These developments allowed for a dramatic increase in size and weight of anchor frames. This enhancement in nautical technology should be considered a significant factor resulting in the increasing sizes of vessels and unprecedented capacity of nautical activity resulting in and facilitating, globalization.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A set Archaic anchor arm exposed within P. oceanica matte at Klazomenai/Liman Tepe, Turkey: A contribution for understanding marine stratigraphy. Journal of Field Archaeology 41.6: 671-683 (2016)by Hayat Erkanal, Gregory F Votruba, and Michal ArtzyExcavation in Posidonia oceanica matte in the ancient harbor of Klazomenai/Liman Tepe, on the Aeg... more Excavation in Posidonia oceanica matte in the ancient harbor of Klazomenai/Liman Tepe, on the Aegean coast of Turkey, demonstrates the stratigraphic archaeological potential of underwater excavation. Among the finds is a fractured wooden anchor arm exposed in situ. The anchor arm dates to approximately 600 B.C. based on stratigraphically associated ceramics, a dating supported by radiocarbon. The arm was found embedded in this marine sediment, which preserved the arm in its set position within the ancient sea floor. This archaeological excavation through matte and silt harbor sediments overturns the misconception that stratigraphic excavation is impossible in a marine environment. The excavation further boosts optimism regarding the preservation of maritime heritage along the littoral of the eastern Aegean and the many other Mediterranean regions where Posidonia oceanica grows.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Did vessels beach in the ancient Mediterranean? An assessment of the textual and visual evidence.

This paper examines the evidence for beaching and outlines the various methods, tools and technology employed. While habitual beaching for seafaring vessels is testified for the Geometric Period Aegean, for later periods the evidence is primarily negative. With the increasing robustness of the structure and weight of ships, the addition of the ram for naval vessels, and developing economic circumstances leading to the necessity of round merchant vessels, habitual beaching became impractical also in this region. In the Mediterranean, where the low tidal range practically precludes the technique of tide beaching, both galleys and merchantmen were largely restricted to anchoring and mooring.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These finds include the teeth of the arms of wooden anchors and a stone stock. This paper preliminarily reports these objects with their chronological and spatial contexts, and they are compared to finds made elsewhere. These testify that the associated submerged features likely served as moles for a harbour and that relatively large ships were mooring in its basin. These objects are further informative documentation for understanding ancient anchoring technology.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The methodology employed is holistic in synthesizing archaeological finds, textual, and iconographic evidence, and includes statistical and geographical analysis based on a substantial catalogue of ancient anchor finds. An experimental project is also included where anchor reconstructions were used in the sea and their utility tested. Mooring is one of the least studied aspects of everyday life for the people of the ancient Mediterranean. It has been elucidated that in most circumstances beaching would not have been a practical option, even for warships and the smallest cargo vessels. Rather, vessels were equipped with specialized gear for mooring off or near undeveloped shores. This included ship's boats enabling access to the shore. Lower draft vessels, particularly galleys, could approach unbuilt shores and employ mooring stakes and cables, and the ship's landing-ladder would be deployed into shallow water. Where available, however, ships would benefit from built quays which facilitated goods transport. The iron stock-anchor displays the greatest longevity of any anchoring tool, evinced as early as the 5th c. BCE, and appears to have achieved dominance over wooden types by the 3rd c. CE. From its conception the iron-stock anchor undergoes a broad range of gradual changes to its form and features. The earliest known finds take a 'V' form in the bulk-arms and gradually develop through rounded to 'T' and 'Y' forms in the Byzantine Period. The stocks evolve from removable iron types, to permanent forms entirely of wood. Reintroduction of upward-oriented arm designs from northern Europe around the 13th c. CE, and incorporation of hydraulic mechanized smithing developments, heralded a revolution of anchoring technology. Larger, stronger and more efficient anchors were being produced to standardized dimensions and quality, promoting larger ships, and ultimately resulting in novel characteristics of navigation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The three materials are 17,000 m3 of volcanic ash (pozzolana) from Puteoli, 11–14,000 m3 of timber from Seleucia Pieria, and cobblestones of unidentified origin. These materials and their importation are discussed, using past provenance analysis, new data, and historical and logistical considerations. The pozzolana and timber importation demanded dozens of transport ships, and is evidence of the sophistication of the construction of Sebastos Harbour and the efficient organization of the Mediterranean under Augustus’ control.© 2007 The AuthorSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
