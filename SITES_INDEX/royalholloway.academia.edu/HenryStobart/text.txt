Based on extensive fieldwork, it explores how music permeates the lives of this group of herders and agriculturalists, and how it is deeply interwoven with agricultural and social (re)production. In this harsh highland environment, persuading the earth to bear fruit is a perpetual challenge, and music emerges as an especially critical and dynamic medium; one that provides rich insights into broader social processes and values. Music and dance orchestrate the seasonal transformation of the landscape, coordinate processes of life and death, and articulate relations with outside social groups and the spirit realm. Through rich and evocative ethnography, the book delves into the powerful meanings ascribed to sound; charts unfamiliar aesthetic territories; suggests how modernity can contribute to indigeneity; and reveals remarkable musical perspectives on llama husbandry and potato cultivation. As we follow the lives, shifting fortunes and musical year of this, in many ways, fragile community, a seasonally shifting array of musical instruments, genres, dances and tunings are introduced. The book is accompanied by an audio CD, photographs, musical transcriptions and explanatory diagrams.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

What has happened to Ethnomusicology during this time? Do its theories, methodologies and values remain rooted in the 1970s and 1980s or has it also transformed? What directions might or should it take in the new millenium? With contributions from a number of key figures in Ethnomusicology and related disciplines, this volume explores Ethnomusicology’s shifting relationship to other disciplines and to its own ‘mythic’ history, and plots a range of potential developments for its future. It also considers perspectives on Ethnomusicology from ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ the ‘discipline’, and its broader contribution and relevance beyond the academy. In a period of particular dynamism and intense technological change, when Music departments, in the UK at least, are increasingly opening their doors to Ethnomusicologists, and valuing the types of skills and approaches they offer, such reflection is particularly timely. In many respects, this volume also offers a European perspective; one that provides some interesting and refreshing contrasts from the North American discourses and institutional dynamics that have tended to dominate Ethnomusicology since the 1950s.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They explore how digital media -- whether on CD, VCD, the Internet, mobile technology, or in the studio -- have transformed and become part of the fabric of Indigenous cultural expression across the globe. Communication technologies have long been tools for nation building and imperial expansion, but these studies reveal how over recent decades digital media have become a creative and political resource for Indigenous peoples, often nurturing cultural revival, assisting activism, and complicating earlier hegemonic power structures. Bringing together the work of scholars and musicians across five continents, the volume addresses timely issues of transnationalism and sovereignty, production and consumption, archives and transmission, subjectivity and ownership, and virtuality and the posthuman."Music, Indigeneity, Digital Media" is essential reading for scholars working on topics in ethnomusicology, Indigeneity, and media studies while also offering useful resources for Indigenous musicians and activists. The volume provides new perspectives on Indigenous music, refreshes and extends debates about digital culture, and points to how digital media shape what it means to be Indigenous in the twenty-first century.Contents Thomas R.

Drawing on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in Bolivian contexts, the authors read the gender-marked status of this initiative as a symbolic site of intercultural disjunctures. Conflicting gender politics sit at the crux of this difficulty to assemble ‘women's singing’ as a heritage object, contradictions between Bolivia’s persistent neoliberal state in which feminist discourses of gender equality reign within a development apparatus, and a plurinational state that originally emerged from social movements that brought Indigenous concepts into governing practices. Expanding on the topic of gender in heritage studies, this work points to critical applications of intersectionality, and uncovers useful openings that this concept lends to heritage studies in general. Through an intersectional lens, key inconsistencies are revealed between a liberal feminist agenda that focusses on empowering stand-alone women and Indigenous working class women’s mobilisation politics that cannot address gender inequalities without also engaging class and ethnic marginalisation. The case study shows how social justice mobilisations, central to political intersectionality, productively disrupt the compartmentalised approaches to rights that usually operate in bureaucratised governing entities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These dilemmas were central to the dialogues of Coroico 2012, a workshop we organized in Bolivia and whose methodologies and conversations are detailed in this website.  In addition to reading about these dialogues, we encourage you to download, modify, and reuse the materials we designed and structured for use in Coroico 2012, particularly the agenda, case studies, and related glossary. We share these materials in the hope that they will spark more conversations, local debates, and necessarily distinct responses to these dilemmas.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Ringing Rocks and Roosters:  communicating with the landscape in the Bolivian AndesSound and Anthropology: body, environment and human sound making,  2008https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/soundanth/work/stobart/
Through examining the stories people told t... more https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/soundanth/work/stobart/ Through examining the stories people told to explain the origin of the bell stones (rumi campana), found on the hill above their homes in a hamlet in the rural Andes, this paper seeks to explore local conceptualisations of sound. How is sound thought to be generated, contained or communicated? Does the notion of ‘sound’ have a linguistic or ontological equivalent in the local language (Quechua)? These local stories lead us to approach sound as a form of energy, which depends upon a sense of dynamic tension between notions of containment and release - shaped by the metaphor of the body and its cycles of life and death. The emergence of sound from within informs the auditor of the existence of another being, and the sound quality communicates knowledge about, for example, the being’s inner state, needs, and relative power or status. But bodies, like rocks, can – and at times must – hold their silence and store or accumulate energies for future production/expression – where containment and release are closely connected with moral values and the very existence of life. Such values and attitudes to ‘sound’, powerfully shape this Andean community’s interactions with the environment and underscore its musical performance practices. Access online on Sound and Anthropology website: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/soundanth/work/stobart/Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The spread of cassette recorders in the 1970s; the introduction of analogue and digital video formats in the 80s and 90s; the pervasive availability of recycled computer hardware; the global dissemination of the internet and mobile phones in the new millennium: all these have revolutionised the access of previously marginalised populations to the cultural flows of global modernity. Yet this access also engenders a pirate occupation of the modern: it ducks and deranges the globalised designs of property, capitalism and personhood set by the North. Positioning itself against Eurocentric critiques by corporate lobbies, libertarian readings or classical Marxist interventions, this volume offers a profound postcolonial revaluation of the social, epistemic and aesthetic workings of piracy.

Rozo Lopez, Henry Stobart, and Juan CorderoLas ideas que pretendo compartir en esta oportunidad se organizan de la siguiente manera: primero... more Las ideas que pretendo compartir en esta oportunidad se organizan de la siguiente manera: primero, sintetizo muy brevemente una serie de problemas identificados en el ámbito del Arte y la Cultura en Bolivia, principalmente en lo concerniente a la necesidad dereconocimiento social, el ejercicio de derechos y responsabilidades ciudadanos y la distinciónque podríamos reconocer, tanto entre las figuras de ‘artista’ y ‘cultor’, cuanto entre las de‘cultura viva’ y ‘bienes culturales’; distinciones éstas que vale la pena repensar frente al rol quehoy en día están cumpliendo las instituciones que gestionan los esquemas de Derechos deAutor y Propiedad Intelectual, hoy vigentes en nuestro país. A partir de ello, si bien buscopuntualizar algunas limitaciones que emergen desde las normas y procedimientos que estos dosesquemas muestran hoy en día con relación a los pueblos indígena, los datos que presentosugieren que dichas limitaciones probablemente no son muy distintas a las que enfrentan lasculturas urbanas dentro del territorio nacional. Sobre esa base, haciendo algunos atisbos sobrelo que sucede en otras partes del planeta, propongo algunas conclusiones y sugerencias quedirijo tanto a los Consejos Departamentales de Culturas, como también a todos quienes deseenarmar una posible agenda colectiva de trabajo, crítica y constructiva, entorno a estos temas.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Del indigenismo al patrimonialismo: Una introducción al dossier sobre música y patrimonio cultural en América Latinaby Richard Mújica Angulo and Henry StobartTRANS-Revista Transcultural de Música/Transcultural Music Review 21-22,  2019Además de señalar lo que vienen en los artículos de este dossier, esta introducción presenta a lo... more Además de señalar lo que vienen en los artículos de este dossier, esta introducción presenta a los lectores cierta orientación con respecto al "patrimonio inmaterial," su relación con la música, y sus significados en contextos latinoamericanos. Se parte del planteamiento que el patrimonio no es igual que la cultura y que el patrimonio se tiene que construir a partir de la conciencia de la idea de "la cultura" (entre comillas) que surge en los viajes inter-étnicos (Carneiro da Cunha, 2009). Mientras el patrimonio inmaterial parece tener más relación con los hechos musicales, se exploran las diferencias, no ontológicas sino políticas, entre el patrimonio material e inmaterial. El patrimonio inmaterial resulta ser como el Otro de los patrimonios y esto marca desigualdades que se replican en las instituciones administrativas. A pesar de las iniciativas de UNESCO, a través de su centro regional CRESPIAL a través de lo cual se promocionan los listados multi-nacionales del patrimonio cultural inmaterial, los procesos de hacer patrimonio varían ampliamente en América Latina. También suelen reflejar competencias locales o nacionalistas, donde el declarar patrimonio podría ser concebido casi como una alternativa a la propiedad intelectual. A pesar de lo sonoro de las expresiones musicales, se plantea que los cambios mundiales en los medios de comunicación contribuyen a un énfasis en lo visual; entonces discusiones sobre los hechos musicales patrimonializables muchas veces van por lo visto y no por lo escuchado. En relación a cuestiones regionales, planteamos que lo que llamamos el patrimonialismo en muchos países de América Latina es algo muy integral al momento neoliberal y multicultural, pero que también hay que entenderlo como la etapa subsiguiente y por ende vinculada, aunque diferenciada de las políticas estatales del indigenismo del siglo XX. En el patrimonialismo del siglo XXI, los Otros están motivados a utilizar sus propias "culturas" como recursos potenciales de extracción, como posibles caminos al desarrollo y/o como nuevas maneras de reivindicar una serie de derechos. Al cerrar, se consideran los papeles de las pericias y los estudios académicos en el patrimonialismo.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
