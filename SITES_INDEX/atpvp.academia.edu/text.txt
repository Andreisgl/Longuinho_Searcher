The contributions are structured around three thematic sections, all contributing towards a new and interdisciplinary understanding of what the sea as an environment and the pursuit of seafaring meant for Late Antique societies. Part 1 looks at the practicalities of tackling the sea as an environment for purposes of travel, trade, and warfare. Part 2 engages with the questions of seaborne communications networks and islands as the characteristic hubs of the Mediterranean environment. Part 3 broadens this view with an exploration of the Mediterranean as an environment with great metaphorical and symbolic potential. Throughout the volume, the editors and contributors have maintained an emphasis on a multidisciplinary, broad-angled understanding of the Late Antiquity’s human interactions with their environments – built, natural, and imagined alike. Perhaps more than any other type of environment (equaled perhaps only by mountains), the sea has been understood as immovable to a proverbial degree, and indeed as often been envisioned as an entity wholly indifferent to the concerns of humanity. The sea was an exception and a limit to civilization, and that can be perceived on the conceptualizations of phenomena such as shipwrecks, symbolizing the dichotomy of the safe land and the ungovernable sea. Yet it was the sea’s capability of moving – both through actual mobility and through such emotions as fear, hope and pity – that formed one of the primary means of conceptualizing its significance to the Late Antique societies.In particular, we feel that understanding the role of environment for ancient societies and culture should be pursued across a range of themes, allowing us to discern diachronic trends and continuities. The significance of the sea for both the concrete mobility of goods, people and ideas, as well as the usefulness of the sea as a metaphor and conceptual, occasionally heterotopic, space both elucidated through an approach that looks at the Mediterranean as an environment, and takes appropriate note of the most recent scholarship. Moreover, this volume will benefit from the use of the theoretical approach of the spatial turn that is a theoretical approach that places emphasis on space and place in disciplines linked with social sciences and the humanities. While never ignoring the fact that we are temporally (as well as environmentally) bound beings, during the past few decades, the use of this approach in different fields of7study has increasingly emphasised the importance of spatiality in understanding the history of the human being and of its relation with the environment. The subject is challenging, because it demonstrates that space is no longer a neutral concept and cannot be considered independent from that which it contains, and therefore neither can it be considered as immune to historical, political and aesthetic changes. Ideas of the reciprocal causal relationship between subjects and their environments have been common currency in spatially oriented disciplines (e.g. archaeology. geography, history, urban studies. This sort of approach can help set forth more nuanced theories regarding the relation between social systems and their environment - in this case, with the maritime cultural landscape – using case studies and methods applied in different disciplines such as archaeology, classics or history.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Contributions in edited volumesCondemning Mobility: Nativist and Exclusionist Rhetoric in the Second-Century "Sophistic" Discourse on Human MovementMediterranean Flows: People, Ideas and Objects in motion,  2023[Uncorrected author proofs: for reference purposes, please consult the final published version]
... more [Uncorrected author proofs: for reference purposes, please consult the final published version]This chapter explores the ways in which human movement and group membership were debated in the second century CE, primarily among the Greek authors influenced by the cultural phenomenon of the 'Second Sophistic'. It examines, in particular, their expressions of unease at the thought of "Hellenic" identities being diluted as the result of population movements within the empire, as well as the occasional dismissal of such fears. These ideas were enabled by the widely diffused set of theoretical structures that all encouraged the perception of population groups as having essentialistically defined and largely unchanging-though corruptible-characteristics. Turning this human variety and the empire's internal mobility into a tool in moralizing debate was an option that several writers within the sophistic movement took up. After discussing the epistemic basis for such nativist rhetoric, the chapter focuses on three particular cases: Polemon of Laodicea's Hellenic chauvinism, Favorinus of Arles' rejection of nativism while upholding essentialising patterns of thought, and Herodes Atticus' allegorically replete anecdote on the rural strongman Agathion as preserved in Philostratus' Lives of the Sophists.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its aim is to provide some insights into the ways in which the visible phenotypic differences between the inhabitants of the Later Roman Empire could be turned into a tool for moralising polemic and essentialising argumentation about both neighbours and strangers. It will discuss how a set of mostly fourth-century CE authors directed their diagnostic gaze not only at individuals but also at the multiplicity of the empire’s subject peoples and groups beyond its borders in pursuit of a variety of rhetorical and polemical purposes. These could range from the simple character-assassination of their competitors to formulating strategies for the continued survival of the empire. Such operations seem to have assumed the existence of a fairly widely shared knowledge base that was framed in terms of physiognomical analogies. By examining Late Antique physiognomical texts in their cultural and literary context, it may be possible to garner evidence for this ‘commonly-known’ or proverbial epistemic base about the supposed properties of different peoples and what evidence it might offer regarding the segregating and integrative speech acts that the ‘visually other’ denizens of the Later Empire had to navigate. In pursuing these questions, this chapter will first discuss the epistemology of ancient physiognomy, as well as its second-century heyday, which formed an important background to the late-imperial popularity of the theory. Next, I will discuss the techniques of segregating and integrating individuals and entire population groups by their looks in later-imperial texts ranging from physiognomical treatises themselves into such works of historiography as Ammianus Marcellinus’ Res gestae. Finally, concluding reflections on the epistemic, social and cultural dynamics at play are offered.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Physiognomy, ekphrasis, and the ethnographicising register in the Second SophisticVisualizing the Invisible with the Human Body: Physiognomy and Ekphrasis in the Ancient World,  2019This chapter seeks to study ethnicised physiognomical descriptions or ekphraseis of both individu... more This chapter seeks to study ethnicised physiognomical descriptions or ekphraseis of both individuals and entire population groups, primarily during the High Empire. Traditionally, physiognomical ekphraseis have been examined through the three epistemological fields where physiognomic arguments are thought to be particularly naturalised: philosophy, medical writings, and rhetoric. There is, however, at least one broad literary and ideological register that extends over andbeyond these domains, yet in which physiognomising gestures are frequent: ethnographical writing.Ekphrastic techniques, for their part, were embedded in the ways in which the Greek and Roman elites communicated about their world. From their early schooling onwards, they were trained in the verbal representation of objects and agents, with plausibility – however commonplace – and vividness as the declared aims. Ethnicised exemplars were commonly used as part of such rhetorical strategies, and they were often presented in common-sense, proverbial guise: as such, they did not aim to convey new information to the audience, but to trigger and evoke the 'already-known'. Thus, I choose to call such ethnically tagged but widely shared views as 'ethnographicising' instead of 'ethngoraphical'. I will seek to show in this article that the empirical claims of ancient physiognomical rhetoric, combined with the anecdotal and wholly stereotypical exempla used therein, produced jointly a powerfully essentialising discourse on the ethnic subjects of the empire.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Forging the Feel of Ancient Ethnography in Pseudo-Jerome's "Cosmography of Aethicus Ister"Animo Decipiendi.

Neither was there an original text by a pagan sophist “Aethicus” behind the Cosmography. Some parts of the Cosmography might be considered parodies rather than forgeries, but in the absence of any secure reconstructions of its intended audience even this must remain conjectural.  On the whole, the approximation of ethnographical “feel” has been created in the Cosmography from almost the same set of texts that we have at our disposal. Isidore (always used without naming him) and Orosius are the primary sources for the ethnonyms, but Solinus and the Alexander matter are also behind some elements. By seeking to recreate and magnify the “epistemic rush”—complementing textual involution—that was part of the ancient ethnographicizing discourse, the Cosmographer explicitly set out to forge an example of a dis-course that by his time was associated with an earlier period of literature. Combining classical and biblical corroborations for his ethnographic inventions and creatively expanded lists allowed the Cosmographer to forge a style that he believed harked back to previous centuries. The resulting Late Antique feel, with church fathers and pious bishops pruning out the pagan wisdom traditions of self-important philosophers, heretics abounding, and a measureless world of strange peoples stretching out all the way until the Apocalypse, must have become a part of the Cosmographer’s aims at some stage—even if these aims mutated as his bold creation took shape.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Against Hope? The Untimely 'Elpis' of Northern BarbariansHope in Ancient Literature, History and Art. Ancient Emotions I. Eds. G. Kazantzidis & D. Spatharas; De Gruyter, Berlin & Boston,  2018This paper looks at the portrayal of northern barbarians’ aspirations from three interconnected a... more This paper looks at the portrayal of northern barbarians’ aspirations from three interconnected angles: first, the hopes for a rebirth or an afterlife that certain northern peoples were supposed to harbour; then, what seems like their yearning or greedy hope for plunder or land; and lastly, their hope for a revenge or reversal. Finally, I will briefly look at how the Greeks and Romans imagined the hopes of the barbarians failing – the turning of hope into hopelessness – as well as the literary conventions and epistemic regimes that buttressed such reversals. The sources used range from the Hellenistic to the Imperial era, but they are unified by their joint technique of projecting affectively or emotively formulated expectations onto the barbarian outgroups of Europe in order to explain their behaviour. For the most part, barbarians were perceived to have internally valid grounds for their hopes – meaning that ‘madness’ or ‘foolishness’ as a characteristic of barbarian action was for the most part used as a metaphor, not a diagnosis of a pathology. In addition to being involved in emotively oriented causation, ‘mindreading’ the barbarians plays a natural role in emotionally charged ingroup communication. By tying the ancient discourse on barbarian hopes and aspirations into the broader ethnographical register, I wish to contribute to the study of the Greek and Roman emotional responses to their encounters with outgroups, as well as to demonstrate how perceptions of intentionality could be elided, in such contexts, with the ascription of collective emotions to outgroups. It is suggested that in the Greek and Roman thinking, hope was for the northerners an unreasonable and untimely expectation of a favourable but often immoral outcome, liable to be revealed as a misidentified or mistimed attempt. By looking at the hopes and hope-like expectations ascribed to the barbarians, it may be possible to discern that in addition to being treated as an emotion – with all the causations this implies – hope could also be debated as a cultural standard, and even used as a help for conceptualising the spread of rationality within the humankind.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This traumatic episode had reawakened imagery of the northern enemies penetrating the “Wall of Italy,” which in some cases went all the way back to the Mid-Republican narrative traditions of the Gallic Invasions and the much more frequently debated shock of Hannibal’s invasion. The significance of this imagery continued evenbeyond the Augustan era, so that remnants of the same Roman insecurity about the “Wall of Italy” being breached, especially by northerners, are preserved in narratives about later Julio-Claudians such as Caligula and Nero. This article first looks at the likely origins of the idea of the Alps as the “Wall of Italy” in Middle-Republican perceptions, projected back onto the past and presenting Rome as predestined to dominate Italy and the Gauls in particular as external intruders in the peninsula. Next, the Late Republican and Augustan stages of the motif isreviewed, and the impact of the Cimbric Wars on this imagery is debated. Finally, there will be brief discussion of anecdotes found in Tacitus and Suetonius aboutlater Julio-Claudian episodes in which the fear of a northern invasion breaching the Alps seem to have gripped the Romans.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The two hermeneutical professions of μάντις and γραμματικός both aim at elucidating the thought (διάνοια) involved in the interpretandum. This is a notion quite frequently made at one level or another in ancient literature, as evidenced for example in writings by Plato, Crates of Mallus, Aristarchus, Cicero, Nigidius Figulus, and Sextus Empiricus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By projecting an image of an ata-vistic rustic mass of religiously substandard commoners, who moreover were unable to participate constructively in most kinds of religious acculturation, the episcopal hierarchy of Gaul was able to tap into a powerful source of legitimacy for their privileges. These chains of utterances, examined through the acta of church councils and synods and compared with hagiographical writing, gained plausibility from their very participation in a literary tradition of ethno-graphicising expositions of subaltern religiosities. By studying techniques of vicarious memory ascription, knowledge ordering, and both intra-and inter-generic enrichment of ecclesiastical texts, I hope to provide some new angles into the Gallo-Roman and Merovingian ecclesiastical writing on lower-class religiosity, which is too often read as a straightforward reflection of conversion processes among the general population. It is suggested that in some historical contexts, socially unequal memory-ascriptions made within conversion narratives can usefully be examined through comparisons with colonial subaltern studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Physiognomy, ekphrasis, and the ethnographicising register in the Second SophisticVisualizing the Invisible with the Human Body: Physiognomy and Ekphrasis in the Ancient World,  2019This chapter seeks to study ethnicised physiognomical descriptions or ekphraseis of both individu... more This chapter seeks to study ethnicised physiognomical descriptions or ekphraseis of both individuals and entire population groups, primarily during the High Empire. Traditionally, physiognomical ekphraseis have been examined through the three epistemological fields where physiognomic arguments are thought to be particularly naturalised: philosophy, medical writings, and rhetoric. There is, however, at least one broad literary and ideological register that extends over andbeyond these domains, yet in which physiognomising gestures are frequent: ethnographical writing.Ekphrastic techniques, for their part, were embedded in the ways in which the Greek and Roman elites communicated about their world. From their early schooling onwards, they were trained in the verbal representation of objects and agents, with plausibility – however commonplace – and vividness as the declared aims. Ethnicised exemplars were commonly used as part of such rhetorical strategies, and they were often presented in common-sense, proverbial guise: as such, they did not aim to convey new information to the audience, but to trigger and evoke the 'already-known'. Thus, I choose to call such ethnically tagged but widely shared views as 'ethnographicising' instead of 'ethngoraphical'. I will seek to show in this article that the empirical claims of ancient physiognomical rhetoric, combined with the anecdotal and wholly stereotypical exempla used therein, produced jointly a powerfully essentialising discourse on the ethnic subjects of the empire.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Forging the Feel of Ancient Ethnography in Pseudo-Jerome's "Cosmography of Aethicus Ister"Animo Decipiendi.

Neither was there an original text by a pagan sophist “Aethicus” behind the Cosmography. Some parts of the Cosmography might be considered parodies rather than forgeries, but in the absence of any secure reconstructions of its intended audience even this must remain conjectural.  On the whole, the approximation of ethnographical “feel” has been created in the Cosmography from almost the same set of texts that we have at our disposal. Isidore (always used without naming him) and Orosius are the primary sources for the ethnonyms, but Solinus and the Alexander matter are also behind some elements. By seeking to recreate and magnify the “epistemic rush”—complementing textual involution—that was part of the ancient ethnographicizing discourse, the Cosmographer explicitly set out to forge an example of a dis-course that by his time was associated with an earlier period of literature. Combining classical and biblical corroborations for his ethnographic inventions and creatively expanded lists allowed the Cosmographer to forge a style that he believed harked back to previous centuries. The resulting Late Antique feel, with church fathers and pious bishops pruning out the pagan wisdom traditions of self-important philosophers, heretics abounding, and a measureless world of strange peoples stretching out all the way until the Apocalypse, must have become a part of the Cosmographer’s aims at some stage—even if these aims mutated as his bold creation took shape.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Against Hope? The Untimely 'Elpis' of Northern BarbariansHope in Ancient Literature, History and Art. Ancient Emotions I. Eds. G. Kazantzidis & D. Spatharas; De Gruyter, Berlin & Boston,  2018This paper looks at the portrayal of northern barbarians’ aspirations from three interconnected a... more This paper looks at the portrayal of northern barbarians’ aspirations from three interconnected angles: first, the hopes for a rebirth or an afterlife that certain northern peoples were supposed to harbour; then, what seems like their yearning or greedy hope for plunder or land; and lastly, their hope for a revenge or reversal. Finally, I will briefly look at how the Greeks and Romans imagined the hopes of the barbarians failing – the turning of hope into hopelessness – as well as the literary conventions and epistemic regimes that buttressed such reversals. The sources used range from the Hellenistic to the Imperial era, but they are unified by their joint technique of projecting affectively or emotively formulated expectations onto the barbarian outgroups of Europe in order to explain their behaviour. For the most part, barbarians were perceived to have internally valid grounds for their hopes – meaning that ‘madness’ or ‘foolishness’ as a characteristic of barbarian action was for the most part used as a metaphor, not a diagnosis of a pathology. In addition to being involved in emotively oriented causation, ‘mindreading’ the barbarians plays a natural role in emotionally charged ingroup communication. By tying the ancient discourse on barbarian hopes and aspirations into the broader ethnographical register, I wish to contribute to the study of the Greek and Roman emotional responses to their encounters with outgroups, as well as to demonstrate how perceptions of intentionality could be elided, in such contexts, with the ascription of collective emotions to outgroups. It is suggested that in the Greek and Roman thinking, hope was for the northerners an unreasonable and untimely expectation of a favourable but often immoral outcome, liable to be revealed as a misidentified or mistimed attempt. By looking at the hopes and hope-like expectations ascribed to the barbarians, it may be possible to discern that in addition to being treated as an emotion – with all the causations this implies – hope could also be debated as a cultural standard, and even used as a help for conceptualising the spread of rationality within the humankind.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Breaching the Alps: the Roman Idea of the "Wall of Italy" from the Republic to the Augustan EraHistory in Flux,  2021The Roman preoccupation with the Alps as the 'tutamen' (safeguard) of Italy owed its epistemic im... more The Roman preoccupation with the Alps as the 'tutamen' (safeguard) of Italy owed its epistemic immediacy to a much more recent event—the Cimbric Wars (113-101 BCE). This traumatic episode had reawakened imagery of the northern enemies penetrating the “Wall of Italy,” which in some cases went all the way back to the Mid-Republican narrative traditions of the Gallic Invasions and the much more frequently debated shock of Hannibal’s invasion. The significance of this imagery continued evenbeyond the Augustan era, so that remnants of the same Roman insecurity about the “Wall of Italy” being breached, especially by northerners, are preserved in narratives about later Julio-Claudians such as Caligula and Nero. This article first looks at the likely origins of the idea of the Alps as the “Wall of Italy” in Middle-Republican perceptions, projected back onto the past and presenting Rome as predestined to dominate Italy and the Gauls in particular as external intruders in the peninsula. Next, the Late Republican and Augustan stages of the motif isreviewed, and the impact of the Cimbric Wars on this imagery is debated. Finally, there will be brief discussion of anecdotes found in Tacitus and Suetonius aboutlater Julio-Claudian episodes in which the fear of a northern invasion breaching the Alps seem to have gripped the Romans.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The two hermeneutical professions of μάντις and γραμματικός both aim at elucidating the thought (διάνοια) involved in the interpretandum. This is a notion quite frequently made at one level or another in ancient literature, as evidenced for example in writings by Plato, Crates of Mallus, Aristarchus, Cicero, Nigidius Figulus, and Sextus Empiricus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By projecting an image of an ata-vistic rustic mass of religiously substandard commoners, who moreover were unable to participate constructively in most kinds of religious acculturation, the episcopal hierarchy of Gaul was able to tap into a powerful source of legitimacy for their privileges. These chains of utterances, examined through the acta of church councils and synods and compared with hagiographical writing, gained plausibility from their very participation in a literary tradition of ethno-graphicising expositions of subaltern religiosities. By studying techniques of vicarious memory ascription, knowledge ordering, and both intra-and inter-generic enrichment of ecclesiastical texts, I hope to provide some new angles into the Gallo-Roman and Merovingian ecclesiastical writing on lower-class religiosity, which is too often read as a straightforward reflection of conversion processes among the general population. It is suggested that in some historical contexts, socially unequal memory-ascriptions made within conversion narratives can usefully be examined through comparisons with colonial subaltern studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With all the accruing understanding of the tradition of ancient ethnographic writing, a critical eye must be cast at a contribution so often postulated as unsurpassed in its influence. In this article, I submit the texts usually taken as Posidonian fragments to a reading informed by recent advances in the study of knowledge ordering (e.g. in eds. König & Whitmarsh 2007), information generation 'on the middle ground' (Woolf 2011), and the interplay of Greek writers and Roman audiences (Clarke 1999). There existed a wide range of interlocking 'middle grounds' which the ethnographical writers of the Late Republic navigated, even when they pursued goals to which ethnography was wholly subservient – as ancient ethnography nearly always was. Rather than being a record of his personal observations and meetings with Gauls, to a much greater extent the northern ethnography of Posidonius was constructed through literary processes based on his reading and his conversations with Romans and Greeks.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In sources ranging from the Hellenistic to the Imperial era, novelistic narratives taking their cue from the register of lighter literature—with its emphasis on pathos, cultural difference, and romantic themes—feature several barbarian characters, characterised as ‘Celts’ or ‘Galatae’, who act according to a code of conduct that was constructed purposefully as barbarian, archaic, and alien. This set of motifs I venture to call the trope of ‘Celtic justice’. While almost certainly devoid of historical source value to actual judicial cultures of Iron Age Europeans, neither are these references mere alterité. Instead, their relationship with other literary registers demonstrate the literariness of certain modes of thought that came to inform the enquiry of Greek and Roman observers into the Celtic northerners. Their ostensibly ethnographical contents emerge as markers of complex textual strategies and vibrant reception of literary motifs. While lacking ‘anthropological’ source value, these texts demonstrate the variety and intensity with which the contacts between Greeks and Celts affected the epistemic regime of the Mediterranean societies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In discussing these dynamics, I am focusing on these writers’ narrativization and causal explanations around the migration and settlement of ‘Gothic’ groups into the Roman empire. Greeks and Romans had long sought to explain such processes of mobility, but it is worth examining whether the closer and more intertwined relations between Romans and non-Romans in the Late Antiquity led to any deepening of how much ‘mindreading’ was directed at the hopes of outgroups. ‘Mind-reading’ outgroup hopes may well have been an increasing concern to the historiographers of the Later Roman Empire, and it will be worth examining whether they might offer evidence for either an entrenchment or a broadening of the received Roman modes of perceiving outgroup volition and futurity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet a hitherto unexplored aspect of these fascinating and rich passages is the emotional charge that is clearly present in each of them, though subtly manipulated by the writers to serve their more particular points in each context. Holy groves were also a longstanding part of the Roman religion, but during the troubled mid-first century CE, the sacred sites of northern peoples – located at least in the realms of imagination in wooded surroundings – the groves of Gauls (in the case of Lucan) and those among the Germani and Britons (in Tacitus) tend to emerge as compellingly (and perhaps compulsively) elaborated loci horridi.Reading the Lucanic (Bell. civ. 3.399-425) and Tacitean (Germ. 39; Ann. 1.61; 14.30) passages on Gallic and Germanic holy groves and bringing them into conversation not only with other relevant passages by the same authors but also with the modern theories of the ‘history of emotions’, I hope to cast new light on the role that natural loci horridi of the northern ritual space played in shaping Roman collective anxieties. These, I will argue, had much to do with the imperial power’s anxieties about the loyalties of their northern subjects and ostensible allies, as well as about the capacity of certain types of imagined landscapes to symbolise atavistic religion and resistance to Roman domination. ‘Fear’ is certainly one of the emotions evoked by these landscapes, but I hope to show that this blanket category covers a remarkable emotional range in these passages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Resources for these innovations included the tradition of Delphi’s preservation from the alleged Persian attack, the already-existing imagery from ethnographies of northern peoples, ideas about divine epiphany, and some mythistorical narratives such as the brigandage of Orchomenian Phlegyans. The different Hellenistic polities, dynasties and koina had widely differing motives for their use of the Delphic sanctuary as a conceptual hub for narratives of barbarian hubris and the defence of Hellas, but what is common to all is the creative reapplication of existing knowledge base that had connections to either the spatial, ritual or mythical aspects of Apollo’s sanctuary.This paper will discuss Delphi’s role as an ideological and epistemological hub for Greek and Roman barbaromachic narratives from the Galatian invasions until the Late Republic. Many of the literary sources from the most fertile, Hellenistic period of innovations are fragmentary in nature, but enough has been preserved for us to draw some conjectures about the different uses that the Galatian attack was put to among the Greeks and even in inter-cultural communication. As the ‘new universal barbarians’ (Marszal 2000, 222), Galatae/Galli offered a common template for ancient debates on identity, belonging, piety, ritual, and Hellenicity. The paper will also propose that Delphi may have been instrumental for the Roman adoption of the ethnonym Galli as a common name tag for their North-Italian adversaries. The epistemological anchoring of Roman elite’s barbaromachic posturing on Delphi is clearly visible in the literary and epigraphic sources.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The literary topoi of gentes vagaeMy paper examines a pair of interconnected but apparently quite distinct literary topoi – in them... more My paper examines a pair of interconnected but apparently quite distinct literary topoi – in themselves reflecting a set of influential stereotypes – encountered in Greek literature about foreign peoples on the move. Firstly, the 'gentes vagae', groups of indelibly nomadic barbarians, could be explained to have adopted this subsistence pattern through either climatic or cultural reasons (physis or nomos), but very often the power of the inherited ‘Scythian’ paradigm was so powerful that there was no need to aetiologise their incessant wandering.Secondly, the so-called 'gentes fugaces', who only truly emerge in the literary tradition after the invasions of the Galatae, but some of the causative reasons for these peoples’ enforced mobility may stem from slightly earlier, when Aristotle and Ephorus were both referring to northern groups having to deal with oceanic inundations. This theme was later taken up as a proposed reason for the Cimbric migrations, though Posidonius, for one, had none of it. For him – and his Roman patrons – the idea of Cimbri as marauding bandits was a powerful delegitimating theme. This points out to the way that the topoi of fugax gens and gens vaga could be swapped if need be; a given author’s polemical or other agendas could recommend one or the other model – such as in the case of Polybius’ “Scythicized” Celts.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The question I will be approaching (even if very tentatively) is whether such considerations can be singled out in our ancient Greco-Roman sources. If identities are both expressed and read as symbols of human beings’ belonging, as one recent study (Ehala 2018) would have it, the obscuring of the signal (or signifier) part of outgroup identities – the visual signs that are cues to (stereotypical) assumptions of the meaning (signified) part of the identities – could threaten the ingroup’s power to identify and distinguish subaltern groups. In the context of an imperial state with plenty of evidence for cultural and phenotypic variance for its urban denizens – such as the Roman Empire – the dominant group could conceivably be motivated by the perceived loss of groupiness (their own and those of subaltern outgroups) to reinforce the distinctness of identities supposedly threatened by mobility. Increased subaltern mobility, then, can be perceived by the cultural insiders of the empire as leading to a crisis in governability, and hence be portrayed as a negative thing.My paper suggests that in some cases of the High-Imperial material – perhaps particularly those aligned with the interests of the ‘Second Sophistic’ – we are seeing indications of Greek authors either expressing or reacting to fears about increased mobility threatening the distinctiveness of group identities in the Empire. Another potentially relevant concept may be the ‘narratives of reverse colonization’ (Arata 1996, 255-56): if an empire poses, in some ways, a challenge or even a threat to the identity of the imperial people, then mobility within the empire is the lived, structural vector of this threat. This has been theorised very well in the case of the fin-de-siècle European literature produced in the colonising societies of France and Britain, but there is perhaps some heuristic value in seeing whether this might apply to the case of the Roman Empire and its dominant – though interwoven – Greek and Roman identities. In the case of the Greeks, the complex ideas relating to Greek identity/-ies during the Second Sophistic seems even to have cast the Roman rule as an example of ‘mobility of the others’.A presentation given at the conference "Mediterranean flows: People, ideas and objects in motion", held online by Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies on 10-11 December 2020.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Breaching the Alps – Late-Republican Romans and the Idea of the ‘Wall of Italy’Given at the international online conference 'The (Im)Penetrable Barriers. Borders and Migrations... more Given at the international online conference 'The (Im)Penetrable Barriers. Borders and Migrations in History', Juraj Dobrila University of Pula, Croatia, on 17 Oct 2020.Although the Livian narrative of Hannibal’s crossing is the most famous one of the Late-Republican expressions given to the historical exempla of breaching the Alps, the Roman preoccupation with the Alps as the tutamen of Italy owed their epistemic immediacy to a much more recent event – the Cimbric Wars. This traumatic episode had reawakened imagery of the northern enemies penetrating the ‘Wall of Italy’, which in some cases went back all the way to the Mid-Republican traditions of the Gallic Invasions. Much more demonstrable, however, are the way in which this very theme was back-projected into earlier historical threats, and the enduring significance of this imagery even during the Augustan era. Remnants of the same Roman insecurity about the ‘Wall of Italy’ being breached, perhaps especially by northerners, are even preserved in the historians of later Julio-Claudians, such as Caligula and Nero.My paper will first look at the likely origins of the idea of Alps as the ‘Wall of Italy’ in the Middle-Republican back-projections of the predestined nature of Rome’s dominance within Italy and the role of Gauls, in particular, as an external intruders in the peninsula. Next, the Late Republican (broadly, but not solely, ‘Livian’) stage of the motif is reviewed, and the impact of the Cimbric Wars (113-101 BCE) on this imagery is debated.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Pity the Barbarian? Empathising with Outgroup Displacement and Emigration in Late Antique HistoriographyDoes Late Antique historiography ever imagine barbarian groups that have left their homelands as ... more Does Late Antique historiography ever imagine barbarian groups that have left their homelands as feeling themselves displaced – and are their motivations, hopes and fears empathised with? Ancient rhetoricians and writers could certainly, when the occasion demanded, empathise with barbarian hopes: while often described as ill-grounded and ultimately futile, it was mostly granted that they acted upon reasoning that seemed rational to themselves – though not necessarily to the Greek or Roman insiders. Setting out of one’s own original home region was imagined to be an act of trust even among outsider groups, and Late-Imperial authors such as Dexippus and Ammianus Marcellinus seem to imply that from a group of people at the mercy of Fate, a degree of opportunism was only to be expected. This is particularly prominent in the case of contemporary groups, whose motivations could have featured higher in the minds of the Romans than those of past historical outgroups.What do these pieces of the ancient evidence actually allow us to say about the extent of empathy with emigrants and displaced groups in the Late Roman society? They are of course highly partisan pieces of rhetoric, but by definition their arguments needed to have some sort of basis on their audiences’ expectations. My paper offers a set of cases where, by close-reading the texts and relating them to both the ancient theories about emotions and the ancient historiographical tradition, we can uncover some of the dynamics at play. Rhetorical pathos and descriptions of dramatic peripeteiai all played their part in shaping these vignettes; in addition to this, the topos of a gens vaga or a people on the move was already a well-established motif. Overall, however, even with the myriad techniques of ‘othering’ that we see characterising the Late Antique writing about outgroups, the possibility of evoking empathy even towards displaced barbarians seems to have been recognised by Roman historians.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Polemics of Late-Antique Physiognomical Argumentation. Difference and Essentialism in an Empire of PeoplesLate Antiquity witnessed the ancient world’s third great proliferation of physiognomical argument... more Late Antiquity witnessed the ancient world’s third great proliferation of physiognomical argumentation and theory-building, following the two previous ones in the early-to-middle Hellenistic period and the High Roman Empire of the first half of the second century CE. It was during this latest stage that the physiognomical work of Polemo of Laodicea, a rhetorician and physiognomist of the second century, was translated into Latin by an anonymous writer and excerpted by the ‘iatrosophist’ Adamantius of Alexandria. Ammianus Marcellinus, too, demonstrates a clear interest in physiognomical inferences, both in terms of individuals and entire peoples. This paper will first review briefly the evidence for Late-Antique physiognomical order of knowledge as it applied to entire peoples. The rest consists of a sample of case studies from Adamantius’ Physiognomica, the anonymous Latin De physiognomonia, and Ammianus Marcellinus’ ethnographical sections. Through them, it will be demonstrated that even within the intensely networked and multicultural Later Roman Empire, purported phenotypic distinctions between population groups were rhetorically emphasised in order to put forward physiognomical arguments. This also sustained the image of a ‘more perfect empire’ ruling over a triumphalistically displayed diversity of humankind. The associated physiognomical rhetoric gave free rein to arguments whereby the unitary, ‘perfect’ Greek physiognomy was used as a standard against which all the other peoples of the empire (and the world) were compared – and found wanting. This essentialized diversity could also give rise to arguments (as in Ammianus) about an ‘utilitarian plurality’, where each subaltern population could serve the enduring Roman wor(l)d-power in a particular role according to their ‘ethnic’ characteristics.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I will focus on the possible local informants of those Romans who, according to our literary sources (e.g. Pliny, Suetonius), rooted out the Druidic rites from Gaul. How did a Roman administrator recognize the forbidden ‘Druidic’ parts of Gallic ritual life? Who acted as the subaltern middlemen for the Romans in this process, and did they have any influence on the direction of the Roman gaze? This paper seeks to explore whether we might be able to use colonial analogies, particularly from British India, to aid us in distinguishing the knowledge-generation practices of the Roman administrators in the Early Imperial religious ‘middle grounds’ of Gaul.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We need to keep in mind the option that the author was neither Christian nor pagan – inasmuch as such religious affiliations existed in any monolithic way, at all – but belonged to the possibly very sizable portion of the population for whom it was expedient (or sufficient) to remain respectful of all cults and wisdom traditions. The author’s enthusiasm and loyalty seems to be devoted to the flow of goods, services and local specialities in the imperial network, into which the presence of the emperor(s) created notes of particularly heightened intensity. Yet I might want to hold back from decisively judging the writer’s identity as that of a ‘merchant-geographer’; it might be better to understand the network aspects of Expositio as an ‘archival’ ordering principle which was reinforced by contemporary texts – and possibly even by maps.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rhetorical techniques such as outcasting, polarising the mob’s alleged motives, allegations of partisanship, and explaining unrest through generalised, sometimes ethnicised arguments will all be in evidence. I will not be able to draw many firm or final conclusions, but would rather like to offer broader reflections on two episodes which to me seem worth of further study in the given context. In both cases it appears that outcasting of either social or ethnicised nature is at work.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The cases are those of the Res gestae of Ammianus Marcellinus and the Cosmographia Aethici of ‘Pseudo-Jerome’. At the first glimpse, there is barely anything linking these two texts, beyond the fact that both are written in a Latin that is idiosyncratic to say the least. There are, however, some interesting commonalities between my two texts today – and they come particularly to the fore when attention is paid to the way both Ammianus and Pseudo-Jerome handle the theme of barbarian sages and the pagan wisdom tradition – the ‘alien wisdom’ of Arnaldo Momigliano. One important shared aspect is that both of these writers inhabit a doubled role in-between paganism and Christianity. In some ways, the Cosmographia is trying to conjure up the world that Ammianus operated in, but from a Merovingian point of view.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Essentially, the Cosmography is a prosimetrum text of indefinable genre  by an unknown author, with some ties to Southern English monastic centres and Irish learned tradition but possibly writing in Northern Italy or Merovingian Francia  – a writer pretending to be Saint Jerome engaged in producing an expurgated breviarium of a text originally written by a pagan philosopher Aethicus several centuries prior to Jerome’s time, indeed before Christ (72). This ‘Aethicus’ is said to be a ‘Scythian’ from (H)Istria (2), but whether this means the city of Histria in Scythia Minor, by the Black Sea, or the Istrian peninsula of the Adriatic, seems to fluctuate within the text.  Today I would like to examine, however briefly, the ways in which the Cosmographer manipulates his inherited religious polemics and imagery of pagans. Basically, only a handful of scholars has studied the Cosmographia in the past forty years, and there is much to be said about the ‘ethnographicising gestures’ therein, as well, but today will be about religion. Essentially, the themes of religion and ethnography circumscribe the basic ambiguity of the Cosmography, its fine balancing act between tongue-in-cheek narrative of marvels and a pessimistic, even quasi-apocalyptic reflection on the limits of human knowledge. I think what will emerge will demonstrate the many instances of irony and subversion in the treatment of Aethicus’ supposed material – but also reveal the limits of seeing this text as entirely devoid of seriousness.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

But why was the religious past of the provincial groups still ‘good to think with’ in the second or third centuries of the empire? What were the primary aims for writers in a wide variety of genres and registers as they referred to the religious practices and antiquities of provincial – essentially subaltern – groups in an ‘ethnicising’ fashion? What difference did the spread of Christianity, with its strong and exclusionary religion-based but occasionally ‘ethnicised’ identity, make?My paper will focus upon the Roman discourse that sought to portray the provincial groups as ‘remembering’ their pre-Roman pasts even in the context of the High and Late Empire. Memory of the past cults and heroes could, on occasion, be portrayed as a holding of grudge towards the Romans, and some uprisings in the provinces seem to have been imagined to have strong religious, even millenarian, motivations. Generally, however, the empire of peoples, regions, and practices was much more useful for rhetorical or knowledge-ordering purposes if its varietas could be maintained – but for this purpose, it was necessary to relegate the provincials to their ‘ethnic’ roles, about which centuries-earlier material could still be circulated. Such a mind-set is essentially colonial, and thus amenable to readings informed by Subaltern Studies, but it can usefully be studied from the point of view of the Greco-Roman tradition of religious ethnography – or perhaps more aptly ‘ethnographicising outgroup religiosities’. This is the particular ‘relocation of religion’ that my paper explores.The portrayal of what provincials ‘remember’ about their past displays even broader linkages when bearing in mind that during the second and third centuries the concept of religious communities as an ethnos became a more widespread notion – partly through the increasing Judeo-Christian influence, as well as the recirculation of originally Hellenistic ideas about ‘barbarian wise men’. Both inside and outside the empire, peoples’ religious practices and antiquities were suspended in a rhetorical state of ahistoricity, while the only religious change imaginable was the inexorable progress of Christianity’s linear time. For the pagan writers, on the other hand, exploration of the religious traditions of their own past or those of the far-away foreign groups’ supposed present (as in the case of the Brahmans) appeared as an attractive, prestige-building option.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Ethnographicising' Arguments between the Second-Century GenresThis paper studies the ways in which – and the aims for which – ‘ethnographicised’ information or... more This paper studies the ways in which – and the aims for which – ‘ethnographicised’ information or topoi are wielded across differing second-century genres in the Greek- and Syriac-speaking East. The paper’s source texts represent four second-century authors (Polemo of Laodicea, Claudius Ptolemy, Lucian of Samosata, and Bardaisan of Edessa), as well as referring to the rebuttal of Celsus by Origen, which casts interesting light upon the monotheistic doctrinal disputes within which ‘ethnicised’ themes became increasingly used during the Later Antiquity. Common to all of these texts is that they stem from the cross-pollinating exchange of ideas, theoretical structures, and rhetorical tropes which took place in the context of the Imperial Eastern Mediterranean, facilitated by common language and almost as widely shared common understanding of how ethnographical-seeming details could help to build a winning argument – no matter what the occasion. Inter-generic interactions are evident in many stages of the ancient tradition of ethnographical and ‘ethnographicising’ writing, but the often antiquarian-seeming elements about population groups that are time and again recirculated in Imperial literature have not been extensively studied in terms of their rhetorical and epistemic underpinnings. Their usefulness seems to be confirmed by their constant presence in a variety of registers, and essentialist – often physiognomic – arguments could be deployed both about individual characters and broader group characteristics alike. The orators of the ‘Second Sophistic’, represented by Polemo and Lucian in this paper, found many uses for the technique of keeping provincials ‘ethnic’ for the purposes of their own arguments. The technical literature represented by Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos – and to a certain extent the surviving evidence for Bardaisan’s Book of the Laws of the Countries – found much use for essentialist representations of provincial character(istic)s. Origen, hailing from Alexandria like Ptolemy did, demonstrates in his rebuttal of Celsus’ True Discourse (Orig. Contra Celsum) the freedom with which the supposed ‘ethnic’ antiquities of a number of peoples could be put to use in expositions which had very little to do with ‘real’ ethnography. Identities and religious affiliations are also crossed among this selection of writers in ways that highlight important dynamics (and ironies) associated with the ‘conditioned co-opting’ of provincial backgrounds into the ranks of cultural/doctrinal insiders. Lucian and Bardaisan are Syrians, but while Lucian is in many ways comparable to Polemo, a native of Laodicea, in his approach to the cultural belonging as a ‘sophist-as-Hellene’, Bardaisan has some points in common with both Ptolemy (in terms of his astrological subject matter), and Origen (in the moralising argumentation that pervades his cultural critique). Social and personal interactions become thoroughly enmeshed in some of the examples of rhetorical one-upmanship and self-fashioning involved, whether we are dealing with sophistic set-pieces or doctrinal disputes. For such agendas, the cultural and phenotypic plurality of the Empire’s provinces formed a common pool of ‘embodied knowledge’, to be used when necessary by the learned writers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In comments and conversation after the talk, Professor Olga Palagia argued very convincingly why my tentative proposal for re-identifying the bust of 'Sauromates' is unlikely. Her points, for which I am extremely grateful, outlined two serious objections, in particular: 1) the acanthus leaves of the bust's foot would seem to indicate a funeral context, and hence a dead person; 2) there is no known connection between Herodes Atticus and the likeliest find spot of the bust, the Theater of Dionysus. These are all very valid points that go against my proposal of attribution, although the first part of my paper, dealing with the Attic nativism among the sophists, the moral panic about educational mobility, and the role of the Agathion anecdote for Herodes Atticus' own self-fashioning, remains unaffected.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This does not, however, apply to all kinds of comedy – or indeed all kinds of elite writing. Yet in terms of Old Comedy – the comic plays as written Aristophanes and his predecessors during the Classical era – this characterisation feels quite apt. The comedies of this period were of course subject to some limitation and conventions stemming from their genre, but they were in constant interaction with the opinion and worldviews of a fairly broad set of (freeborn) audiences of their contemporaries. This talk seeks to kick off the web seminar series by taking a look at Aristophanes’ ways of using ethnic categories and stereotypes as a material for his comedy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It might be interesting to try and find some of the epistemological mooring points in the broader matrix of theoretical explanations about why Assyrians (or indeed Syrians) of the historiography and the commonly shared knowledge pool about early Middle-Eastern history were the way they were. It might help us also to begin to detect what degree of continuation was perceived between the Assyrians of old and the Syrians of the, say, Roman Imperial era.Within this context, it seems rather interesting and quite relevant to have a look whether the historiographical references to Assyrian figures conform with the sort of ancient explanation models that sought to categorise and explain the ‘national characteristics’ of Assyrian and Syrian groups.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

And what was the degree to which the old ethnonyms or ethnic categories remained ‘good to think with’ – or were they replaced by more recently salient group images such as those based on provinces? Today I would in particular like to focus on second- and third-century material which seems to point to enduringly essentialising characterisation of not only the ethnic groups of the empire, but also the inhabitants of the provinces. These groups, I will argue, could be on occasion treated as so many jewels in the diadem of the empire, principally valuable for their range of variation and their consequent emphasis on the qualities – perhaps even the health – of the world-empire.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Another big question, so far quite seldom explored, is the connection and position of ethnographicising gestures within and in relation to the register of technical writing in antiquity.Throughout the paper I will in particular pay attention to how the Roman administrative divisions, primarily provinces, begin in the High Imperial period to obtain a degree of ‘entitativity’ – the quality of being naturalised entities of stereotyping – and emerge as meaningful frameworks of ‘common knowledge’ instead of the previously more narrowly ‘ethnicised’ categories. This would have highlighted the already-existing Greco-Roman tendency to think about population groups in an ‘essentialising’ fashion; an ideological pattern which resulted both from inherited literary tropes and some of the most elaborate technical theory-building of the ancient world – particularly the climatological, astrological, and physiognomic ones.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Daemonum ludificationes': 'turba rusticanorum' ja kansanomaisen uskonnollisuuden konstruointi myöhäisantiikin ja merovingiajan Gallian kirkkoeliitin retoriikassa"Myöhäisantiikin ja merovingiajan gallialaisissa hagiografioissa ja kirkolliskokouksien actoissa ... more "Myöhäisantiikin ja merovingiajan gallialaisissa hagiografioissa ja kirkolliskokouksien actoissa kansanomaisen uskonnollisuuden kuva on paitsi moraaliseen paniikkiin vivahtava, myös anakronistinen sekä praksiksen että palvonnan kohteiden suhteen. Kuvastoa leimaa myös ajallinen pysähtyneisyys: varoitukset demonien ja luonnonkohteiden palvonnan akuuttiudesta eivät näytä millään tavalla vähentyneen yli kolmen vuosisadan kuluessa. Lähiluen tässä esitelmässä eräitä Gallian antikvarisoivassa kirjallisessa ilmastossa tuotettuja lähdetekstejä 400-luvulta 700-luvulle, joissa aiempi klassinen ja myöhäiskeisarillinen traditio pohjoisten kansojen uskonnollisuudesta on selvästi vaikuttanut narratiivin muotoon ja sen motiivien valikoitumiseen. Kirjallisen koulutuksensa myötä klassiset stereotypiat omaksunut kirkollinen eliitti saattoi toki kuvitella maaväestön henkisen ja moraalisen tilan teksteissään kuvaamansa kaltaiseksi, mutta on myös mahdollista että kirkolliskokouksesta toiseen toistuvat varoitukset substandardin uskonnollisuuden jatkuvasta uhasta omaksuivat itsessään formulatorisen luonteen. Hagiografisissa teksteissä tämä motiivien lainaaminen ja suoranainen leikkaa-liimaa –tekniikka on jo hyvin dokumentoitu. Esitelmäni tarkoituksena on luoda alustava, etupäässä alkuperäislähteisiin ja niiden kirjalliseen kontekstualisointiin keskittyvä preliminäärinen katsaus erääseen lupaavalta vaikuttavaan post doc –aiheeseen. Tämä väitöskirjani kronologista kehystä myöhäisempi ja täten vain muutaman alaviitteen varaan aiemmin jätetty aihe hyötyisi käsittelystä, joka korostaisi gallialaisen kirkollisen eliitin tuottamien tekstien kirjallista traditiosidonnaisuutta sekä yhteyksiä klassillisoivaan topiikkaan. Näin ollen tutkimuskirjallisuuteen, metodologisiaan sekä muihin apuvälineisiin kohdistuvat kommentit ovat erittäin tervetulleita. Etenkin keltologian alalla (Celtic Studies) on lähes systemaattisesti yliarvioitu hagiografisten lähdetekstien ja kirkolliskokousten päätösten todistusvoima mitä tulee esikristillisen uskonnollisuuden säilymiseen Gallian alueella. Osaksi tästä syystä tutkimukseni pyrkii sijoittamaan kansanomaisen uskonnollisuuden aiempaa keskeisemmin antikvarisoivan kirkollisen sivistyneistön mielikuvissa muodostuneeksi artefaktiksi, joka kertoo enemmän antiikin eliitin uskonnollisesti värittyneen retorisen rekisterin jatkuvuudesta kuin esikristillisen kansanuskon säilymisestä. Ymmärrettävä sosiologinen motiivi substandardin kansanuskon konstruoinnille löytynee ’jatkuvan kääntymisen’ (ongoing conversion) legitimoivasta paradigmasta, johon viittaamalla uskonnollisten spesialistien on mahdollista perustella erityisoikeuksiensa säilyttämistä (vrt. Charles Ramble Tiibetin buddhalaisuudesta). Gallian vaikutusvaltaisen ja sosiaalisesti suhteellisen eksklusiivisen eliitin kohdalla tämä vaikutin lienee varsin mahdollinen."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Markers of Northernness' - cover, program, abstracts and biblio: That the Greeks and the Romans held distinct, culturally shared ideas about various peoples nor... more : That the Greeks and the Romans held distinct, culturally shared ideas about various peoples north to the Mediterranean zone has long been recognised. What has been perhaps less explored is the way in which the motifs and elements in this ‘ethno(geo)graphic archive’ could be transposed from one population group to others within the broad sweep of the northern expanse. What elements enabled the Greek audiences of different eras to associate groups as distinct as Scythians, Thracians, Celts, Germans and other as belonging to this commonality of northerners? Some commonalities must certainly have been real, but even in these cases the Greek imagination made connections, filled gaps, and provided overarching explanations. Ethnonyms, while sometimes inherited for centuries in the tradition, formed a heuristic tool that was strongly conditioned by ancient practices of knowledge ordering: for instance, name-tags such as ‘Scythians’ have been often characterised as applicable to any group thought to hail from the Pontic North. But the cardinal direction was only one aspect, and interacted with cultural and climatic explanations, among other things. What were the most basic components of this shared ethnographic or geographic ‘northernness’ in the minds of Greek writers and audiences? This workshop organised by the Finnish Institute at Athens aims to gather together a diverse group of experts on ancient ethnography, geography, and ‘septentriography’ – i.e. writings on the northern parts of the oikoumene – to discuss the parameters of the Greek perceptions of ‘northernness’ from a variety of perspectives. The programme seeks to delve into the elements that made the North and the northerners stand out as an entity or commonality in the Greek thinking from Homer to Late Antiquity and Byzantium, as well as to bring the different aspects of the septentriographic tradition into a fuller conversation with each other. The workshop is closely connected to the institute’s long-standing and ongoing research interest in the interactions between Nordic regions and the Mediterranean, as well as Antti Lampinen’s own current research project on ancient ethnography.What made the north ‘North’ for the Greeks? What marked a person, people, or a region as ‘northern’? ‘Eaters of flesh, drinkers of milk’ (Shaw 1982) could be found not only in the north; dressing up in animal skins or pelts was imagined as having also been the norm among the very early stages of civilization elsewhere; tattooing was practiced in various lands, as was human sacrifice; other mountain barriers could perhaps match the Rhipaean Mountains in edge-of-the-world symbolism; and there were other blessed peoples in the furthest margins of the world besides the Hyperboreans. Yet ancient explanations of the common qualities of northern groups – both physical and mental – clearly imagined them as parts of a shared whole, and this impression is reinforced by the way in which the tradition transposes ethnographic elements from one population to another. Hazy and interchangeable commonplaces were reshuffled and reused by authors for whom the markers of northernness offered a valuable resource, with immediate purchase in the ‘commonsense ethnogeography’ (cf. Geus & Thiering, eds. 2014) of the north.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Workshop: Revolt Narratives in the Roman Tradition, St Andrews, 17 January 2017by Myles Lavan and Antti LampinenRoman historians have long pored over the scattered evidence for rebellion by subaltern groups in... more Roman historians have long pored over the scattered evidence for rebellion by subaltern groups in different regions and periods, particularly in the light of a growing scholarly focus on resistance in all forms over the past four decades. But almost all work has been carried out within the frame of social and/or political history, seeking to understand what actually happened – a heroic task in many cases given the meagreness of the evidence in most cases. Much less attention has been given to understanding the presuppositions and agendas that shape Roman discourse on revolt, though there is ample material for such a study and it ought to be a prerequisite for in-depth social history based on Roman sources. This exploratory workshop aims to build on a few interventions that have sought to shift the focus from revolt to discourse about revolt. The aim is to place the texts themselves centre stage: to explore their categories, explanatory models, narrative devices – and their ulterior motives; to better understand how the Greco-Roman elite understood and/or chose to represent resistance by subaltern groups.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This traumatic episode had reawakened imagery of the northern enemies penetrating the “Wall of Italy,” which in some cases went all the way back to the Mid-Republican narrative traditions of the Gallic Invasions and the much more frequently debated shock of Hannibal’s invasion. The significance of this imagery continued even beyond the Augustan era, so that remnants of the same Roman insecurity about the “Wall of Italy” being breached, especially by northerners, are preserved in narratives about later Julio-Claudians such as Caligula and Nero. This article first looks at the likely origins of the idea of the Alps as the “Wall of Italy” in Middle-Republican perceptions, projected back onto the past and presenting Rome as predestined to dominate Italy and the Gauls in particular as external intruders in the peninsula. Next, the Late Rep...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
