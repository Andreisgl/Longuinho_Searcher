Typeface designed for early computer OCR

OCR-ACategorySans-serifDesigner(s)American Type FoundersCommissioned byAmerican National Standards InstituteDate released1968[1]VariationsOCR-A ExtendedSample
OCR-A is a font issued in 1966[2] and first implemented in 1968.[3] A special font was needed in the early days of computer optical character recognition, when there was a need for a font that could be recognized not only by the computers of that day, but also by humans.[4] OCR-A uses simple, thick strokes to form recognizable characters.[5]
The font is monospaced (fixed-width), with the printer required to place glyphs 0.254 cm (0.10 inch) apart, and the reader required to accept any spacing between 0.2286 cm (0.09 inch) and 0.4572 cm (0.18 inch).
Standardization[edit]
The OCR-A font was standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
as ANSI X3.17-1981.  X3.4 has since become the INCITS and the OCR-A standard is now called ISO 1073-1:1976.
Implementations[edit]
In 1968, American Type Founders produced OCR-A, one of the first optical character recognition typefaces to meet the criteria set by the U.S. Bureau of Standards. The design is simple so that it can be easily read by a machine, but it is more difficult for the human eye to read.[3]
As metal type gave way to computer-based typesetting, Tor Lillqvist used Metafont to describe the OCR-A font.[when?]  That definition was subsequently improved by Richard B. Wales.  Their work is available from CTAN.[6]
To make the free version of the font more accessible to users of Microsoft Windows, John Sauter converted the Metafont definitions to TrueType using potrace and FontForge in 2004.[7]  In 2007, Gürkan Sengün created a Debian package from this implementation.[8]  In 2008. Luc Devroye corrected the vertical positioning in John Sauter's implementation, and fixed the name of lower case z.[9]
Independently, Matthew Skala[10] used mftrace[11] to convert the Metafont definitions to TrueType format in 2006.  In 2011 he released a new version created by rewriting the Metafont definitions to work with METATYPE1, generating outlines directly without an intermediate tracing step.  On September 27, 2012, he updated his implementation to version 0.2.[12]
In addition to these free implementations of OCR-A, there are also implementations sold by several vendors. As a joke, Tobias Frere-Jones in 1995 created Estupido-Espezial, a redesign with swashes and a long s. It was used in a "technology"-themed section of Rolling Stone.[13][14]
Use[edit]
OCR-A on a German bank check. The ⑂, ⑀ and ⑁ characters are used to delimit particular fields in the machine-readable line (shown here partially redacted).
Although optical character recognition technology has advanced to the point where such simple fonts are no longer necessary,[15] the OCR-A font has remained in use. Its usage remains widespread in the encoding of checks around the world. Some lock box companies still insist that the account number and amount owed on a bill return form be printed in OCR-A.[16]  Also, because of its unusual look, it is sometimes used in advertising and display graphics.
Notably, it is used for the subtitles in films and television series such as Blacklist and for the main titles in The Pretender. Additionally, OCR-A is used[how?] for the films Crimson Tide and 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.
Code points[edit]
A font is a set of character shapes, or glyphs.  For a computer to use a font, each glyph must be assigned a code point in a character set.  When OCR-A was being standardized the usual character coding was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange or ASCII.  Not all of the glyphs of OCR-A fit into ASCII, and for five of the characters there were alternate glyphs, which might have suggested the need for a second font.  However, for convenience and efficiency all of the glyphs were expected to be accessible in a single font using ASCII coding, with the additional characters placed at coding points that would otherwise have been unused.
The modern descendant of ASCII is Unicode, also known as ISO 10646.  Unicode contains ASCII and has special provisions for OCR characters, so some implementations of OCR-A have looked to Unicode for
guidance on character code assignments.
Pre-Unicode standard representation[edit]
The ISO standard ISO 2033:1983, and the corresponding Japanese Industrial Standard JIS X 9010:1984 (originally JIS C 6229-1984), define character encodings for OCR-A, OCR-B and E-13B. For OCR-A, they define a modified 7-bit ASCII set (also known by its ISO-IR number ISO-IR-91) including only uppercase letters, digits, a subset of the punctuation and symbols, and some additional symbols.[17] Codes which are redefined relative to ASCII, as opposed to simply omitted, are listed below:

Additionally, the long vertical mark () is encoded at 0x7C, corresponding to the ASCII vertical bar (|).[17]
Dedicated OCR-A characters in Unicode[edit]
Main article: Optical Character Recognition (Unicode block)
The following characters have been defined for control purposes and are now in the "Optical Character Recognition" Unicode range 2440–245F:

Space, digits, and unaccented letters[edit]
OCR-A digits
OCR-A unaccented capital letters
OCR-A unaccented small letters
All implementations of OCR-A use U+0020 for space,
U+0030 through U+0039 for the decimal digits,
U+0041 through U+005A for the unaccented upper case letters, and
U+0061 through U+007A for the unaccented lower case letters.
Regular characters[edit]
In addition to the digits and unaccented letters, many of the characters of OCR-A have obvious code points in ASCII.
Of those that do not, most, including all of OCR-A's accented letters, have obvious code points in Unicode.

^ American National Standard Character Set for Optical Character Recognition (OCR-A) (PDF). ANSI X3.17-1981. American National Standards Institute, Inc. National Institute of Standards and Technology. 1981. p. 3. The OCR-A character set for optical character recognition was first developed in the United States in 1961 as a numeric font only. In 1966 an alphanumeric font which contained 57 characters, including the existing numeric font, 4 abstract characters, and only capital letters, was issued. The revised standard was entitled American National Standard Character Set for Optical Character Recognition, ANSI X3.17-1966.
^ a b "OCR A". In 1968, American Type Founders produced OCR-A, one of the first optical character recognition typefaces to meet the criteria set by the U.S. Bureau of Standards. The design is simple so that it can be read by a machine, but it is slightly more difficult for the human eye to read. OCR-A follows the 1981 standard set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), X-3.17-1981 (size I). The same design is also specified for the German DIN 66008 standard. OCR-B was designed in 1968 by Adrian Frutiger for Monotype. This design pushes the limits of the optical reader, but is easier for people to read. OCR-B's construction follows the ISO 1073/II-1976 (E) standard, with 1979 corrections (letterpress design, size I). Both OCR-A and OCR-B have "alternate" versions, which have the standard ISO-Adobe character set instead of the more limited OCR character set.
