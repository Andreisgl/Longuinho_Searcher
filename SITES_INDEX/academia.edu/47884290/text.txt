What Contributes to Higher Retention Rates and Positive Learning Outcomes?George Lorenzo2012, Internet LearningWhat are the foundations of student satisfaction or dissatisfaction with online courses? Why do online learners succeed and others fail or drop out? What kind of instructional designs, pedagogical practices, and administrative standards contribute to the development of effective online courses with high retention rates and positive student learning outcomes? Plenty of valid, well-researched information and literature reviews, along with abundant data accumulated through student/faculty surveys and online learning course evaluations, are outlined and summarized inside numerous academic papers that attempt to answer such questions. This report is based on the author's search and analysis of numerous scholarly academic papers that addressed such questions and were published between 2004 and 2007.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe internet and higher educationImproving online learning: Student perceptions of useful and challenging characteristics2004 • Vivek ReddyDownload Free PDFView PDFStudents' Perceptions of Online Learning: A Comparative Study2006 • Karl SmartDownload Free PDFView PDFSTUDENT PERCEPTIONS OF ONLINE INSTRUCTIONMargaret Greer, Brenda ShookThis study examined student perceptions of online teaching effectiveness in undergraduate courses. End-of course evaluation data were collected from a sample of 2,750 online multisection courses taught within a 12 month period and comparisons were made between highly rated courses (at 4.5 or higher on a 5 point scale) and low rated courses (at 3.0 or lower). There was a significant difference in course evaluations as a function of academic rank, with slightly lower ratings for faculty at lower ranks relative to those at higher ranks. In general, online teaching experience and experience teaching the same course were both weak predictors of course evaluation outcomes. Overall, in highly rated courses instructors were: receptive to questions, responded promptly to emails, provided timely feedback, posted grades in a timely manner, and were perceived as active participants in the online class. Further findings and recommendations to assist faculty in understanding online teaching evaluations are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal on E-LearningKey Factors for Determining Student Satisfaction in Online Courses2004 • María José  Rodríguez-CondeDownload Free PDFView PDFOnline Learning Students: Characteristics, Satisfaction, and Implications for Future Planning.

An understanding of the factors that influence student satisfaction with online learning in a particular context can be used as an input to the appropriate design of learning environments, and for the provision of targeted support to students, with an aim to positively influence the student online learning experience. Following the mandatory inclusion of at least one wholly online unit of study in all undergraduate programs at Deakin University, a large ‘experiences of learning online’ (ELO) survey was undertaken to gauge students’ perceptions of studying in the wholly online mode. A multivariate linear regression of all the questionnaire items was performed against an overall satisfaction item. Five items were found to significantly contribute to a model that explained approximately 70% of reported student satisfaction. Factors that were found to positively influence student satisfaction with studying a wholly online unit primarily related to how confident they felt about their ability to communicate and learn online, having a clear understanding of what was required to succeed in the unit and how well they thought they were performing in the unit. Other results are also reported.Download Free PDFView PDFLearners' Satisfaction in Online Courses2019 • Mohammad MerhiOnline education is gaining more and more attention from both learners and institutions. Many institutions are moving some of their courses or creating sections of current face-to-face courses online. The success and continuation of online courses depend on learners’ satisfaction. This research in progress is an effort to understand the impact of critical factors on learners’ satisfaction in online courses. This paper extends the existing literature by considering interrelationships among important factors that have been found to impact individuals’ perceptions. To our best knowledge, the interrelationships and hypotheses presented in this paper have not been investigated in the literature. Thus, this study is a crucial contribution to theory and practice.Download Free PDFView PDFExamining Students’ Online Course Perceptions and Comparing Student Performance Outcomes in Online and Face-to-Face Classrooms2021 • Traci TempleThrough the use of existing grade and student survey data, this study investigated online courses offered at a public four-year university. Specifically, the study explored differences in student success rates between online and face-to-face courses for traditional undergraduate students as well as the climate of student perceptions towards online courses. Our general results suggest that students performed better in, and had higher levels of preference toward, traditional face-to-face formats. However, overall perceptions of online courses were positive, with students viewing instructional technologies as reliable and easy to use, as well as reporting that online technologies facilitated prompt feedback, enhanced their problem-solving skills, and met their learning needs. Alongside this, students exhibited positive views towards their instructors’ skill level and use of technology to support academic success.
