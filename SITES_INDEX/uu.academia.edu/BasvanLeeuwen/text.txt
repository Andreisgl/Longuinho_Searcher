However, in spite of a wide variety of available data and indicators, so far published data on Indonesian per capita GDP in colonial times are limited to macro-estimates for the entire archipelago or are confined either to Java or to the Outer Islands. In this paper we provide a first attempt to arrive at estimates of diverging income and living standards at a regional level. We implement the Geary and Stark method on a large body of data collected by the colonial government, to estimate GDP for ten macro-regions and five benchmark years between 1870 and 1930. Our findings, corrected for prices, confirm the image arising from the existing literature of major divergences within the Indonesian archipelago in general, and of a higher per capita GDP in most of the Outer Islands (all islands of the Indonesian archipelago except for Java and Madura) compared with Java in particular.

We present the first study of changing heights for people born in West Africa during the early 19 th century. The data set, not used before for anthropometry, documents men, born between 1800 and 1849 in what are now Ghana and Burkina Faso. Mostly purchased from slave owners, they were recruited into the Dutch army to serve in the Netherlands Indies. We find that height development was stagnant between 1800 and 1830 and deteriorated strongly during the 1840s. In international comparison and after taking selectivity issues into account, these West Africans were notably shorter than northwestern Europeans but not much shorter than Southern Europeans during this period.

Recently, also the accumulation of human capital has increasingly been incorporated in this picture. However, few datasets exist that cover this crucial variable for this vast area. Therefore, our main objective is to introduce a new dataset that contains human capital related time series for the USSR (and the Newly Independent States (NIS) after its dissolution), constructed mostly on an annual basis. These data were drawn from various primary sources, available datasets and secondary literature where our focus was on constructing a dataset as clear, transparent and consistent as possible. It is our hope that, by supplying these data in electronic format, it will significantly advance quantitative economic history research on Russia and all over the former Soviet Union area (FSU) and will inspire further research in var...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Growing Silver and Changing Prices: : the Development of the Money Stock in Ancient Babylonia and Medieval EnglandThe role of money (and in many ancient economies this is equated with silver) has fascinated peop... more The role of money (and in many ancient economies this is equated with silver) has fascinated people throughout the ages. There has been a lively debate on the role of (coined and uncoined) silver as money in the Antiquity. We shall not enter into this debate, but it is our contention (following Jursa (2010)) that silver was used as money (means of payment, means of account) already in the Ancient Near East and that silver remained the main form of money until the nineteenth century. The lack of direct evidence on the amount of silver in circulation, however, puts a serious limitation for historical research on the monetary development in ancient societies. In this paper we attempt to remedy this by applying a model to available staple price data from first millennium BC Babylonia to estimate the changes of the amount of silver in the economy. In order to do this, in section 2 we introduce a model that establishes a relationship between prices and the quantity of silver in circulation. This establishes the relation between the price level of a staple crop and the growth of the amount of silver in the economy. In section 3, using our model, we calculate the amount of silver in circulation. We find that this decreases considerably, which possibly explains the rise in purchasing power of silver observed in the second century BC. In section 4 we cross-check our model by applying it to medieval and early modern England. We find that our estimates of silver in circulation are close to the independent estimates that exist in the literature. Remarkably, we also find that the influx of Spanish silver in England in the sixteenth century was not as large as is often assumed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is the culmination of the free movement of capital across borders, one of the aspects of the creation of a single market within the EU. With this achievement, however, we tend to forget that many regions in the past had comparable forms of common currencies. In order to assess the uniqueness of the EU achievement, we compare its speed of coin circulation, being an indicator of the efficiency of its internal market, with that of the Seleucid Empire over 2,000 years ago.  We find that Seleucid silver coins circulated at about the same speed as do the Euro coins today. This is not true, however, for Seleucid bronze coins, which had a far slower speed of circulation. Given the monetary differences between the EU and the Seleucid Empire, a direct comparison of the proximate causes for this pattern is impossible. Yet, looking at the ultimate factors (i.e. geography and institutions), we find that geography did not play a major role in both region. Given that the speed of circulation was the same anyway, this implies that the effect of the underlying institutions must have been comparable as well.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A History of Market Performance from Ancient Babylonia to the Modern Worldby R.J.

London, New York: Routledge 2015 [2014],  Aug 21, 2014This exciting new volume examines the development of market performance from Antiquity until the ... more This exciting new volume examines the development of market performance from Antiquity until the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.Efficient market structures are agreed by most economists to serve as evidence of economic prosperity, and to be prerequisites for further economic growth. However, this is the first study to examine market performance as a whole, over such a large time period. Presenting a hitherto unknown and inaccessible corpus of data from ancient Babylonia, this international set of contributors are for the first time able to offer an in-depth study of market performance over a period of 2,500 years.The contributions focus on the market of staple crops, as they were crucial goods in these societies. Over this entire period, all papers provide a similar conceptual and methodological framework resting on a common definition of market performance combined with qualitative and quantitative analyses resting on new and improved price data. In this way, the book is able to combine analysis of the Babylonian period with similar work on the Roman, Early-and Late Medieval and Early Modern period.Bringing together input from assyriologists, ancient historians, economic historians and economists, this volume will be crucial reading for all those with an interest in ancient history, economic history and economics.This is part of a research project conducted at the VU University (Vrije Universiteit) Amsterdam, funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) on "The efficiency of markets in Pre-Industrial Societies: the case of Babylonia, 485-61 BC".Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Inspiration vs. perspiration in economic development of the Former Soviet Union and China (ca. 1920-2010)by Bas van Leeuwen and Peter FoldvariEconomics of Transition,  2014ABSTRACT Here, we discuss the role of both perspiration factors (physical and human capital) and ... more ABSTRACT Here, we discuss the role of both perspiration factors (physical and human capital) and inspiration factors (Total Factor Productivity) in the economic development of the Former Soviet Union area (FSU) and China, ca. 1920–2010. Using a newly created dataset, we find that during the Socialist central-planning period, economic growth in both countries was largely driven by physical capital accumulation. This finding follows logically from the development policies in place at that time. During their transition periods, (i.e., starting from the late 1970s in China and the late 1980s in the FSU), China managed to keep technical inefficiency of production factors in check, largely by massively increasing its human capital, thereby lowering the physical-to-human capital ratio. In contrast, the FSU accomplished a similar outcome largely through reducing its stock of physical capital. As a result, although there was little difference in technical efficiency between these two economies, China&amp;#39;s emphasis on human capital formation made it easier for this country to improve its general productivity and to increase per capita growth. This changed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the FSU began to recover economically, regaining its 1990 levels of output and productivity.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to treat space as continuous rather than using an arbitrary collection of geographical units, we follow the point-pattern methodology of Duranton and Overman (2005, 2008). We apply these techniques on two datasets of Dutch manufacturing firms in two benchmark years, to explore the differences of co-location over time. On the one hand, we will use a dataset of the larger manufacturing establishments in the Netherlands in 1896 and 2010. On the other hand, we will make use of a standardized factory-level dataset in Hunan province, China. Presenting thus two cross sections from two completely different regions, we aim to provide a first empirical test of the agglomeration theories of Marshall (1890) in his period of research and repeat these tests for the recent period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
