Aun cuando a primera vista parece un mero ingrediente escenográfico u ornamental, sin mayor interés iconográfico, esa definida forma de templo trasluce en realidad profundos significados mariológicos y cristológicos. En ese orden de ideas, este ensayo se basa en una doble estrategia metodológica: ante todo, la de analizar algunas imágenes marianas que en dichos siglos incluyen la forma del templo, para ver qué papel juega en ellas semejante edificio religioso; en segundo lugar, la de descubri...Save to LibraryDownloadby José María  SALVADOR-GONZALEZ•  15  Humanities, Art, Theology, PatristicsLa doctrina de San Juan Damasceno sobre la muerte y la asunción de María al cielo, y su posible influencia en las correspondientes iconografías medievalesEste artículo pretende poner en luz la influencia que la doctrina de San Juan Damasceno (c. 675-c. 749) sobre la muerte, la resurrección y la asunción de la Virgen María podría haber ejercido sobre las complementarias iconografías... moreEste artículo pretende poner en luz la influencia que la doctrina de San Juan Damasceno (c. 675-c. 749) sobre la muerte, la resurrección y la asunción de la Virgen María podría haber ejercido sobre las complementarias iconografías medievales de la Dormición y la Asunción de María al cielo. El trabajo tiene dos vertientes esenciales. En la primera, mediante el análisis de tres homilías del Damasceno sobre la Dormición de María, se estudia la posición conceptual de dicho autor sobre la muerte, el sepelio y la asunción del alma de la Virgen, así como su resurrección anticipada y su ascención en cuerpo y alma al cielo. En la segunda vertiente se interpretan algunas obras pictóricas medievales de la Dormición y la Asunción de María al cielo desde la perspectiva doctrinal de San Juan Damasceno, poniendo en directa correspondencia los elementos narrativos contenidos en dichas pinturas con lo formulado por el teólogo sirio en sus tres homilías sobre la Dormición.Save to LibraryDownloadby José María  SALVADOR-GONZALEZ•  17  Philosophy, Humanities, Art, NarrativeThe State of the University: Academic Knowledges and the Knowledge of God – By Stanley HauerwasSave to LibraryDownloadby Stanley Hauerwas•  2  Sociology, Religious StudiesAfrican and Christian Theology of Environment as a Model for the Control of Global WarmingThe problem of global warming and its implications on the continuous existence of the world are alarming.

Hence, the phenomenon has attracted a lot of responses from different people including scholars, journalists and religious leaders. While researches on possible solutions to the menace of global warming continue, the contribution of this paper is that a combination of traditional African attitude to nature and Christian theology of environment can be used as a model for the control of global warming. Important elements in the two traditions include the idea of relationship between God, human and nature and the eschatological views of the two traditions. The paper concludes that the combination of these views will help to check human attitude to nature and unbridled craze for material wealth which are the major causes of globalSave to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Moses Udoh•  2  Philosophy, Global WarmingTao and LogosSave to LibraryDownloadby In-Sing Leung•  2  Philosophy, Chinese PhilosophyA Call for Papers - Journal of Biblical and Theological StudiesThe Journal of Biblical and Theological Studies is accepting article submissions for an upcoming general issue (Fall 2024).Save to LibraryDownloadby Ryan A Brandt•  12  Philosophy, Ethics, New Testament, History of ChristianityMedieval Shiloh-Continuity and RenewalThe present paper deals with the development of cult in Shiloh during the Middle Ages.

After the Byzantine period, when Shiloh was an important Christian cult place, it disappeared from the written sources and started to be identified with Nebi Samwil. In the 12th century Shiloh reappeared in the travelogues of Muslims, and shortly thereafter, in ones by Jews. Although most of the traditions had to do with the Tabernacle, some traditions started to identify Shiloh with the tomb of Eli and his family. The present study looks at the relationship between the practice of ziyara ("visit" in Arabic), which was characterized by the veneration of tombs, and the cult in Shiloh. The paper also surveys archeological finds in Shiloh that attest to a medieval cult and compares them with the written sources. In addition, it presents testimonies by Christians about Jewish cultic practices, along with testimonies about the cult place shared by Muslims and Jews in Shiloh. Examination of the medieval cult in Shiloh provides a broader perspective on an uninstitutionalized regional cult.Save to LibraryDownloadby Abraham Ofir Shemesh•The Tripartite Structure of the Sixth Seal , the Sixth Trumpet , and the Sixth BowlFor centuries the Apocalypse of John, commonly known as the book of Revelation, has posed problems for scholars who have sought to interpret it.

Many of the problems are aggravated by the seemingly impossible task of determining with any certainty the literary structure of the book itself. The Apocalypse contains four sections explicitly divided into seven parts: the seven letters (2:1!3:22), the seven!sealed scroll (4:1!8:1), the seven trumpets (8:2!11:19), the seven bowls of God&#39;s wrath (15:1!16:21). The first of these sections contains seven letters dictated to John. The letters share a distinct form among themselves that sets them apart from the other three sections containing seven parts. In addition the other three sections contain six parts that in turn are each divided into three subparts. While no scholar has challenged the thematic unity of 16:12!16 (the sixth trumpet), many scholars have regarded the last two scenes of both 6:12!7:17 (the six seal) and 9:13!11:14 (the...Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Steinmann•Traducción de la respuesta a la siguiente pregunta en la red social Quora Was Jesus the carpenter according to Mark 6:3 or the carpenter's son as in Matthew 13:55La pregunta era si Jesús era carpintero o hijo del carpintero, la respuesta fue que ambos.

The faith document that was developed in Ghana invites the church to participate in Christian public witness. It affirmed the importance of the gospel in addressing contemporary social and economic challenges and recognizes the need for the church to maintain a prophetic voice in the face of oppression, exploitation and exclusion. The article argued that the Public Theology document provides the necessary resources that are needed for the public witness of the church in Ghana after its almost two decades in existence and therefore any form of disconnection and silence need to be identified and addressed.

He distances himself from the idea of the Absolute as a construct of human reason and turns to the concept of God as an ontic foundation of the world. He rejects the concept of the Absolute alienated and separated from the world and embraces the vision of God hidden in the depths of reality and allowing us to experience his proximity in various ways. In the first part of the article, the philosophers' concept of God, identified with the First Mover of the world and the Supreme Being, is critiqued. In the second part, the vision of God as the foundation and depth of being and the related issues of pantheism, panentheism and the personality of God are outlined. In the third part, attention is given to the fundamental ways of experiencing His presence and proximity, which include the experience of nature and historical events, the experience of the human interior ("deeper self") and the encounter with another person, especially a wounded and suffering one.Save to LibraryDownloadby Collectanea Theologica•  20  Philosophy, Theology, Spirituality, Catholic TheologySławomir Zatwardnicki, The Rule of Faith, the Scripture and Tradition: A Voice in the Discussion on the Doctrine of the Holy ScriptureThe article is a voice in the discussion on the doctrine of Scripture, that is, the theological reflection on the nature, attributes and mission of Scripture.

The text shows the close link between the regula fidei and Scripture and, at the same time, the impossibility of identifying the rule of faith with the biblical canon. The rule of faith has played a role in establishing the Christian canon and throughout the Church's time serves to protect the message of Scripture. The content expressed in the rule of faith is not derived from hidden Tradition, and Tradition has become the internal principle of the New Testament and the regula fidei. The key to Scripture is the faith of the Church, one expression of which is the rule of faith. It allows us to grasp the order of the truths of faith (harmonia veritatum) and their hierarchy (hierarchia veritatum). The original rule of faith was born out of the reception of divine revelation and, together with Scripture, remains at the service of the New Covenant.Save to LibraryDownloadby Collectanea Theologica•  17  Theology, Hermeneutics, History Of The Bible/Biblical Canon, Catholic TheologyChrześcijańska idea wcielenia a koncepcja technologicznej osobliwościArtykuł podejmuje kwestię roli chrześcijańskiej idei wcielenia w dyskursie dotyczącym perspektywy społeczeństwa postludzkiego, zwłaszcza zaś inte-gracji umysłów w technologicznej osobliwości.

Wcielenie w swoim wymiarze wspólnoto-wym, jak choćby koncepcja zjednoczenia wiernych w Mistycznym Ciele Chrystusa, czy indywidualnym  wymiarze  przebóstwienia  człowieka  stanowi  ideowy  fundament  trans-humanizmu. Technologiczna osobliwość rozumiana jako szczytowy punkt ewolucji człowieka, w którym dokona się integracja technologii i biologii organizmu staje się współczesnym substytutem wcielenia Syna Bożego i nadziei, które wierzący pokładają w tym dogmacie. W ten sposób transhumanizm wyznacza sobie identyczne cele jak chrześcijaństwo, ale obiecuje zrealizować je odmiennymi, technologicznymi mianowicie środkami.The article discusses the role that the Christian idea of incarnation can play in the discourse on the perspective assumed by the post-human society, especially where it  concerns  the  integration  of  minds  in  the  technological  singularity.  Incarnation  is  the  ideological  foundation  of  transhumanism  both  in  its  communal  dimension  –  as  in  the  concept of the union of believers in the Mystical Body of Christ – and in the individual dimension of the divinization of the human person. The technological singularity understood as the pinnacle of human evolution, a point at which the integration of technology and organismal biology will take place, becomes a modern substitute for the incarnation of the Son of God and the hopes that believers place in the Christian dogma. In this way, transhumanism sets goals similar to those of Christianity, but promises to achieve them by different, that is, technological means.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paweł Sznajder•  11  Christianity, Philosophy Of Religion, Theology, Slavoj ŽižekHristiyan Teolojisinde Kutsal RuhBir gizem olarak nitelenen teslisin muhtemelen en kapalı tarafını Kutsal Ruh oluşturmaktadır.

İçinde muhtelif kaynaklara ait metinleri barındıran geniş bir kitap koleksiyonu olan Kitabı Mukaddes buna paralel olarak Ruh konusunda da farklı anlayışlara sahiptir. Eski Ahit'te Ruh "tanrısal/ilahi" birçok işler gerçekleştiren bir yapıda tasvir edilse de Tanrı ile ontolojik bir yakınlığa sahip değildir. Yeni Ahit'te ise İncillerin yazılış kronolojisine uygun olarak Kutsal Ruh anlayışı konusunda bir gelişim ve dönüşüm göze çarpmaktadır. Kitabı Mukaddes'ten sonra teolojik meselelerin ilk defa ele alındığı metinler olan Apostolik babalara ait yazılar ise Kutsal Ruh konusunda büyük oranda kutsal metinleri takip etse de Hermas'ın Çoban'ı gibi farklı bir Ruh anlayışı barındıran metinler de bulunmaktadır. Hemen akabinde Apoloji yazarları Hristiyan karşıtı yazarların metinleri ile ilgilendiklerinden onların kendi terminolojileri üzerinden bir cevap üretme yoluna gitmişlerdir. Bu durum Hristiyan teolojisinde Kutsal Ruh anlayışının gelişimine önemli katkılar sağlamıştır. 3. yüzyılda Origenes ve Tertullianus gibi çok önemli kilise babalarının Kutsal Ruh'un mahiyeti konusundaki görüşleri tartışmaların alevlendiği 4. yüzyıldaki önemli isimleri ciddi bir biçimde etkilemiştir. Kutsal Ruh meselesi müstakil olarak ilk defa 4. yüzyılın ikinci yarısında gündeme gelmiştir. Önce Tropici denen yerel Mısırlı bir grup, ardından Makedonyusçular/Pneumatomachi Kutsal Ruh'un yaratılmış olduğunu kabul edip onu Baba Tanrı'dan ve İsa Mesih'ten farklı ve hiyerarşik olarak aşağıda olduğunu savunmuşlardır. Kutsal Ruh'u kilisenin bir dönem ana gündem maddesi haline getiren Pneumatomachi'nin iddialarına Kapadokya Babaları cevaplar üretmiştir. En nihayetinde siyasi desteği uzun süre sonra arkasına alan İznikçi kamp İstanbul Konsili'nde Kutsal Ruh'un varlığını Baba'dan aldığını ve Baba ve Oğul ile birlikte yüceltilip tapılması gerektiğini kabul ettirmiştir.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yunus Kaymaz•  4  Christianity, Early Christianity, Christian Theology, Christian StudiesAcatistul Sfintei cuvioase Teodora din Tesalonic (5 aprilie/3 august /29 august)Bucură-te, Sfântă Teodora, podoabă a Tesalonicului!Save to LibraryDownloadby stea emy•  2  Religion, Christian SpiritualityAcademic Freedom at Religious InstitutionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Sam Logan•Christianity and Oral Literature of Križevci RegionThe work demonstrates that Christianity is an essential part of the identity of Croats in a particular locality, the town and region of Križevci and the region of Križevci, which is best demonstrated in the oral literature formed among... moreThe work demonstrates that Christianity is an essential part of the identity of Croats in a particular locality, the town and region of Križevci and the region of Križevci, which is best demonstrated in the oral literature formed among the folk. The study of a set of fifteen manuscript collections, compiled in the 19th century, the period when the majority of oral literature records in Croatia had been collected, uncovered Christian content in numerous instances, not limited only to the characters, symbols and motifs, but also as a confirmation of living Christian values and Christian morality as key determinants of identity. Such affiliation with the Christian worldview was observed in all the analysed manuscript collections, regardless of the time of their recording, the various literary genres and the many recorders doing the work, and who had all come from different social and educational backgrounds.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tanja Baran•  2  Christianity, HistoryReligious Views of Victor Frankl / Религиозные воззрения Виктора ФранклаThe article is devoted to the analysis of the religious views of the founder of logotherapy, an Austrian psychologist, psychotherapist and philosopher, Viktor Emil Frankl.

Frankl’s works were of great importance for the philosophical and psychological thought of the 20th century, and also remain relevant today. The founder of logotherapy was a believer, which makes his doctrine of man important for theology as well. At the moment, Frankl’s legacy has not been explored from an Orthodox point of view. First of all, theology is interested in the question of the religious views of Viktor Frankl himself, which is the purpose of this article. When studying the issue of Frankl’s religiosity, the following methods were used: historical-functional and biographical methods, which made it possible to identify the causes and conditions that influenced the continuity and formation of Frankl's religious ideas; a method of linguo-stylistic analysis, which made it possible to analyze the vocabulary and figures of speech that Frankl uses in his writings. As well as methods of induction, generalization, comparison, synthesis. As a result, the author comes to the conclusion that Viktor Frankl, having been brought up religiously, carries his faith through his whole life, and even through the Nazi camp. His religiosity took various forms, but if we pay attention to the semantic content of his religious ideas, we find their amazing correspondence with Christian ones. Frankl did not agree on everything in Christianity, but here one should take into account the difficulties of interpreting specifically theological provisions for philosophical and psychological consciousness.Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Theological Bulletin•  10  Religion, Christianity, Theology, PsychotherapyΗ ΓΝΩΣΗ ΤΟΥ ΘΕΟΥ ΚΑΙ Η ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ ΤΟΥ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΥΗ παρούσα εργασία στόχο έχει να μελετήσει, να καταγράψει και να αναδείξει, αρχικά το κυριότερο στοιχείο της ανθρώπινης ύπαρξης, την ελευθέρια.

The analysis... moreThis paper presents a comaparative lexical-semantic analysis of the loci selected from the late antique Greek texts of Christian and non-Christian origin that advocate the dominant anthropological notions of the time. The analysis encompasses the two main anthropological paradigms, the Christian and the Platonic, which in many respects opposed each other, but also met and intersected throughout history, fostering the development of religious and philosophical thought. The Christian paradigm, marked by anthropological monism, is examined in this work in the key passages from the Old Testament and St. Paul’s Epistles, whereas the Platonic paradigm, marked by anthropological dualism, is analysed in the examples taken from Plato himself, Philo, Plutach and the Corpus Hermeticum. The main objective of the analysis is to examine the analogies and parallels between the two paradigms on the lexical, terminological and rhetorical plane. These analogies reveal a literary and intellectual dynamics that characterized the discourse on man’s nature in the era of early Christianity and late Antiquity. The analysis pays a particular attention to the tropes of „dressing“ and „undressing“ the body and the „nudity“ of the soul, as well as to the comparison of death with sleep. У раду је представљена компаративна лексичко-семантичка анализа одабраних места из позноантичких грчких текстова хришћанске и нехришћанске провенијенције у којима се износе доминантне антрополошке концепције тог доба. Компаративном анализом обухваћене су две главне парадигме, условно назване хришћанском и платонском, које су се, премда у много чему супротстављене, током историје сусретале, преплитале и подстицале развој религиозне и филозофске мисли. Хришћанска, одређена антрополошким монизмом, размотрена је у кључним одломцима из Старог Завета и Посланица Светог апостола Павла, док је платонска, одређена антрополошким дуализмом, размотрена на примерима самог Платона, Филона, Плутарха и Херметичког корпуса. Главни циљ анализе јесте да укаже на аналогије и паралелизме између те две парадигме у лексици, терминологији и употреби реторских средстава попут метафоре. Те аналогије откривају литерарну и интелектуалну динамику која је у позноантичко и ранохришћанско доба одликовала дискурс о природи човека. У раду су посебно истакнути тропи „облачења“ и „свлачења“ тела и „голе“ душе, те поређење смрти са сном.Save to LibraryDownloadby Noel Putnik•  4  Anthropology of Christianity, Christian Theology, Christology,anthropology,early Christian History Philosophy of Religion, Anthropology of Religion'"Psychological truth leads to theological truth": Recent Works on Theology and Psychoanalysis', Journal of Orthodox Christian Studies, 5.2 (2022): 272-282--GallaherSave to LibraryDownloadby Brandon Gallaher•  20  Christianity, Psychology, Psychoanalysis, AnthropologyThe Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self (Carl Trueman)My popular-level review of Carl Trueman's helpful book "The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self."Save to LibraryDownloadby Ian  Clary•  5  History, Philosophy, Ethics, CultureHaunted Theology: How the Modern Church is Haunted by the Ghost of Marcion Who Caused a Divorce of God’s Commandments from His GraceThere’s a notion that somehow God’s commandments and His grace are two different things.

Let’s consider this using the theme of a haunted house. A haunted house is often perceived as being inhabited by disembodied spirits of the deceased who may have been former residents.

Sadly, instead of being faithful, Israel repeatedly went after other gods (Jer 3) which led to the split of the united kingdom into the southern Kingdom of Judah (House of Judah under Rehoboam) and the northern Kingdom of Israel (House of Israel/Ephraim under Jeroboam) (1Kings 11:31-32). Finally, after seven hundred years of adultery since Sinai, God gave the northern kingdom a certificate of divorce and sent her away (Jer 3:8, Hos 2:2), calling her No-Mercy (Lo-Ruchama) and Not-My-People (Lo-Ammi)  (Hos 1:8-9) and she (ten tribes) assimilated into the pagan gentiles (nations) (Hos 7:8, 8:8, 9:17, 2Kings 17:23-24). Judah likewise deserved divorce but God would not because of his promise to David (Hos 1:7, 1 Kings 11:32).God then promised to betroth the house of Israel to himself in righteousness (Hos 2:19) and to restore the two kingdoms into one (two sticks per Ezk 37:16-23). That promise created a divine dilemma because God's instructions (law) did not permit a woman to come back to her first husband after she had been married to others (Deut 24:1-4) (that was the curse of the law) (Gal 3:13). This divine dilemma was resolved by Jesus' (the husband's) death which canceled the Old (Marriage) Covenant and canceled the curse of the law (due to her adultery) (Rom 7:1-4). Now those who were not his people (Rom 9:24-26) and who had not obtained mercy (1Pet 2:10) could come into the commonwealth of Israel as full members and citizens (Eph 2:11-19) which was also in fulfillment of Ephraim becoming the multitude of nations (Gen 48:19, Rom 11:25).Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas Hamp•  17  New Testament, Old Testament Theology, Biblical Theology, Apostle Paul and the Pauline Letters"A Review of Steve McVey, Grace Walk," Evangelical Forum Newsletter, Vol. 1 No. 4 (2004): 8-14.The basic thesis of Grace Walk is that Christians should live by grace and not by legalism.

Believers do this not by trying to conform to external rules (not even basic disciplines like having quiet times, reading the Bible, or attending church) but by resting in the fact that, as believers, Christ lives in them. On the surface there are parts of this approach that may sound appealing. Certainly, all true believers will heartily agree that we are saved by grace through faith and not by works. One might also heartily "Amen!" McVey's denunciation of any notion of self-sufficiency when it comes to the Christian life. With careful examination and reflection, however, the reader will find that McVey has taken some major detours from the classical Biblical doctrines of salvation and sanctification. Unfortunately, McVey's theology leads in the dangerous direction of antinomianism, hardly the healing Biblical cure for legalism. Rather than offering a robust Biblical critique of the spirit of this age, Grace Walk conforms to the mold of this world by promoting a relativistic Jesus-spirituality that downplays any firm doctrinal commitments about who that Jesus is.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeffrey T .

This results in a community with high value expectations and a high performance pressure.In my research into the lived experience of the CMS as community, a community with both local and worldwide dimensions, I discovered both a deep commitment to the community, its purpose and values, and a deep experience of ambivalence with the lived reality of that community. Highexpectations regularly meet deep disappointment, in the face of the experience of difference.Yet, this ambivalent experience, painful as it is, does not seem to be a negative reality only. In this paper, I explore this ambivalent reality as a place of creative and disruptive hope, a place where boundaries are redrawn, where, to speak with Bednarowsky, ambivalence is lived as “a new religiousvirtue.”1 Living ambivalence - as a true and complex knowing of both the painful, unjust and problematic, and the good, just and hopeful – invites to repentance and conversion, and to hope and creative action. Such true and complex knowing and living is only possible in the context of true relationships, and in the specificity of context and locality.Save to LibraryDownloadby Berdine van den Toren-Lekkerkerker•Guest Editorial “History Matters”: Reflections on Studying the History of Christian EducationSave to LibraryDownloadby David  Setran•SociologyPaul: the transition from Nazarenism to christianityThis study examines the role of the person of Paul in the transition of Christian religion from Nazaren-Christianity to Gentile-Christianity.

The goal of this paper is to explore firstly Paul‘s turning point from being a Jew to a devout Christian and secondly his missionary activities to the Gentiles (non-Jews), which played an important role in the development of Christianity as a religion, its major teachings and thoughts. Paul‘s great concern regarding the foundation of Christian theology or what is now known as the Pauline Christian theology, is presented in this study. His real contribution is found in his teachings, where the central point is the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who after the crucifixion had risen in glory, headed a new community and guided it through his spirit. The main thrust of this paper will be on: (1) Paul‘s life and personality, (2) Paul‘s conversion from an orthodox Jew to a devout Christian, (3) Paul‘s missionary activities to the ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Fatmir Shehu•  7  Christianity, Philosophy, Theology, Religious StudiesDid Jesus Thwart the Gates of Hades and  the Underworld from Opening at Caesarea Philippi?esus took his disciples about thirty-five miles north of Capernaum to Caesarea Philippi, a two-day trek on foot near the end of his ministry.

They went to the Cave of Pan (Banias),  known as the Gates of Hades, at the base of Mount Hermon. It seems strange for a Jewish rabbi to take His students to a thoroughly pagan place of worship. Yet, Jesus was always intentional. He was taking the fight to the enemy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas Hamp•  18  New Testament, Biblical Studies, Demonology, Biblical TheologyРецензия на книгу: Епифаний (Феодоропулос), архим. «Эллинохристианский синтез» и Отцы Церкви / перевод с греческого М.

The essential Christian conviction that the crucified and risen Jesus Christ is the Messiah and beyond that the Incarnate Son of God is not only denied by Jews, but is incomprehensible for them. Jewish objections have caused Christian theology to ask whether it is possible for it to say something positive as regards Jewish hope in the Messiah, a hope which also says “no” to Christians’ faith in Christ. The Pontifical Biblical Commission picked up on this question in a positive way in its text of the year 2001, The Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible. In addition, Jewish criticism of the Christian idea of the Incarnation, not least in discussions of shituf (&quot;association&quot;), has brought a new awareness of the importance for Christ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Hans Hermann Henrix•  11  Philosophy, Theology, Christology, FaithThe Seven Earths and Seven Heavens in the Light of Jung, Maslow and Hindu PsychologyThe Holy Quran tells of Allah creating seven heavens and seven earths.

These have been traditionally identified cosmologically with seven stars etc. or geographically with seven lands. We provide an alternative interpretation that these refer to seven centers in the spinal cord. Each center has a physical location and a psychic quality. Abraham Maslow has suggested that a human being evolves progressively through seven needs. We suggest this evolution refers to the consciousness of a person rising thorugh the seven centers in the spinal cord. Car G. Jung has commented on the Hindu understanding of these seven centers and endorsed that these have psychic qualities. We find that this understanding is consistent with the Quran. In particular, a Hadith tells of the area from the Prophet's "throat to lower part of the abdomen" being washed. This is the location of the lower five of the seven psychic centers in the spine. The Hadith then goes on to tell that the Prophet ascended the seven heavens and met with Adam, Jesus and John, Joseph, Idris, Aaron, Moses and Abraham sequentially. In the seventh heaven He was shown Bait-al-Ma'mur or Allah's House which could indicate that his consciousness reached the crown center which is said to be the seat of "spiritual emancipation."Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Philosophical Investigations•Seven HeavensCalvinismo x Arminianismo (1)Save to LibraryDownloadby Felipe Espejo•MATHEWS, T[homas] W[right]: Autobiography of the Late Rev.

Esta noción interconecta todo un entramado teórico en el pensamiento de Plotino. Para el padre del neoplatonismo, al igual que para Platón, la experiencia erótica supone un despertar admirativo del alma ante el mundo, que guía a la vida filosófica. Este saber versa, entonces, sobre una vivencia determinada y orienta al pensamiento hacia su hermenéutica. Lejos de los ascetismos y de la filosofía de sistema en las que en muchas ocasiones se encorseta al neoplatonismo, esta corriente dedica grandes esfuerzos a dilucidar los niveles más profundos de la experiencia humana, donde el Eros se manifiesta como mediador filosófico. De este modo, en el siguiente examen profundizaremos en la noción plotiniana del Eros a un doble nivel.

As a divine-human society it ‘is not one of the many religious and moral institutions that exist in the world.’ As an incarnated empirical human institution, it simultaneously witnesses against an evil-dominated world, while also witnessing to it being God’s creation and object of redeeming quality. The Church experiences crisis between the world and divine orders but is often unconscious of this because unless it realizes its nature and mission, behaves as if it was just a religious and moral institution.”Save to LibraryDownloadby Bassam Michael  Madany•  7  Globalization, Internet & Society, Christian Apologetics, Satellite CommunicationSacred Womb-Divine Gateway of LifeThroughout many philosophical, spiritual, and scientific traditions, the idea of the "Sacred Womb" has been given significant weight.

After an overview of some examples, this paper analyzes the unusual events of Ephesus in Acts and reflects on the identity of the cloths. This investigation reveals the stark contrast between Paul's ministry in Ephesus and the modern practice of healing cloths. Instead of inaugurating a normal healing device for Christianity, God uses the miracles and Paul's public ministry to lead the Ephesians away from magical practices. While God can do as he sees fit, Christian groups and leaders should avoid seeking to manipulate and control the power of God like the sons of Sceva (Acts 19:13-20).Save to LibraryDownloadby Scott D MacDonald•  11  Theology, New Testament, Systematic Theology, Biblical TheologyGod as Motherly Father and Fatherly Mother[Priscilla Papers 37, no. 3 (Summer 2023): 20–23] What are the implications of insisting that God is “He” but never “She”?

Logically, if referring to God as “She” implies a female goddess with female sexuality, then would not the use of “He” imply a male god with male sexuality?  Patristic (ancient Christian) theologians such as Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329–390) and Jerome (c. 343–420) recognized that God is neither male nor female.  Biblical texts consistently ascribe both masculine and feminine traits to God.  In some languages, including many Nilotic languages in Africa, the name for “God” is grammatically feminine.  Patristic theologizing and contemporary Christian praxis in Africa demonstrate that God who is revealed in Christ can be understood as both “Motherly Father” and “Fatherly Mother.”Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Robert Barron•  6  Patristics, Biblical Theology, Pronouns, African theologyInterreligious Dialogue and The Problem of Truth ClaimsThis article explores why the truth claims emerge and become a serious problem among religions, and how to handle it next to build inter-religious dialogue, especially in the era of pluralism.

He tried to examine the issue of truth claims and how to solve them within the framework of dialogue. This paper is intended to implement concrete steps to overcome the problem of truth claims among religions and strive for mutual understanding to build a pluralistic view of interreligious dialogue in the frame. To overcome the problem of truth claims in religion dialogue, there are three steps that can be done: first, an exclusive view. Both views, inclusive.

However, despite existing efforts in academia to understand criminality, its causes, and rehabilitation programs, there remains a need for further research in specific areas, including the transformative power of Christian religion. Christianity, as a monotheistic faith rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Apostles, emphasizes salvation through grace and the reconciliation of humanity with God. Within this system of beliefs, there are inherent principles of divine transcendence, human responsibility, moral transformation, and social justice. This paper aims to comprehensively explore how Christian religion can contribute to reducing recidivism rates and addressing criminogenic factors, focusing on the promotion of atonement, rehabilitation, and communal ecclesiastical life, supported by relevant studies. By doing so, this paper will offer an effective probe into the matter.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christina Lynch•  11  Religion, History, Criminology, TheologyMoral Debt Owed to Human Victims of Evil: A Gap in Christian TheologyAll evil committed by humans that affects other humans creates two moral debts: a debt/sin against God and a debt against human victims.

Murder, for example, creates a moral debt to multiple human victims: the murdered person (depriving their right to life) and the friends and relatives of the murdered person (causing mourning, anger, misery, despair, depression, and fear).  The Christian doctrine of the atonement only addresses the sins against God because God can only forgive the moral debt owed to God.  Therefore, God’s forgiveness cannot release an evildoer from the moral debts he owes to the human victims of his evil.   Does Christian theology have an answer for resolving the moral debt to human victims?  If not, then how can ultimate justice ever be realized for human victims of evil?  I will explore these topics in this paper.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dennis  Linscomb•  2  The Atonement, Christian TheologyNextLast »Related TopicsTheologyFollowFollowingSystematic TheologyFollowFollowingChristologyFollowFollowingBiblical StudiesFollowFollowingBiblical TheologyFollowFollowingChristian ApologeticsFollowFollowingPhilosophical TheologyFollowFollowingChristian EthicsFollowFollowingHistorical TheologyFollowFollowingTheological HermeneuticsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
