Several high-level strategies devote special priority to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in SIDS, and contemporary literature on ESD has shed light on the most effective approaches for addressing the types of complex sustainability problems facing islands. As a response, the Indian Ocean Commission ISLANDS project has introduced the international Eco-Schools programme as a regional ESD framework, now being mainstreamed through national education systems in several Indian Ocean countries. Given the seriousness of the ESD agenda in SIDS, it is vital that the Eco-Schools Indian Ocean programme can perform at a level where the potential positive impacts of ESD on schools and communities can be realised. This qualitative research study sets out to identify how the changes which the Eco-Schools Indian Ocean partners are working towards on the ground, relate to the requirements of international strategies and contemporary ESD theory. Using in-depth interviews, this research reveals a dominant emancipatory educational paradigm amongst ESD professionals interviewed, and provides insight into the kinds of transformative learning processes which emphasise community collaboration, sustainable citizenship, and critical reflection and action. The study concludes that the Eco-Schools Indian Ocean programme is theoretically capable of delivering the transformative change required by the international strategies and the contemporary ESD field. Finally, this study suggests how this transformative change might be recognisable on the ground, proposing several indicators for evaluation which will be tested during a future collaborative research project in the region.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersChanging Together - Eco Schools (1994-2019)Changing Together - Eco Schools (1994-2019)2019 • Pramod K Sharma, Nicole Andreou, Anna Christine Daa FunderIn 2019, Eco-Schools celebrates 25 years of excellence in the field of Environmental Education (EE) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). It is, to date, the largest school network globally, implemented in over 68 countries, involving over 59,000 schools that engage 20 million students and 1.3 million teachers. This publication is a collection of the many inspiring Eco-Schools stories that have been unfolding all around the globe for the past 25 years since the programme’s inception. This publication is divided into two sections. The first section tells the story of how Eco-Schools was conceptualised, its history and evolution, and also describes the famous “Seven Steps” – one of the most recognised aspects of the programme. The Seven-Step process is the basic framework that guides an Eco-School to plan and implement the learning journey. The steps are intended to be flexible enough to accommodate any school context and environmental theme. The Seven-Step methodology has stood the test of time as an effective pedagogy across different contexts of educational systems, types of schools, cultural and socio-economic conditions. The nature of each of the Seven Steps and the order in which they are implemented allows for incremental change in sustainability literacy through active learning, as the actions of students improve the environmental performance of the whole institution, starting first with their behaviour. This robust pedagogical process empowers students with the drive and confidence to continue to have a positive impact in their bid to make the world a better place to live in. The first section also includes a chapter with a literature review of more than 68 research reports from multiple countries. The results have been synthesised and summarised under four major categories, Academic and Skills Development Changes, Environmental Impact Changes, Behaviour/Attitudinal Change and Whole School Sustainability Programme Approach with selected country case studies highlighted. The second section tells the story of the development of the programme in different member countries. The presentations detail basic information about each country, the status of EE in terms of national legislation, K-12 curriculum and professional development. The different stages of evolution and maturity which the programme is at in different countries is illustrated in the reflections of different stakeholders.Download Free PDFView PDFRegional Strategic Action Plan for Coastal Ecotourism Development in the South Western Indian Ocean2008 • David PicardNational and regional project and policy assessment leading to recommendations to promote ecotourism activities as a livelihood alternative for coastal populations in the South Western Indian Ocean.Download Free PDFView PDFUNESCOIssues and trends in Education for Sustainable Development2018 • Adesuwa Vanessa Agbedahin, Won Jung ByunChapter 1, From Agenda 21 to Target 4.7: the development of ESD, by Alexander Leicht, Bernard Combes, Won Jung Byun and Adesuwa Vanessa Agbedahin, provides an account of this emergence and the development of the concept of ESD. The chapter highlights the two flows of change: the development of ESD examining both the integration of sustainable development into education systems and how education has been embedded in the discourse of sustainable development. It addresses certain international processes that supported the emergence of ESD and shows how these two flows of change laid strong grounds for ESD over the years. Among other things, the chapter addresses the increasing centrality of ESD to the global education discourse, as reflected in the Education 2030 Agenda, and the relevance of education and particularly ESD in relation to the achievement of all the SDGs.Download Free PDFView PDFChapter 2 – Learning to transform the world: key competencies in ESD2018 • Marco RieckmannThis chapter presents ESD as a form of transformative and competence-based education. It describes the competencies that ESD should develop and the action-oriented transformative pedagogy needed to facilitate this process. It also discusses the needs of educators in developing competencies for ESD.Download Free PDFView PDFIssues and trends in Education for Sustainable DevelopmentChapter 3 – Key themes in education for sustainable development2018 • Marco RieckmannWhile the acquisition of sustainability competencies is at the core of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), the choice of topics and content used for developing these competencies is not arbitrary. Key themes of ESD are crucial for sustainable development processes at the local and/or global level, and their selection has implications for the future.Download Free PDFView PDFEducation for Sustainable Development in Primary and Secondary EducationAaron BenavotThis paper examines, from a global perspective, developments related to education for sustainable development (ESD) in primary and secondary education during the past decade (2005-2014). It focuses on the evolving policy context for ESD and explores the extent to which, and the ways in which, countries are committed to integrating ESD in their education systems. It pays particular attention to the actual implementation of ESD policies, initiatives and programs in national education systems and in local schools, especially in the curriculum of primary and secondary education. The paper draws upon peer-reviewed journal articles, policy documents published by UNESCO and other international agencies, and several comparative databases reporting evidence on ESD topics. It also analyses a diverse array of national and regional documents. In primary and secondary education, in particular, indications of increasing policy attention to ESD are apparent. And yet, while policy attention to ESD has strengthened, many countries either lack an ESD policy or a viable one. Limited financial resources, and a weak global economy, have constrained the implementation of national ESD commitments. Support from international donors, NGOs and the private sector is considered critical for the successful ESD implementation. A large and diverse array of ESD initiatives has been implemented in primary and secondary schools around the world since 2005. These initiatives range from large-scale trans-national programs and national reforms to small community projects, from NGO initiatives across many schools to teacher-led projects in individual schools. Many SD initiatives in schools primarily focus on the environmental components of ESD; quite a few emerged from earlier programs in environmental education. Moreover, the coverage, scope and depth of SD issues in school curricula have increased significantly. Recent comparative assessments highlight the variability of student knowledge of, and engagement with, ESD topics, especially in secondary educationDownload Free PDFView PDFMartin 2011 The Creolization of EE in Seychelles phd dissMichele MartinDownload Free PDFView PDFPicard, D. (2015). Making ecotourism sustainable: Refocusing on economic viability. Journal of Sustainable Tourism. doi: 10.1080/09669582.2015.1019512 David PicardEcotourism has become the focal point of a wide range of private and public sector development initiatives in the countries of the Western Indian Ocean. The 2008 “Regional Strategic Action Plan for Coastal Ecotourism Development in the South Western Indian Ocean” aimed at both a strategic assessment of current achievements and the development of recommendations for policy action. Drawing on the research data initially gathered for this report, the article demonstrates the importance of fostering criteria for ensuring medium and long-term economic viability in the assessment of sustainable ecotourism development performance, both at micro- and macro-economic levels. The arguments are presented in the form of eight lessons learnt, and the article approaches the question of economic viability at the different levels of enterprises, projects and products, and in terms of public policy and planning.Download Free PDFView PDFA MORPHOGENIC AND LAMINATED SYSTEM EXPLANATION OF POSITION-PRACTICE SYSTEMS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING IN MAINSTREAMING EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICAN UNIVERSITIESAdesuwa Vanessa AgbedahinThis research focuses on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), particularly in Africa. It explores the roles and practices of these institutions, especially their professionals, in the Anthropocene era where increasing concern for contemporary environmental and sustainability issues and risks emerge. The study presents a longitudinal case study of institutions and participants of the Swedish/African/Asian International Training Programme (ITP) on ESD in Higher Education (HE), who are mostly university educators. This thesis, however, focuses on African ITP participants only. At a macro level, the research sought to examine how African university educators have contributed to the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD) through their participation in the ITP (which is a change-oriented professional development training programme on ESD) and the associated ESD ‘change projects’. The change projects are ITP participants’ direct attempts to mainstream environment and sustainability issues, concerns, and concepts into core university functions and practices: teaching, research, community engagement, and management operations and policy engagement. At a meso level the study sought insight into how educators in national institutions were supported by sub-regional and regional initiatives, institutions and organisations, including the Mainstreaming of Environment and Sustainability in African (MESA) Universities Partnership programme, especially an initiative supported by the Southern African Development Community Regional Environmental Education Programme to provide (limited) seed funding to three southern African universities to establish what are known as ‘MESA Chairs’, with dedicated time and support for MESA activities in their universities . At a micro level, this research sought to investigate how the position-practice systems and the ITP shape (enable or constrain) effective ESD mainstreaming in higher education, and how the morphogenetic approach and laminated system can be used to understand and explain these dynamics and their relations with meso and macro level engagements. The research sought to understand these dynamics through empirical investigations using survey questionnaires, interviews, document analysis and field visits. The research is constituted as theoretical, conceptual, methodological and analytical exploration using a singular and nested case study research approach, underlaboured by a critical realist ontology, and drawing on a social learning epistemology and social realist morphogenetic interpretive lens. In particular, ontological depth was sought via critical realist laminated system explanation. See Chapter Two for details. This study was carried out in three phases. Phase one encapsulates the investigation of all ITP ESD in higher education alumni who were Asian and African participants from the inception of the ITP to its completion, over a six-year period (2008-2013). This included 280 academics from Asia and Africa in 35 countries in Asia and Africa from 106 institutions in Asia and Africa with their 139 change projects. The outcome of phase one of the research is only included in this thesis as an appendix (see Appendix 3; Agbedahin & Lotz-Sisitka, 2015). However, this phase provided and formed the foundational data that was expanded in phases two and three for the purpose of this study. Phase two of this research concentrated on a less broad population of research participants comprising only all African ITP alumni, from all regions in Africa. The overall data collection and analysis included 162 academics in 23 African countries from 66 institutions with their 81 change projects. The aim was to investigate and provide a morphogenetic explanation of their change projects and how the relationship between participants’ positions and practices (and that of others) may influence ESD mainstreaming in universities. The outcome of this phase two investigation is presented in Chapter Four. In phase three, (nested) case studies of Swaziland, Zambia, and Botswana (in the southern Africa region), which included all the ESD ITP HE participants therein and the three corresponding EE/ESD MESA Chairs, were developed. The population sample in this phase three, therefore, contained 20 academics, from six institutions with their nine change projects. This phase was characterized by field trips to these countries and in-depth data collection and analysis in order to investigate and deepen the morphogenetic explanations of their change projects and how the relationship between participants’ positions and practices (and that of others) have indeed influenced the ESD mainstreaming in universities. The outcome of this phase three research is presented in Chapters Five, Six and Seven. The final Chapter Eight of this thesis focuses on the seven scalar laminated system perspective and reflections on this research and discussion of these perspectives for supporting the mainstreaming of ESD in African higher education institutions and more specifically in the three case countries and respective institutions presented in Chapters Five, Six, and Seven. The seven scalar laminated system is presented in relation to the position-practice system, and draws on morphogenetic social realist and social learning theory to provide perspective on the actual change processes. Chapter Eight also includes a discussion on social learning and its implication for ESD mainstreaming and provides recommendations for further research. The outcome of the theoretical exploration underpinning this study provided a potential model for understanding ESD learning and change processes that are facilitated by professional development training programmes in the context of ESD in HE. This study also provides a model for appraising educational changes in time and in space, especially in relation to ESD, or the types of changes that can be brought about by professional development interventions such as those provided by the ITP and how they can be tracked, monitored and documented. For the field of professional or academic development in higher education, this research highlights the significance of the relationship between position-practice systems, professional development interventions and institutional transformation. For the field of ESD in higher education, this study shows the need for in-depth consideration of the position-practice system and sphere of influence of change agents and related stakeholders in and around their institutions in the design and development of professional development programmes. It further sheds light on the laminated system of factors that contextually constrain and/or enable effective ESD mainstreaming at individual, collective, institutional, national, regional and global levels.Download Free PDFView PDFBraz J Sci Technol Education, sustainability and social learning2016 • Edson Grandisoli, Pedro Roberto Jacobi, Renata Ferraz de ToledoThis article proposes a contribution to the existing debate on social learning as a possible framework that strengthens the role of sustainable actions through educational initiatives as to promote changes in behavior and attitudes in a collective perspective. Sustainability as a new basic and integrative criterion may strengthen collective and solidary values that through contextualized and problem focused educational practices can mobilize students and practitioners to action-reflection-action initiatives on the challenges posed by transformations on environmental issues. Social learning as an approach for the understanding and management of environmental issues has become a relevant interpretative framework in the assessment and management of natural resources. This has implied in a continuous reshaping of the usual roles taken by scientists, policy makers, and citizens in the governance of sustainability. Within this perspective the paper establishes a dialogue with the current literature on education for sustainability from a perspective that dialogues with social learning and adaptive management. Our approach indicates the need of changes to advance in the capacity building of leaderships focused in the premises that lead to the construction of a sustainable society. Universities, NGOs and companies have gradually joined this movement in pursuing more sustainable practices. New arrangement of stakeholders based on cooperation, information exchange, dialogue, and of course, financing, that includes Universities, NGOs and companies is vital for the construction of a new paradigm which must stimulate interdisciplinarity, transversality and more integrated and complex society world views’, strengthening ethical and socioenvironmental responsibilityDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
