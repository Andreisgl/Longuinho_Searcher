Benefits of eculizumab in AQP4+ neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: Subgroup analyses of the randomized controlled phase 3 PREVENT trialMultiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders,  2021BACKGROUND Antibodies to the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel in neuromyelitis optica spectrum di... more BACKGROUND Antibodies to the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are reported to trigger the complement cascade, which is implicated in astrocyte damage and subsequent neuronal injury. The PREVENT study demonstrated that the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab reduces adjudicated relapse risk in patients with anti-AQP4 immunoglobulin G-positive (AQP4+) NMOSD. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab in reducing relapse risk and its safety in AQP4+ NMOSD across clinically relevant subgroups in PREVENT. METHODS In the randomized, double-blind, time-to-event, phase 3 PREVENT trial, 143 adults received eculizumab (maintenance dose, 1200 mg/2 weeks) or placebo (2:1), with stable-dose concomitant immunosuppressive therapy (IST) permitted (except rituximab and mitoxantrone). Post hoc analyses of relapses and adverse events were performed for prespecified and post hoc subgroups based on concomitant IST and prior rituximab use, demographic and disease characteristics, and autoimmune comorbidity. RESULTS The significant reduction in relapse risk observed for eculizumab versus placebo in the overall PREVENT population was consistently maintained across subgroups based on concomitant IST and previous rituximab use, age, sex, region, race, time since clinical onset of NMOSD, historical annualized relapse rate, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and history of another autoimmune disorder. The serious infection rate was lower with eculizumab than placebo regardless of rituximab use in the previous year, concomitant IST use, or history of another autoimmune disorder. CONCLUSION Across a wide range of clinically relevant AQP4+ NMOSD patient subgroups in PREVENT, eculizumab therapy was consistently effective versus placebo in reducing relapse risk, with no apparent increase in serious infection rate.

Anti-Yo Antibody Uptake and Interaction with Its Intracellular Target Antigen Causes Purkinje Cell Death in Rat Cerebellar Slice Cultures: A Possible Mechanism for Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration in Humans with Gynecological or Breast CancersPloS one,  2015Anti-Yo antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies reactive with a 62 kDa Purkinje cell... more Anti-Yo antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies reactive with a 62 kDa Purkinje cell cytoplasmic protein. These antibodies are closely associated with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration in the setting of gynecological and breast malignancies. We have previously demonstrated that incubation of rat cerebellar slice cultures with patient sera and cerebrospinal fluid containing anti-Yo antibodies resulted in Purkinje cell death. The present study addressed three fundamental questions regarding the role of anti-Yo antibodies in disease pathogenesis: 1) Whether the Purkinje cell cytotoxicity required binding of anti-Yo antibody to its intraneuronal 62 kDa target antigen; 2) whether Purkinje cell death might be initiated by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity rather than intracellular antibody binding; and 3) whether Purkinje cell death might simply be a more general result of intracellular antibody accumulation, rather than of specific antibody-antigen interaction.

Characterization and Alternative Diagnoses in Patients with False-positive Aquaporin-4 Autoantibody Detection by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (P6.420)Neurology,  2018Objective: To determine rate and characteristics of patients testing positive for autoantibodies ... more Objective: To determine rate and characteristics of patients testing positive for autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) but not meeting diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Background: NMOSD represent a family of inflammatory central nervous system syndromes, variable in both clinical presentation and paraclinical markers, including the presence or absence of autoantibodies, primarily to AQP4. This antibody has been demonstrated to have direct pathogenicity. Seropositivity to AQP4 is predictive of both a higher clinical relapse rate and a favorable response to therapeutics. AQP4 autoantibodies are detected by a variety of methods; the highest sensitivity is achieved with cell-based assays and flow cytometry. Over 80% of patients with this disorder have detectable antibodies to AQP4. However, a minority of patients with positive testing do not meet clinical criteria for NMOSD.

The median mRS score at symptom onset was 3 (interquartile range 2–4), which remained unchanged at follow-up, although less than half (43.2%) of the patients received corticoste...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Characterization and Alternative Diagnoses in Patients with False-positive Aquaporin-4 Autoantibody Detection by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (P6.420)Neurology,  2018Objective: To determine rate and characteristics of patients testing positive for autoantibodies ... more Objective: To determine rate and characteristics of patients testing positive for autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) but not meeting diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Background: NMOSD represent a family of inflammatory central nervous system syndromes, variable in both clinical presentation and paraclinical markers, including the presence or absence of autoantibodies, primarily to AQP4. This antibody has been demonstrated to have direct pathogenicity. Seropositivity to AQP4 is predictive of both a higher clinical relapse rate and a favorable response to therapeutics. AQP4 autoantibodies are detected by a variety of methods; the highest sensitivity is achieved with cell-based assays and flow cytometry. Over 80% of patients with this disorder have detectable antibodies to AQP4. However, a minority of patients with positive testing do not meet clinical criteria for NMOSD. Design/Methods: We queried the medical record at the University of Utah f...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Background: Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE) is a postinfectious condition characterized by extensive demyelination and foci of intracerebral hemorrhage. Although most often a condition of childhood, AHLE can also affect adults, with high morbidity and mortality. Design/Methods: A 44 year old male with history of recent upper respiratory tract infection presented with headache and encephalopathy which progressed to coma within 24 hours. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was notable for lymphocytic pleocytosis. MRI demonstrated multifocal white matter hyperintensities on T2 and FLAIR sequences, and rim enhancement with gadolinium. Gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequences were normal but SWI sequences showed extensive microhemorrhages. Serological studies were notable for elevated immun...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Dimethyl Fumarate in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Effects of Dose Reduction on Lymphopenia (P5.373)Neurology,  2017Objective: Determine the effects of dose reduction in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRM... more Objective: Determine the effects of dose reduction in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients developing lymphopenia while on dimethyl fumarate (DMF) therapy, and monitor the associated clinical course and MRI outcomes. Background: Dimethyl fumarate is an FDA approved first-line therapy to treat adult patients with RRMS. At the standard dose of DMF 240 mg twice daily, lymphopenia of grade 2 or higher is a risk. Dose reduction may lessen the degree of lymphopenia, but it is not known if reduced dose therapy remains effective under these circumstances. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on RRMS patients prescribe with oral DMF from the University of Utah Multiple Sclerosis Clinic database from June 2013 to April 2016. Patients on reduced dose DMF due to lymphopenia were identified and included in this analysis. Results: Of the 105 patients identified through chart review, dose reduction to DMF 240 mg once per day (or less) was found in 6 patients...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Hydrocephalus in Neuromyelitis Optica (P2.270)Neurology,  2014OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical characteristics, type and frequency of hydrocephalus in aquapor... more OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical characteristics, type and frequency of hydrocephalus in aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG seropositive neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders. BACKGROUND: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by relapsing attacks preferentially involving the optic nerves and spinal cord. The disease-specific autoantibody marker of NMO, NMO-immunoglobulin G (IgG), binds to the extracellular domain of the AQP4 water channel which is concentrated in polarized foot processes of astrocytes at CNS tissue -fluid interfaces (blood-brain and brain-cerebrospinal fluid) and encircling glutamatergic synapses and nodes of Ranvier. DESIGN/METHODS: Obstructive hydrocephalus was identified in the index case. We therefore reviewed, with a study neurologist and neuroradiologist, all available head MRIs from AQP4-IgG-seropositive cases identified in the Mayo Clinic NMO clinical biospecimens datab...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Case report: Improvement of GAD65-Associated Autoimmune Epilepsy with Testosterone Replacement Therapy (P2.166)Neurology,  2016OBJECTIVE: Report a unique case of immunotherapy and anti-epileptic drug (AED)-resistant Glutamic... more OBJECTIVE: Report a unique case of immunotherapy and anti-epileptic drug (AED)-resistant Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)-associated autoimmune epilepsy demonstrating improvement with exogenous testosterone replacement. BACKGROUND: Treatment response in autoimmune epilepsy is variable, often dependent on the specific neuronal antibody involved, with GAD65-associated epilepsy amongst the most challenging to treat. There have been reports of improvement in seizure frequency in non-autoimmune epilepsy following administration of testosterone; however, an association between sex steroids and autoimmune epilepsy has not been reported previously. DESIGN/METHODS: Case Report RESULTS: A 47-year-old Caucasian man with treatment refractory GAD65-associated autoimmune epilepsy (CSF and serum GAD65 titer &gt;250 IU/mL) and primary hypogonadism was admitted for long-term video EEG monitoring to objectify the patient9s observation that the testosterone replacement prescribed by his primary ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
AQP4-IgG Assays Comparison in Laboratory Clinical Serivce (S63.004)Neurology,  2014OBJECTIVE: To compare aquaporin-4 IgG assays for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) d... more OBJECTIVE: To compare aquaporin-4 IgG assays for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) diagnosis, 2011-2013. BACKGROUND: Comparative performances of aquaporin-4 IgG-specific assays in a high-throughput clinical laboratory are unknown. DESIGN/METHODS: All patients were initially tested by service aquaporin-4-ELISA (antigen, M1-aquaporin-4). Additional testing was by cell-based assay (CBA, M1-aqupaorin-4, indirect immunofluorescence) and in-house-developed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assays (M1 and M23 isoforms). Results were referenced to pre-test diagnoses. Patient groups comprehensively tested were: Group 1, 388 consecutive Mayo Clinic patients (January-May 2012); Group 2, 615 consecutive Mayo and non-Mayo patients (September 2012); Group 3, 36 patients physician-reported as NMOSD with negative M1-ELISA (2011-2013); Group 4, 41 patients physician-reported as not NMOSD with positive M1-ELISA (2011-2013). FACS results were compared for cells transfected with M...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Quality Improvement Project Studying the Integration of a Proposed Diagnostic Algorithm on Inpatient Encephalitis into the Electronic Medical Record and its Impact on Length of Hospital Stay (P4.9-023)Neurology,  2019Objective: To establish and study a diagnostic algorithm and inpatient order set for improved eva... more Objective: To establish and study a diagnostic algorithm and inpatient order set for improved evaluation of suspected encephalitis on the neurology inpatient service. Background: Encephalitis is a complex and challenging neurologic disease. Over one hundred viruses can cause encephalitis, along with more newly recognized autoimmune and paraneoplastic etiologies. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with encephalitis, rapid and accurate diagnosis is important. Design/Methods: We developed a diagnostic algorithm that incorporates CSF and serum testing, MRI findings, travel exposure, seasonality, immunological status, and clinical factors to streamline diagnostic testing in an efficient manner. We built the inpatient diagnostic order set into the EMR and provided educational training to the Neurology Department. The primary outcome measure of this interim analysis was clinical length of stay. Results: 113 patients with encephalitis were identified in this non-implementatio...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
