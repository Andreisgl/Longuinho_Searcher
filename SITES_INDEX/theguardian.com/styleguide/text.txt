Use this at first mention, a simple title (Lord or Lady) at second mention, and thereafter surname only. Some examples:Andrew Adonis (first mention), Lord Adonis (second mention), Adonis (thereafter).Paddy Ashdown, Lord Ashdown, Ashdown.Sebastian Coe, Lord Coe, Coe.Norman Foster, Lord Foster, Foster.Tony Hall, Lord Hall, Hall.Greville Janner, Lord Janner, Janner.Jenny Jones, Lady Jones, Jones.Martha Lane Fox, Lady Lane-Fox (note hyphen), Lane Fox.Andrew Lloyd Webber, Lord Lloyd-Webber (note hyphen), Lloyd Webber.Peter Mandelson, Lord Mandelson, Mandelson.David Owen, Lord Owen, Owen.John Prescott, Lord Prescott, Prescott.John Reid, Lord Reid, Reid.Richard Rogers, Lord Rogers, Rogers.Chris Smith, Lord Smith, Smith.Sayeeda Warsi, Lady Warsi, Warsi.For people who were not widely known before becoming peers, or who are better known by their title, use a simple title at first mention, and thereafter surname only. Examples:Lord Sewel (first mention), Sewel (thereafter).Lady Stowell, Stowell.Even if you claim to be on good terms with the peer in question, avoid such constructions as “Lady Helena Kennedy” or “Baroness Shirley Williams”: call them Helena Kennedy QC at first mention, then Lady Kennedy, then Kennedy; Shirley Williams, then Lady Williams, then Williams.Do not use Baron, Baroness etc unless there is a particular reason to do so – for example, for satirical or ironic purposes (“Baron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham”).Where two or more peers share the same name, make it clear which one you are writing about, for example:Lola Young, the former actor, artist and academic (first mention), Lady Young of Hornsey (second mention), thereafter Young.Barbara Young, a former chief executive of the Environment Agency and Care Quality Commission (first mention), Lady Young of Old Scone (second mention), thereafter Young.Peers in historical pieces should be given their titles only if they had received them at the time, for example Herbert Asquith’s Liberal government and Margaret Thatcher’s Tory government (not Lord Asquith’s, Lady Thatcher’s) – they had not yet been given peeragespeewitpeking duckpendantnoun; pendent adjectivepeninsulanoun; peninsular adjectivepenknifepenny, pence1p is one penny, not “one pence”pensionersnot “old age pensioners” or “OAPs”; older people is preferable to “elderly people” or (even worse) “the elderly”.While this term is useful in headlines, it should be avoided in text as a description of an individual. As one of our readers notes: “This usage defines older people by their non-participation in the workforce and immediately typifies them as dependents or drains on the public purse. Rupert Murdoch and Michael Caine are never described as ‘pensioners’ because they are perceived as still contributing to the economy, so does the term only apply to the little people?” Reporters should ask what job people used to do and then describe them as a retired banker/powerboat racer or former whatever (including homemaker)peonyflowerpeople-smugglingThe hyphen helps to clarify such sentences as: “The problem of people smuggling between north Africa and Europe has increased”Pepsi-ColaTM; a brand of cola; the company is PepsiCoper cent% in headlines and copypercentage risesseem to give us a lot of problems: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase; any sentence saying “such and such rose or fell by X%” should be considered and checked carefullyperemptorynot open to challenge; perfunctory careless: if you carry out a task in a perfunctory way, you may face peremptory dismissalPérez de Cuéllar, JavierPeruvian diplomat and former UN secretary generalperfect storma perfect cliche, best avoidedperformance-related payPerforming Right Societynot RightspermissiblePeronistssupporters of the nationalist/populist ideology of the late Argentinian president Juan Domingo Perónpersonal equity planswere known as Pepspersonal independence payment (Pip)personsare people in our papers, even if they are the luckiest persons in the worldPerspexTMperspicaciousshrewd; perspicuous easily understoodperuseSome maintain that to peruse is to scrutinise or study carefully, rather than browse or skim, although Samuel Johnson defined it in the latter sense.

Example: “Vada the dolly eke on the bona omee ajax” (Look at the gorgeous face on that nice man over there); “naff” is an example of Polari that has passed into more general use, as are “butch”, “camp” and “dizzy”Polaroidpole positionThe fastest qualifier in a motor race starts from pole position or on pole, alongside one other driver (on occasion, two or more others) on the front row of the grid.Take care if using metaphorically, and do not spell it “poll position”, even in election stories, as we have been known to doPolice FederationNormally no need to use its full title, the Police Federation of England and Wales, but note initial caps.

I will tell you presently – soon – is the traditional British English usage, whereas in American English it means at present, and is usually redundant (“we are presently third in the table”). To avoid ambiguity, say soon when you mean soon, and don’t say anything when you mean now. There is a similar problem with momentarily, which means for a moment or briefly in British English, and very soon to American (and some British) speakers.

Thus a prodigal striker is one who misses lots of chances to score goals, not one who has played for lots of clubs (who will also invariably be described as “much-travelled”)professionStrictly, to enter a profession you need a specific qualification, such as that acquired by a doctor, lawyer, social worker or teacher. As anyone with a mobile, a laptop and a bit of cheek can be a journalist, or at least claim to be one, journalism is not a profession but a trade, craft or racket.

For example: ‘Jones, who uses they, said …’. Alternatively, although they and their are sometimes used in the singular in speech, it may be clearer to rewrite or repeat the person’s name if the use of they/them/their is not explained. For example, “They said the show was brilliant” can simply become “Jones said the show was brilliant”proofreader, proofreadingpropellerprophecynoun; prophesy verbprophetthe prophet Muhammadpros and consproseccoprostitution(see sex worker)protagonistThe person who drives the action, from the ancient Greek meaning “first actor”.
