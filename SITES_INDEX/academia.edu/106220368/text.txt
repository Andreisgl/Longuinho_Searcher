Though the role of the allochthonous component in the North African Neolithic has now been scaled down (see , it remains an indisputable fact that the main botanical and faunal domesticates (with many questions and controversies regarding cattle) entered peripheral African territories from ouside. It is also highly likely that coastal North Africa functioned as a corridor for their penetration and dissemination. Until recently, the eastern mirage prevailed and was implicit in the "Neolithic package" formula referring to wheat, barley, pulses, sheep/goat, cattle and pig thought to have spread together from their original near Eastern locations. Is this model still valid? It must immediately be said that two principal facts have considerably weakened this model. First, there is now an...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersQuaternary InternationalNorthwest Libya from the early to late Holocene: New data on environment and subsistence from the Jebel Gharbi2014 • barbara E barichDownload Free PDFView PDFWas a transition to food production homogeneous along the circum-Mediterranean littoral?

Neolithic of Cyrenaica (north-east Libya): New enlightenments from recent research, Quaternary International 410, p.144-159Elodie de FaucambergeThe research lead by the French Archaeological Mission in Libya and the Cyrenaican Prehistory Project (CPP) in the beginning of the 21st century, added to those realized by McBurney in the middle of the 20th century, gathered important information on the Neolithic and the Neolithisation of Cyrenaica, the region of northeast Libya. Despite numerous unknown which will have to be resolved by future investigations, it already appears that pottery production and animal domestication of ovicaprines started very early in that area. These data were obtained for the first time at the site of Haua Fteah, a huge cave excavated in the 1950s and nearly fifty years later by the University of Cambridge. The discoveries made on the new site of Abu Tamsa confirm that the Neolithic began in north Cyrenaica as early as the beginning of the 8th millennium cal BP. The elements we possess indicate that this Libyan region had many traits in common with the eastern regions from where people obtained domesticated animals and shared technological lithic practices. Nonetheless, although the influence of Egypt is present, the local character of the industries dominates. The study of the Neolithic assemblage of Abu Tamsa indicates that there are no visible contacts with the Maghreb Capsian in the west, a hypothesis first supported by McBurney for Haua Fteah's Holocene industries.Download Free PDFView PDF Archaeology of Food - New Data from International Missions In Africa and Asia - Serie Orientale Roma, n.s. 17, Rome,  Scienze e LettereBarbara E. Barich , "Herder-Foragers and Low-Level Food Producers. Some Insights into the early Food Production in Northern Africa"2019 • Barbara BarichRecent research perspectives which highlight the long lasting process undertaken by the Near East communities towards domestication allows us to establish comparisons with similar North African situations. The article starts recalling the main characteristics of plants and animals used by the Holocene groups distributed along the southern mediterranean coast. It then proceeds focusing on the main archaeological sequences, both in the Southern Levant and in the Libyan and Egyptian Sahara which, beginnings from the early Holocene, offer the oldest proofs of domestication and/or management of wild species. In both cases the evidence of the long period elapsed between the first domestication attempts and the full establishment of agricultural/pastoral production, urges us to recognize in this period the intermediate stage that in anthropology is called “LowLevel Food Production”. The consideration of this “middle ground” fully grasps the identity of the North African groups allowing to better clarify its characterizing elements, expression of a complete and autonomous economic and social space that the definition of foragers-herders no longer could adequately describe.Download Free PDFView PDFThe exploitation of wild plants in Neolithic North Africa.

In contrast to its well-investigated history from the first millennium BC onward, its antecedent dynamics are very poorly understood, and deeper archaeological histories of the Mediterranean therefore remain unbalanced and incomplete. This paper draws on a new surge in data to present the first up-to-date interpretative synthesis of this region's archaeology from the start of the Holocene until the threshold of the Iron Age (9600-1000 bc). It presents the evidence for climatic, environmental and sea-level change, followed by analysis of the chronological and spatial patterning of all radiocarbon dates from Mediter-ranean Africa, brought together for the first time. The principal exploration then divides into three phases. During Phase 1 (9600-6200 bc) diverse forms of hunting, gathering and foraging were ubiquitous. Phase 2 (6200-4000 bc) witnessed more continuity than elsewhere in the Mediterranean, but also the widespread uptake of domesticated livestock and gradual evolution of herding societies, as well as limited enclaves of farming. Phase 3 (4000-1000 bc) has been least explored, outside developments in Egypt; in the east this phase witnessed the emergence of fully nomadic and transhumant pastoralism, with political superstructures, while trajectories in the west remain obscure, but in parts of the Maghreb suggest complex possibilities. Contacts with the Mediterranean maritime world grew during the third and second millennia bc, while interaction to the south was transformed by desertification. Understanding how the southern Mediterranean shore was drawn into Iron Age networks will require much better knowledge of its indigenous societies. The present constitutes a pivotal moment, in terms of accumulated knowledge, pathways for future investigation and engagement with a challenging current geopolitical situation.Download Free PDFView PDFAfrican Archaeological ReviewNew Light on the Silent Millennia: Mediterranean Africa, ca. 4000–900 BCGiulio LucariniThe so-called neolithization process (ca. 6000/5500–4000 BC) in Mediterranean Africa and the Sahara has been increasingly researched in recent years. In contrast, relatively little is known, especially in Mediterranean Africa, of the period between the beginnings of irreversible climatic deterioration in the Sahara, around 4000–3500 BC, and the onset of Iron Age to broadly Classical times. Why, with the exception of the Nile Delta, is our knowledge of the period between the fourth millennium BC and the threshold of the first Iron Age Phoenician and Greek colonies so limited? To what extent can this information gap be attributed to aridification in the Mediterranean zone, or is it rather a product of the failure to look for the right kinds of materials and sites, and of their relative visibility? In order to answer these questions, this paper focuses specifically on Mediterranean Africa (with the exception of Egypt) from about 4000 BC to ca. 900 BC. It is mainly based on the data mad...Download Free PDFView PDFUse-wear and residue analysis of non-knapped stone tools from the Haua Fteah cave , Cyrenaica , Libya2016 • Huw BartonThe origin of food production is one of the key themes in North African pre-/proto-history. In recent years the orthodox model, that domesticated plants and animals were introduced by maritime Neolithic colonists from the Near East, has been increasingly challenged, and a component of autonomous development independent of the Near East acknowledged (Barker, 2009; Bellwood, 2005; Krzyżaniak and Kobusiewicz, 1984; Smith, 2005). However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the nature and extent of, and interplay between, internal and external dynamics in the beginnings of food production across North Africa. It is commonly accepted that domestic caprines from the Near East were introduced into North Africa at the end of the 9 th millennium cal BP (Gautier 2014; Linseele et al., 2010; Vermeersch et al. 2015). The new species came into contact with existing subsistence systems mainly based on an intensive exploitation of different wild resouces, mainly local wild grasses, e.g. s...Download Free PDFView PDFQuaternary InternationalFirst direct evidence of wild plant grinding process from the Holocene Sahara: Use-wear and plant micro-residue analysis on ground stone tools from the Farafra Oasis, Egypt2019 • Giulio LucariniThe excavation of the 8000-year-old Hidden Valley village has highlighted the importance of wild plant exploitation in the Mid-Holocene contexts of the Farafra Oasis. This site yielded high numbers of plant macro-remains, which were analysed during the early 2000s by A.G. Fahmy. Among these, Sorghum and other species of wild grasses, often found charred in the fireplaces of the site, prevail; together with the assemblage from E−75-6 (Nabta Playa) these represent the oldest evidence of wild Sorghum exploitation in the Eastern Sahara. Hidden Valley village has also yielded one of the largest assemblages of grinding implements for the whole of North Africa, which, until recent times, had been analysed only from a techno-typological perspective. The general assumption of a direct link between grinding tools and plant exploitation has been tested, and challenged using, for the first time for North African contexts, an integrated method, carried out on the actual tools, combining low-and high-power use-wear and plant micro-residue analyses. Firstly, micro-residues (mainly starch granules and phytoliths) were extracted from the Hidden Valley grinding tools, and analysed by means of a high magnification transmitted-light microscope. The identification of the plant micro-fossils was based upon the 'visual matching' of morphological characteristics with those of a purpose-built reference collection of modern starch granules and phytoliths. Then, tool micro-topography and use-wear traces were analysed both using a low-and high-power approach in order to detect the possible presence of macro-and micro-wear associated with plant exploitation. The grinding stones analysed showed very developed wear mainly consistent with plant processing activities. The same artefacts also yielded starch granules, sometimes in large quantities, together with a lower number of phytoliths. A number of plant tribes from the grass family Poaceae were represented in the micro-remain assemblage. Our results integrate and complement the previous archaeobotanical work carried out on the plant macro-remains from this site and stress the important role played by grinding tools in the processing activities of the variety of wild grasses that were consumed as staple food by Eastern Saharan communities during the Holocene.Download Free PDFView PDFNew Data on Plant Use in the Eastern Sahara: The Macro-Remain Assemblage from Sheikh el-Obeiyid Villages and Bir el-Obeiyid Playa, Farafra Oasis, Egyptian Western DesertNew Data on Plant Use in the Eastern Sahara: The Macro-Remain Assemblage from Sheikh el-Obeiyid Villages and Bir el-Obeiyid Playa, Farafra Oasis, Egyptian Western Desert2021 • sherief elshafaeyThis article discusses archaeobotanical evidence from two Sheikh el-Obeiyid villages and the Bir el-Obeiyid playa, which are located along the course of the Wadi el-Obeiyid and on the top and escarpment of the Northern Plateau, at the northern edge of the Farafra Oasis, Egypt. The villages and playa are both part of a settlement system which developed from the top of the plateau, through its various erosion surfaces, down to the bottom of the wadi. The villages in particular can be considered as seasonal base camps, populated by semi-sedentary groups who engaged in intensive exploitation of the resources available in the surrounding environment during the early and mid-Holocene. These sites can be compared to the better-known Hidden Valley village site located only 20 km to the east, the remains from which were analysed during the early 2000s by Ahmed G. Fahmy. At all the sites investigated to date in Farafra there is clear evidence for gathering and use of sorghum and other species of small-seeded wild grasses, fitting the emerging patterns of intense wild grass exploitation in attractive ecological zones for the eastern Sahara during the 9th-6th millennia BP.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
