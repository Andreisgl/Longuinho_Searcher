The approach requires researchers and implementing partners to learn new skills and build new capacities as they work in multistakeholder teams. Capacity development is central to programs utilizing RinD, both to ensure quality engagement with stakeholders and to enable capacity to innovate as an outcome. In this working paper, the authors share learning from the implementation of a systems approach to capacity development in the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) over 3 years in five geographies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Conceptual models for developing and delivering high-yielding varieties have proven inadequate for delivering natural resource management (NRM) technologies that are adopted in farmers&#39; fields. Successful INRM requires tools and approaches that can blend the technical with the social, so that people from different disciplines and social backgrounds can effectively work and communicate with each other. This paper develops the &quot;follow-the-technology&quot; (FTT) approach to catalyzing, managing, and evaluating rural technology change as a framework that both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; scientists can wo...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Adoption of ISC increased from 44 participating farmers in four pilot areas to more than 500 farmers in 16 villages and hamlets in three seasons. On average, farmers adopted 3.25 different Striga control options from a basket of six &apos;&apos;best bets&apos;&apos;. Resource-poor and -medium farmers were more likely to adopt than resource-rich ones. Adopting farmers enjoyed livelihood improvements, largely through selling ISC soybean. Women in most adopting households benefited through selling food products based on soybean. Adoption of ISC can be attributed to four factors: (1) farmer-field-school-type training that explained how the technologies worked; (2) incorporation of at least one technology in the ISC package that gave quick benefits to sustain farmer interest in adopting and learning other components whose effects took longer to become evident; (3) allowance f...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To achieve this goal, we need to understand how innovation happens; yet innovation histories are rarely written down. The innovation history method allows those involved in the process to reflect and use their experiences to improve future performance. Comparing and contrasting several innovation histories can also help to identify factors and approaches that lead to success, and those that may need improving. This Brief describes a methodology for recording and learning from innovation histories that is currently being developed at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, when we finish our training most of us believe that it is our job to conceptualize designs, develop products and worry little about what happens after they have been introduced. Our courses are generally too practical to bother with theories about how innovation occurs, who it affects and how we might better manage the process. Diesel, inventor of the diesel engine, distinguished between two phases in technological progress: the conception and carrying out of the idea, which is a happy period of creative mental work in which technical challenges are overcome, and the introduction of the innovation, which is a “struggle against stupidity and envy, apathy and evil, secret opposition and open conflict of interests, a horrible period of struggle with man, a martyrdom even if success ensues” (as quoted by Mokyr, 1990, p. 155). Diesel is perhaps overstating the difficulties of managing innovation, but nevertheless as ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Challenges for these agencies include: i) monitoring and evaluating changes in capacity to innovate (C2I) at individual and community level as a result of their interventions; and ii) using the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) process as a means for all stakeholders in ARD to learn about what favours and constrains local innovation. Usually, the intervening ARD actors develop the M&E approaches, criteria and indicators to use. In order to better understand the factors that influence C2I from the perspective of small-scale farmers, a mini-study was carried out among 12 such farmers who showcased their innovations at the West African Farmer Innovation Fair in May 2015. The study explored what they saw as the main factors that strengthened local C2I. Semi-struct...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It seeks to share learning about how the approach is working in context and to explore the outcomes it is achieving through initial implementation over 3 Â½ years. This learning can inform continuation of agricultural research in the second phase of the CGIAR research programs and will be useful to others aiming to implement research programs that seek to equitably build capacity to innovate in complex social-ecological systems. Each of the chapters in this working paper have shown that RinD has produced a range of outcomes that were often unexpected and broader in scope than might result from other approaches to agricultural research. RinD also produces innovations, and there is evidence that it builds capacity to innovate.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Developing complexity-aware program monitoring and evaluation systems within existing organizations is difficult because they challenge traditional orthodoxy. Little has been written about the practical experience of doing so. This article describes the development of a complexity-aware evaluation approach in the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems. We outline the design and methods used including trend lines, panel data, after action reviews, building and testing theories of change, outcome evidencing and realist synthesis. We identify and describe a set of design principles for developing complexity-aware program monitoring and evaluation. Finally, we discuss important lessons and recommendations for other programs facing similar challenges.

Over the years, a range of effective component technologies has been identified for Striga control in Africa. The potential of these technologies has been demonstrated under researcher-managed conditions. To promote farmer testing of the technologies, community workshops were conducted in 42 rural communities in Kaduna State, northern Nigeria. These revealed that agriculture was the main source of livelihood for most households. The three most important crops, maize, sorghum and pearl millet are attacked by S. hermonthica, regarded as the major constraint to crop production, often causing 70–100% crop loss. Farmers recognised two types of Striga damage (underground and aboveground), with greater damage being caused by underground Striga.
