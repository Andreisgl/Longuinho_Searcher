It traces the development of Nietzsche’s thought in order to expose how nihilism came to be Nietzsche’ central concern. Then it examines the vexing question of what exactly Nietzsche takes to be the core of nihilism. Sometimes Nietzsche treats nihilism as a belief; at other times he seems to treat it as an affective disorder. Similarly, regarding Nietzsche’s notion of the affirmation of life, his antidote to nihilism. It remains unclear whether this is a matter of adopting some cognitive attitude, for instance affirming the eternal recurrence of life, or, of adopting a form of life that does not involve the repression of our fundamental drives. Throughout the paper the question of Nietzsche’s attitude to the relation between myth, nihilism and affirmation is examined. This sheds light on both his relationship to Wagner and the ambition behind his Thus spoke Zarathustra, the work he took to be his most important.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEuropean Journal of PhilosophyNihilism and the Affirmation of Life: A Review of and Dialogue with Bernard Reginster 2008 • Ken GemesDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Journal of PhilosophyNihilism and the Affirmation of Life: A Review of and Dialogue with Bernard Reginster 12008 • Ken GemesDownload Free PDFView PDFMetaphysician, Philosopher, Psychologist?—Making Sense of Nietzsche’s Sense-MakingManuel DriesThis paper argues that Moore’s compelling reading of Nietzsche as a metaphysician in The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things (EMM) largely ignores Nietzsche’s philosopher-psychologist approach to metaphysical, general sense-making. Nietzsche’s metaphysical sense-making is often psychologically framed, i.e. sense is made of sense-making as the expression of specific psychological perspectives and types. Nietzsche’s own most general “acts of sense-making,” such as the will to power, nihilism, and eternal return, often need to be interpreted as targeting specific perspectives and types with the goal of affecting their values. Section 2 considers Moore’s definition of metaphysics and asks what evidence there is that Nietzsche is a metaphysician in his inclusivistic sense. Section 3 provides evidence that Nietzsche pursues a psychological project and introduces the idea of “psychological framing.” Sections 4–6 argue that Moore takes will to power (4), nihilism as suffering (5), and eternal return (6) as Nietzsche’s own, most general “metaphysical” sense-making, thereby neglecting the philosopher-psychologist who may elude Moore’s inclusivist conception of metaphysics.Download Free PDFView PDFTraversing the ethics of fantasy2018 • Aron SuttnerM.A. (Philosophy)Abstract: In this paper by way of examining topics in Nietzsche as well as Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, I discuss possible methods to overcome the problem of nihilism. I begin this thesis by analysing nihilism and decadence. I argue we should read nihilism and decadence alongside psychoanalytic anxiety. This allows us to view nihilism, like anxiety, as a process and an experience that we often go through. It also explains why nihilism is so often resisted, for it is accompanied by anxiety. This sets the tone of the paper, as in each chapter, I compare topics in Nietzsche’s moral philosophy and psychoanalysis. In the second chapter, I move onto a discussion of bad conscience and its relation to Freudian neurosis. I argue that we should view Nietzsche’s account of the economy of punishment and Freud’s myth of the primal father as psychic reality rather than anthropological fact. This allows us to uphold the prescience of Nietzsche and Freud’s theories whilst ...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Fatality of ModernityAlexander DoddA rather bucolic farewell to academia that analyses Nietzsche's interpretation of modern human society.Download Free PDFView PDFLife-denial versus life-affirmation: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on pessimism and asceticism2012 • Christopher Janaway, Ken GemesDownload Free PDFView PDFThe MonistNietzsche as a Critic of Genealogical Debunking: Making Room for Naturalism Without Subversion (in: The Monist)2019 • Matthieu Queloz, Damian CueniThis paper argues that Nietzsche is a critic of just the kind of genealogical debunking he is popularly associated with. We begin by showing that interpretations of Nietzsche which see him as engaging in genealogical debunking turn him into an advocate of nihilism, for on his own premises, any truthful genealogical inquiry into our values is going to uncover what most of his contemporaries deem objectionable origins and thus license global genealogical debunking. To escape nihilism and make room for naturalism without indiscriminate subversion, we then argue, Nietzsche targets the way of thinking about values that permits genealogical debunking: far from trying to subvert values simply by uncovering their origins, Nietzsche is actively criticising genealogical debunking thus understood. Finally, we draw out the consequences of our reading for Nietzsche's positive vision.Download Free PDFView PDFNietzsche's ModernismAdam Rosen-CaroleDownload Free PDFView PDFBlackwell Companion to 19th Century Philosophy, ed.
