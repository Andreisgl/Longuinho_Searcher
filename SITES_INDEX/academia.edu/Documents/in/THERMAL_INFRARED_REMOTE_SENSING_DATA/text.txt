Satellite remote sensing has been effectively used to distinguish relatively intact and degraded forests at a number of scales. However, the utility of remote sensing data for rapid and cost-effective assessments of habitat intactness across large arid regions has not been adequately tested. To this end, we tested the ability of TM imagery to rapidly discriminate different levels of habitat degradation across large regions of the Chihuahuan Desert. We were able to identify relatively intact habitat in many cases. However, degraded habitat was often misidentified as relatively intact. The use of both mid- and late-season imagery provides some improvement by highlighting phenological differences among the intactness classes. Overall, low vegetation cover and inter- and intra-seasonal variability diminish the utility of TM imagery for large-scale conservation planning in the Chihuahuan Desert.Save to LibraryDownloadby jesus reyna•  17  Earth Sciences, Remote Sensing, Arid environments, Satellite remote sensingThe delineation of agricultural management zones with high resolution remotely sensed dataAbstract Remote sensing (RS) techniques have been widely considered to be a prom-ising source of information for land management decisions.

Many models of snow albedo represent snow crystals by spheres of surface/volume (S/V) ratio equal to that of snow crystals. However, the actual S/V ratio of snow has never been measured simultaneously with the albedo, for a thorough test of models. Using CH4 adsorption at 77 K, we have measured the specific surface area (SSA) of snow samples, i.e. its ratio S/(V · ρ), where ρ is the density of ice, together with the snow spectral albedo using a field radiometer with nadir viewing, at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. Tests are performed at 1310, 1629, 1740 and 2260 nm, and we find a good correlation between the SSA and the snow spectral albedo in the SWIR (linear correlation coefficient R2 > 0.98 for the last 3 wavelengths). Snow samples having varied crystals shapes such as rounded crystals in windpacks and hollow faceted crystals in depth hoar were studied and crystal shape did not affect the correlation in a detectable manner. An interest in using SSA rather than crystal size to predict SWIR albedo is that the reflectance of large hollow crystals such as depth hoar or surface hoar will be correctly predicted from their SSA, while considering their large dimensions would underestimate reflectance. We compare these correlations to those predicted by commonly used optical models. The best agreement is found when we compare our data to the modeled hemispheric reflectance, corrected by an adjustable factor that shows a small wavelength dependence. We propose that, once these results have been confirmed by more studies, it may be possible to design a rapid and simple optical method to measure snow SSA in the field. Our results may also allow a more detailed use of remote sensing data to study snow metamorphism, air–snow exchanges of gases, and climate.Save to LibraryDownloadby rosamaria salvatori•  9  Civil Engineering, SNOW, Specific surface area, InfraredMapping dominant vegetation communities at Meili Snow Mountain, Yunnan Province, China using satellite imagery and plant community dataSave to LibraryDownloadby Lieven  Verbeke•  7  Remote Sensing, Stratification, Geomatic Engineering, Satellite ImageryClassification using ASTER data and SVM algorithmsSave to LibraryDownloadby Dan G Blumberg•  10  Image Classification, New Technology, Case Study, Geomatic EngineeringGeological and geomorphological evolution of the Etna volcano NE flank and relationships between lava flow invasions and erosional processes in the Alcantara Valley (Italy)Save to LibraryDownloadby Stefano Branca•  25  Geology, Geomorphology, Stratigraphy, Remote SensingPotentiality of multi-sensor satellite data in mapping flood hazardSave to LibraryDownloadby Ramesh P.

In particular, it’s the friable asbestos the most dangerous element, above all as for the easily dispersing fibres. Despite the above mentioned risks, the number of asbestos covered block is still high in many nations, in particular they are buildings characterized by eternit coverings (a mixture of cement and asbestos), certainly due to the features of materials and their low cost.Various legislations implement reclamation works on the asbestos roofs, but in several countries building farms keep on using such material, despite it’s forbidden to them. The present work has as objective one to supply a cheap tool for the automatic identifying with the buildings which do use for its covering of this very dangerous technology; they are taken back three alternative methodologies of development of the tool, everyone working on remote sensed images and of a procedure of specific classification for the problems in exam, skilled actually turned out to offer useful on the applicatory plan. In the specific one the three configurations melt their work on the comparison between the spectrum of a building, spatially considered well known, characterized by covering in cement-asbestos with the spectrum of the pure material obtained from laboratory measures.From such comparison it is generated, in the first two cases, the building and the implementation of a suitable operator that through the estimate of an opportune equalization coefficient (built respectively using the neural nets and the ionized plasma (electromagnetic fields)), it allows to identify in automatic way the present coverings on the territory and therefore proceed to the next phase of pixel-oriented classification of the whole image.The last methodology is responsible for making a comparison between the classifications obtained with the methodologies preceding (pixel-oriented) and that coming from the use of an object-oriented method consisting in a Nearest Neighbor classification tool following a multi-resolution segmentation worked on the whole scene.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giuliana Bilotta•  12  Image Analysis, Neural Network, Legislation, Feature DetectionSatellite Data Methods and Application in the Evaluation of War Outcomes: Abandoned Agricultural Land in Bosnia-Herzegovina After the 1992–1995 ConflictSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank Witmer•  11  Human Geography, Remote Sensing, Image Analysis, SeasonalityUsing single- and multi-target regression trees and ensembles to model a compound index of vegetation conditionSave to LibraryDownloadby Matt White•  18  Machine Learning, Multidisciplinary, Ecological Modelling, Ensemble MethodsRandom Forests for land cover classificationSave to LibraryDownloadby Jón Atli Benediktsson•  12  Cognitive Science, Remote Sensing, Decision Trees, Random ForestUnderstanding alpine tree line dynamics: An individual-based modelSave to LibraryDownloadby Erich Tasser and +2Gudrun WallentinUlrike  Tappeiner•  21  Climate Change, Seed Dispersal, Environmental Change, MultidisciplinaryEstimation of tree canopy cover in evergreen oak woodlands using remote sensingSave to LibraryDownloadby João Pereira•  23  Remote Sensing, Forest Ecology And Management, Biological Sciences, Environmental SciencesAccuracy comparison of various remote sensing data sources in the retrieval of forest stand attributesSave to LibraryDownloadby Marcus Engdahl•  17  Remote Sensing, Data Analysis, Forest Ecology And Management, Forest EcologyPatterns of variability of sea surface chlorophyll in the Mozambique Channel: A quantitative approachWe analyse the coupling between sea surface chlorophyll concentration (CC) and the physical environment in the Mozambique Channel (MZC) using statistical models.

Seasonal and interannual patterns are studied along with the role of mesoscale dynamics on enhancement and concentration processes for phytoplankton. We use SeaWifs data for CC and two other remotely sensed data sets, TMMI for sea surface temperature (SST) and merged altimetry products for sea level anomaly and geostrophic current. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) on SSC and SST show strong seasonality and partition the MZC into three distinct sub-areas. The chlorophyll variability is mostly driven by seasonality, but more in the North (10°S–16°S) and South (24°S–30°S), and explains respectively 64% and 82% of the CC variance. In the Central part (16°S–24°S), the seasonal signal has less influence (60% variance). There, complex EOFs on Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) highlight the role of mesoscale activity (i.e. eddies and fil...Save to LibraryDownloadby Francis Marsac•  13  Oceanography, Sea surface temperature, Seasonality, Generalized Additive ModelWave and wind retrieval from SAR images of the oceanSave to LibraryDownloadby René Garello•  10  Remote Sensing, Ocean Circulation, Synthetic Aperture Radar, Inverse ProblemUtilidad de imágenes Landsat 7 ETM+ de diferentes fechas para la estimación de biomasa aérea en bosques subtropicales secos de ArgentinaSave to LibraryDownloadby Nestor Ignacio Gasparri and +1J.

The major geomorphic units identified in the area are, alluvial plain, sand dunes, palaeo channels and the Ghagar flood plain. The study area being part of alluvial plain has good to excellent ground water prospects. Field observations showed that ground water occurs under both confined and unconfined conditions with water table at shallow depth. The area on either side of the Ghagar river and along the major canals (about 46% of the total geographical area in the block) have good quality of ground water and is suitable for irrigation, whereas the water quality is marginal (sodic) in 52 per cent area of the block..Save to LibraryDownloadby Manoj Sharma•  10  Geomorphology, Hydrogeology, Water quality, Case StudyAutomated analysis of ultra high resolution remote sensing data for biotope type mapping: new possibilities and challengesSave to LibraryDownloadby Manfred Ehlers and +1Monika Gähler•  12  Remote Sensing, Environmental Monitoring, Scanner Data, Geomatic EngineeringErosion study of a part of Majuli River-Island using remote sensing dataMajuli, the world’s largest river island, is situated in mid of river Brahmaputra in Assam.

River Brahmaputra flows in highly braided channels most of them are transient in nature, being submerged during high monsoon flows and changing drastically their geometry and location. Majuli island, home of about 1.3 million people is endangered because of the erratic behavior of the river. In this study, an attempt has been made to observe the trends of erosion in a small part of Majuli island, the area near Kaniajan village in south Majuli- a stretch of about 11 km, using satellite data of 1991, 1997 and 1998. Image processing of digital data has been done in ILWIS software. Supervised for delineation of river from land and then change detection analysis has been done to find out changes in river course from 1991 to 1997 and further from 1997 to 1998. Erosion and deposition maps of the area have been prepared and the erosion of island is measured at various sections at 1 km interval. Erosion of 1900 ha has been observed during the period of six years from 1991 to 1997 and 845 ha during the period of one year from 1997 to 1998.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pankaj Mani•  5  Image Processing, Change detection, Geomatic Engineering, Satellite DataA prototype for pipeline routing using remotely sensed data and geographic information system analysisA prototype least cost analysis was performed for pipeline routing using remotely sensed data and GIS analysis.

A small section of the proposed Caspian oil pipeline was chosen for development of the prototype. The entire proposed 700-km Caspian pipeline would connect with existing pipelines and carry oil from the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan, on the Caspian Sea, to Novorossiysk in Russia, on the Black Sea. A model was developed incorporating pipeline length, topography, geology, land use, and stream, wetland, road, and railroad crossings to identify a least cost pathway. Satellite remote sensing imagery was used as a base to display results and to define the land cover. Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis was used for spatial modeling and data overlay. Costs associated with terrain conditions, geology, and land use were calculated from actual costs on a recent Bechtel pipeline project. The length and cost associated with a straight line path between four predetermined points along a section of the pipeline were compared with the length and cost of the least cost pathway. The straight line path was 42 km long, and the least cost pathway was 51 km long. Although longer in length, the least cost pathway (in the area considered) is 14% less expensive to construct than the straight line path. The least cost pathway realizes savings principally by avoiding higher cost urban and industrial cells on the straight line route. The results of this analysis demonstrate the benefits of integrating remotely sensed data with GIS analysis as a first look for pipeline routing.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas Ahl•  9  Remote Sensing, Satellite remote sensing, Land Cover, Land UseUrbanization in India – Spatiotemporal analysis using remote sensing dataSave to LibraryDownloadby Stefan Dech•  22  Remote Sensing, Spatial Analysis, Time Series, Urban And Regional PlanningA review of assessing the accuracy of classifications of remotely sensed dataThis paper reviews the necessary considerations and available techniques for assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed data.
