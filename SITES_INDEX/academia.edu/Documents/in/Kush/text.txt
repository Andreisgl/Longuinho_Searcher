The text records in 159 lines covering all four sides of the stela the conquest of Egypt by the Kushite king about c. 734 B.C., Piankhy's 20th regnal year. The text is one of the most elaborated texts in Egyptian language describing Egyptian siege warfare and pitched battles. In his 20th regnal year Piankhy was in control of Upper Egypt with an army stationed there. Nimlot, the King of Hermopolis (Middle Egypt), had been subjugated to Piankhy. Meanwhile, in the Western Delta, Tefnakht, the great chief of the Me(shwesh), extended his conquests Eastward, subjugating the Central and Eastern Delta , subsequently he threatened the Kingdom of Heracleopolis. When Nimlot, the ruler of Hermopolis, defected and subjugated himself voluntarily to Tefnakht, Piankhy decided to intervene in Egypt. Immediately he ordered his army commanders which were stationed in Egypt, to harass the districts of Hermopolis, blockade its capital, cut it off from food supplies, and prevent the movement of large groups of people until the main body of the army could get organized and retaliate. In the meantime Piankhy recruited a considerable army and sent it to Egypt as reinforcement to the troops who were already acting there.  This article will deal mainly with Piankhy's orders to this army and their execution. From the nature of these orders it is possible to deduce that: 1.The Kushite fighting methods fit the social structure of an organized kingdom.2.A comparison of Piankhy's orders with their (partial) execution in the field hints to the authenticity of the orders."Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan'el Kahn•  7  Egyptian History, Kush, 25th Dynasty (Egyptology), TefnakhtTefnakht’s “letter of submission” to PiankhySave to LibraryDownloadby Dan'el Kahn•  6  Egyptian History, Kush, 25th Dynasty (Egyptology), TefnakhtDevi Sita - The Silent Power of Suffering and SacrificeAll versions of the Ramayana are unanimous in reiterating Sita Ji's fidelity and devotion towards Rama even in times of extreme adversity.

For example, when Shri Rama is preparing to go to exile in the forest all alone, she addresses him thus: "O son of an illustrious monarch, a father, a mother, a brother, a son or a daughter-in-law, all enjoy the fruit of their karma individually and receive what is their due. It is only the wife who actually shares the fortunes of her husband.

The high priests of Amun of Thebes had risen to power during the century-long period of the successors of Ramesses III, and their polytheistic ideology could not be accepted by other priesthoods in Egypt. The secession of the North (Lower Egypt) created the phenomenon of several parallel dynasties; the reason for this is that the pharaohs of Lower Egypt, although backed by the priesthoods of Heliopolis and Hermupolis and strengthened by the interfering Libyan princes, were still very weak to drive the Theban priests out. On the other hand, the latter, known in Ancient Egyptian as Whem Mesut (lit. repetition of births; e.g. Renaissance), although drawing from the wealth of Kush / Ethiopia and machinating against the North, were not strong enough to recapture the whole of Egypt. The high priests of Thebes were not considered as a proper dynasty, despite of the existing kin relationship among them, and despite the fact that all of them resumed the pharaonic position, and had their names inscribed in cartouches according to the royal customs of Egypt. Through Horihor´s grandson, Psunennes I, there was kin relationship also between the high priests of Thebes and some of the Lower Egyptian pharaohs. Even this was not able to make the "Two Lands" (Tawy in Ancient Egyptian, a second name for Egypt) reunite, due to the risen priestly control (either monotheistic Heliopolitan and Hermupolitan in Lower Egypt or polytheistic Theban in Upper Egypt and Kush / Ethiopia).

The years between 690-683 are regarded as years ofpeace, while Kushite intervention in the Levant from 683 and probably until 679 prompted Assyriato react and gain control over the Levant and finally conquer Egypt. This conquest is reflected in theAssyrian Royal Inscriptions and Annals of Esarhaddon. An extraordinary prayer by Taharqa toAmun, previously dated by P. Vernus to 677/6-674/3 B. C., records Taharqa's defeat and the captureof his crown-prince, Ushanhuru in 671 B.C. and Taharqa's request from Amun to guard the life ofhis sons and concubines and to return things to their previous state of affairs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan'el Kahn•  6  Egyptian History, Kush, 25th Dynasty (Egyptology), Assyrian EmpireTaharqa, Egypt, Ethiopia (Ancient Sudan), Nubians, Assyria and Assurbanipal, Emperor of the Universe (2010)Nechao was of Berber origin, but modern Orientalists and Egyptologists avoid this term, because it is supposed to be politically incorrect ( ! ); they therefore keep using the term found in Manetho´s Aigyptiaka, namely "Libyan" dynasty.... moreNechao was of Berber origin, but modern Orientalists and Egyptologists avoid this term, because it is supposed to be politically incorrect ( ! ); they therefore keep using the term found in Manetho´s Aigyptiaka, namely "Libyan" dynasty. This is absolutely ridiculous, because the term Libya had a very different connotation in the Antiquity, and only today it is confusingly associated with the colonial pseudo-state of Libya. In the Antiquity, the Ancient Greek name Libya originated from Lebu, an Ancient Egyptian name of a Hamitic, Berber ethnic group that lived throughout North Africa. It is therefore imperative to name the 26th dynasty of Egypt "Hamitic Berber" (not ´Libyan´) in order to avoid falsifications of colonial character. This pro-Assyrian act initiated a long tradition, because after a few years, Nechao´s son, Psamtek (Pisamilku in Assyrian; Psammetichus in Ancient Greek), moved to Nineveh and was properly educated as an Assyrian in order to return and implement in Egypt as local administrator (under the supervision of an Assyrian general) policies coping with those of the Assyrian monotheistic universalistic establishment. Assarhaddon´s famous inscription from Samal gives an epic character to his achievements, those in Egypt included.

Frame recently republished a rock inscription and relief of Sargon II, discovered in the Tang-i Var Pass in Iran and originally published in Farsī in 1968. The text mentions the rebellion of Iamani, king of Ashdod, against Sargon in the year 712 BC and his flight to the king of Kush. According to the inscription, king Shabatka (=Shebitku) extradited Iamani to Sargon before the year 706 BC. In this article I shall attempt to rule out any assumed co-regency between Shabaka and Shabatka and the proposed division of the Egyptian and Kushite kingdoms between Shabaka and Shabatka, respectively.

While this term may occasionally also refer to territories in the south-eastern neighbourhood of Judah (Num 12; 2 Chr 14; 21) or in Mesopotamia (Gen 10:8-12), Kush appears most often as a designation of a region south of Egypt, stretching as far as the highlands of central Africa.

The latter may now well be the quasi-exclusive inhabitants of a vast part of the territory of Upper Egypt (Kemet) and of North Sudan (Kush - Ethiopia), namely south of Luxor to Wadi Halfa and thence further to Debba, but in the Antiquity, their ancestors were only a minority among the Egyptians and the Kushites (Ethiopians) who inhabited the said territory (and the rest of Egypt and North Sudan). More importantly, the Ancient Nubians never formed a state of their own in the pre-Christian times. So, the royal monuments, temples, palaces, military camps and outposts, administrative buildings and private homes that have been unearthed in the land where today's Nubians live were not built by their ancestors and consequently, they are not their own historical heritage, but mainly the heritage of today's Egyptians, Arabic speaking Sudanese, Oromos, Sidamas and eventually other, minor, Kushitic nations.Today's Nubians therefore cannot be considered as either the only or the primary heir to either the Egyptian Past or the Kushitic / Ethiopian Antiquity, History, monuments, and Heritage. In other words, the Egyptian temple of Isis at Philae cannot be characterized as a Nubian temple, and the Kushitic / Ethiopian temple of Amun of Napata (in today´s Karima, North Sudan) cannot be labeled "Nubian temple"; the latter is valid for even one more reason, namely that there is no Nubian population living there today as well.The term "Nubian" cannot be given to the kings of Kerma, Napata and Meroe – the three most important capitals of Pre-Christian Kush / Ethiopia – because these kings were not Nubians but Kushites / Ethiopians. Considering both, the ethnic and the linguistic levels, the Nubians were as different from the Egyptians and the Sudanese Kushites / Ethiopians as the Ancient Greeks from the Ancient Babylonians. The fake term "Nubian" has been introduced in order to effectively detach the Arabic-speaking Sudanese from the search for their identity, prevent them from properly assessing their tremendous historical heritage, further engulf them into the Pan-Arabist fallacy, and definitely disconnect them from their brethren, namely the tyrannized Oromos, Sidamas, and the other subjugated Kushitic nations. These Kushitic nations have been comprised within the non-Kushitic, non-African, Semitic colonial state of the racist Amhara and Tigray Abyssinians, who are totally unrelated to the Oromos, the Sidamas, and the other subjugated Kushitic nations of Abyssinia.  For the above reason, the Amhara and Tigray Abyssinians are absolutely irrelevant of the historical name of Ethiopia, which belongs only to he Arabic-speaking Sudanese, the Oromos, the Sidamas, and the other subjugated Kushitic nations of Abyssinia. The criminal colonial state of Abyssinia has to be forced - by any means - not to use the fair name of Ethiopia anymore in the future.

As Padiese before him, he found it difficult to let go of the horses that he promised Piankhy. It is not stated if Tefnakht ﬁnally presented his horses to Piankhy, but Piankhy would probably have recorded such a tribute from Tefnakht as his biggest success, considering his interest in horses and his wish to show that he subdued his ﬁercest opponent and the whole of Egypt. Failing to mention such a tribute is another clue to the supposition that Tefnakht was not entirely defeated but only suffered a setback. According to various scholars Piankhy’s concern in the fate of the horses is described for their importance in Kushite warfare, their economical value, and in order to stress Piankhy’s traditional image of Pharaoh as a horse-lover. According to the Piankhy Stela, almost every ruler of Egypt at that period had a special fondness for his own horses and found it difficult to give them away as tribute. It seems to me that an additional reason should be given for Piankhy’s emphasis on the tribute of horses: Apart from Peftjauwybast, ruler of Heracleopolis, who brought Piankhy the best horses of the stable out of his free will (l. 71), all the rulers of Egypt tried to evade presenting their horses as tribute to Piankhy. The success of collecting this tribute of horses from every tax-evading ruler, considering the huge effort that was invested, was surely something that the authors of the stela had to mention.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dan'el Kahn•  8  Egyptian History, Nubia, Kush, 25th Dynasty (Egyptology)Meroitic Diplomacy and the Festival of EntrySave to LibraryDownloadby Jeremy Pope•  10  Demotic, Kush, Ancient Graffiti (Archaeology), Demotic (Languages And Linguistics)"TIRHAKAH, KING OF KUSH AND SENNACHERIB", Journal of Ancient Egyptian Interconnections 6/1 2014"Abstract According to the Assyrian sources, Sennacherib, King of Assyria (704–681 BCE) went on campaign to the West to quell a rebellion in 701 BCE.

During his campaign he conducted a pitched battle against the forces of Egypt and Kush and won the war. However, according to the Biblical narrative the Assyrians suffered an enormous defeat by the angel of God. Furthermore, the Kushite ruler who came to the aid of the Judean forces was Tirhakah (=Taharqa), King of Kush, who ascended the throne of Egypt-and-Kush only eleven years later, in 690 BCE.  How then, can we explain the mentioning of Taharqa in the biblical account? Is the information that he was present in the events of 701 BCE an anachronism or is it historically reliable? Can his role in the events be determined? Who won the war – Sennacherib, King of Assyria or Taharqa, King of Kush (and his ally, Hezekiah, King of Judah)? Did Sennacherib conduct two campaigns against the Levant, as some have suggested?

Egyptian presence was not long lasting, and several new comers allied with the remaining indigenous people in an effort to keep the Egyptians out of the area. New types of burial architecture, new types of pottery and new names are now in use. Beyond Egypt´s limit at the first cataract, the Egyptians now denote three successive lands, namely Wawat, Irtjet and Setju. At the same period, Egyptian texts start mentioning the Nehesy, the earliest name used to denote the Nubians. Nehesy is an ethnic term, whereas the other three names seem to be rather geographical terms. A desert-based ethnic group is also first mentioned in this period, the Medjaw. All these terms find their archeological counterpart in the name C-Group that was also coined by Reisner before more than 100 years. C-Group Kush was neither strong nor united; it was totally eclipsed by the rise in force of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, a Delta-centered state that needed the natural resources of Upper Egypt and Kush for its magnificent projects. C-Group Kush was inhabited by a mixture of Kushitic and Nubian populations that we cannot easily identify with the aforementioned three geographical terms. The strong Kushitic - Ethiopian component of C-Group is suggested by the workmanship, the artistic choices (particularly in terms of pottery, architecture and sculpture), the burial traditions, and several religious practices. It is plausible that Kushitic populations emigrated to Wawat, Irtjet and Setju from Kerma in the south, and as far in the south as Khartoum.

The present article deals with the identification of personal markers and verbal number. It shows how Meroitic, like many other languages, used a former demonstrative, qo, as a 3rd person independent pronoun. An in-depth analysis of the royal chronicles of the kings and princes of Meroe, compared with their Napatan counterparts written in Egyptian, further yields the 1st person singular dependent pronoun e-(later variant ye-), which can be compared with 1st person singular pronoun found in related languages. A stela of Candace Amanishakheto found in Naga is the starting point for identifying the 2nd person singular and plural independent pronouns are and deb. These two morphemes are linked with the most recent reconstructions of Proto-Nubian pronouns and confirm the narrow genetic relation between Nubian and Meroitic. Finally, the reassessment of the so-called "verbal dative"-xe/-bxe shows that this morpheme is simply a former verbal number marker with integrated case endings. This makes it a rare instance of transcategorisation in the cross-linguistic typology of verbal number.

Other investigations which verge on the group of prophecies concerning the nations in Isa 13-23 rarely delve into exegetical details to the extent that the reader of Isaiah would feel convinced to stand here on familiar grounds. Even others, overtly restricted to a small pericope inside Isa 13-23, often neglect the significance of this larger context. This book provides a thorough analysis of Isaiah 18-20, concerned with Egypt and Kush, from the earliest stages to their final contextualisation within the developing corpus of the Isaianic prophecies regarding the nations.Save to Libraryby Csaba Balogh•  11  Egyptology, Assyriology, Egyptian Archaeology, Identity (Culture)Queen Karimala, Daughter of Osochor?Following up a proposal by Kendall that the queen Karimala/Katimala of the Semna inscription should be a queen of the 21st dynasty, it is argued that the best genealogical fit for this solution is to make Karimala a wife of Siamun and... moreFollowing up a proposal by Kendall that the queen Karimala/Katimala of the Semna inscription should be a queen of the 21st dynasty, it is argued that the best genealogical fit for this solution is to make Karimala a wife of Siamun and daughter of Osochor.Save to Libraryby Chris Bennett•  7  Kush, 21st Dynasty, Karimala, KarimataEl Salha Project 2005: New Khartoum Mesolithic sites from central SudanSave to LibraryDownloadby Donatella Usai•KushEgyptian impact on pot-breaking ceremonies at Kurru?
