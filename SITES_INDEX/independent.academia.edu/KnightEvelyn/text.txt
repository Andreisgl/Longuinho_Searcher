Ninety-eight subjects described a stressful situation, completed the Stress Arousal Checklist and a perceived control instrument. Two days later they completed the Ways of Coping Checklist. Subjects were followed for up to six weeks to judge whether or not the situation was resolved and by whom. Perceiving control of a hassle situation was highly associated with the situation being resolved. However, perceiving no control or insufficient resources did not predict outcome as clearly. Emotion-focused coping, but not problem-focused coping or stress arousal, distinguished situations resolved by the subject from those unresolved or resolved in some other way.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Results of rankings and canonical analyses indicate that agency use of networks in planning is related to lower YPLL rates overall, but knowledge of services was related to lower white rates only. Community competence as a framework for evaluating community organization techniques is defined and the implications of the findings for community health practice are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since most studies that found low rates of Pap test use in Appalachia were carried out decades ago, an in-depth update is warranted. Local, trained interviewers conducted interviews with rarely or never screened Appalachian women from Kentucky and West Virginia. Sessions were tape recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. Participants (N = 25) suggested the following positive influences on obtaining screening: having an orientation toward the use of preventive health services; having health insurance and access to a good medical environment; and maintaining a flexible enough schedule to keep appointments. Screening barriers included: fear of subjecting oneself to medical scrutiny because of obesity or being a smoker; inadequate health care access such as clinician shortages, scarcity of specialty providers, long travel time to services, and clinic schedules that do not accommodate working women; and lack of providers&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; recommendations.
