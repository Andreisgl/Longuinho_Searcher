Sensitive to Mn oxidation and structural symmetry, X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy (XAS and XES) provide complementary insights. However, few benchmark examples of complexes with similar structures but in different oxidation states are available to evaluate data from unknown structures like the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II (PSII). This study examines two types of compounds prepared in a variety of Mn oxidation states and which possess chemical structures with Mn-Mn interactions (~2.7 Å and ~3.3 Å) that have been observed in the OEC. Model complexes with core compositions Mn3O and Mn4O2 contain combinations of Mn in either a reduced (II) or oxidized (III) state. Within each set of compounds, complexes with higher Mn oxidation states have absorption K-edge energy values that are higher (1.6-2.2 eV) than those of their more reduced counterp...Download Free PDFView PDFPhysical Chemistry Chemical PhysicsMn oxidation states in tri- and tetra-nuclear Mn compounds structurally relevant to photosystem II: Mn Kedge x-ray absorption and K-Beta X-ray emission spectroscopy studies2005 • George ChristouDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biological ChemistryStructure and Orientation of the Mn4Ca Cluster in Plant Photosystem II Membranes Studied by Polarized Range-extended X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy2006 • Uwe BergmannDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of the American Chemical SocietyPolarized X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Single-Crystal Mn(V) Complexes Relevant to the Oxygen-Evolving Complex of Photosystem II2007 • Jesper BendixDownload Free PDFView PDFMetal Ions in Life SciencesLight-Dependent Production of Dioxygen in Photosynthesis2014 • Jan KernDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
