Request for approval of Wikipedia Batak Toba[edit]
Horas ma di hita saluhutna / Warm greetings!
Dear Language Committee, it's been almost three years since the initial submission of our proposal, and it has been verified as eligible. Though until now, we are still waiting for this project yet to be hatched. We have also completed the translation of Most important messages on Translatewiki. Thus we would like to remind the Language Committee to kindly check and consider our request for Wikipedia Batak Toba. Batak Toba is one of the largest native languages in Indonesia and currently has almost two million native speakers. Thus, with great hope may this project be granted approval to be launched.
Boti ma, Mauliate godang tu hamuna / Thank you for your attention. 27christian11 (talk) 04:42, 13 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Hello, this is currently being discussed by the committee and I think positive results can be expected if your activities continue. It is expected to undergo linguistic verification and final approval if there are no linguistic issues. --Sotiale (talk) 11:55, 3 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Request for approval of Talysh Wikipedia[edit]
Dear committee members Amire80, Jon Harald Søby, MF-Warburg, Sotiale. I think now is the time to open Talyhs Wikipedia. I kindly request your review and consideration. Sincerely, Patriot Kor (talk) 12:14, 23 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Dear, Amire80, Jon Harald Søby, MF-Warburg, Sotiale. Please... --Patriot Kor (talk) 12:22, 9 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Late reply as I was recently inactive. I'll check now. --Sotiale (talk) 10:24, 16 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Sorry, I wrote in the wrong thread. I will start discussing the approval of this. --Sotiale (talk) 11:08, 16 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Request for approval of Fon Wikipedia[edit]
Dear Language Committee members, 
After 5 years working on the incubated version of Fon Wikipedia and building an active community of fon contributors, we think that we are ready to go. Our experienced contributors made of Fon teachers spent these past weeks reviewing the more than 500 articles that are already there. 
We kindly request your review and expect it to be approved soon.
Regards, ⁣

Request for approval of Karai-Karai Wikipedia[edit]
Dear Language Committee members,
It has been a great experience that our work on the incubated version of Karai-Karai Wikipedia have arrived us to this stage. We believe our contribution and number of contributors would really become higher and keep increasing when we got approved. 
We kindly request your review and expect it to be approved soon. Thank you. De-Invincible (talk) 00:10, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@De-Invincible But then, there even doesn't have a request for it? Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 01:41, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Oh sorry, I thought the request is to be made here. Can you guide me to the proper page for placing the request please. Thank you for your help. De-Invincible (talk) 08:10, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I have seen the link in your comment and have created the request, thank you so much De-Invincible (talk) 09:08, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@De-Invincible: Hello. Thank you for your hard work on this project. However, I would like to say that this project has not reached the stage of approval yet. Since your project started continuous contributions in July of this year, the activation period is short, and the sustainability of the community is not sufficient because many editors have not continuously edited it yet. Please continue to edit for several more months. Again, thank you for your efforts! --Sotiale (talk) 10:34, 16 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Sotiale: okay, we would engage more editors and keep doing more edits before applying again. Thank you for your help. De-Invincible (talk) 06:53, 17 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Notification from Sylheti Wikinews[edit]
Hi, earlier we got the following feedback from the language committee: "There needs to be sustained activity from several users (at least 3 or 4, preferably more) for at least three months before we will consider a project for approval." Just to notify you that, we have relayed the information to the community and currently, we meet the above-mentioned criteria. More info: Wikimedia Incubator, Wikidata, Meta-Wiki -- ꠢꠣꠍꠘ ꠞꠣꠎꠣ (talk) 10:30, 15 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@ꠢꠣꠍꠘ ꠞꠣꠎꠣ: Hi. I think it's better to give Sylheti Wikipedia an approval review first. I would like to know what you think. --Sotiale (talk) 10:29, 16 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
And one more question, there are a few things I would like to ask you about in relation to this project. It's about the scripts you currently use in your incubator project. It has been pointed out that this project uses the sylheti nagri script. Is this accessible to a large number of sylheti users or is it easily convertible? Or are there alternatives to other approaches if the majority of speakers cannot use this script? --Sotiale (talk) 11:09, 16 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Sotiale: All good, I am just notifying the updates.
Is this project previously used any other script in last 9 years? I had a quick look at the history of the main page and could not find any such information.
It has Google fonts, Microsoft, Apple and Google Keyboards so definitely accessible worldwide.
Yes, any soft copy, electronic files easily convertable, using various Tools (even someone can convert a whole Wiki page in one click to multiple scripts, if they wish).--ꠢꠣꠍꠘ ꠞꠣꠎꠣ (talk) 06:40, 18 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Thanks and appreciating you for keeping eye on Sylheti Wikipedia. So, what's the condition of approval of Sylheti Wikipedia? Could you let us know please. ~~ AbuSayeed (talk) 08:26, 25 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Request for Approval Hausa Wikiquote[edit]
Hi, the Hausa Wikiquote page has being verified since July 2022 and it has a considerable edits from many editors. Please check if it is ready enough to be approved as a project. Thank you and best regards. Uncle Bash007 (talk) 07:43, 17 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Hello, thanks for asking! At the moment it seems like you are the only active contributor to Hausa Wikiquote (while in the previous month, it was someone else). For approval however, there needs to be continuous activity from at least several users over some months. So keep up the good work and try to find some more editors. --MF-W 12:44, 17 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Notification about proposed approval of Talysh Wikipedia[edit]
Hi. The language committee intends to approve Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Talysh. If you have any objections to that based on the language proposal policy, please tell us here on this page in the next 7 days. Meanwhile, the community is asked to check (and if necessary, complete) the wiki settings as indicated on the request page. Thank you. --Sotiale (talk) 12:24, 21 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Patriot Kor: Hi. You are encouraged to review the logo and wiki settings on the request page above with your community members. Since this setting takes time to change once set, it is recommended that you check it right now. --Sotiale (talk) 12:26, 21 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Hi dear @Sotiale. First of all, I would like to thank you and the Azerbaijani government, which has never spared its support in language. I do not have any objections. The carriers of our language use the Latin alphabet entirely. There must be some changes. They are as follows:
In the original, the spelling of the language should be "Tolıš".
There are two abbreviated versions: The first version is used as "tlš" and the second version is used as "tol". Both versions are accepted versions. (Only in our language. It's not an international standard.)
Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that "WIKIPEDIA" should be written as "VİKİPEDİÁ" in the logo.
Similarly, "The Free Encyclopedia" should be written as "Ozoda Ensiklopediá".
I would be glad if you could help with these important issues. Patriot Kor (talk) 13:35, 21 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Hi, Patriot Kor. Thanks for the reply. You can directly edit the above page. And the logo should also be modified by your community, would you like to find a contributor who can modify the svg? --Sotiale (talk) 14:21, 21 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Hi, @Sotiale. Can you suggest a contributor who can modify the SVG according to the standards? Thanks in advance. Patriot Kor (talk) 07:09, 22 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
There are no users that immediately come to mind. Ask the users who contributed to the creation of the svg file. --Sotiale (talk) 03:00, 23 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
@Patriot Kor: Jon Harald Søby modified commons:File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-tly.svg and tlywiki is now live. Congratulation! --Sotiale (talk) 13:40, 31 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Hello. There have been 7 edits in June, 2 in July and none so far in August. In this state, the project can't be approved. --MF-W 14:06, 26 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
