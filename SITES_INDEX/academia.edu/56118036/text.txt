Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we sought to determine if and where cortical pathways in humans might diverge for processing action sounds vs. vocalizations as distinct acoustic-semantic categories of real-world sound when matched for duration and intensity. This was tested by using relatively less semantically complex natural sounds produced by non-conspecific animals rather than humans. Our results revealed a striking double-dissociation of activated networks bilaterally. This included a previously well described pathway preferential for processing vocalization signals directed laterally from functionally defined primary auditory cortices to the anterior superior temporal gyri, and a less well-described pathway preferential for processing animal action sounds directed ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNeuropsychologiaProbing category selectivity for environmental sounds in the human auditory brain2008 • Steffen VolzDownload Free PDFView PDFFrontiers in Systems NeuroscienceAuditory object salience: human cortical processing of non-biological action sounds and their acoustic signal attributes2012 • Christopher FrumDownload Free PDFView PDFFrom where to what: a neuroanatomically based evolutionary model of the emergence of speech in humansOren PolivaIn the brain of primates, the auditory cortex connects with the frontal lobe via the temporal pole (auditory ventral stream; AVS) and via the inferior parietal lobule (auditory dorsal stream; ADS). The AVS is responsible for sound recognition, and the ADS for sound-localization, voice detection and audiovisual integration. I propose that the primary role of the ADS in monkeys/apes is the perception and response to contact calls. These calls are exchanged between tribe members (e.g., mother-offspring) and are used for monitoring location. Perception of contact calls occurs by the ADS detecting a voice, localizing it, and verifying that the corresponding face is out of sight. The auditory cortex then projects to parieto-frontal visuospatial regions (visual dorsal stream) for searching the caller, and via a series of frontal lobe-brainstem connections, a contact call is produced in return. Because the human ADS processes also speech production and repetition, I further describe a course for the development of speech in humans. I propose that, due to duplication of a parietal region and its frontal projections, and strengthening of direct frontal-brainstem connections, the ADS converted auditory input directly to vocal regions in the frontal lobe, which endowed early with partial vocal control. This enabled offspring to modify their Hominans contact calls with intonations for signaling different distress levels to their mother. Vocal control could then enable question-answer conversations, by offspring emitting a low-level distress call for inquiring about the safety of objects, and mothers responding with high-or low-level distress calls. Gradually, the ADS and the direct frontal-brainstem connections became more robust and vocal control became more volitional. Eventually, individuals were capable of inventing new words and offspring were capable of inquiring about objects in their environment and learning their names via mimicry.Download Free PDFView PDFNeuroImageDifferent categories of living and non-living sound-sources activate distinct cortical networks2009 • Christopher FrumDownload Free PDFView PDFFrontiers in NeuroscienceFunctional MRI of the vocalization-processing network in the macaque brain2015 • Georgios A KelirisDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroscience & Biobehavioral ReviewsProcessing of emotional vocalizations in bilateral inferior frontal cortex2013 • Didier Grandjean, Sascha FrühholzDownload Free PDFView PDFAbstract encoding of auditory objects in cortical activity patternsBruno L.
