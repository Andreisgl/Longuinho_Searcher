Critical information is lost if the user does not get immediate feedback on whether the acquired image meets the quality requirements for OCR. To avoid such information loss, we propose a novel automated image quality assessment method that predicts the degree of degradation on OCR. Unlike other image quality assessment algorithms which only deal with blurring, the proposed method quantifies image quality degradation across several artifacts and accurately predicts the impact on OCR error rate. We present evaluation results on a set of machine-printed document images which have been captured using digital cameras with different degradations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Xujun Peng•  11  Image Quality, Edge Detection, Feature Extraction, Bit Error RateQoS analysis of video streaming service in live cellular networksSave to LibraryDownloadby Pedro Merino•  11  Distributed Computing, Performance Analysis, Video Streaming, Computer CommunicationsDevelopment of ECG signal interpretation software on Android 2.2Save to LibraryDownloadby Reggio Hartono•  9  Cardiovascular disease, Electrocardiography, Heart rate, Cardiovascular systemOptimizing the boot time of Android on embedded systemSave to LibraryDownloadby Gaurav Kumar Singh•  6  Embedded Software, Open Source, Humanoid robot, Smart PhoneA Graphical Password Based System for Small Mobile DevicesPasswords provide security mechanism for authentication and protection services against unwanted access to resources.

A graphical based password is one promising alternatives of textual passwords. According to human psychology, humans are able to remember pictures easily. In this paper, we have proposed a new hybrid graphical password based system, which is a combination of recognition and recall based techniques that offers many advantages over the existing systems and may be more convenient for the user. Our scheme is resistant to shoulder surfing attack and many other attacks on graphical passwords. This scheme is proposed for smart mobile devices (like smart phones i.e. ipod, iphone, PDAs etc) which are more handy and convenient to use than traditional desktop computer systems.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohammed Aalsalem•  3  Graphical Password, Mobile Device, Smart PhoneA feedback-based control technique for interactive live streaming systems to mobile devicesSave to LibraryDownloadby Gianluca Paravati•  15  Wireless networks, Mobile Computing, Control Systems, Video StreamingApplications of Google Glass-ReviewGoogle Glass is a brand of smart glasses-an optical head-mounted display designed in the shape of a pair of eyeglasses.

But for efficient teaching task, we need to make the novel intuition teaching method and user friendly interface to realize end effector's position and orientation easier. In addition to enhance time efficiency of teaching task, tele-operation function and mobility are also needed. In this regard, this research proposes smart phone based intuitive teaching pendant. The way of basic idea is that the smart phone orientation information can be considered as some control device which has universal joint in base part, and we match orientation information of smart phone to end effector of manipulator. Furthermore, a user study is performed to compare the proposed smart teaching pendant with conventional approach in a given scenario. And we can show that suggested method has more time efficiency comparing with the traditional teaching works in the virtual environment applied the idea of teaching method we designed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yasir Jan•  2  Industrial Robots, Smart PhoneIndoor pedestrian navigation system using a modern smartphoneSave to LibraryDownloadby Valentina Marotto•  8  Mobile Human Computer Interaction, Map, Accelerometer, CompassDesign and implementation of an open framework for ubiquitous carbon footprint calculator applicationsAs climate change is becoming an important global issue, more and more people are beginning to pay attention to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

To measure personal or household carbon dioxide emission, there are already plenty of carbon footprint calculators available on the web. Most of these calculators use quantitative models to estimate carbon emission caused by a user's activities. Although these calculators can promote public awareness regarding carbon emission due to an individual's behavior, there are concerns about the consistency and transparency of these existing CO2 calculators. Apart from a small group of smart phone based carbon footprint calculator applications, most of the existing CO2 calculators require users to input data manually. This not only provides a poor user experience but also makes the calculation less accurate. The use of a standard framework for various carbon footprint application developments can increase the accuracy of overall calculations, which in turn may increase energy awareness at the individual human level. We aim for developing a carbon footprint calculation framework that can serve as a platform for various carbon footprint calculator applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a platform-agnostic Open Carbon Footprint Framework (OCFF) that will provide the necessary interfaces for software developers to incorporate the latest scientific knowledge regarding climate change into their applications. OCFF will maintain a clouded knowledge base that will give developers access to a dynamic source of computational information that can be brought to bear on real-time sensor data. Based on the OCFF platform, we developed a Ubiquitous Carbon Footprint Calculator application (UCFC) that allows the user to be aware of their personal carbon footprint based on their ubiquitous activity and act accordingly. The major contribution of this paper is the presentation of the quantitative model of the platform along with the entire design and implementation of UCFC application. We also present the results, analysis, and findings of an extensive survey that has been conducted to find users’ awareness of increased carbon footprint, feature requirements, and expectations and desires to alleviate CO2 emissions by using a footprint calculator. The design of UCFC application incorporates the analysis and inferences of the survey results. We are also developing a fuel efficient mobile GPS application for iPhone suggesting the greenest/most fuel efficient route to the user. In this paper, we also point out some important features of such an application.Save to LibraryDownloadby Casey O'Brien•  17  Climate Change, Surface Science, Sensor, Software DevelopmentDrugs interaction checker based on IoTSave to LibraryDownloadby Antonio J.

The present day mobile phones can run rich stand alone applications as well as distributed client-server applications that access information via a web gateway. This changed environment brings new opportunities as well as constraints for mobile application developers. A move towards open source software offers several advantages for application developers and operating system vendors. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how voice enabled mobile applications can be deployed economically using only open source software to access information from the Web. Swar-Suchak is a voice enabled mobile application for information retrieval in multiple languages. We describe two applications running on Swar-Suchak using the open source Android platform. By linking a mobile phone to a voice gateway, built with open source software, we are able to develop voice enabled web applications which are accessible ubiquitously by anyone, anytime.Save to LibraryDownloadby Punyabrata Ghatak•  16  Information Retrieval, Open Source Software, Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech RecognitionProviding accident detection in vehicular networks through OBD-II devices and Android-based smartphonesSave to LibraryDownloadby Pietro Manzoni•  5  Automotive Industry, Intelligent Transport System, Performance Analysis, Vehicular NetworkNextLast »Related TopicsIndoor PositioningFollowFollowingSensorsFollowFollowingComputer ScienceFollowFollowingInternet and web securityFollowFollowingVehicular Ad Hoc NetworksFollowFollowingPhubbingFollowFollowingMobile Ad Hoc NetworksFollowFollowingCryptographyFollowFollowingMobile DeviceFollowFollowingDepartamento de Ciências Humanas e TecnologiasFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
