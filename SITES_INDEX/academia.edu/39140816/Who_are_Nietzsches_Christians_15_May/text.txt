It traces the development of Nietzsche’s thought in order to show how nihilism came to be Nietzsche’s central concern. It then examines the vexing question of what exactly Nietzsche takes to be the core of nihilism. Sometimes Nietzsche treats nihilism as a belief; at other times he seems to treats it as an affective disorder. It is argued that beyond the nihilism of despair and the nihilism of disorientation identified by Bernard Reginster there must be a deeper core nihilism, which is identified as affective nihilism; the drives turned against themselves. The key evidence being that while Nietzsche identifies Christianity as being intrinsically nihilistic, the Christian suffers from neither disorientation or despair. Similarly,regarding Nietzsche’s notion of the affirmation of life, his antidote to nihilism, it remains unclear whether this is a matter of adopting some cognitive attitude, for instance affirming the eternal recurrence of life, or of adopting a form of life that does not involve the repression of our fundamental drives. Throughout the paper the question of Nietzsche’s attitude to the relation between myth, nihilism and affirmation is examined. This sheds light on both his relationship to Wagner and the ambition behind his Thus spoke Zarathustra, the work he took to be his most important.Download Free PDFView PDFWhy Does Nietzsche Think Christianity is 'Hostile to Life'?James UrsellDownload Free PDFView PDFPessoa is not PessoaKen GemesAgainst the dominant interpretation that Pessoa is a modernist, one who is aiming at a certain self-construction, albeit a construction of the self as multiplicity, it is argued that Pessoa is a post-modernist who dissolves the notion of the self. To get a better understanding of what exactly is involved in self-construction we turn to the philosophy of Nietzsche, which highlights a certain kind of unity as essential to having a genuine self. We then turn to interrogate the Nietzschean imperative to self-construction and, with several of Pessoa’s heteronyms in mind, question whether having a self really is a pre-condition for creativity, as Nietzsche seems to claim, or whether the imperative to self-construction is really underwritten by a commitment to the overcoming of ressentiment.Download Free PDFView PDFCambridge University PressNietzsche's Ethics2020 • Tom SternThis Element explains Nietzsche’s ethics in his late works, from 1886 onwards. The first three sections explain the basics of his ethical theory – its context and presuppositions, its scope and its central tension. The next three sections explore Nietzsche’s goals in writing a history of Christian morality (On the Genealogy of Morality), the content of that history and whether he achieves his goals. The last two sections take a broader look, respectively, at Nietzsche’s wider philosophy in the light of his ethics and at the prospects for a Nietzschean ethics after Nietzsche.Download Free PDFView PDFon MoralityBrian LeiterNietzsche is one of the most important and controversial thinkers in the history of philosophy. His writings on moral philosophy are amongst his most widely read works, both by philosophers and non-philosophers. Many of the ideas raised are both startling and disturbing and have been the source of great contention.Download Free PDFView PDFREADING DOSTOEVSKY IN TURIN: THE ANTICHRIST'S ACCELERTATIONISMGary ShapiroNietzsche adapted ideas and stylistic rhythms from Dostoevsky's novels in his last two years of writing.Download Free PDFView PDFMA Thesis, Religious StudiesNIETZSCHE'S UNDERSTANDING OF SOCRATES1998 • Sean SteelDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche-Studien Volume 47 (Issue 1)The Priestly Slave Revolt in Morality2018 • Paul S. LoebIn this essay I evaluate a new and influential interpretation of Nietzsche's idea of the slave revolt in morality. This interpretation was first proposed by Bernard Reginster and has since been extended by R. Lanier Anderson and Avery Snelson. Citing textual evidence from Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morality , these scholars have argued for the counterintuitive view that nobles, not slaves, instigated the slave revolt in morality. This is because Nietzsche says that nobles create new values, introduces priests as nobles, and claims that priests began the slave revolt. However, against this new approach I argue that these scholars neglect important evidence from these same texts in which Nietzsche claims that the psychologically slavish can also create values, assumes that politically subordinated nobles can lose their psychological nobility, and asserts that the slave revolt was instigated by psychologically slavish priests. I also argue that these scholars ignore Nietzsche's related claims that the priestly peasant Luther renewed the Jewish slave revolt against re-ascendant Roman nobles and that the plebeian philosopher Socrates led a slave revolt in morality against the Athenian nobles. Thus, it turns out that none of the leaders of the slave revolt were noble and that one of them was not even priestly. I conclude with a defense of the traditional and straightforward view that Nietzsche always conceived of the slave revolt in morality as an act of revenge by oppressed people who are politically and psychologically ignoble.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
