This page is a short introduction to the Wikipedia's multilingual concepts.
The main central place for the coordination of all the Wikimedia projects (in any language) is the Meta-Wiki (located at meta.wikimedia.org).
The mailing list to coordinate Wikipedia across different languages is Wikipedia-l.
See also the English Wikipedia's embassy, a page for non-native speakers.
The Wikipedia community is committed to including any and all languages for which there are Wikipedians willing to do the work. We are aware that many of the world's 6,500 languages are not well-represented on computers or the web, and we are committed to working with language speakers and computing organizations to support as many languages as possible.

vte
Each language in Wikipedia currently has a separate set of user accounts. Links between articles in different languages are called interlanguage links or interwiki links.
The URL of the Wikipedia for a given language is xx.wikipedia.org, where xx is the  2-letter language  code as per ISO 639. For languages without an ISO 639 2-letter language code, the 3-letter language code is used, or if that also does not exist, a custom 3-letter language code is made. (On the mailing list and in discussion, people often write xx: to mean the xx-language Wikipedia, as in I'm a regular on fr:.)
