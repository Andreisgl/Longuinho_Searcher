Archaeologists must be particularly careful when applying rank-size analysis to a given study area as the results can change at a different spatial scale. With these premises in mind, in this work, I first show the results produced by performing rank-size analyses on the two whole study areas and assess comparatively any difference in the observed patterns between them. Second, I break down each study area into smaller window analyses in order to detect how settlement size distributions change at a more local scale. The results show that at a larger regional scale, both central Anatolia and the Khabur Triangle in the Middle Bronze Age are characterized by fragmented politically landscapes of competing independent polities loosely integrated. By contrast, at smaller local scales central Anatolia and the Khabur Triangle show a different picture. In central Anatolia settlement systems appear more nucleated in large centres dominating their surrounding rural hinterlands and strong political and economic centralization is evident at Kültepe and Boğazköy. On the other hand, in the Khabur Triangle settlement primacy is less accentuated and the polities are more loosely integrated. These examples demonstrate the advantage of using rank size analysis at different spatial scales for having a complete understanding of the dynamics behind the observed empirical data.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Archaeological Science: ReportsLandscapes of interaction and conflict in the Middle Bronze Age: From the open plain of the Khabur Triangle to the mountainous inland of Central Anatolia (2015)2015 • Alessio Palmisano, Mark AltaweelDownload Free PDFView PDFIn: F.

This study uses pollen, palaeoclimate and archaeological evidence to investigate the relationships between demography and vegetation change, and to explore how the development of agriculture varied spatially. Data from 21 fossil pollen records have been transformed into forested, parkland and open vegetation types using cluster analysis. Patterns of change have been explored using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and through analysis of indicator groups, such as an Anthropogenic Pollen Index, and Simpson’s Diversity. Settlement data, which indicate population densities, and summed radiocarbon dates for archaeological sites have been used as a proxy for demographic change. The pollen and archaeological records confirm that farming can be detected earlier in Anatolia in comparison with many other parts of the Mediterranean. Dynamics of change in grazing indicators and the OJCV (Olea, Juglans, Castanea and Vitis) index for cultivated trees appear to match cycles of population expansion and decline. Vegetation and land use change is also influenced by other factors, such as climate change. Investigating the early impacts of anthropogenic activities (e.g. woodcutting, animal herding, the use of fire and agriculture) is key to understanding how societies have modified the environment since the mid–late Holocene, despite the capacity of ecological systems to absorb recurrent disturbances. The results of this study suggest that shifting human population dynamics played an important role in shaping land cover in central and southern Anatolia.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Archaeological ScienceApplication of an entropy maximizing and dynamics model for understanding settlement structure: the Khabur Triangle in the Middle Bronze and Iron Ages2014 • Mark AltaweelDownload Free PDFView PDF2014 with T.

Connecting Cultures, Dividing Countries: A Preliminary Assessment of the Khabur Ware from Girnavaz Höyük, Southeastern Turkey2020 • Sergio G RussoGirnavaz Höyük is a key site for better understanding the cultural and economic relationship between northern Mesopotamia and the Upper Tigris region between the third and the first millennia BC. The site is located in the liminal zone of the northern Jazirah at the start of the Tur 'Abdin mountains, in a spot that most likely allowed it to play an important role in financial, cultural, and social exchange during the end of the third and the beginning of the second millennium BC when Assyrian merchants began engaging in long-distance trade with Anatolian settlements. During this period, the Khabur Ware (within the Upper Khabur river valley) and other types of Band Painted Wares (from other neighbouring regions) became clear archaeological correlates of this temporal phase. In this paper, I will focus on a preliminary analysis of the Khabur Ware from Girnavaz Höyük in order to define the similarities and differences between contemporary pottery assemblages discovered in the region as well as in other neighbouring areas. The aim will be to provide an initial definition of a relative inner chronology for this specific ceramic assemblage at the site that has never been previously published.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Archaeological Method and TheoryUrban and Transport Scaling: Northern Mesopotamia in the Late Chalcolithic and Bronze Age (2019)2019 • Alessio PalmisanoScaling methods have been applied to study modern urban areas and how they create accelerated, feedback growth in some systems while efficient use in others. For ancient cities, results have shown that cities act as social reactors that lead to positive feedback growth in socioeconomic measures. In this paper, we assess the relationship between settlement area expressed through mound area from Late Chalcolithic and Bronze Age sites and mean hollow way widths, which are remains of roadways, from the Khabur Triangle in northern Mesopotamia. The intent is to demonstrate the type of scaling and relationship present between sites and hollow ways, where both feature types are relatively well preserved. For modern roadway systems, efficiency in growth relative to population growth suggests roads should show sublinear scaling in relation to site size. In fact, similar to modern systems, such sublinear scaling results are demonstrated for the Khabur Triangle using available data, suggesting ancient efficiency in intensive transport growth relative to population levels. Comparable results are also achieved in other ancient Near East regions. Furthermore, results suggest that there could be a general pattern relevant for some small sites (0–2 ha) and those that have fewer hollow ways, where β, a measure of scaling, is on average low (≈ < 0.2). On the other hand, a second type of result for sites with many hollow ways (11 or more) and that are often larger suggests that β is greater (0.23–0.72), but still sublinear. This result could reflect the scale in which larger settlements acted as greater social attractors or had more intensive economic activity relative to smaller sites. The provided models also allow estimations of past roadway widths in regions where hollow ways are missing.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
