First anniversary of Wikispore Day was marked with a mini-conference on July 19, 2020.
Wikispore is a project to develop test wikis to fill out the rest of the reference shelf with new genres of free knowledge. It differs from Wikimedia Incubator in that it would support experimentation and diversification in new formats, as well as new languages.  Eventually, it should function similarly to the Community Wishlist Survey in that 10 test wikis would be selected each year for interim development, and, after a maturation phase, perhaps one or two a year might "graduate" to a full sister project.
Wikispore could potentially support and provide an initial home for any of the Proposals for new projects that are consistent with the established copyright and NPOV principles of the Wikimedia movement, and that are compatible with our somewhat limited tech environment. This includes providing a narrative base for the wide range of Wikidata topics that don't fit inside current Wikimedia text-based projects.
The idea was inspired by a recurring theme that came up at the New York City Wiknic / Strategy Salon, that expanding partnerships and diversity requires greater flexibility with the starting of new "spore" mini-projects to support new directions for the movement.
Current status[edit]
Wikispore is both a proposal for a new official Wikimedia sister project, and an ongoing unofficial project hosted on the Wikimedia Cloud Services platform. It can be found at wikispore.wmflabs.org. For technical information, see wikitech:Nova Resource:Wikispore and the #wikispore phabricator board. For policies and general information, see:

 Support We have an experimentation space for new languages of Wikipedias, but we need an experimentation space for various projects of other types. In Wikidata there will be countless variations on Wikibase instances, and for other sorts of projects we have many other odd pending proposals. Right now WikiCite and Structured Data on Commons seem like the most developed Wikibase'd projects and WikiJournal seems like the most developed non-Wikibase project which needs incubation.

 Support, probably. Incubator handles languages, but overall new project prototyping definitely merits a platform for investigation and support. I don't know if we have the technical basis here to pull it off at this stage, but perhaps that is part of what simply requires further investigation. -— Isarra ༆ 21:18, 9 November 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply]

 Strong support Absolutely. Wikimedia Foundation has an excess of financial resources, and providing an incubation wiki for potential new projects, modeled after the Incubator wiki for new language products is a great idea. If this passes, I would also like to suggest that we opt it in to Global Sysops wikiset for, at a minimum, aiding with counter vandalism and spam efforts by single-purpose accounts. I would also further suggest that it have the latest relatively stable extensions, including StructuredDiscussions and DiscussionTools as well as things the VisualEditor and New Wikitext Editor, to provide another production quality environment to test these extensions. It absolutely would be in keeping with the goals and aims of Wikimedia Foundation to encourage the sharing of knowledge in other ways that aren't within the scope of the existing projects. Moreover, the more wikis we're running gives us new and different avenues for potential new ideas for extensions and gadgets we may want to develop. Plus, it also aids with our outreach efforts to attract new editors, who, in turn, may become involved with other existing projects as well. Dmehus (talk) 02:23, 29 June 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]

 Support —but let's not stop at 10 per year.  The introductory paragraph is bursting with potential, one sees a tension between different representations of Wikispore and its goals, all of which align but ask for a wide range of different technical and social approaches.  To me, this suggests a demand for what Wikispore offers.  Highlighting some of these different threads which come up in the introduction: "New genres of free knowledge" leads way beyond our modest catalog of sister projects and sounds like Whose Knowledge?, centering the knowledge of marginalized communities, perhaps to build "people's archives".  "New languages" shows that the current Incubator is not adequately serving its niche.  "Community Wishlist Survey" shows that governance of Wikispore can be populist and democratic.  "'Graduate' to full sister project" is interesting, this is a nice way of critiquing the canonical projects and showing that we can choose to expand the canon together.  I'm in favor of all of the above, and would love to see us adopt an even more ambitious scope, supporting open wiki farms such as Miraheze with grants, engineering, legal, safety and support resources.  Even from the narrower perspective of today's sister projects, we already know that we need to nurture such an ecosystem of secondary sources in order to ground new Wikipedias in solid references. —Adamw (talk) 23:52, 13 August 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
