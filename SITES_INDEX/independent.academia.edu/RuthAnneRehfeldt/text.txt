Approximately on... more The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders is currently on the rise nationwide. Approximately one fifth of all individuals with autism and related disorders function within the normal range of intelligence, and may, in fact, possess superior intelligence in certain areas. Despite this, many individuals with high functioning autism and Asperger&#39;s syndrome are not competitively employed. The challenges that such individuals experience in securing and maintaining employment are often just as severe as those for individuals with more limited intellectual functioning. Characteristics of high functioning autism and Asperger&#39;s syndrome are described, and recommendations for how rehabilitation counsellors and other professionals can best support the employment pursuits of individuals with the disorders are provided.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The study took place in a mobile school-based dental clinic. Participants quickly mastered the skills, in as few as three sessions. Behavioral Skills Training could be easily used to teach basic behavior analytic procedures to dental hygiene students as a part of their ongoing curriculum.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Learning Skinner’s Verbal Operants: Comparing an Online Stimulus Equivalence Procedure to an Assigned ReadingThe Analysis of Verbal Behavior,  2015The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of an online stimulus equivalence pro... more The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of an online stimulus equivalence procedure to that of an assigned reading when learning Skinner&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s taxonomy of verbal behavior. Twenty-six graduate students participated via an online learning management system. One group was exposed to an online stimulus equivalence procedure (equivalence group) that was designed to teach relations among the names, antecedents, consequences, and examples of each elementary verbal operant. A comparison group (reading group) read a chapter from a popular textbook. Tests for the emergence of selection-based and topography-based intraverbal responses were then conducted, as were tests for generalization and maintenance. Overall, results suggest that the online equivalence procedure was not significantly more effective in promoting topography-based responses than the assigned reading. However, performance on selection-based tests was enhanced by the online equivalence procedure as was performance on topography-based tests when participants were required to provide operant names in response to consequences or examples. On average, the equivalence group performed at a level that was 10 percentage points (i.e., a full letter grade) above that of the reading group. The viability of the equivalence-based procedure is discussed in relation to the assigned reading.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
