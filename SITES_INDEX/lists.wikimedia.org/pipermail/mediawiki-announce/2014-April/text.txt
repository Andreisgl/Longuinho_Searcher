Hello everyone,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.22.6 and 1.21.9. This is a regular
security and maintenance release. Download links are given at the end of this email.
Please note there is no new release of the 1.19 branch, as it is not affected by the
security issue.
== Security ==
* (bug 63251) SECURITY: escape sortKey in pageInfo.
== Bugfixes in 1.21.9 ==
* (bug 58640) Fixed a compatibility issue with PCRE 8.34 that caused pages
  to appear blank or with missing text.
Full release notes for 1.22.6:
