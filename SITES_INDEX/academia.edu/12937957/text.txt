BatleyAnthony Chariton2014, The Science of the total environmentThis study assessed historical changes in metal concentrations in sediments of southern Lake Macquarie resulting from the activities of coal-fired power stations, using a multi-proxy approach which combines (210)Pb, (137)Cs and metal concentrations in sediment cores. Metal concentrations in the lake were on average, Zn: 67 mg/kg, Cu: 15 mg/kg, As: 8 mg/kg, Se: 2mg/kg, Cd: 1.5 mg/kg, Pb: 8 mg/kg with a maximum of Zn: 280 mg/kg, Cu: 80 mg/kg, As: 21 mg/kg, Se: 5 mg/kg, Cd: 4 mg/kg, Pb: 48 mg/kg. The ratios of measured concentrations in sediment cores to their sediment guidelines were Cd 1.8, As 1.0, Cu 0.5, Pb 0.2 and Zn 0.2, with the highest concern being for cadmium. Of special interest was assessment of the effects of changes in ash handling procedures by the Vales Point power station on the metal concentrations in the sediments. Comparing sediment layers before and after ash handling procedures were implemented, zinc concentrations have decreased 10%, arsenic 37%, selenium 20%, ca...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWetlands AustraliaTrace metals in sediments from Lake Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia2006 • Helen WaldronDownload Free PDFView PDFChemosphereHistory of metal contamination in Lake Illawarra, NSW, Australia2015 • Bernd  GruberLake Illawarra has a long history of sediment contamination, particularly by metals, as a result of past and current industrial operations and land uses within the catchment. In this study, we examined the history of metal contamination in sediments using metal analysis and (210)Pb and (137)Cs dating. The distributions of copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, cadmium and lead concentrations within sediment cores were in agreement with historical events in the lake, and indicated that metal contamination had been occurring since the start of industrial activities in Port Kembla in the late 1800 s. Most metal contamination, however, has occurred since the 1960s. Sedimentation rates were found to be 0.2 cm year(-1) in Griffins Bay and 0.3 cm year(-1) in the centre of the lake. Inputs from creeks bringing metals from Port Kembla in the northeast of the lake and a copper slag emplacement from a former copper refinery on the Windang Peninsula were the main sources of metal inputs to Lake Illaw...Download Free PDFView PDFArchives of Environmental Contamination and ToxicologyTrace Metal Concentrations in Sediments and Fish in the Vicinity of Ash Lagoon Discharges from Coal-Combustion Plants in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada2011 • benoit lalondeDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental monitoring and assessmentSource identification and assessment of sediment contamination of trace metals in Kogarah Bay, NSW, Australia2015 • Errol McleanThe distribution of trace metals (spatial and temporal) and sedimentary fractions were investigated to identify the concentrations and sources of trace metals within Kogarah Bay, NSW, Australia. A total of 59 surface sediments and six subsurface samples from core of the sediment were collected. The contamination factor and pollution load index indices used to evaluate environmental effects of trace metals. The study area was found to be uncontaminated with Cr and Ni, moderately contaminated with As and considerably contaminated with Cu, Zn and Pb. The concentrations of Cr and Ni were below both effect range low and effect range median, while As, Cu, Zn and Pb were slightly above effect range low. The highest concentrations of these trace metals such as Cu, Zn and Pb were found in the north, northwest and southeast of the bay, close to discharge points, stormwater outlets and around boatyards and watercrafts. The spatial distributions of metals were strongly related to muddy particle...Download Free PDFView PDFImpact of coal mining on river sediment quality in the Sydney Basin, Australia2017 • Aal-e AliThe environmental impacts arising from mining activities affect the air, water, and soil quality. Impacts may result in unexpected and adverse environmental outcomes. This study reports on the impact of coal production on sediment in Sydney region of Australia. The sediment samples upstream and downstream from the discharge points from three mines were taken, and 80 parameters were tested. The results were assessed against sediment quality based on presence of metals. The study revealed the increment of metal content in the sediment downstream of the reference locations. In many cases, the sediment was above the Australia and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council and international sediment quality guidelines value (SQGV). The major outliers to the guidelines were nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). Keywords—Coal mine, environmental impact, produced water, sediment quality guidelines value.Download Free PDFView PDFLicensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY Contribution of Catchment and Anthropogenic Activities to Metal Bioavailability in the Lake Victoria Sediments using Sequential Extraction and Radiotracer Analysis2015 • Odipo Osano PhDAbstract: Sequential extraction and radiotracer analyses were used to evaluate the geochemical partitioning of metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, and Cu) in the sediments of Lake Victoria to partition the contribution of catchment areas. Highest total concentration and enrichments of Pb, Cd and Cr occurred near river inlets from polluted urban areas discharging municipal effluents into the rivers. Partitioning coefficient (Kd) of all metals were lowest in lake sediments at the sites receiving water with high concentration of metals, which showed an apparent decrease with increasing metal enrichment. The exchangeable phase and Fe/Mn oxides were the most important binding phases for Pb, Cd and Cr at the sites receiving industrial and municipal wastes, indicating that these sediments were subjected to recent anthropogenic metal pollutants. Cu partitioned in the residual phase at the site with high geological Cu suggesting Cu enrichment from the natural sources. At the reference sites, metals were bou...Download Free PDFView PDFScience of The Total EnvironmentTrace metal fluxes to lake sediments in south-eastern Australia1992 • Terry HamiltonDownload Free PDFView PDFDesalinationLevels of heavy metals in subtidal sediments in the vicinity of thermal power/desalination plants: a case study2009 • Sabah Abdul-wahabDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental Monitoring and AssessmentNatural attenuation of coal combustion waste in river sediments2014 • Rock Vitale, James T Markwiese, David  Thal, Randall RytiDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Environment QualityMetal Release from Bottom Sediments of Ocoee Lake No. 3, a Primary Catchment Area for the Ducktown Mining District2008 • Jerry BighamDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
