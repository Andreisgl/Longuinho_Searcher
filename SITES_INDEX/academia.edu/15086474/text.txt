Study Design: Comparative cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Ayub Medical Complex, Abbottabad, from Jun to Nov 2018. Methodology: We recruited 120 children of both genders aged 3-8 years. Sample recruited included two groups including 60 children with stuttering (CWS) and 60 children with no stuttering (CWNS), using consecutive sampling. After taking consent, data was gathered using demographic sheet and Children Behavioral Questionnaire (CBQ) from the sample population. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS-21. Results: The sample included 82 (68.3% males and 38 (31.7%) female children. t-test results of children with stuttering and children with no stuttering showed statistically significant difference for effortful control (p&lt;0.05) including dimension of inhibitory control, low intensity pleasure and perceptual sensitivity.

The purpose of Study 1 was to develop the Short Behavioral Inhibition Scale (SBIS), a parent-report scale of BI. The purpose of Study 2 was to determine, based on the SBIS, differences in BI between CWS and CWNS, and associations between BI and CWS's stuttering frequency, stuttering severity, speech-associated attitudes, and stuttering-related consequences/reactions. Method: Participants in Study 1 were 225 CWS and 243 CWNS with the majority of them being included in Study 2. In Study 2, a speech sample was obtained for the calculation of stuttering frequency and severity, and the parents of a subset of CWS completed the Communication Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten Children Who Stutter (Vanryckeghem & Brutten, 2007), and the Test of Childhood Stuttering Disfluency-Related Consequences Rating Scale (Gillam, Logan, & Pearson, 2009). Results: Study 1 analyses indicated that SBIS is a valid and reliable tool whose items assess a single, relatively homogeneous construct. In Study 2, CWS exhibited greater mean and extreme BI tendencies than CWNS. Also CWS with higher, compared to CWS with lower, BI presented with greater stuttering frequency, more severe stuttering, greater stuttering-related consequences, andDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Communication DisordersEmotional reactivity and regulation associated with fluent and stuttered utterances of preschool-age children who stutter2014 • Edward Conture, Tedra WaldenDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Communication DisordersEmotional reactivity, regulation and childhood stuttering: A behavioral and electrophysiological study2011 • Edward Conture, Tedra WaldenDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Fluency DisordersSubtyping stuttering II: Contributions from language and temperament2007 • Sarah Mangelsdorf, Carol SeeryDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
