In this article, I am not defending or making any arguments for the charges levied against Professor Ramadan-they are serious and require full and fair examination by the authorities and the courts as well as more responsible coverage from the media. The cause of sexual harassment is rightly receiving a much needed and overdue global attention. What is important is to make sure that the scales of justice in pursuit of a needed legal, social and political corrective does not lead to undermining the rights and standing of a similarly demonized community. Demanding justice, fairness and transparency is a universally supported set of principles, which are critical in the case of Professor Ramadan. The guilt or innocence after a transparent legal process and a trial are what all parties to this painful case deserve and expect. Muslim subjects have become accustomed to an abnormal legal treatment from the moment they are arrested and charged, and even throughout the court proceedings. This abnormal is becoming the normal no matter whether the charges are civil or criminal and is for sure the case when the charges are remotely related to terrorism. I do think that the initial attempts to defend Professor Ramadan were wrong in disparaging the women who levied the charges. These shortsighted attacks on the women who came forth caused a mix-up and confusion between the demands on the French legal system to treat Professor Ramadan fairly and the attempts to win public debates and alter the demonized media coverage of the Muslim subject. These two should be separated and I am not sure how this should be done but it should be part of any serious approach. A basic analysis of the French media coverage of this case points to the problematic nature of the coverage and the preponderance of journalists to pile-on and sentence Professor Ramadan before even the end of the investigation and the court proceedings have started. What is expected of the French State and its legal system is to adhere to the due process of the law and accord Professor Ramadan the same rights that are granted to any non-Muslim, non-Arab and non-Maghrabi person in the country. Indeed, the legal process in France is tainted by the differentiated treatment accorded to all " non-French to the source " populations that face systemic discrimination at all levels of society including foremost in the legal system. The treatment is similar to the one faced by the African Americans in the U.S. and an entrenched racism dating from the colonial period is ever present in France. Let's be clear – Professor Ramadan travelled willingly to France and surrendered to the police authorities in order to face the charges levied against him and then to prepare for the legal proceedings. The French authorities moved to arrest Professor Ramadan, refused to grant bail, placed him in solitary confinement, and limited family visitation and access to proper medical care, which collectively point to the differentiated treatment reserved for the Arab and MuslimSave to LibraryDownloadby Hatem Bazian•  32  History, Sociology, Ethnic Studies, Economicsجمعية هلوان تاريخها ومنهاجيتها في تغييرSave to LibraryDownloadby Ahmad  Hashimi•  5  Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Muslim Brotherhood, Civil Society, Islamic social movementsJames Toth (2013), Sayyid Qutb: The Life and Legacy of a Radical Islamic IntellectualSave to LibraryDownloadby Faridah  Zaman•  4  Islamism, Muslim Brotherhood, Sayyid Qutb, Egyptian PoliticsRise And Alleged Fall Of Islamism The Case of Ennahda Movement PartyAt its tenth national congress, Ennahda Movement Party declared that it will separate politics from preaching and transform itself into a national democratic party.

This decision was perceived as an indication of the downfall of Islamism. However, tracing the ideological and organizational evolution of the Tunisian Islamist movement shows that it is highly dynamic and adaptable. Therefore, the latest developments should be perceived as a new metamorphosis of Islamism and an organizational remodeling of its movement in response to the opportunities and challenges it has faced since the Arab Spring.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohammad Affan•  4  Islamism, Political Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic Movements and Political IslamThe Muslim Brotherhood's Reaction to the Taliban's Return to PowerWhile a significant degree of uncertainty surrounds the Taliban’s international agenda, prominent players within the Muslim Brotherhood have already signaled their unambiguous support for the group.

This paper compiles those declarations of support by Muslim Brotherhood members, documenting various quotes, official statements, publications, media appearances, and more. The collection starts from the fall of Kabul and proceeds to the present, dividing quotes into two distinct categories according to their origin: 1) those made by members or groups of the global Muslim Brotherhood, and 2) those made by members or institutions specifically of the Muslim Brotherhood inthe West. On the whole, the collection below provides evidence not only of the ideological affinities shared by the Taliban and the Muslim Brotherhood, but also reveals how the Brotherhood is adapting its discourse to incorporate and accommodate new narratives of the fall of Kabul to the TalibanSave to LibraryDownloadby Sergio  Altuna•  4  Afghanistan, Taliban, Islamism, Muslim BrotherhoodPolitical Muslims in America: From Islamism to ExceptionalismThe article argues that several American Muslim organizations that had roots in political Islam are now moving away from their roots and embracing American Exceptionalism.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muqtedar Khan•  95  Religion, New Religious Movements, Comparative Religion, Political SociologyScholarly Authority and Lay Mobilization: Yusuf al-Qaradawi's vision of da'wa, 1976-1984The late 1970s and early 1980s were a propitious yet challenging time for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, as its elites sought to define the movement's priorities in the face of new opportunities to spread their call (da'wa).

The debate over preaching, while one of strategic assessment, also involved a negotiation of intellectual hierarchy: Should laymen lead Egypt's oldest Islamist organization, or should scholars? In contrast to previous studies that focus on how laymen led the Brotherhood's return to grassroots preaching, this article reintegrates scholars into the story of da'wa by focusing on the organization's most prominent 'a ¯ lim, Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, and his vision of institution-based preacher education and extra-institutional activism. Drawing on three books written by Qaradawi on this topic between the mid-1970s and early 1980s, this article casts lights not only on this Islamist scholar's claim to religious authority as he sought to mold the Brotherhood, but also on the ways in which projects of mass mobilization – whether grassroots preaching or the reform of state-sponsored educational curricula – have transformed scholarly claims to authority more broadly. T he late 1970s and early 1980s were a propitious yet challenging time for the Mus-lim Brotherhood in Egypt. The organization had begun to rebuild its infrastructure within a political system that provided it space to mobilize on a grassroots level, even as it forbade national political participation. These new opportunities were particularly fraught for scholars within Egypt's leading Islamist group: Was this to be a movement of intellectuals or activists, of 'ulama ¯' or of laymen? Who was to lead it and how should it relate to state-controlled religious institutions?

Certainly the recent revolts throughout the Arab streets have grabbed unprecedented attention to a region where civil society and tools of mass mobilization were deemed nonexistent. Why the discourse on civil society is so appealing nowadays amid the uprisings, and what role does civil society play in the process of transition to democracy? Has there previously been any real presence of civil society across Arab states, or is it true –as many Orientalists suggest- that Arab societies are incapable of democratization due to their social and religious structures? This paper aims at challenging the mainstream rhetoric that civil society has been absent from Middle Eastern countries by tracing civil society organizations since the late 19th century in various Arab states with special focus on Egypt, specifying their various types and affiliations, and giving examples of situations where civil society played an influential position in pushing the state in the direction of democratization. At a later stage of this research I present some solid evidence reflecting that during long eras of authoritarian regimes ahead of the Arab Spring, the Islamic movement in Egypt has played the role of the most influential opposition as well as the most profound and significant civil society organization, especially in light of the space left unoccupied by failed external civil groups and Western endeavors of promoting democracy across the region. Finally, I suggest a set of steps and reforms that should essentially be embraced by both the Muslim Brotherhood as well as secular actors in the new-Egypt political arena in order to develop a mature civil society and a fertile soil for authentic transition to democracy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hend Eltaweel•  5  Egypt, Political Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, Civil SocietyΑδελφοί Μουσουλμάνοι: Η μήτρα του «πολιτικού Ισλάμ» και της ισλαμικής τρομοκρατίαςSave to LibraryDownloadby Dimitrios Athanasiou•  3  Political Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic Terrorismثروت الخرباوي، "قلب الإخوان: محاكم تفتيش الجماعة"، القاهرة، دار الهلال، 2010" أن في الجسد مضغة إذا صلحت صلح الجسد كله وإذا فسدت فسد الجسد كله ألا وهي القلب" هكذا يمكن تلخيص مجمل كتاب ثروت الخرباوي الذي حمل عنوان "قلب الإخوان: محاكم تفتيش الجماعة"، وجاء في 237 صفحة مقسمة إلي عشرة فصول بخلاف الخاتمة والوثائق... more" أن في الجسد مضغة إذا صلحت صلح الجسد كله وإذا فسدت فسد الجسد كله ألا وهي القلب" هكذا يمكن تلخيص مجمل كتاب ثروت الخرباوي الذي حمل عنوان "قلب الإخوان: محاكم تفتيش الجماعة"، وجاء في 237 صفحة مقسمة إلي عشرة فصول بخلاف الخاتمة والوثائق والصور. والمؤلف لمن لا يعرفه هو أحد القيادات الإخوانية السابقة بقسم المهنيين بالجماعة، والتي انشق عنها في عام 2002 بعد اختلاف حاد في الرؤى والأفكار عقب محاكمة داخلية هزلية له.Save to LibraryDownloadby Youssef Wardany•  3  Egypt, Political Islam, Muslim BrotherhoodThe Islamic Action Front in JordanA chapter in the Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics on the the evolution, structure, and priorities of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Islamic Action FrontSave to LibraryDownloadby Shadi Hamid•  8  Islamic Studies, Jordan, Middle East Politics, Muslim Brotherhoodأمننة "انتقالية": قضايا الأمن القومي المصري في خطاب مؤسسات الدولة والأحزاب السياسيةSave to LibraryDownloadby Eman  Ragab (Ph.D) د.إيمان رجب•  6  Democratization, Egypt, Democracy, Muslim BrotherhoodThe Power of the Jama‘A: The Role of Hasan Al-Banna in Constructing the Muslim Brotherhood’s Collective IdentitySave to LibraryDownloadby Khalil al-Anani•  5  Islamic Studies, Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Politics, Arab Spring (Arab Revolts)The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan (2020)Save to LibraryDownloadby Joas  Wagemakers•  12  Jordan, Islamism, Jordan (History), Muslim BrotherhoodTribes and the Islamists in Modern Syria: A Short IntroductionSave to LibraryDownloadby Haian Dukhan•  5  Syria, Muslim Brotherhood, Isis, Islamist movementsZur Rolle und Strategie der Muslimbrüder in der ägyptischen RevolutionSave to LibraryDownloadby Ivesa Luebben•  4  Egypt, Muslim Brotherhood, Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt after the Egyptian revolution 2011, Arab Spring (Arab Revolts)The Many Faces of Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Muslim WorldThe Many Faces of Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Muslim World by Mohammed Ayoob is an introductory book on political Islam.

The modernization and westernization processes continued in the aftermath of Egyptian independence (1922) and the declaration of the Republic (1923) in Turkey. One of the main outcomes of modernization in Turkey and Egypt was the secular policies, which were positioned in the center of state-religion relations.After 1980, liberal political and economic developments triggered the social, economic and political transformation in Turkey and Egypt, which are two close allies of the Western countries in the Middle East. However, Turkey and Egypt’s modernization processes gave different outcomes within three decades in term of democratization. By 2010, Turkey enjoyed the rise of democratic values while the military, one of the most prominent symbols of the secular regime, was losing its dominance in politics. A series of public demonstrations, known as “the Arab Spring”, shook Egypt in late 2010, and caused the fall of the Mubarak regime.Therefore, this dissertation aims to compare the modernization processes of Turkey and Egypt and their responses to change. I outline this study in two parts. First I analyze the social, economic and political developments of the two countries through their main political actors and institutions in a comparative perspective. Later, in case study part, I analyze the political actors that played a significant role in modernization and democratization: the Muslim Brotherhood, the Milli Görüş Movement and the AK Party. I also examine the socio-religious movement, the GM, and the MB through its social perspective. By doing this, I follow a parallel comparison pattern for the cases.In this dissertation, I will adopt the comparative historical method. In order to achieve the objectives, I will do historical analysis and study the sociological- structural, ideological and political behavioral aspects of the cases. In terms of the data sources, this dissertation will include content analyses and tertiary sources.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yunus Akcali•  5  Social Movements, Comparative Politics, Turkey, EgyptΙσλαμικός Ριζοσπαστισμός: Ιστορικές και θεολογικές προϋποθέσεις του Τζιχάντ

Every spring since 2015, the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), a coalition of national and local Islamist organizations, has hosted an annual lobbying event titled “Muslim Advocacy Day” in Congress, at the Capitol Visitor Center’s Auditorium. Over the course of several days, Islamists from across the United States visit congressional offices to lobby for their national and international agendas.The annual event is a serious lobbying effort. The 2017 lobby day, hosted by the USCMO and Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), connected national, regional and state Islamist organizations and community members with their elected representatives in Congress. CAIR reported4 that 400 delegates from 30 states had met with some 230 elected officials and congressional staff.Among the delegates at the 2017 Muslim Advocacy Day were many Muslim Brotherhood leaders directly linked to violent Islamists. USCMO’s own leadership includes an Islamist once accused by the U.S. government of funding terrorism conducted by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

And it had reached those heights not by way of coup or revolution but throughthe ballot box.Save to LibraryDownloadby Garabet K Moumdjian, Ph.D.•  10  Islamic Law, Islamic Contemporary Studies, Islamic Philosophy, Islamic StudiesThe Society of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt 1928-42: The Rise of an Islamic Mass Movement (Ithaca Press, 1998/2006).Save to LibraryDownloadby Brynjar Lia•  6  Middle East Studies, Islamism, Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Muslim BrothersExtremism in moderation: Understanding state responses to terrorism in Egypt.pdfThe Arab Republic of Egypt has a long history of battling jihadism in the region, and as such presents an interesting case study of counter-terrorism (CT) practices in a non-Western setting.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom that reduces the Egyptian state's response to the indiscriminate use of repressive measures, the current case study offers a more nuanced analysis of Egyptian state responses to terrorism that spans the country's history since its independence. Despite repressive measures constituting the backbone of Egyptian state responses to terrorism, their use is much more strategic than is often implied in the literature. As this chapter demonstrates, a comprehensive CT approach including select soft measures does exist in Egypt, albeit with the goal of maintaining regime interests, as opposed to necessarily eliminating the phenomenon. The analysis presented here suggests a symbiosis of regime longevity and existence of an extremist opposition, and that a strategy of extremism in moderation is perhaps the most prominent, underlying strategic trend that is observed across Egyptian CT state practices over the past six decades.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dina Al Raffie (Huehn)•  7  Middle East Studies, Egypt, Counterterrorism (CT), Religious ExtremismA genealogical inquiry into early Islamism: the discourse of Hasan al-BannaThis article inquires into the ideological vision of Hasan al-Banna (1906-1949), one of the most influential figures of Islamist thought.

By assuming a discourse theory perspective, I argue that al-Banna's Islamist discourse was genealogically caught between a traditional pan-Islamic vocation and modern ways of articulating political discourse, such as nationalism and Arab nationalism. Following the traumatic encounter between tradition and modernity that colonialism enacted, al-Banna increasingly integrated and valourized modern national `signifiers', downplaying early universalistic ethos. This denoted a growing reliance on the language of modernity over the language of tradition, though such reliance was instrumental to al-Banna's anti-imperialist political project, entailing the very preservation of tradition as a moderator principle in the appropriation of modernity.

Escolhidos originalmente como o nome de uma sociedade secreta europeia do século 18, os Illuminati modernos são uma criatura totalmente diferente dos Illuminati da Baviera.Hoje Illuminati é comumente usado como um termo genérico para descrever a elite governante, um grupo relativamente pequeno de plutocratas que possuem e governam nosso mundo coletivamente.O número exato de pessoas neste grupo e o grau de controle e influência que têm sobre os assuntos mundiais é difícil de determinar, mas a existência da própria classe dominante é amplamente aceita em ambas as extremidades do espectro político mundial. Essa superclasse altamente organizada trabalha em seus próprios interesses comuns, seja para melhorar o negócio ou não.Este grupo de sombras está no centro de todas as teorias modernas da conspiração dos Illuminati. O grupo ressoa com que movimento, uma organização de raiz de erva nascida na esteira da crise financeira de 2008 Occupy, chamada de por cento. Os fundamentalistas cristãos e os aproveitadores de OVNIs muitas vezes adicionaram suas próprias reviravoltas, incluindo os patos usuais da adoração a Satanás e sacrifício de sangue, fazendo o uso do termo Illuminati ambíguo.Examinaremos algumas das teorias mais populares sobre a conspiração dos Illuminati e veremos suas semelhanças e diferenças.PROCEDIMENTO PARA CONECTAR MEMBROS Illuminati.PASSOS A SEGUIR:1.
