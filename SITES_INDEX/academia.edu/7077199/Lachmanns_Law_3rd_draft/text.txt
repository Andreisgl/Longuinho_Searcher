In the Strunk (1976)'s solution of LL, all forms whose consonant has been devoiced before -t are involved: LL intervened to make the active perfect (e.g. lēgi, with long vowel and voiced consonant) and the passive perfect (lēctus sum, with long vowel and voiceless consonant) formally similar: without an activation of LL, the latter form would become too different from the active perfect, because it would show both a short vowel and a voiceless final consonant. In his model, the LL activation involves only forms provided with a thematic root present, or with an innovative nasal present which replaced an older thematic root present. Nevertheless, the causes of such a limitation are not explained, so that his theory « is little more than a post-hoc, case-by-case justification of why each form turned out the way it did» .See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe history of perfective reduplication and stem-initial patterns in LatinAndrás CserIn this paper we look at the demise of perfective reduplication in Latin and seek to answer the question why this process of erosion followed a phonologically rather strictly defined path. The small set of remaining reduplicated perfects is not a random collection of leftovers from the ruins of earlier morphology (as it is e.g. in Gothic) but displays remarkable phonological coherence in the documented period of the language. To understand why this should be so we look at the relevant phonotactic properties of simplex forms. It appears quite clearly that, for a variety of reasons, the number of stems beginning with pVp, tVt, kVk, bVb and sVs increased in the prehistory of Latin. The fact that this occurred and that voiceless stops figure more prominently in this configuration than other types of consonants may well have given rise to a new phonotactic pattern in which such stem-initial sequences were now legitimate (as opposed to Proto-Indo-European). It seems to be a plausible explanation that perfective verb forms remained reduplicated only if they conformed to this new phonotactic pattern.Download Free PDFView PDFThe development of the intervocalic laryngeal in LatinLucie  PultrovaThe development of laryngeals in the traditional interpretation depends purely on their sound environment and at least in the development into Latin no role is ascribed to in what morpheme or morphemes and on what position within the morpheme the relevant sound sequence occurs. However, in the process of elimination of laryngeals the extra-phonetic factors evidently also come into play that complicate the well-arranged rules and that have not yet been systematically explained. The article is concerned with a partial problem of this complex issue, namely the question of development of intervocalic laryngeal on the morphemic boundary between the root and the suffix. In Latin there are examples where for semantic reasons the deletion of the laryngeal is not followed by the contraction of vowels, but where an epenthetic consonant occurs in its place.Download Free PDFView PDFLachmann’s Law, Thurneysen’s Law, and a New Explanation of the PIE no-ParticiplesGuus KroonenDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Relative Chronology of Some Major Latin Sound Changes1986 • Holt ParkerParker, Holt. Dissertation, Yale Univ. 1986. The text is the UMI microfilm and unfortunately the text is only imperfectly searchable. This dissertation attempts a historical ordering of various Latin phonological rules. The starting point is the phonemic split of I into bright and dark allophones. Ch. 1 assembles the evidence for their phonetic quality. Ch. 2 concerns the assimilations of ld, ln, ls and lv to ll. Ch. 3 examines the sources for surface ld, In, Is and lv, in particular the case of helvus. Ch. 4 and 5 treat consonant clusters: rules of loss of stops before sC in Latin, and the loss of nasals with compensatory lengthening before spirants with parallels in Osco-Umbrian and Celtic (Ch. 4); the loss of liquids (Ch. 5). Part lI deals with changes in vowels. Changes in short vowels in initial syllables (Ch. 6). Changes of diphthongs in initial syllables (Ch. 7). Ch. 8 presents the weakening of vowels in medial syllables as an ordered series of rules. Ch. 9 details the process of R-Lowering (i > e, o > u before r in an open syllable) as a single rule. An excursus on dereduplication of the perfects of compound verbs, and a second on mollis and the adjectives in -ui- complete the work.Download Free PDFView PDFStudia LinguisticaLatin vowel reduction and the reality of phonological rules1977 • Tore JansonDownload Free PDFView PDFSome Remarks on the Genitive of the Latin Third Declension and its Faliscan Pendant 1Ludmila BuzassyovaDownload Free PDFView PDFIncontri Linguistici 33 (2010), pp. 167–178Chronology between word-internal and word-final vowel reduction in LatinKanehiro NishimuraDownload Free PDFView PDFLinguisticae Dissertationes.

In particuar we show that two asymmetries in the formation of the perfect stem are deeply related, that is the analytic strategy with deponent verbs, and the 'affix-deletion' of -sc, -n, -j with verbs with marked present stem. We claim that, in both cases, the asymmetries are due to the impossibility of managing via normal affixation a complex syntactic constituent in which the Perfect layer interacts either with non active Voice or Action.Download Free PDFView PDF Mechanisms of language change in Latin1979 • Tore JansonDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Latin LinguisticsThe Latin Third Declension in the Scope of natural Morphology2005 • Ludmila BuzassyovaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
