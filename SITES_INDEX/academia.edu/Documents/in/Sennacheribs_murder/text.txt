Equipped with the accurate understanding of the term mār šarri, I re-evaluate the most prominent theories of the succession of the Sargonids, especially the succession arrangement of Sennacherib, and demonstrate that the misunderstanding of the term mār šarri, especially in legal contracts, has resulted in an inaccurate picture of the succession history of the Sargonids.Save to LibraryDownloadby Auday  Hussein•  20  Assyriology, Akkadian Language, Mesopotamian history, Cuneiform 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
