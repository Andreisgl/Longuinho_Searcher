His avoidance of prefixing what ontologically permissible entities directly comes from his thoroughgoing empiricism. Even experimental parapsychology or anomalistic psychology by another name is not an oxymoron, although it is highly unlikely. To define, determine, and investigate what is natural falls into the domain of the sciences in the broadest sense. It cannot be foreknown by liberal naturalism, given that no one has the prophetic powers. Thus, it becomes clear that Quine's scientific naturalism is more liberal than "liberal naturalism." It is possible that ontological naturalism is the antithesis of methodological naturalism, and the socalled exclusion of some supernatural entities in alleged liberal naturalism in fact renders naturalism too narrow. Contrary to appearances, it might turn out that it is the more restrictive form of naturalism.Save to LibraryDownloadby Serdal Tumkaya•  9  Parapsychology, Analytic Philosophy, Metaphilosophy, History of Analytic PhilosophyA Psycho-Biological Approach to Suspense and Horror: Triggers of Emotion in a Passage from Lewis’s The MonkSave to LibraryDownloadby Peter Wenzel•  6  Psychoanalysis, Art, Poetry, Embodied CognitionReview of: Tora Wall.

She lays injured in a Los Angeles hospital bed as Kevin, her white American husband, desperately tries to fathom how she has become so bruised and bloodied.“Who did this to you?”“A patroller. He . . . he thought I was a runaway.”“And what’s a patroller? All I could think of was the Highway Patrol.” (Butler 1988, 44-45)At Kevin’s urging, Dana recalls how she was mercilessly racialized and beaten by a slave patroller, one of many white men paid to restrict and punish the movement of Black people in the US. The moment of dialogue calls to mind how the present-day commitments of California Highway Patrol and Police Departments to “serve and protect” actually derive from historical slave patrol units in the US and other countries, which sustained the system of slavery by surveilling and capturing so-called fugitives, and restricting the movement and behavior of enslaved Africans to sabotage resistance (Wilson 2022; Sorin 2020). But in the year 1976, more than 100 years after the abolition of slavery, why is it that a Black woman uses the term runaway to refer to herself? How can she be suspected of being anything other than free?In this chapter, I use tools of critical discourse analysis (Blommaert and Bulccaen 2000), a linguistic approach focused on power and inequality in language, to explore Butler’s fantastic mechanisms of recontextualization. Locating her strategic discourse among recent fatal events of anti-Black policing in the US, as well as historical advertisements offering rewards for the capture of “runaway slaves” in American newspapers, I offer a deep dive into the enduring liminality and death that stalk Black life to an almost supernatural degree. While modern television is replete with policing and prosecution as tandem entertainment themes, in real life the repeated killings of unarmed citizens by police tell a different story. This includes the police killings of young Breonna Taylor on March 13, 2020, as well as Elijah McClain on August 30, 2019; George Perry Floyd on May 25, 2020; Daunte Wright on April 11, 2021; and countless others. These repeated incidents strike me particularly hard as an African American woman and someone whogenerally fears encounters with police. My analysis illuminates how each of these unsuspecting victims was, like Dana, dying to live that is, forced into crucible situations that led to a violent death through which they have since become memorialized, particularly as a function of subsequent activist attention.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jamie A.

This article proposes the concept of miracles as divine acts that do not contradict the laws of nature, but rather go beyond the laws of nature and can even be compatible with the laws of nature. By drawing on the concept of miracles and natural laws in relation to the notion of Neo-Classical Special Divine Action (NCSDA) of Jeffrey Koperski, I argue that although miracles and natural law are two distinct forms of divine action, yet miracles can be reckoned as divine acts compatible with natural causes and share the same purpose as divine providence to humans. As a result, rather than contradicting miracles and natural laws, these two forms of divine action actually complement each other to witness the act of God’s power controlling His creation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hendra Winarjo•  5  Natural Law, Supernatural, David Hume, MiraclesMahal The Uncanny Cosmos of the SelfSave to LibraryDownloadby rohit ranjan•  4  Gothic Literature, Gothic Fiction and the horror film, Hindi film research, Bombay CinemaFollow-up for New BelieversReinforce the faith of brand-new Christians with assurance of salvation, instruction concerning sacraments and baptism, and encouragement to grow strong spiritually.

They present the reader with negative examples, such as clerics who acted in inappropriate ways and got their rightful punishment, as well as positive examples of men who not only stayed faithful to the precepts of the church but bolstered their masculinity by doing so. Reading the revenant stories within this framework allows us to see how religious men adopted and adapted secular masculine ideals, shows us the value of focusing on the intersection of gender and religious status, reveals the different means through which gendered messages spread, and acts as a reminder that although one group may have been the target of regulations, all men were affected by them.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maroula Perisanidi•  5  Medieval History, Gender, Masculinities, SupernaturalJournal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, L.L.DSave to LibraryDownloadby James Boswell•  4  History, Download, Geografi, New HebridesBeyond Free Will: Variety in Understanding of Choice, Luck, and NecessityContemporary Western discourse on freedom and choice – some of the most championed modern values – is usually anchored in the concept cluster of free will and autonomous choice.

In turn, academic research on free will in philosophy (including experimental philosophy) and psychology is largely based on a limited conceptual framework with roots in particular debates in Christianity and European philosophy. This framework is currently challenged by multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches applied in the fields of area and Asian studies, comparative philosophy, and also empirical research in cross-cultural psychology, and anthropology. One reason for this challenge is that the dominant Western academic approach, with its almost exclusive focus on concepts of free will and causal determinism, neglects the multitude of non-Western cultural traditions.

The text was written for the catalogue of first large retrospective exhibition of the work of Thomas Houseago and was written directly in response to real experiences. A mythic narrative was developed to take the original experience and to mould it into a story that now had traction as an idea of what as an artist Houseago could now be.

The fog itself, magical and possessed, becomes a current and force that resists both the openness of the watery ocean, the initial text from which it is sprung, and the human understandings and conquests of natural elements seen throughout the film.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tamara Browne•  3  Ritual, Cultural History Of Ghosts, FictionHumanity, Nature, and the Supernatural in Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"This paper examines the ways through which Washington Irving’s “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” might be considered as an example of environmental literature which focuses extensively on nature and the human relationship to it.

It argues that Irving promotes an ecocentric worldview which treats human beings as members rather than masters of the natural environment. It suggests that this worldview is articulated in various ways in the tale such as the emphasis on the intrinsic value of nature, the celebration of biodiversity, and the condemnation of the anthropocentric outlook on the natural world. In its study of Irving’s representation of the natural environment, the essay claims that nature is portrayed as a character that is not only omnipresent but also more powerful than human beings and their attempts to dominate and subdue it. It asserts that the supernatural in the tale is only nature’s reaction to human greed and egotism. Due to the presence of many important environmental values and ethics, the paper argues that the story reflects Irving’s ecological awareness and underlines his significant contribution to the development of environmental literature.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sabri Mnassar•  20  Literature, Environmental Studies, Environmental Ethics, EcocriticismGod and PsychologyI asked the students at a small pastoral and theological training institute deep in Tanzania, 1 which of all their classes they like the most.

The consensus of experts is these reports of mysterious creatures (known in Scottish Highlands folklore as Nessie) have mundane or prosaic explanations such as hoaxes, wakes, mirages, misidentifications of floating objects (e.g., natural debris, boats) and known native fauna (e.g., deer, otters, diving birds), opposed to extraordinary or unusual explanations such as exotic fauna, escaped animals from traveling circuses, relict plesiosaurs and unknown or elusive species (e.g., 'long-necked' pinniped, giant eel).

Finalmente, y gracias a la magia de Facebook, la cita con Luis Jorge Salinas y su hermano Sergio se convirtió en una realidad concreta, pudiendo así acceder, de manera directa y sin intermediarios, a unos de los relatos más extraordinarios en la historia reciente de la tan cuestionada criptozoología. Una historia que nos habla de monstruos supuestamente extintos hace más de 10.000 años, pero que numerosos testigos juran y perjuran haberlos visto deambular hoy día por las selvas de la Amazonía brasileña. Luis Salinas es uno de ellos. Pero a diferencia del resto, este marplatense aventurero, amable y generoso, asegura haber sido testigo no de uno, sino de una manada entera de dichos monstruos, a lo largo de veinte noches consecutivas, hacia mediados de la década de 1980. Toda esta asombrosa experiencia está plasmada en un libro que Luis y Sergio Salinas escribieron y publicaron digitalmente recién en 2010 (y que gentilmente me enviaran por mail un año más tarde).Save to LibraryDownloadby Fernando Jorge Soto Roland•Social HistoryLas alturas de la fantasía:  consideraciones para una  distinción genéricaLa tajante distinción entre fantástico y maravilloso de Tzvetan Todorov en los años 1970 no convenció a los estudiosos angloamericanos de la fantasía, quienes establecieron a partir de entonces una distinción que sigue vigente entre... moreLa tajante distinción entre fantástico y maravilloso de Tzvetan Todorov en los años 1970 no convenció a los estudiosos angloamericanos de la fantasía, quienes establecieron a partir de entonces una distinción que sigue vigente entre la alta (high) y la baja (low) fantasía.

The fictive inventory draws on real data to generate an archaeological dig across diverse geographies and histories and in the process, renders visible new architectures of time and matter. Working with four distinct and non-hierarchical categories (the songs of science, supernatural oracles, natural philosophy and the underworld), this data mining is stratified for the purposes of condensation, displacement and transformation. Ultimately, these borrowed images and the specific stories they uncover are adapted towards new crystallization, allowing for an emergent legibility of a world beyond words where matter matters.Save to LibraryDownloadby Randy Lee Cutler•  9  Interdisciplinarity, Minerals, Natural philosophy, CrystallizationIbrahim et Anaïs : le merveilleux comme expérience du droit des femmes au plaisir dans les Lettres persanes (1721) de MontesquieuSave to LibraryDownloadby Moussa Traoré•  13  Art, Pleasure, Desire, SupernaturalThe enhancement of enchantments in MelanesiaSave to LibraryDownloadby mark mosko•  2  Philosophy, Ethnographic TheoryFrom Resistance to Conformity: "Reverse Resistance" in Supernatural Fan FictionDrawing on scholarship focused on fan resistance against, and reformation of, masculine- oriented ideological persuasions and gender bias in mainstream television texts, this thesis examines fan fiction’s response to the depiction of a... moreDrawing on scholarship focused on fan resistance against, and reformation of, masculine- oriented ideological persuasions and gender bias in mainstream television texts, this thesis examines fan fiction’s response to the depiction of a non-conformist relationship between two characters in the series, Supernatural. My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a “reverse resistance” by recuperating unconventional elements of a text – which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like – back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text’s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nivanka Fernando•  9  Media Studies, Kinship (Anthropology), Participatory Culture, Resistance (Social)Painting the Dybbuk.

Most frequently ‘supernatural’ means ‘separated from nature’, i.e. different from nature. Thus, what is meant here is the difference in ontological character. The defi nitions of miracle, present in literature, emphasize the fact that we may talk about a miracle only when the phenomenon takes place beyond the natural order or stands in opposition to it. The description of a miracle as a ‘supernatural event’ contains in itself the reference to that which is natural. The supernaturality of an event means that it surpasses (transcends) naturality. Additionally, this transcendence contains a kind of opposition to that which is natural. However, the miracle as a supernatural event takes place within the scope of that which is natural, although it takes place in a different way from natural events. It seems that this supernaturality may involve two things: (1) the course of the miraculous event; (2) the cause...Save to LibraryDownloadby Adam Świeżyński•  8  Philosophy, Epistemology, Philosophy Of Religion, SupernaturalGhost Hunters Contested Knowledge and Cultural ComplexityThe interest and acceptance of the supernatural as a subject in popular Western culture is at a notable apex in the early 21st century, gauging from myriad reality television shows, social and traditional media outlets, and the creation... moreThe interest and acceptance of the supernatural as a subject in popular Western culture is at a notable apex in the early 21st century, gauging from myriad reality television shows, social and traditional media outlets, and the creation of hundreds of local and globalized special interest groups.  None-the-less, mainstream science often continues to marginalize any research or cultural dialogues that deviate from acceptable empirical pathways, typified by fields such as neuropsychology or quantum physics, to cite just two of many examples.  In spite of a lack of funding, the paucity of academic opportunity, and fully aware of the reputational risk, a growing number of serious “ghost hunters” (more properly termed paranormal investigators) are utilizing technology, sophisticated methodology, and innovation to examine age old questions about life, death, and the unexplained.  This study utilized a mixed-methods design to examine participants’ attitudes about science and religion, to document the formation of a new and often unique quasi-research subculture, and to increase understanding of the impact of supernatural phenomenon within popular culture.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jack Trammell•  2  Sociology, Paranormal BeliefsHaunted BodiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Nicolas Ballet•  12  Psychiatry, Gender Studies, Art History, Performing ArtsThe Development Blended Learning Model Using Collaborative and Case – Based Learning to Enhance Critical Thinking Problem Solving Thinking and Team Learning of Undergraduate Education StudentsThe study objectives were ; 1) to develop blended learning model using collaborative and case – based learning 2) to conduct the experiment of blended learning model using collaborative and case – based learning.

Lovejoy raised the fundamental question of whether Romanticism could be characterised as a movement that transcended national borders. More recent comprehensive monographs on Romanticism demonstrate that the issue is still controversial today. The European dimension of Romanticism and, thus, the commonalities between its different national manifestations are elaborated once again. In relation to Romantic art, the situation is by no means simpler or clearer. Here, the question of whether to talk about several independently considered Romanticisms or one European Romanticism has seldom been asked. Possible overarching similarities hardly come into the focus of research, not least because too little is known about the latest work and discussions on Romanticisms in other languages. The conference aims to take a close look on this problem and explore current tendencies in Romantic studies. We focus on significant questions, theoretical and methodological conjunctures as well as blind spots in recent research. By concentrating on painting, drawing and printmaking, we address those art forms in which Romantic impulses are probably most evident.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elisabeth Ansel•Ghosts: A Haunted HistorySave to LibraryDownloadby Jen Baker•  3  History, Folklore, Folk LoreA Transient Response of the Feed-Forward Syllabic CompanderThe feed-forward syllabic compander, which is already proposed in previous paper, has equality in companding functions with existing feed-back syllabic companders as described in this letter.

In the literature, such assumptions rise to mere speculation, the result of superstition and personal beliefs, using the abilities of mental manipulation; however, some research has challenged these beliefs. Objectives: To demonstrate whether the personality profi le of the psychic mediums analyzed exhibits pathological personality traits and whether such is suffi cient to confi rm a clinical diagnosis. Materials and methods: Clinical interview, based on narrative-anamnestic and documentary evidence, and battery of psychometric tests. Results: The totality of the clinical group (CG) is found to be pathological, with at least 5 dysfunctional traits, and a corollary of secondary traits reinforcing the primary condition; the pathological differential from the control group (Cg) is +70.7%. At the individual sexual matrix questionnaires, just over 1/4 of the CG show a dysfunctional tendency to sexual behavior with a differential from the Cg of +42.8%. Slightly more than one-fi fth of the CG also exhibit affective dependence, with a pathological differential with the Cg of +17%, while the CG sample concerning ego defense mechanisms exhibits the pathological totality of the sample, with a differential for the Cg of +45.7%. Conclusion: This research confi rms the psychopathological nature of the personality profi les of mediums, with a higher prevalence of delusional, dissociative, and narcissistic disorders of the overt type, although these results do not prove the fraudulent nature of the mediumistic activity boasted by the subjects, and therefore what has been obtained should be read more generally, subjecting psychic mediums (in mediumistic activity) to technical instrumentation (electroencephalogram, functional magnetic resonance imaging and signal potential and audio-video) in the future to verify the outcomes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giulio Perrotta•  16  Paranormal, Supernatural, Parapsychology, Anthropology, Mediumship, Phenomenology, Spiritualism, Paranormal, Supernatural, Folklore, Religion, Sociology, Paranormal BeliefsNextLast »Related TopicsSupernatural FolkloreFollowFollowingMiraclesFollowFollowingAnthropology of Dreams and DreamingFollowFollowingDreams (Psychology)FollowFollowingHistory of psychical research and parapsychologyFollowFollowingHumanities VisualizationFollowFollowingGreen PoliticsFollowFollowingSupernatural in LiteratureFollowFollowingEarly PhotographyFollowFollowingSex and Gender in Ancient EgyptFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
