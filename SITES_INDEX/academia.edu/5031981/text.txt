Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns.Bradley J ParkerCatherine P. Thirty years ago, Richard Wilk and William Rathje coined the phrase "household archaeology" in their seminal issue of American Behavioral Scientist . Since that time, household archaeology has become a subfield as diverse in theoretical underpinnings as it is in practical applications. Even the definition of household archaeology can be outlined in several ways: (1) a subdivision of settlement archaeology specializing in the study of spatial patterning at the household level; (2) a development from social archaeology presenting more humanized reconstructions of the past; or (3) simply as the study of household-based behaviors and relationships. All of these approaches to what is widely considered a basic unit of society are represented in this volume, which serves as the latest incarnation of household studies based on a long intellectual development. Although more detailed discussions of the history of household archaeology are available elsewhere , we find it useful...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNew Perspectives on Household ArchaeologyFoster, C.

Aux Marges de l'archéologie : Hommage à Serge Cleuziou, Collection Travaux de la Maison René-Ginouvés 16, Paris : De Boccard.Valentina AzzaràThis paper focuses on the concept of the household intended as a means to investigate social complexity of a community and the processes of production/consumption within it. The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to answer questions concerning social systems using archaeological evidence. The approach relies on the analysis of organisation of the household, following spatial configuration of buildings and systems of activities as revealed by material remains. This perspective might enlighten the relationships between spatial layouts of buildings and socioeconomic characteristics of interacting social groups. The method proposed here is briefly exemplified by the analysis of field data from the Early Bronze Age settlements of HD-6 (3100-2700 BC) and RJ-2 (2500-2000 BC), both located in the Sharqiyya in the easternmost region of the Sultanate of Oman. Concluding remarks concern a critical evaluation of the proposed approach and suggest further perspectives and possible applications of it.Download Free PDFView PDFMultifunctionality and Hybrid Households - The Case of Ancient Egypt, in: M.
