Time-scaling scale-invariant approaches have been used to characterize the temporal distribution of forest-fire sequence detected in Gargano area (southern Italy), which is characterized by high level of wildfire density. Our findings reveal that the point process of the fire sequence can be considered as a fractal process with a high degree of time-clusterization of the events. The time-clustering phenomenon is visible from timescales of order of few days. Furthermore, the fire process tends to be less time-clusterized with the increase of the burned area.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEcological ModellingAnalysis of time-scaling properties in forest-fire sequence observed in Italy2010 • rosa lasaponaraDownload Free PDFView PDFChaos, Solitons & FractalsTime-clustering analysis of forest-fire sequences in southern Italy2005 • rosa lasaponaraDownload Free PDFView PDFTime-clustering Behaviors of Urban FiresJian WangDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysica A: Statistical Mechanics and its ApplicationsEmergence of temporal regimes in fire sequences2006 • rosa lasaponaraDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysical Review EScaling and correlations in the dynamics of forest-fire occurrence2008 • Luciano RosaForest-fire waiting times, defined as the time between successive events above a certain size in a given region, are calculated for Italy. The probability densities of the waiting times are found to verify a scaling law, despite that fact that the distribution of fire sizes is not a power law. The meaning of such behavior in terms of the possible self-similarity of the process in a nonstationary system is discussed. We find that the scaling law arises as a consequence of the stationarity of fire sizes and the existence of a non-trivial ``instantaneous'' scaling law, sustained by the correlations of the process.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysica A: Statistical Mechanics and its ApplicationsIdentifying spatial clustering phenomena in forest-fire sequences2007 • rosa lasaponaraDownload Free PDFView PDFEcological ModellingScaling properties in forest fire sequences: The human role in the order of nature2007 • Carmen RojoDownload Free PDFView PDFPloS oneDynamic analysis and pattern visualization of forest fires2014 • Antonio LopesThis paper analyses forest fires in the perspective of dynamical systems. Forest fires exhibit complex correlations in size, space and time, revealing features often present in complex systems, such as the absence of a characteristic length-scale, or the emergence of long range correlations and persistent memory. This study addresses a public domain forest fires catalogue, containing information of events for Portugal, during the period from 1980 up to 2012. The data is analysed in an annual basis, modelling the occurrences as sequences of Dirac impulses with amplitude proportional to the burnt area. First, we consider mutual information to correlate annual patterns. We use visualization trees, generated by hierarchical clustering algorithms, in order to compare and to extract relationships among the data. Second, we adopt the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) visualization tool. MDS generates maps where each object corresponds to a point.

In this paper a public domain forest fires catalogue, containing information of events for Portugal, covering the period from 1980 up to 2012, is tackled. The events are modelled as time series of Dirac impulses with amplitude proportional to the burnt area. The time series are viewed as the system output and are interpreted as a manifestation of the system dynamics. In the first phase we use the pseudo phase plane (PPP) technique to describe forest fires dynamics. In the second phase we use multidimensional scaling (MDS) visualization tools. The PPP allows the representation of forest fires dynamics in two-dimensional space, by taking time series representative of the phenomena. The MDS approach generates maps where objects that are perceived to be similar to each other are placed on the map forming clusters. The results are analysed in order to extract relationships among the data and to better understand forest fires behaviour.Download Free PDFView PDFChaos, Solitons & FractalsIdentifying spatial clustering properties of the 1997–2003 Liguria (Northern Italy) forest-fire sequence2007 • Giuseppe Amatulli, rosa lasaponaraDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
