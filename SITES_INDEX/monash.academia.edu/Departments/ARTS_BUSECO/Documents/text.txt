(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264,4657–4663) that high affinity binding requires the sequence Manα1→2 Manα1→6 Manα1→6 Manβ1→4. However, moderate binding was still exhibited by structures lacking this sequence provided the oligosaccharide core sequence Manα1→3[Manα1→6]Manβ1→4GlcNAc was present. This moderate binding was not affected by substitution with N-acetylgluco-samine at C2 and C4, respectively, of the Manα1→3 and Manβ1→4 residues and BMA Sepharose should prove to be a useful tool for the isolation of bisected or non-bisected hybrid-type glycans.Save to Libraryby Dhruv Chawla•Biochemistry and cell biologyApplication aware Service discovery protocol for Scalable Self supervising truly ad hoc p2p network based on multicastingSave to Libraryby Dhruv Chawla•JourneySave to LibraryDownloadby Trymore Rare• 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
