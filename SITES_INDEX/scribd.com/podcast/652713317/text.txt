I immediately felt connected to the juicy wisdom that she shares and knew she had to come on Highest Self Podcast. Her journey of sharing her reinvention post-divorce (something I myself have gone through) and how she used it as fuel to make herself more open, pleasure-filled, and ALIVE resonated so deeply with me.    In this week’s Highest Self Podcast episode, Jo Portia and I dive into how you can create a pleasure-filled life, how to reinvent yourself at any stage of life (with or without a massive initiation), how to use pleasure as a tool while healing, tuning into and creating from your pussies desires, understanding lessons from your past/present relationships, slowing down to mindfully enjoy your life, and soul much more.    This is one of those episodes that will open your heart up and give you permission to go deeper into your desires, inspire creativity, and realize that what you find yourself craving the most is already there within you – ready to be witnessed, felt, and expressed.
