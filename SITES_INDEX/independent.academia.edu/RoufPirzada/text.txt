Over the years... more Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. Over the years, extensive research has fostered a better understanding of its pathogenesis and defining its different phenotypes; nevertheless, positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy has remained as the ‘gold standard’ treatment option. Perceptibly, PAP therapy is fraught with challenges and, at times, undesired side effects. All these therapeutic pitfalls not only determine the outcome but also have a close correlation with patient compliance. Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea (TECSA) (complex apnea) is one of such challenges that need to be prognosticated in high-risk patients, and cautiously managed, whenever it does not follow the common course of gradual remission over time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Rapid eye movement predominant obstructive sleep apnoea: prognostic relevance and clinical approachby Rouf  Pirzada and Ahmed S BaHammamCurrent Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine,  2021Purpose of review Rapid eye movement (REM) obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a stage-specific OSA... more Purpose of review Rapid eye movement (REM) obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a stage-specific OSA, in which obstructive events occur primarily during REM sleep. This review discusses REM-OSA definitions, its cardiometabolic correlates, associated comorbidities and treatment, and addresses diagnostic ambiguities and therapeutic pitfalls. Recent findings Current evidence indicates that REM-OSA is prevalent among younger age groups and women and is independently associated with cardiometabolic complications, particularly hypertension, metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. However, currently, there is no consensus on the accepted diagnostic criteria for REM-OSA. Available data suggest that adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in patients with REM-OSA is suboptimal. Moreover, the currently accepted criteria for good adherence to PAP therapy of 4 h/night, 70% of the days may not be suitable for REM-OSA, as it will not cover most of the REM sleep periods. In addition, further research is needed to assess the impact of REM-OSA treatment on cardiometabolic outcomes. Summary Patients with REM-OSA are at an increased risk of cardiometabolic complications. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose this disorder, and close follow-up is required to enhance adherence to therapy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Exploding head syndrome: A case series of under-diagnosed hypnic parasomniaby Rouf  Pirzada and Ahmed S BaHammamCase Reports in Neurology,  2020Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is an under-recognized parasomnia characterized by a complaint of s... more Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is an under-recognized parasomnia characterized by a complaint of sudden loud noise or a sense of explosion in the head that usually occurs at sleep onset.This is a report of six patients diagnosed with EHS through a structured clinical interview and video-polysomnography (vPSG) recordings. We also reviewed the available literature that addressed the presentation and clinical and PSG characteristics of EHS.The case series included four men and two women of a mean age of 44.2 years (between 13 and 77 years). Their episodes were variable in expression, between a sudden firecracker-like explosion to a gun-shot sound, mostly as if happening inside the head. It is always associated with distress but never pain. Five out of six patients had other sleep-related problems with a close relationship of EHS symptoms to comorbid sleep disorder manifestations and exacerbations. The vPSG of five patients were unremarkable. An attack was documented in one patient arising in stage N2. Three patients responded well to reassurance and treatment for the comorbid sleep disorder. The other three patients responded well to amitriptyline (10-50 mg).EHS is a well-characterized under-recognized hypnic parasomnia with a benign course. Amitriptyline seems to be effective in persistent cases.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Abnormal Sexual Behavior During Sleep: Sexsomnia and Moreby Rouf  Pirzada, Ahmed S BaHammam, and Ahmd KkuhSleep and Vigilance,  2019Background The purpose of the paper was to describe cases of abnormal sexual behavior during slee... more Background The purpose of the paper was to describe cases of abnormal sexual behavior during sleep in Saudi Arabian patients and classify them under the pertinent subtype. Methods Patients diagnosed with abnormal sexual behavior during sleep received a clinical interview and underwent video-polysomnography recordings at the University Sleep Disorders Center, King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh. Results Three men and one woman between 27 and 46 years of age reported abnormal sexual behaviors during sleep, with duration of symptoms ranging from 4 months to 3 years. Episodes consisted of masturbation without seeking the participation of a sleeping partner (case no. 1), attempts at sexual intercourse with inappropriate and uncharacteristic vocalizations and behaviors (cases no. 2 and 3), and rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD) presenting with abnormal sexual behavior (case no. 4). The frequency of the episodes ranged from 1-3 per week to 2-3 per night. Cases 1, 2, and 3 were amnestic of these events and expressed surprise to their partners' account of their behavior. However, case no. 4 had a full recall of the event. Conclusions Sexsomnia (a non-REM parasomnia) is characterized by abnormal sexual behavior during sleep ranging from masturbation to inappropriate attempts at achieving sexual intercourse followed by total amnesia of the event. Nevertheless, REM behavioral disorder can, at times, present as abnormal sexual behavior during sleep, like sexual dream enactments, which may mimic sexsomnia. Therefore, the condition warrants diagnostic consideration as abnormal sleep-related sexual behavior.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, radical changes in daily routine are almost always fraught with harmful outcomes and often long‐term adverse sequelae. Sleep and circadian clock/ rhythm are some such biological processes that are sensitive changes. There is growing evidence to support the idea of maintaining a regular sleep/wake pattern and circadian rhythm synchrony to keep a healthy body and mind.[1] Fiddling with the biological clock due to any social or socioeconomic reason results in deleterious physiological and metabolic effects.[1] “Daylight saving time” (DST) and its close cohort “Delaying the starting times of school and office/work during Ramadhan” are the two adopted protocols that fall into this category. DST has been in debate for decades, and we need to put its cohort (Ramadan month sleep pattern) in the same seat.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prevention of spread through aerosol generation is one of the essential strategies in this regard, particularly for patients with sleep-disordered breathing at home and during hospital admission. Aerosols are produced, at home and in health care facilities, by natural processes and aerosol-generating procedures. To address this impinging problem, aerosol-generating procedures, like non-invasive ventilation (NIV), are to be handled meticulously, which might warrant isolation and sometimes device/interface modifications.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
