The rapid development and progress of communication, technology, and new media in each period has shaped, changed, and transformed the cinema industry. In recent years, technological developments, which allow the rapid increase in content that offers interactive experiences to the users of other branches of art, remarkably the game industry, have also affected the literature of cinema and brought a new concept-Virtual Reality (True Virtual Reality-TVR) and 360 Degree Film (Cinematic Virtual Reality-CVR)-that has destroyed the monopoly of the magic curtain. While it is possible to see the transition from pellicle to digital as a change, it is possible to call the transition from digital to virtual reality a revolutionary transformation. This study aims to put forward the relatively new virtual reality technology and digital film narrative by comparing traditional cinema and virtual reality/360-degree film narrative structures to understand this transformation better. In the study, based on this definition, the short film Refugee Crisis in the context of the 360-degree film; the position of the director, the part of the audience, 360-degree framing and orientation, dynamic narrative structure, and transformation from the audience to the user were evaluated in terms of form and content. As a result of this study, it was determined that the VR cinema and 360-degree film technology is in a transitional phase today. It is predicted that today’s technologies such as virtual reality, 360-degree video format, and metaverse will create a new language with its narrative structures and technical form shortly, beyond changing and transforming the language of cinema.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kenan Subaşı and +1Alev Fatos  Parsa•  6  New Media, Virtual Reality (Computer Graphics), Digital Cinema, Virtual RealityThe technique of the use of Virtual Learning Environment in the process of organizing the future teachers' terminological work by specialtyThis paper studies the concept related to E-learning and the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and their role in organizing future teachers’ terminological work by specialty.

A pesquisa realizada pode ser caracterizada como exploratória e descritiva de abordagem qualitativa. Na fase de coleta de dados, utilizou-se três técnicas, desenvolvidas de forma sucessiva e trianguladas. Para análise dos dados, utilizou-se a técnica da análise qualitativa de conteúdo de Mayring. O metaverso pode ser caracterizado como um espaço (ambiente ou plataforma) virtual, que proporcionará a criação de uma realidade paralela, impactando e transformando o mundo atual. Trata-se de um local onde as pessoas poderão se encontrar, interagir e conviver em uma realidade diferenciada da vivida do mundo real, de forma imersiva. Essa imersão não está limitada apenas a um espaço virtual, gráfico ou mundo de histórias, mas, também, à imersão social e com ela o estímulo à interação e produção de conteúdo. O metaverso e todos os aparatos necessários à sua sustentação provocarão uma revolução na maneira como as pessoas poderão se relacionar, aprender, comercializar, e outros aspectos da vida cotidiana. Pode-se afirmar que o metaverso será vital em vários setores da atividade humana, entre eles, educação, entretenimento, medicina, indústria, comércio, prestação de serviços, em que as interações sociais poderão ser facilitadas pela imersão e realidade virtual. O artigo avança nos estudos sobre metaverso pela perspectiva de potenciais usuários, abordando questões relacionadas às tecnologias habilitadoras, aspectos comportamentais, morais, regulatórios, sensações e percepções, o impacto na cadeia de valor e estrutura das organizações.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ingrid Weingärtner Reis•The effect of height and shoulder-to-hip ratio on interpersonal space in virtual environmentPrevious research has associated men&#39;s physical features such as height and Shoulder-to-Hip Ratio (SHR) with dominance.

Proxemics literature has suggested that the interpersonal space (comfort distance) increases in threatening and uncomfortable situations and decreases in unthreatening and comfortable situations. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effect of different heights and SHRs on comfortable interpersonal distance by systematic manipulation of virtual confederates bodily features. More specifically, participants determined their comfort distances from virtual male confederates with different heights and SHRs in a virtual environment. We hypothesized that a virtual confederate&#39;s height and SHR influences the perception of interpersonal dominance; and consequently interpersonal space increases for taller and broader confederates as a result of increased interpersonal dominance. Results showed that comfortable interpersonal distance was positively associa...Save to LibraryDownloadby Sandra Mouta•  8  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Perception, Interpersonal CommunicationFire Safety Game: an Educational Learning Innovation to Increase Fire Safety Knowledge among Vocational StudentsSave to LibraryDownloadby antinah latif•  2  Vocational Education, Fire safetyDes Jeux Symboliques Aux Rituels CollectifsSave to LibraryDownloadby Fabrice Clément•Virtual RealitySave to LibraryDownloadby Alice Chirico•PsychologyColor accurate monitors: Basic features and comparison of four monitorsSave to LibraryDownloadby Adi Abileah•  7  Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, CalibrationStatistical Approach of User's Experience in the Visualization of Architectural Images in Different EnvironmentsSave to LibraryDownloadby David Fonseca Escudero•  8  Computer Science, Human Computer Interaction, Visualization, User eXperienceTrippel oktay signedSave to LibraryDownloadby Oktay Bekar•3D stereo displays for air traffic control: a multidisciplinary framework and some resultsSave to LibraryDownloadby Dương Thùy Vũ•  8  Engineering, Computer Science, Visualization, Human Factors5 AMAZING BRIDAL EYE MAKEUP IDEASBridal eye makeup can make or break a look.

Reducing ageism is an important social endeavor. Studies have shown that when people move in synchrony, they become cooperative and develop a sense of similarity towards each other. While many efforts are invested to decrease ageism, the ability of synchronous movements (dancing with music) to decrease ageism has not yet been investigated. Eighty-eight young adults, who did not know each other before the experiment, were randomly assigned to one of four dyadic conditions. These included dancing together for 11 minutes in synchrony (sync) or out of synchrony (async) with a young adult (20-45 years) or an older adult (65+ years). Reaction time of young participants was measured by the Brief-Implicit Association Test (BIAT) at baseline and immediately after the intervention. The BIAT measures congruently matched compared with noncongruently matched pictures of young and older faces and valanced positive and negative words. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect of Synchrony × Time (pre vs post) on the BIAT score. The analysis demonstrated a BIAT score reduction from baseline to post-intervention only in the synchronous condition. We conclude that joint dance has the potential to reduce implicit ageism among young adults.Save to LibraryDownloadby Assaf Suberry•  7  Music Psychology, Stereotypes and Prejudice, Intergenerational Relationships, AgeismCharacterizing the Effects of Haptic Rendering Parameter Variations on Perceived Kinesthetic Rendering AccuracySave to LibraryDownloadby Bolun Zhang•  4  Computer Science, Rendering (Computer Graphics), Kinesthetic learning, Haptic TechnologyFactors Facilitating Cultural Learning in Virtual Architectural Heritage EnvironmentsBesides being a medium for exhibiting three-dimensional heritage objects, the design and development of virtual heritage environments could also facilitate cultural learning.

Gesture-based interaction is one of the prominent fields of natural interactions. The recognition and application of hand gestures in virtual environments (VEs) need extensive calculations due to the complexities involved, which directly affect the performance and realism of interaction. In this paper, we propose a new interaction technique that uses single fingertip-based gestures for interaction with VEs. The objective of the study is to minimize the computational cost, increase performance, and improve usability. The interaction involves navigation, selection, translation, and release of objects. For this purpose, we propose a low-cost camera-based system that uses a colored fingertip for the fastest and accurate recognition of gestures.

In this environment we used the geometric transformations of translation and rotation with the structure of hierarchies of HTML pages, without the use of the coordinates of each polyhedra vertex. The developed environment can be used in classroom to visualize the polyhedra in Augmented Reality, with the possibility of manipulations of the graphical representations by students in the environment created in Virtual Reality. Other studies that can be developed with the polyhedra modeled are areas, volumes and the relation of Euler. Another important content that can be developed is truncation, because seven Archimedes polyhedra are obtained by using truncation of Plato's polyhedrons. With this work, it becomes possible to develop didactic materials with a simple technology, free and with great contribution to improvement of the teaching of Geometry and other areas that use representation of 3D objects.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paulo Henrique Siqueira•  6  Virtual Reality (Computer Graphics), Augmented Reality, Realidade Virtual, Realidade Aumentada<b>Cibercenários: Hekuras, Karuanas & Kurupiras</b>O projeto apresenta a possibilidade de miscigenação do campo biológico com instrumentos tecnológicos computacionais em jornadas que utilizam a computação gráfica tridimensional interativa como cibercenários e que possibilitam a... moreO projeto apresenta a possibilidade de miscigenação do campo biológico com instrumentos tecnológicos computacionais em jornadas que utilizam a computação gráfica tridimensional interativa como cibercenários e que possibilitam a participação ativa dos intérpretes que com elas interagem.
