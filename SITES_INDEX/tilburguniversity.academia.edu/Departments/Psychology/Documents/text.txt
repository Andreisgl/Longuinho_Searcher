Similarly, self-harm (SH) concerns clinicians that observe this behavior in clinical populations. SH is more common amongst individuals with mental and neurodevelopmental disorders and is observed more in the female population. Although a link between SH and ADHD has recently been established, it is pertinent to investigate this link regarding sex differences further, to help clinicians understand the underlying roles of sex on the relationship between ADHD and SH. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to determine whether female individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at a heightened risk for SH compared to male individuals diagnosed with ADHD. Out of the initial 504 articles acquired through 3 databases; A total of 8 studies were analyzed in this study. Four studies alluded to possible sex differences, with the female sex being at a heightened risk for SH. However, three of these studies were conducted on all-female samples, whereas one study has not analyzed sex differences statistically. Furthermore, the remaining four studies have a perfect divide between finding sex effects to be present and not finding any sex effects. Thereupon, no clear conclusion on the existence of sex effects within self-harming ADHD populations can be drawn, making the results of this study inconclusive. Thus, it is recommended to fill this gap within the literature with more research on self-harm and ADHD concerning sex and gender differences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ilayda Siner•  7  Psychology, ADHD (Psychology), Gender Differences in ADHD, Gender DifferencesAR Furniture Placement: An Evaluation of the User-Onboarding Process of Ikea PlaceSave to LibraryDownloadby Ilayda Siner•Life Satisfaction among the Poorest of the Poor: A Study in Urban Slum Communities in IndiaThis study investigates the level and predictors of life satisfaction in people living in slums in Kolkata, India.

Participants of six slum settlements (n = 164; 91% female) were interviewed and data on age, gender, poverty indicators and life satisfaction were collected. The results showed that the level of global life satisfaction in this sample of slum residents did not significantly differ from that of a representative sample of another large Indian city. In terms of life-domain satisfaction, the slum residents were most satisfied with their social relationships and least satisfied with their financial situation. Global life satisfaction was predicted by age, income and non-monetary poverty indicators (deprivation in terms of health, education and living standards) (R2 15.4%). The current study supports previous findings showing that people living in slums tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction than one might expect given the deprivation of objective circumstances of ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Jasmijn Loos•  7  Psychology, Socioeconomics, Poverty, Life SatisfactionMaternal mindfulness and anxiety during pregnancy affect infants neural responses to soundsSave to LibraryDownloadby Bea Van den Bergh and +2Mercuri EIstván Winkler•The Child Effect in Media and Communication Research: A Call to Arms and an Agenda for ResearchThis article reviews the literature on the child effect and suggests that it is an undervalued approach to studying the way families deal with media and the way they communicate.

Even young children play an active part in their own socialization and there are many instances in which it is the child who socializes the parent, rather than the other way around. Media and communication research offers excellent opportunities for studying this child effect because the introduction of new media or new types of content often provides quasi-experimental ...Save to Libraryby Bea Van den Bergh•  3  Prenatal Stress, Prenatal Development, cognitive  developmentAccurate R peak detection and advanced preprocessing of normal ECG for heart rate variability analysisSave to LibraryDownloadby Bea Van den Bergh•  5  Time Series, Heart rate variability, Heart rate, Bit Error RateStress during pregnancy: Is the autonomic nervous system influenced by anxiety?...

Van den Bergh &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; M. Ackx, 2003) was identical for children who stutter (CWS), typically developing children (TDC), and children with vocal nodules (CWVN). A principal axis factor analysis was performed on data obtained with the Dutch CBQ from 69 CWS, 149 TDC, and 41 CWVN. All children were between the ages of 3;0 (years;months) and 8;11. Results indicated a 3-factor solution, identified as Extraversion/Surgency, Negative Affect, and Effortful Control, for each of the participant groups, showing considerable similarity to previously published U.S., Chinese, Japanese, and Dutch samples. Congruence coefficients were highest for CWS and TDC and somewhat more modest when comparing CWVN and TDC. The Effortful Control factor consistently yielded the lowest congruence coefficients. These data confirm that although stuttering, voice-disordered, and typically developing children may differ quantitatively with regard to mean scores on temperament scales, they are similar in terms of their overall underlying temperament structure. The equivalence of temperament structure provides a basis for further comparison of mean group scores on the individual temperament scales.Save to Libraryby Bea Van den Bergh•  22  Cognitive Science, Child Development, Ancient Indo-European Languages, Statistical AnalysisAntenatal Maternal Anxiety is Related to HPA-Axis Dysregulation and Self-Reported Depressive Symptoms in Adolescence: A Prospective Study on the Fetal Origins of Depressed MoodSave to LibraryDownloadby Bea Van den Bergh•  23  Depression, Neuropsychopharmacology, Adolescent, AnxietyAntenatal maternal anxiety and stress and the neurobehavioural development of the fetus and child: links and possible mechanisms.
