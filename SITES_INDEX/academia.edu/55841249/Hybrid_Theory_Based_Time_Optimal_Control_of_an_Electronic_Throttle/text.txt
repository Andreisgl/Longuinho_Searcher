It can successfully replace its mechanical counterpart if a control loop satisfies prescribed requirements : a fast transient response without overshoot, positioning within the measurement resolution, and the control action that doesn't wear out the components. Static accuracy within the measurement resolution bit rules out the need for an additional idle speed control actuator thus reducing the production costs while a fast transient response makes the superimposed engine torque control system faster and directly improves drivability of the vehicle. Furthermore, fulfilling the performance requirements reduces the fuel consumption and air pollution.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInternational Journal of ControlConstrained optimal control of an electronic throttle2006 • Nedjeljko PericDownload Free PDFView PDFSynthesis for idle speed control of an automotive engine2004 • Alberto Sangiovanni VincentelliThe problem of maintaining the crankshaft speed of an automotive engine within a given set interval (idle speed control), is formalized as a constrained control problem using a hybrid model of the engine. The control problem is difficult because the system has delays and a large number of constraints. The approach for the synthesis of a controller for this system is based on the theory developed for affine systems on polytopes.Download Free PDFView PDFEngineeringElectronic Throttle Control System: Modeling, Identification and Model-Based Control Designs2013 • Robert LohDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

Electronic Throttle Control provides benefits such as improved air-fuel ratio for improving the vehicle performance and lower exhausts emissions to meet the stringent emission norms. Modern vehicles facilitate various features such as Cruise Control, Traction Control, Electronic Stability Program and Pre-crash systems. These systems require control over engine power without driver intervention, which is not possible with conventional mechanical throttle system. Thus these systems are integrated to function with the electronic throttle control. However, due to inherent non-linearities in the throttle body, the control becomes a difficult task. In order to eliminate the influence of this hysteresis at the initial operation of the butterfly valve, a control to compensate the shortage must be added to the duty required for starting throttle operation when the initial operation is detected. Therefore, a lot of work is being done in this field to incorporate the various nonlinearities to achieve robust control. In our present work, the ETB was tested to verify the working of the system. Calibration of the TPS sensors was carried out in order to acquire accurate throttle opening angle. The response of the calibrated system was then plotted against a step input signal. A linear model of the ETB was prepared using Simulink and its response was compared with the experimental data to find out the initial deviation of the model from the actual system. To reduce this deviation, non-linearities from existing literature were introduced to the system and a response analysis was performed to check the deviation from the actual system. Based on this investigation, an introduction of a new nonlinearity parameter can be used in future to reduce the deviation further making the control of the ETB more precise and accurate.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Numerical Modelling: Electronic Networks, Devices and FieldsAsymmetric modelling and control of an electronic throttle2015 • Leonardo AchoDownload Free PDFView PDFControl Synthesis for Idle Speed Control of a Car EngineAlberto Sangiovanni VincentelliThe problem we address in this paper is to control an automotive engine such that the its speed is maintained at a set point or within a set interval. The model we use for the idle speed control of the engine is a hybrid system with three discrete states and a six-dimensional continuous state space. The control problem is difficult because the system has delays and a large number of constraints. The approach we use to synthesize a controller for this system is based on the theory developed for affine systems on polytopes.Download Free PDFView PDFIEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology, 2003State estimation of an electronic throttle body2003 • Nedjeljko PericDownload Free PDFView PDFHybrid Theory Based Model Predictive Control of Electrical Drives with FrictionLuka MaticIn this paper hybrid theory has been applied to design a state-feedback control law of an electrical drive with friction. The drive is modeled as a piecewise affine (PWA) system and a finite time optimal control problem is formulated for such a hybrid system. Three most often used friction models are considered and compared based on their suitability for the PWA description. It is shown that a reset-integrator friction model gives a PWA model of smaller complexity than LuGre and Karnopp friction models. A state-feedback optimal control law in a form of a look-up table is then derived via dynamic programming. The control system behavior is tested by computer simulations. The results indicate that the proposed control strategy is a valuable alternative to the currently used control strategies.Download Free PDFView PDFHybrid control for automotive engine management: The cut-off case1998 • Alberto Sangiovanni VincentelliA novel approach to the control of an automotive engine in the cut-off region is presented. First, a hybrid model which describes the torque generation mechanism and the power-train dynamics is developed. Then, the cut-off control problem is formulated as a hybrid optimization problem, whose solution is obtained by relaxing it to the continuous domain and mapping its solution back into the hybrid domain. A formal analysis as well as simulation results demonstrate the properties and the quality of the control law.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
