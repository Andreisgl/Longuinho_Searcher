Discuss'Seven years of the American occupation of Japan culminated with the signing of the San Francisco ... more Seven years of the American occupation of Japan culminated with the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in September. This treaty, becoming manifest at the end of the occupation, granted Japan an increased level of independence and intended to provide the nation with the foundation to emerge as a prosperous, stable member of an American-led capitalist bloc. Beginning by promoting democratisation and demilitarisation, policymakers came to designate the state as an integral piece in a global balance of power game with Communist Russia. Thus concurrent with persistent anti-communist rhetoric, policy in Japan shifted from democratic reform to economic reconstruction. Washington promoted the production of goods and the revitalisation of Japanese industry whilst championing Japan’s prospective position in a regional ‘anti-communist great crescent’.  The end of occupation therefore should be understood in relation to the American ambition of fostering an anti-communist ally by encouraging independent Japanese economic development. However, whilst various scholars ,  have perceived these objectives as being directly related to the Communist threat during the Cold War, this essay will examine the wider aspects of the global environment and the larger economic and political situation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These politically unaffiliated citizens or shimin, like the organised parties of the left, stood in fervent opposition to the Japanese political ruling hierarchy. The proliferation of citizen activists within these protests indicates more than just a mass resistance to political legitimacy; it serves to simultaneously demonstrate the existence of a new autonomous political space for civilian protest and a reinterpretation of Japanese democracy. As well as constituting Japan’s largest post-war social movement, the ANPO struggle also marked a watershed moment in the dynamics of Japanese politics and society. With the actualisation of citizen protest, the ANPO struggle served to indigenise democracy in Japan. This emergence of the citizen activist therefore remains the most potent legacy of the mass protests of the ANPO. This essay will therefore elucidate the role of the citizen activist and present its relevance in relation to the 1960 protest movement, concluding that the ANPO protests sparked the emergence of citizen protest on an unprecedented level.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This process involved a push into overseas expansionism. Additionally Japan displayed its military influence by defeating Russia and China in two separate wars and controlling territories throughout the region. Taiwan, Korea and Manchuria were all subsumed under Japanese influence. There were three fundamental reasons that formed Japan’s desire to undertake overseas military expansionism and become an imperialist power. Initially, an ideological rationale for overseas expansion was associated with a domestic understanding of Japan’s comparative position within the region coupled with a desire to establish and maintain national sovereignty against Western Imperial subjugation. The purpose of maintaining sovereignty adapted to include military motives that involved exerting a military presence abroad to safeguard national security or strategic locations. Economic motives involved involved expanding overseas in order to utilise foreign markets and acquire resources. However, at any occasion no single factor was at play, the motives worked in tandem for mutual benefit. A militarist motivation partnered an ideological motivation in securing Japanese sovereignty and military economic motives enhanced the military by providing capital for its expansion. These motives were central to the domestic politics of the period, ushering in policies and government legislation that worked to accomplish their aims.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Assess the claim that the KMT government has transformed Taiwan's external relations since 2008'In 2008 Ma Ying-jeou won the election race for the 12th President of the Republic of China (ROC/T... more In 2008 Ma Ying-jeou won the election race for the 12th President of the Republic of China (ROC/Taiwan) with 58% of the vote. The victory of the Kuomintang party (KMT) ended eight years of consecutive rule by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). With victory, Ma was now the incumbent political actor faced with both managing tense cross-strait relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC/China) and establishing Taiwan on the international stage.    Since the election Taiwan’s relations with China have altered dramatically. Importantly, Ma has downplayed attempts at finding a solution to the previously contested dichotomy between unification and independence and has instead championed a new approach of reconciliation and cooperation. This process of confidence building with China is exhibited through Ma’s “three no’s” policy and his acceptance of the ‘1992 Consensus’ which serves to maintain the political status quo. Establishing further diplomatic ties with the PRC as well as increasing Taiwan’s international profile comes as a result of reconciliation. In addition, the signing of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement holds for Taiwan the interdependent ambitions of closer cross-strait economic relations whilst simultaneously seeking wider economic activity in the region. This essay therefore will provide an account of the development in cross strait-relations and the consequent impact on wider external relations since Ma was sworn in as president in 2008.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Following this, I will assess its success in relation to two potential solutions. The metalinguistic solution will attempt to solve the puzzle by asserting that the sentences differ in informational content linguistically. Once this has been demonstrated to be incommensurable, I will turn to the sense/referent solution that postulates the concept of sense in relation to a statement, thus allowing for the truth-value to remain the same, but the information to differ. However I will conclude to the effect that due to the idiosyncratic nature of sense, Frege’s solutions fail.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In doing this it will become apparent that in its utilisation a meaning and truth-value can be given to the sentence “the golden mountain does not exist”.  I will then move onto an analysis of this theory. Due to the word constraint and because of a desire to allow for a greater understanding, I will focus solely on Strawson’s critique from "On Referring". I will conclude to the effect that although Strawson's criticism seems damaging, Russell's theory can still persist.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An explication of this stance will involve an exegesis and analysis of Heidegger’s 1950 essay, The Origin of the Work of Art. Through an understanding of this work, it will become evident that Heidegger tackles and explains the nature of art not in relation to artistic desire or intention, or even as a direct imitation of nature, but rather through a relation of Being and truth. To understand how this is the case, it will therefore be essential to present a formulation of Heidegger’s conception of truth as alethia; uncovering or revealing. This will demonstrate, through an explication of Van Gogh’s shoes that artwork can be seen as expressing the relationship between being and truth.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to understand why this is the case I will initially look at Sartre’s understanding and consequential rejection of the Freudian theory regarding failures of self-knowledge. A rejection of the Freudian perspective will lead onto an analysis of Sartre’s account of the problem of bad faith. I will then conclude by asserting that the self-acknowledged homosexual man can indeed be accused of acting in bad faith.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In detailing Plantinga’s account, careful attention will be paid to the interplay between naturalism, evolution and the probability of our having reliable cognitive faculties . Plantinga’s account of the nature and efficaciousness of beliefs will be comprehensively laid out in order to give a detailed explanation of the argument. Given constraints on word count, I will primarily be looking at Plantinga’s EAAN as detailed in Naturalism Defeated.  In order to offer a thorough analysis of Plantinga’s argument, Bergman’s assertion that R are known in a common sense way will be expressed. Furthermore, Ramsey’s rejection from the essay ‘Naturalism Defended’, expressing that Plantinga fails to provide a systematic answer as to why false beliefs can demonstrate adaptive behaviour will be assessed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Explain and assess Kripke's argument against physicalism' During the course of this essay I will elucidate Kripke’s argument as given in his essay ‘Naming ... more During the course of this essay I will elucidate Kripke’s argument as given in his essay ‘Naming and Necessity’. Kripke attacks the physicalist stance by postulating notions of contingency and necessity in rigid designators and the role they have to play in how we understand a concept. I will demonstrate how Kripke formulates this conception of identity and establish how he applies it to the identity between pain and C-Fibre stimulation. This application will entail that we can conceive of pain without C-Fibre stimulation and vice versa, rejecting identity theory and therefore physicalism. I will also expound Loar’s defence of Physicalism as he attempts to clarify that identity can also occur between properties. I will conclude to the effect, through an understanding of Law’s formulation of a stronger antiphysicalist argument, that physicalism fundamentally fails.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to fully answer the question it will be essential to gain an understanding of the fundamental positions on truth in the philosophies of both Heidegger and Nietzsche. In order to do this an explication of Nietzsche’s conception of truth, as illusion will occur, this will culminate in an understanding of art and its relation to Being in the form of the will to power. Once a clarification of Nietzsche’s position has been demonstrated, Heidegger’s assertion of art involving techne and therefore as entailing an unconcealment of Being will be deliberated.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

During the course of this essay, I will elucidate the reasons why Heidegger postulated the need to return to the question of the meaning of Being. This will entail an understanding of the motives behind why Heidegger rejected traditional philosophy and will inevitably culminate in an illumination of Heidegger’s conception of Dasein. A conclusion will claim that Heidegger has something not only important, but also original and necessary to tell us about the flawed nature of philosophical enquiry and how we are to now proceed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In accordance with the theory of the Forms a brief understanding of Plato’s epistemological position will be clarified claiming that one can only have true knowledge through an understanding of the Forms, this will then allow us to view art in accordance with this enterprise. Once an assessment of this has been undertaken, a closer look at the Form of Beauty will be engaged as a possible evaluative marker of artistic representation. Once it has been eluded that the question of the assessment of art through an understanding of the Form of Beauty cannot be undertaken an analysis of mimesis will occur. This analysis will entail that neither painting nor poetry can provide knowledge of the Forms. Furthermore, poetry has the capacity to subdue the rational faculties of man and should therefore be banned from the polis.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In order to demonstrate this conclusion I will initially give a detailed description of art forgery and what it consists of in a philosophical context. Once this has been established through the Van Meegeren case, I will discuss the possibility that aesthetic value lies solely in perceptual qualities of art and thus there is no difference between a forgery and an original. When it has been made apparent through the use of conceptual art that empiricism alone cannot account for aesthetic appreciation, I will consider Goodman’s hybrid view. I will continue by explicating Denis Dutton’s paper ‘Artistic Crimes: The Problem of Forgery in the Arts’ and conclude that there is more to the aesthetic value of an artwork than just the perceptual qualities; namely achievement. Henceforth we are justified in our revising of our aesthetic judgement on an artwork after learning that it is a forgery.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
