Lobbying and minority government in Australia: The concept of the marginal memberAustralian Journal of Political Science,  2015Within Westminster-based majority parliaments, the presence of minority government runs contrary ... more Within Westminster-based majority parliaments, the presence of minority government runs contrary to the conventional wisdom. Over the last 40 years, however, there has been a steady voting trend away from major parties in many of these parliaments. The complex composition of the Australian Senate after July 2014 reinforces that non-ministerial marginal members continue to be a vital part of the political landscape. This article introduces the concept of the marginal member and examines the potential influence of these members for legislative outcomes and lobbying success. In doing so, the article provides a heuristic through which to identify avenues of policy influence and presents a range of strategies for lobbyists working with marginal members within minority-government contexts. 在英式多数制议会内，少数党政府的存不符合传统的智慧。在以往40年里，许多英式议会出现了一种偏离多数党的稳定趋势。澳大利亚参院2014年之后的复杂构成，说明非内阁边缘成员依然是政治格局中有活力的部分。本文提出了边缘成员的概念，考察了他们对立法结果及游说成败的潜在影响力。本文提供了一种关于政策影响渠道的思路，以及在少数党政府的情况下如何游说边缘成员的一系列办法。Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Such situations pose new questions for notions of government legitimacy within Westminster systems. For instance, is negotiation with cross-benchers an example of government illegitimacy? What is the legitimate role of non-ministerial members when the composition of parliament gives them the final say on the enabling legislation for public policy? What is the legitimate response of the public sector regarding policy-making in the context of minority government? In this paper, we reflect on how a ‘marginal member’ concept can provide new insights into such issues and their implications.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This process of devolution has been widely criticised for including insufficient consultation. This paper assesses whether that criticism is fair. Modifying Archon Fung’s framework for the analysis of public participation mechanisms, we begin by considering whether the depth of public engagement has been limited. Then, by comparing these consultation practices with other examples (including one we have ourselves trialled in pilot experiments), we find that deeper forms of public engagement would have been both possible (though at some financial cost) and productive.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

With narrowing expectations on children in the classroom, the pressures of less time and resources on teachers, as well as Australia increasingly welding education onto the economy, it is becoming ever easier to think about differences in children as deficiencies, disorders or even economic dangers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
