English has many spelling variants (for example, British English and U.S. English), and some decisions need to be made. Use the following guidelines:
In quotes from written sources, cite the source and copy as written.
If the cited text includes spelling (or grammar) errors, insert {{sic}} immediately after the erroneous word. Do not do this if the spelling is merely a variant, or if it is from old texts that used different spelling conventions. Check an appropriate dictionary (e.g., Merriam-Webster Online for U.S., Cambridge Dictionaries Online for UK English) first to ensure that the spelling is an error.
In quotes from spoken sources, use the spelling which the person would have used, as best you can determine. (Use the accent as a hint.)
In comments, notes, and translation, use a consistent spelling throughout the page.
