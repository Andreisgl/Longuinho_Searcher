Thomas WierFree University of Tbilisi,  Humanities,  Faculty MemberGeorgian Language+32My work focuses on the theory and typology of polysynthetic languages, with special focus on morphological blocking, incorporation, (non)configurationality, and complex systems of case and agreement.  Aside from this, I have spent much of my career working on languages of the Caucasus, primarily Georgian and its dialects, as well as a variety of Native American language families, including Algonquian, Uto-Aztecan, and Tonkawa.Address: Free University of TbilisiKakha Bendukidze University Campus of DighomiDavit Aghmashenebeli Alley, 13kmTbilisi 0131, Georgialess1,123 Followers580 Following1 Co-authorTotal Views ;22 Public MentionsFollowFollowingCVall4 Books14 Papers15 Talks2 Squibs, short notes and teaching documents4 CorporaMore  1 Translations18 Book Reviews5 Interviews and public media publications3 Blog postsBooksGeorgian Morphosyntax and Feature Hierarchies in Natural LanguageWhat are linguistic features, and how do they manifest themselves in natural languages?

The Georgian language provides a particularly acute set of challenges to linguists in the way it questions received assumptions about grammatical functions, thematic relations, and natural language categorization.   This dissertation tackles these facts by examining first what the evidence for different domains of grammar are in Georgian. How do data from Georgian verb morphology challenge traditional assumptions underlying lexical incremental assumptions behind the morpheme? Do inversion facts argue for monostratal or multistratal conceptualizations of grammatical functions?  The answer to both of these questions is highly complicated, and requires an extensive look at the Georgian systems of case, agreement, tense, aspect, and modality.  In particular I assess the viability of classical treatments such as Harris (1982), Anderson (1993), Marantz (1992), and Stump (2001) and find that Georgian poses problems for each one.  I go on to assess in the second part how differential feature hierarchies in morphology versus syntax argue for the existence of distinct feature geometries.  Feature hierarchies, it turns out, are epiphenomena of set-theoretical properties of these geometries.  In the last chapter, I discuss the literature on feature hierarchies arguing how many scholars have misunderstood this highly abstract area of grammatical theorizing.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Much of what is known about Tonkawa—an “isolate” language, related to no others—comes to us through the stories collected and translated by twentieth-century anthropologist Harry Hoijer. These texts, constituting the entire remaining oral literature of the Tonkawa people, are edited and presented here in the original Tonkawa and newly translated into English, along with a new and up-to-date grammatical description. Hoijer’s original transcriptions were largely unannotated and unglossed and were translated word for word, with no free English translation of full clauses. In this volume, Thomas R. Wier provides translations for each line of text along with morphological analysis of each Tonkawa word. He breaks each line of the original Tonkawa text into its constituent parts, glosses each of these in turn, and translates the whole into English. For the first time in nearly a century, his work supplies an entirely new grammatical description—using the modern terms, conventions, and insights of modern linguistic theory—that will help linguists understand the structure of the Tonkawa language. The tales themselves—divided into “Night Stories” of a pre-human mythological past, and “Old Stories” of humans caught up in unexpected adventures—act as a crucial resource for scholars and any readers interested in the literature of this prominent Native American tribal group. For both the language it preserves and the stories it tells, Tonkawa Texts is an invaluable repository of Tonkawa culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In modern Georgian, this process has become restricted to a small set of construction types, including a kind of nonfinite adverbial subordinate clause, or converb, which affixes the genitive-dative string -isa-s to verbal gerundives with the meaning 'while Xing'. This paper will survey the origin and functions of this construction, and show that because it retains some of the morphological and syntactic properties of nominals, it constitutes a kind of noncanonical converbal construction.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This chapter will survey the various kinds of expressive language present in the three autochthonous Caucasian families Abkhaz-Adyghean, Kartvelian and Nakh-Daghestanian, and find they vary in terms of:  1) their morphological exponence, 2) the extent to which their overall typological profile constrains how expressive forms may be formed,3) grammatical categories exclusive to expressives,4) expressives as a source for lexical innovation,5) expressives as a locus of diachronic change It will also look in-depth at the specific morphological and syntactic peculiarities of expressives in Georgian, which exhibit exuberant consonant clusters, processes of reduplication uncharacteristic of the language as a whole, as well as specific morphosyntactic alignment splits between different classes of expressive. Expressives will be seen to be not one thing, but many.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This will look at both features that lead to an aggregate increase in morphological complexity, such the decline of tmesis in preverbs and their ultimate grammaticalization onto the verb, allowing for the possibility of ‘trapped morphology’ in the terms of Harris and Faarlund (2006). While such processes result in a net increase of morphological complexity, there also exist countervailing declines in morphological complexity in other ways, such as with the loss of –(e)n plural number agreement. Then there are cases of ‘ambivalent’ grammaticalization, such as clitic agreement and aspectual-modality markers (=q’e, =mca, =dzi) which never quite ‘made it’, as well as various phonological changes in dialects which have had some rather serious knock-on effects to verb morphology. Georgian verbal morphology will be seen to be not a fixed unchanging template, but a kaleidoscope of multisystemic, ongoing morphological change.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

And do Caucasian languages do anything different from obscenities in more familiar Western languages? In this talk, we will deconstruct the idea of obscenity and discuss them from the perspective of linguistic taboos.
