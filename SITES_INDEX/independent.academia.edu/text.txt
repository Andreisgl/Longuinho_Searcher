Nevertheless, the image of Ninus contains elements of Near Eastern origin. Ctesias and Diodorus portray Ninus as a son of nobody, resembling Sargon of Agade and Nabopolassar, but this image changes in later Greek historiography. According to Abydenus, Ninus is the seventh in a line of kings and founders of important cities in Mesopotamia. This pedigree is a far echo of the myth of the seven sages who, in Babylonian tradition, introduced civilisation to mankind before the deluge. In Moses of Chorene's History of Armenla, this genealogy is combined with that of Noah's son Cush, adding another oriental tradition to the story of Ninus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
