Pre-trial/remand prison population: trendFemale prison population: trendPrison population trend up to 2000Pre-trial/remand prison population: trendThe table below gives an indication of the recent trend in the pre-trial/remand prison population. The final row shows the latest figures available.It consists of the number of pre-trial/remand prisoners in the prison population on a single date in the year (or the annual average) and the percentage of the total prison population that pre-trial/remand prisoners constituted on that day.  The final column shows the pre-trial/remand population rate per 100,000 of the national population.                                                TRINIDAD & TOBAGOYearNumber in

Consequently the above figures give an indication of the trend but the picture is inevitably incomplete.The pre-trial/remand population rate is calculated on the basis of the national population total. All national population figures are inevitably estimates but the estimates used in the World Prison Brief are based on official national figures, United Nations figures or figures from other recognised international authorities. Female prison population: trendThe table below gives an indication of the trend in the female prison population. The final row shows the latest figures available.It consists of the number of female prisoners in the prison population on a single date in the year (or the annual average) and the percentage of the total prison population that female prisoners constituted on that day. The final column shows the female prison population rate per 100,000 of the national population.                                               TRINIDAD & TOBAGOYearNumber of

All national population figures are inevitably estimates but the estimates used in the World Prison Brief are based on official national figures, United Nations figures or figures from other recognised international authorities.(If the rate were calculated on the basis of the number of females in the national population it would of course be approximately double the figure in the final column).
