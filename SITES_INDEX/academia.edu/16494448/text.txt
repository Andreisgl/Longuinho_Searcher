I. Epidemiology of Symptomatic Acute Dengue Infection in Children, 2006–20092012 • Saravudh SuvannadabbaDengue infection is one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases. More data regarding the disease burden and the prevalence of each clinical spectrum among symptomatic infections and the clinical manifestations are needed. This study aims to describe the incidence and clinical manifestations of symptomatic dengue infection in Thai children during 2006 through 2008. This study is a school-based prospective open cohort study with a 9,448 person-year follow-up in children aged 3-14 years. Active surveillance for febrile illnesses was done in the studied subjects. Subjects who had febrile illness were asked to visit the study hospital for clinical and laboratory evaluation, treatment, and serological tests for dengue infection. The clinical data from medical records, diary cards, and data collection forms were collected and analyzed. Dengue infections were the causes of 12.1% of febrile illnesses attending the hospital, including undifferentiated fever (UF) (49.8%), dengue fever (DF) (39.3%) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (10.9%). Headache, anorexia, nausea/vomiting and myalgia were common symptoms occurring in more than half of the patients. The more severe dengue spectrum (i.e., DHF) had higher temperature, higher prevalence of nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, diarrhea, petechiae, hepatomegaly and lower platelet count. DHF cases also had significantly higher prevalence of anorexia, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain during day 3-6 and diarrhea during day 4-6 of illness. The absence of nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, petechiae, hepatomegaly and positive tourniquet test may predict non-DHF. Among symptomatic dengue infection, UF is most common followed by DF and DHF. Some clinical manifestations may be useful to predict the more severe disease (i.e., DHF). This study presents additional information in the clinical spectra of symptomatic dengue infection.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of tropical medicineFrequency and clinical manifestations of dengue in urban medellin, Colombia2014 • Francisco DiazA dengue fever surveillance study was conducted at three medical facilities located in the low-income district of San Javier in Medellin, Colombia. During March 2008 to 2009, 781 patients with fever regardless of chief complaint were recruited for acute dengue virus infection testing. Of the 781 tested, 73 (9.3%) were positive for dengue infection. Serotypes DENV-2 (77%) and -3 (23%) were detected by PCR. One patient met the diagnostic criteria for dengue hemorrhagic fever. Only 3 out of 73 (4.1%) febrile subjects testing positive for dengue infection were diagnosed with dengue fever by the treating physician. This study confirms dengue virus as an important cause of acute febrile illness in Medellin, Colombia, but it is difficult to diagnose without dengue diagnostic testing.Download Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesEarly Clinical Features of Dengue Virus Infection in Nicaraguan Children: A Longitudinal Analysis2012 • Oscar OrtegaDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS neglected tropical diseasesCorrelation of serotype-specific dengue virus infection with clinical manifestations2012 • nicolas aguayoDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS Neglected Tropical DiseasesEvaluation of the Traditional and Revised WHO Classifications of Dengue Disease Severity2011 • Andrea NuñezDownload Free PDFView PDFCLINICAL PRESENTATION OF DENGUE IN 150 ADMITTED CASES IN DHAKA MEDICAL COLLEGE2006 • Anup SahaDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesFactors Associated with Dengue Shock Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis2013 • Javier ZamoraDownload Free PDFView PDFJ Dhaka Med CollSERO-EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DENGUE VIRUS INFECTION IN CLINICALLY SUSPECTED PATIENTS ATTENDED IN DHAKA MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL DURING JANUARY TO DECEMBER 20162017 • nusrat fatemaIntroduction: Dengue is now established as one of the most important Arboviral infection in tropical countries. As the epidemic continues worldwide, this Aedes mosquito-transmitted pathogen is considered a major re-emerging tropical disease and significant public health concern. The study was conducted to determine the sero-epidemiology and clinical picture of dengue virus infection among the clinically suspected patients attended in Dhaka Medical College Hospital had fever with temperature >39°C. Blood sample was collected during acute febrile phase of patients and separated sera were tested for NS1 dengue antigen and IgM antibodies using commercial test kits (NS1 by OMC Healthcare (Pvt. Results: Of the total 145 patients 40 (27.6%) were positive for Dengue NS1 antigen and or IgM antibody test. Of the positive 40 patients, 18 (45%) were positive for NS1, 19 (47.5%) were positive for IgM and 3 (7.5%) were positive for both NS1 and IgM antibody. Major clinical manifestations were fever with arthralgia (79.5%) and retro-orbital pain (50%). Conclusion: Outbreak of Dengue fever is continuing every year and typical presentation of Dengue fever has changed. Arthralgia and retro orbital pain was the most common clinical feature in the present study instead of headache and rash with fever. A large number of suspected dengue cases were negative by Dengue tests for antigen NS1 and IgM antibody which suggests other organisms of similar clinical manifestations are becoming prevalent in Dhaka city.Download Free PDFView PDFPLOS Neglected Tropical DiseasesClinical Forms of Chikungunya in Gabon, 20102012 • Melanie CaronBackgroundChikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused multiple outbreaks in tropical and temperate areas worldwide, but the clinical and biological features of this disease are poorly described, particularly in Africa.
