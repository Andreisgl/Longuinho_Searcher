In particular, around 80,000 people die per year or paralyse in Australia due to problems related to medical errors and are mainly caused by the non-integrated nature of HIS.

BEEBEEJAUN MOHAMMAD REZA, Hemant B Chittooe-Health has emerged as a fundamental tool to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health delivery systems. However, evidence suggests that the success of e-health implementation needs a comprehensive e-health readiness assessment of the different stakeholders. e-Health readiness assessment represents a significant step to analyse the existing settings and provide appropriate approaches to successful e-health transformation. The objectives of this study are to provide an assessment of the e-health readiness in the public health sector of Mauritius and to gauge the perceptions of different cadres about the critical factors for e-health implementation. A cross-sectional approach was adopted to elicit relevant data among different cadres randomly chosen from the five regional hospitals in Mauritius. One of the main findings of this study is that the staff in the public health sector of Mauritius are ready to adopt e-health and provide full support for its implementation. Identified attributes were categorised based on the literature to develop a conceptual framework. The result has shown significant contribution of different constructs included in the framework. The results also provide an understanding and the need to focus on the right strategy to introduce e-health in Mauritius. Hence, the model may practically be used by health practitioners and researchers in the e-health readiness assessment status when there is a plan to implement an e-health system.Download Free PDFView PDFThe development and initial psychometric validation of the eHealth readiness scaleCarolyn M Yeager, Arjun BhallaParticipant attrition and non-adherence are common issues within eHealth interventions. There is need for a better understanding of who has interest in using these technologies. The current study developed and psychometrically evaluated the eHealth Readiness scale, which assesses user preparedness to engage in eHealth interventions. Construction of scale items was informed by the theory of self-efficacy, as well as the eHealth and eLearning literature. An initial validation was conducted with an undergraduate sample (N ¼ 195, Aged 18e51, M ¼ 21.53, SD ¼ 5.16). Continued validation of the scale was done with a sample of military mental health providers (N ¼ 64, Aged 29e80, M ¼ 49.30, SD ¼ 11.97) in a randomized controlled trial for an eHealth intervention. Results illustrated that scale items demonstrated good internal reliability (Cronbach's a ¼. 81 and 0.83), and a stable one-factor solution. Results also established construct validity for the scale. Results of an independent samples t-test indicated no significant difference in eHealth readiness scores between those who did and did not engage with the eHealth intervention, but scores for those who engaged were marginally higher. Current findings provide preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the eHealth readiness scale.Download Free PDFView PDFInteractive journal of medical researchHealth Care Provider Adoption of eHealth: Systematic Literature Review2013 • Pradeep RayeHealth is an application of information and communication technologies across the whole range of functions that affect health. The benefits of eHealth (eg, improvement of health care operational efficiency and quality of patient care) have previously been documented in the literature. Health care providers (eg, medical doctors) are the key driving force in pushing eHealth initiatives. Without their acceptance and actual use, those eHealth benefits would be unlikely to be reaped. To identify and synthesize influential factors to health care providers&#39; acceptance of various eHealth systems. This systematic literature review was conducted in four steps. The first two steps facilitated the location and identification of relevant articles. The third step extracted key information from those articles including the studies&#39; characteristics and results. In the last step, identified factors were analyzed and grouped in accordance with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Tech...Download Free PDFView PDFThe American journal of managed careEHR adoption among ambulatory care teams2015 • Dawn Heisey-groveOBJECTIVES This study provides information on the types of practices that employ 2 types of advance practice providers (APPs), nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs), and the association between employment of APPs and health information technology (IT) adoption by the practice. STUDY DESIGN Three outcomes predicted the likelihood that practices employed at least 1 NP, at least 1 PA, or at least 1 of either type of APP; one outcome estimated electronic health record (EHR) adoption across practices; and 4 models assessed the EHR functionalities used by practices. METHODS Data from SK and A Information Services&#39; 2013 Office-Based Provider Database were used to estimate EHR adoption using a Poisson regression model. Independent variables included practice size, care setting, practice specialty, ownership, geographic region, whether a practice employed a NP, and whether a practice employed a PA. RESULTS In 2013, three-fourths of practices that employed at least 1 AP...Download Free PDFView PDF… .
