Analisa a importância do conceito de alienação mental na formação do lugar social da loucura na sociedade moderna e, com ele, a constituição de um sujeito alienado, incapaz de subjetividade e de desejo: um não-sujeito da loucura &quot;medicalizada&quot;. Em continuidade, após uma elaboração sobre a genealogia da subjetividade, reflete sobre as práticas atuais no campo da saúde mental que têm como proposta a construção coletiva do sujeito da loucura, não mais como sujeito alienado, mas como protagonista, isto é, de uma nova relação social com a loucura.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eduardo Henrique•  6  Sociology, Medicine, Alienation, SubjectivityCommunity placement for insanity acquittees: a preliminary study of residential programs and person-situation fitThe present study, one of the first of its kind, describes the characteristics of community living placements for insanity acquittees conditionally released following hospitalization, along with the &quot;fit&quot; between living... moreThe present study, one of the first of its kind, describes the characteristics of community living placements for insanity acquittees conditionally released following hospitalization, along with the &quot;fit&quot; between living placement and individual characteristics. Although the small number of insanity acquittees (n = 13) and community placements (n = 9) precluded meaningful statistical analyses of results, the study provides a model for studying the characteristics of placements as well as personal characteristics of acquittees, and the interaction between the two. It also suggests the possible importance of this interaction, operationalized as &quot;fit&quot; between characteristics and placement. Consistent with research findings for other criminal defendants and for nonforensic psychiatric patients released from hospitalization, a better fit between acquittee and community placement may be associated with increased likelihood of success on conditional release.Save to LibraryDownloadby K.

However, the concept of early intervention has emerged during the 19th century but it did not make much impact on practice. The aim of this review is to identify the difficulties appeared during that period of time which could provide insight into the modern development of early intervention initiatives. A narrative review which focused on English literature about early intervention for insanity during the 19th century was undertaken. Clinicians during the 19th century recognized that treatment would be the most effective at the early stage of the mental illness and they had emphasized the importance of early intervention. However, because of a number of factors, such as the limited roles of asylums, lack of knowledge about mental disorder and the lack of effective treatment, the idea of early intervention did not make imp...Save to LibraryDownloadby Hằng Châu•  11  Psychology, Psychiatry, Early Intervention, PsychotherapyMadness and idiocy: Rethinking a basic problem of philosophy of psychiatry

For the Late Modern thinker of madness, the problem was not one of defining madness in contrast to sanity, but in contrast to “idiocy” – the apparent diminution or abolition of one’s reasoning power. This altered reading of the problem has an important consequence. For what distinguishes madness from idiocy is not the failure, absence, or lack of reason, but its presence – albeit in a perverse and mutated form. For the Late Modern theorist, madness was always, by its very nature, infused with reason. This “infusion” of madness by reason has two consequences for philosophy of psychiatry today: it revitalizes the project of defining “mental disorder,” and it provides intellectual scaffolding for the emerging movement known as Mad Pride.This is a Philosophical Case Conference with seven commentaries and my response, “Lack, Perversion, Shame.” Only the target article and my response are available here, not the commentaries, which were written by Wouter Kusters, Sofia Jeppsson, Jon Tsou, Valentina Cardella, Awais Aftab, Richard Gipps, and Konrad Banicki.Save to LibraryDownloadby Justin Garson•  3  Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Psychiatry, History Of Madness And PsychiatryThe Insanity of Our "Leaders" May Doom UsSave to LibraryDownloadby Alton C.

I examine patient case-notes from the Bethlem, York Retreat and Surrey County Pauper Asylum to establish that the experiential or &#39;real&#39; narratives of monomaniacs confirm the category&#39;s initial confusion with melancholia, and then its conflation with social commentary. Used sparingly in clinical practice, physicians account for a range of anti-social behaviour with its deployment as a diagnosis. However, I argue that it is in the literature of the day that the idea is most widely celebrated. Demonstrating its variant, unstable meanings, the texts I read use monomania explicitly. They include works by the Brontë sisters, Elizabeth Gaskell and George Eliot, neglected thriller pieces by Dinah Craik, the pseudonymous &#39;Thomas Waters&#39;, and an anonymously authored story from The Ladies&#39; Cabinet of Fashion, Music and Romance.

Ganz, “Carrying On Like a Madman: Insanity and Responsibility in Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” (pp. 363–397) This essay reads Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886) alongside medico-legal debates about the nature and scope of insanity, arguing that the novel seeks to shore up the idea of individual responsibility in Victorian society. The cognitive test of insanity that emerged from the M’Naghten case of 1843 deemed a person legally irresponsible for his acts if, due to a defect of reason resulting from mental disease, he was unable to perceive the nature and quality of his acts or to know that they were wrong. Alienists such as James Cowles Prichard and Henry Maudsley, however, argued that this test failed to acknowledge the existence of affective and volitional disorders such as moral and impulsive insanity. In their treatises, they urged judges to adopt a more permissive standard—an “irresistible impulse” test—that deemed acc...Save to LibraryDownloadby Melissa J .

Yet, the concept of free will is also difficult to define and operationalize, and, moreover, it is intensely debated. In particular, the very existence of free will has been denied based on recent neuroscience findings. This debate has significant implications on those fields in which the link between free will and behaviour is the main focus of interest, such as forensic psychiatry. In fact, a tension is often experienced between the centrality of the notion of free will on the one hand, and its controversial status on the other. This tension needs to be addressed, especially in forensic psychiatry, since it is relevant for actual assessments of legal insanity. In the present paper we will try to operationalize “free will” using a fourpartite decision-making capacity model, which can be used in forensic assessment of insanity. We will describe its advantages and application to guide mental insanity assessments....Save to LibraryDownloadby Massimo Biondi•  16  Psychology, Decision Making, Forensic psychiatry, Free Will[Closing forensic psychiatric hospitals in Italy: a new deal for mental health care?]The date of March 31, 2015, following the Law 81/2014, has marked a historical transition with the final closure of the six forensic psychiatric hospitals in Italy.

This law identifies a new pathway of care that involves small-scale high therapeutic profile facilities (Residenze per la Esecuzione della Misura di Sicurezza, REMS) instead of the old forensic psychiatric hospitals. The Law promotes a new recovery-oriented rehabilitation approach for the persons with mental disorders who committed a criminal offence, but lack criminal responsibility and deemed as socially dangerous. After a brief description of what happens abroad, this article highlights the positive aspects of the law that, as a whole, has to be considered innovative and unavoidable.

In klassischen Darstellungen handelt es sich hierbei zumeist um die subjektive Perspektive der*des Wahnsinnigen im Kontrast zu einer objektiven Betrachter*innenposition, welche durch die Sichtbarmachung ihrer Differenzen einander definieren. Anders ist es bei Hartmanns Inszenierung von Erniedrigte und Beleidigte, in dem es Wahnsinn als klar erfassbares Gegenstück zu geltenden Norm- und Wertvorstellungen nicht mehr zu geben scheint. Vielmehr haben wir es hier mit einer pluralistischen Ansammlung aufeinandertreffender Perspektiven zu tun, die sich einer Zuordenbarkeit fast gänzlich entziehen.Zentral für die Unterscheidung zwischen dargestelltem Wahn als semiotischen Zeichenkomplex und performativen Wahn, der in alle Aspekte der Inszenierung integriert ist, ist, dass es unmöglich ist zu sagen um wessen Wahn es sich handelt. Wahnsinn als kollektiver, gewaltsamer und produktiver Traumprozess entzieht sich einer konkreten Zuordnung, auf einzelne Individuen, stattdessen handelt es sich um etwas das im Bruch zwischen verschiedenen Akteuren entsteht. Als eine Form der künstlerischen Störung bietet Wahn einen Kommunikationsraum, der durch die Gleichberechtigung aller Akteure gekennzeichnet ist und der durch das Aufbrechen von Sinnzusammenhängen geltende Strukturen sichtbar und neu verhandelbar macht. Dies äußert sich in der Inszenierung unter anderem durch eine Dehierarchisierung des Textes in der Performance. Weiters löst Erniedrigte Wahnsinn vom Subjekt und macht ihn, durch eine Einschreibung in den theatralen Raum als entstehend im Dazwischen kenntlich. Auch der Wahnsinn der Figuren im Roman verräumlicht sich in der Gestaltung des Bühnenbildes, kennzeichnend sind hier vor allem die Überlappungen innerer und äußerer Reize, sowie die Anerkennung und Nebeneinanderstellung subjektiver Perspektiven. Zuletzt wird Wahnsinn in der postdramatischen Auseinandersetzung als Ereignis begriffen, was Erniedrigte und Beleidigte durch das Element der Improvisation und eine starke Betonung der affizierenden Wirkung von Ausdrücken des Wahnsinns fassbar macht. Als konstitutive Elemente des performativen Wahnsinns lassen sich also festhalten: 1. Die Einarbeitung von Wahnsinn über semiotische Darstellungen hinaus in alle Prozesse der Inszenierung2. Das Anerkennen seiner produktiven Wirkung in Form der künstlerischen Störung und die damit verbundene Dehierarchisierung der Kommunikation 3. Ein Verständnis von Wahnsinn als entstehend im Dazwischen von sozialen Sphären und Netzwerken und seine Loslösung vom Subjekt.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lisa Hasenbichler•  3  Postdramatic theatre, Insanity, Fiodor DostojewskiChallenging the Insanity DefenseThe Supreme Court of Indiana in Barcroft v.

References in the M&#39;Naghten Rules to the appropriate standard of wrongfulness were ambiguous, resulting in a divergence of judicial opinion as to whether wrongfulness means legal wrong, subjective moral wrong, or objective moral wrong. This article reviews and analyzes these three judicial standards of wrongfulness in the context of case law from jurisdictions that follow each of the respective standards. The evolution of knowledge of right and wrong tests of criminal responsibility is traced back to its philosophical roots. Most psychiatrists claim no expertise in matters of morality or law. The American Psychiatric Association would bar psychiatric expert testimony on the ultimate issue of insanity, on the grounds that there are &quot;impermissible leaps in logic&quot; when psychiatrists opine on the probable relationship between medical concepts and moral-legal construc...Save to LibraryDownloadby Merrill Rotter•  9  Psychology, Law, Homicide, Expert testimonyFeudal languages!

The first part starts with an important question: is the insanity defense constitutionally required? The United States Supreme Court will finally try to answer this question next term in the case of Kahler v. Kansas. I say “finally” because the Court refused to answer this question in 2012 when it denied certiorari to an appeal brought by John Joseph Delling, a severely mentally ill defendant who was sentenced to life in prison three years earlier for two murders. Delling never had the opportunity to plead the insanity defense because his home state, Idaho, had abolished it in 1982. By depriving Delling of the right to plead insanity, Idaho violated Delling’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and his Eighth Amendment right against “cruel and unusual” punishment. Naturally, the same is true for many other mentally ill and disabled defendants who have been prosecuted in Idaho and in the other three states that have abolished the ins...Save to LibraryDownloadby Ken  Levy•  11  Law, Philosophy, Political Science, Supreme CourtIntroduction: histories of asylums, insanity and psychiatry in ScotlandThis paper introduces a special issue on ‘Histories of asylums, insanity and psychiatry in Scotland’, situating the papers that follow in an outline historiography of work in this field.

Using Allan Beveridge’s claims in 1993 about the relative lack of research on the history of psychiatry in Scotland, the paper reviews a range of contributions that have emerged since then, loosely distinguishing between ‘overviews’ – work addressing longer-term trends and broader periods and systems – and more detailed studies of particular ‘individuals and institutions’.

There is a need for clarity in the law and agreement between experts on a standardised form of assessment and diagnosis in these challenging cases. We suggest that the time has come for a standardised, internationally recognised diagnostic protocol to be set as a minimum standard in all cases of suspected sleep-related forensic cases. The protocol of a full medical history, sleep history, psychiatric history, neuropsychiatric and psychometric examination and electroencephalography (EEG), should be routine. It should now be mandatory to carry out routine polysomnography (PSG) to establish the presence of precipitating and modulating factors.

It comes as no surprise that our current world continues inquiring about the realm of “mental health”, questioning how it manifests physiologically and gets expressed outwardly. Far from being an objective practice, observing, interpreting, and acting on meanings constructed of mental health remains an intersubjective process involving multiple stakeholders. And, indeed, the stakes are high. Pronouncements of individuals’ mental health, particularly regarding diagnoses, play a significant role in shaping the trajectory of persons’ lives indefinitely. Given the myriad of consequences tied to diagnostic practices, Cristina Hanganu-Bresch and Carol Berkenkotter’s 2019 book, Diagnosing Madness: The Discursive Construction of the Psychiatric Patient, 1850-1920, examines the historical underpinnings of insanity in the making.

We discuss and address possible pitfalls of this interdisciplinary interaction. Using insights from analytic philosophy of psychiatry, we investigate whether there were significant differences in the explicit conceptualisation of the notion of harm in diagnoses of moral insanity in relevant texts of Austrian and Croatian psychiatrists at the turn of the 19th and 20th century. Our finding that different notions of harm were at the core of debates on moral insanity in early Croatian psychiatry indicates the fruitfulness of the interaction between analytic philosophy and intellectual history of psychiatry.Save to LibraryDownloadby Vinko Drača•  4  Psychology, Croatian, Insanity, HarmKnowledge awareness and attitude about epilepsy among schoolteachers in IndiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Pragya Mishra•  19  Psychology, Epilepsy, Medicine, Java ProgrammingPsykisk helse hjå barn i barnehagenMasteroppgåva handlar om korleis vaksne i barnehagen kan fremme god psykiskhelse hjå barn i barnehagen ved hjelp av gode relasjonar.
