In the "Rede zum Shakespeare-Tag" Shakespeare receives the title of the "greatest Wanderer" in recognition of the sheer scope of his dramatic powers of representation and his status of a surrogatee Muse. Goethe at that time was known to many as a wanderer in line with his habit of trekking on foot over long distances as with the notion of pilgrimage associated with this word. The "wanderer" thus gained a highly ambiguous and unsettling connotation in Goethe's psyche. In 1772 Goethe wrote two poems which differed radically by pointing to alternative stategies in Goethe's bid to define his personal profile in relation to "Shakespeare," his source of inspiration. They were "Wandrers Sturmlied" and "Der Wandrer." A close examination of these works follows. In translation "Der Wandrer" was to exert a great influence on William Wordsworth's development.Download Free PDFView PDFJust WanderingJUST WANDERING, a plea for a little less critical conversation and a closer regard for literary texts and the words they contain2017 • Julian ScuttsHere you may read the text of a book that inspects words based on the common root of the verbs wandern in German and to wander in English in works by Shakespeare, Goethe, Wordsworth among other Romantic poets and Robert Browning.
