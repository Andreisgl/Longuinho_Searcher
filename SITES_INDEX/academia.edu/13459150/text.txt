Aim: This study has been conducted to determine the possible perinatal and neonatal risk factors of autism. Method: The present study is a case control study, 50 children with autismall of them fulfilling the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–IV-TR) recruited from the Psychiatric Clinic, Institute of Postgraduate Childhood Studies, Ain Shams University and 50 apparently healthy children of matchingage& sex recruited from different outpatient clinics as control group. Detailed history to all children including all the suspected risk factors through well-designed questionnaire and general examination with laying stress on neurological examination were done to all children enrolled in the study. Assessment of severity of autistic symptoms was done to cases. Results: High paternal and maternal age? 35 years at child birth, breech and other abnormal presentation, caesarean delivery, Preterm baby< 37 weeks of gestation, low birth weight < 2500 gm., 1st baby in the family and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia were identified as significant risk factors of autism. Conclusion: Our findings support several perinatal, neonatal and paternal risk factors of autism. However, some have been associated with autism in several studies and should be considered as potential risk factors that provide small contributions to the etiology or causal pathway of autism.Download Free PDFView PDFAutism ResearchIndependent and dependent contributions of advanced maternal and paternal ages to autism risk2000 • Daniel TancrediDownload Free PDFView PDFHuman reproduction (Oxford, England)Association of assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment and parental infertility diagnosis with autism in ART-conceived children2015 • Sheree BouletAre assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment factors or infertility diagnoses associated with autism among ART-conceived children? Our study suggests that the incidence of autism diagnosis in ART-conceived children during the first 5 years of life was higher when intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was used compared with conventional IVF, and lower when parents had unexplained infertility (among singletons) or tubal factor infertility (among multiples) compared with other types of infertility. Some studies found an increased risk of autism among ART-conceived infants compared with spontaneously-conceived infants. However, few studies, and none in the USA, have examined the associations between types of ART procedures and parental infertility diagnoses with autism among ART-conceived children.
