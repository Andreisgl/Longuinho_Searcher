Alexander’s campaigns ... more Mythology facilitated encounters with the Unknown in the Hellenistic East. Alexander’s campaigns ushered in an epoch where Greeks and Easterners not only warred and traded with one another but lived together in large numbers. This meeting of the minds, as I aim to show, was facilitated by mythology. Eastern and Hellenic peoples were able to negotiate their distinct cultures with the aid of mythical kinship, stories, and figures. Myths acted as an intermezzo between Greeks and unacquainted races and locations.  However, even before this interaction took place, myths were a source of solace for Alexander during his campaign in unfamiliar territory. History regularly describes the general as either imitating or communing with mythical heroes. The mythological was often called upon as a form of guidance for Alexander, illuminating his mysterious past and calling.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This anachronistic paradigm however is insufficient for understanding the multidimensional nature of Greek/non-Greek interactions and exchange during the Hellenistic period. Rather, this thesis argues the dominant strategy adopted in cases of Greek/non-Greek interactions were both sides appealing to certain similarities and commonalities (universalism) that would allow diverse cultural traditions to bridge the gaps between them and overcome barriers to acculturation and exchange.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
