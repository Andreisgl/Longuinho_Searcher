(1) WorkgroupRikk Mulligan2016, Open Scholarship Initiative ProceedingsThe mechanisms used for scholarly publishing have remained largely unchanged over time, even as we’ve moved from a print-based world to a digital world. The scholarly communication ecosystem, however, is now undergoing a period of rapid transformation, including the introduction of new actors, new services, and increased pressure to improve the means of scholarly communication in order to meet the growing expectations of an information-rich world. Where to begin? The first question is to ask how scholarly publishing can provide the greatest benefit to global society in a sustainable way. Our two-day conversation about this question led us to the conclusion that the “black box,” monolithic model of scholarly publishing no longer serves most researchers. The most sustainable approach that best responds to the needs of authors and researchers today, and that may also pose the least amount of risk in completely disrupting the system, is disaggregated services—unbundling the products and...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIdeas in Ecology and EvolutionThe four pillars of scholarly publishing: The future and a foundation2014 • Mark SchildhauerDownload Free PDFView PDFReforming scholarly publishing and knowledge communication: From the advent of the scholarly journal to the challenges of Open Access2005 • Ana CorreiaDownload Free PDFView PDFPublishing Research QuarterlyChallenges to scholarly publishing2001 • Stephen MooneyThreats to professional and scholarly publishers abound since publishing is at a strategic inflection point. The inability of users to identity quality information, the advent of new technologies and services, and the fact that users want a variety of experiences all threaten your well-being. However, focusing on marketing, editorial, reputation, and by partnering effectively, publishers can avail themselves of the marketing opportunities presented, ironically enough, by the very threats themselves.Download Free PDFView PDFPali U. K. De Silva and Candace K. Vance, Scientific Scholarly Communication: The Changing Landscape2018 • Ana TomicicAfter a brief outline addressing the issue of market-oriented academic practices and their link to the requirements of the economy, De Silva and Vance give a more detailed overview of the historical evolution of scientific communication. The digital revolution has given rise to interpretations and perceptions that shake the foundations of the editorial world and intellectual activity in general. Debates are woven together around the possible disappearance of the book, the end of print civilization, free access to knowledge, the control of editorial markets, and the fragmentation of reading and thought. The “book chain” has evolved into multipolar networks. New actors (Amazon, Google, etc.) that did not exist in the printed book circuit appear. Others are disappearing or being challenged by the digital switchover. The bookstore no longer intervenes in the mediation of the digital journal; the library no longer ensures the long-term preservation of digital editorial production.

However, its current dynamics have deeply transformed the scientific life and conditioned in new ways the economics of academic knowledge production. They have also challenged the perceived common sense view of scientific research. Method: Analytical approach to set out a comprehensive framework on the current debate on scholarly publishing and to shed light on the peculiar organization and the working of this peculiar productive sector. Result: The way in which scientific knowledge is produced and transmitted has been dramatically affected by the series of recent major technosocietal transformations. Although the effects are many, in particular the current overlap and interplay between two distinct and somewhat opposite stances—scientific and economic—tend to blur the overall understanding of what scholarly publishing is and produces distortion on its working which in turn affect the scientific activities. The outcome is thus a series of intended and unintended effects on the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Conclusion: The article suggests that a substantial transformation characterizes science today that seems more like a thrusting, entrepreneurial business than a contemplative, disinterested endeavor. In this essay, we provide a general overview of the pivotal role of the scholarly publishing in fostering this change and its pros and cons connected to the idiosyncratic interplay between social norms and market stances.Download Free PDFView PDFCommunications of the ACMScholarly publishing model needs an update2011 • David RomanDownload Free PDFView PDFPublicationsTen Hot Topics around Scholarly PublishingCurt RiceThe changing world of scholarly communication and the emerging new wave of ‘Open Science’ or ‘Open Research’ has brought to light a number of controversial and hotly debated topics. Evidence-based rational debate is regularly drowned out by misinformed or exaggerated rhetoric, which does not benefit the evolving system of scholarly communication. This article aims to provide a baseline evidence framework for ten of the most contested topics, in order to help frame and move forward discussions, practices, and policies. We address issues around preprints and scooping, the practice of copyright transfer, the function of peer review, predatory publishers, and the legitimacy of ‘global’ databases. These arguments and data will be a powerful tool against misinformation across wider academic research, policy and practice, and will inform changes within the rapidly evolving scholarly publishing system.Download Free PDFView PDFFuture of scholarly publishing and scholarly communicationFuture of Scholarly Publishing and Scholarly Communication Report of the Expert Group to the European Commission2019 • Hernando Perdomo GomezEl futuro de la publicación académica y la comunicación académica Unión Europea, enero 2019 El Grupo de Expertos sobre el Futuro de la Publicación Académica y la Comunicación Académica fue creado para apoyar el desarrollo de políticas de la Comisión Europea sobre la Ciencia Abierta.
