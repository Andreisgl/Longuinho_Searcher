In this paper, we suggest that other linguistic phenomena like semantic and syntactic processing also rely on the activation of transient memory networks, which can be compared to active memory networks in the primate. Consequently, short-term cortical memory ensembles that participate in language processing can be phylogenetically tracked to more simple networks present in the primate brain, which became increasingly complex in hominid evolution. This perspective is discussed in the context of two current interpretations of language origins, the "mirror-system hypothesis" and generativist grammar.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEncyclopedia of Language & LinguisticsCognitive Basis for Language Evolution in Nonhuman Primates2006 • Ruth TincoffDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Human EvolutionPrimate communication, comparative neurology, and the origin of language re-examined1985 • Horst SteklisDownload Free PDFView PDFBrain and LanguageMirror neurons and the evolution of language2010 • Michael CorballisDownload Free PDFView PDFComparative primate neurobiology and the evolution of brain language systemsKaixin renHuman brain specializations supporting language can be identified by comparing human with non-human primate brains. Comparisons with chimpanzees are critical in this endeavor. Human brains are much larger than non-human primate brains, but human language capabilities cannot be entirely explained by brain size. Human brain specializations that potentially support our capacity for language include firstly, wider cortical minicolumns in both Broca's and Wernicke's areas compared with great apes; secondly, leftward asymmetries in Broca's area volume and Wernicke's area minicolumn width that are not found in great apes; and thirdly, arcuate fasciculus projections beyond Wernicke's area to a region of expanded association cortex in the middle and inferior temporal cortex involved in processing word meaning.Download Free PDFView PDFFeature Review Evolution, brain, and the nature of languageManu Gomez RodriguezDownload Free PDFView PDFBIOLINGUISTICSReview of the Summer Institute in Cognitive Sciences 2010: The Origins of Language2010 • 龔. 濤hku, Caicai ZhangDownload Free PDFView PDFOn being moved: from mirror neurons to  …Cues on the origin of language2007 • laila craigheroDownload Free PDFView PDFNeural NetworksLanguage evolution: neural homologies and neuroinformatics☆2003 • Michael A ArbibDownload Free PDFView PDFBehavioral and Brain SciencesFrom monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics2005 • Michael A ArbibDownload Free PDFView PDFLanguage and CognitionPrécis of "How the Brain Got Language: The Mirror System HypothesisMichael A ArbibDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
