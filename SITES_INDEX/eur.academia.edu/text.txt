Drawing on a range of case studies, including the Black Death, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 and the Fukushima disaster, the authors examine how societies dealt with shocks and hazards and their potentially disastrous outcomes. They reveal the ways in which the consequences and outcomes of these disasters varied widely not only between societies but also within the same societies according to social groups, ethnicity and gender. They also demonstrate how studying past disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods and epidemics, can provide a lens through which to understand the social, economic and political functioning of past societies and reveal features of a society which may otherwise remain hidden from view.

Drawing on a large database of twentieth-and twenty-first-century films depicting epidemics, the study looks into issues including trust, distrust, and mistrust; different epidemic experiences down the lines of expertise, gender, and wealth; and the difficulties in visualizing the invisible pathogen on screen. The authors argue that epidemics have long been presented in cinema as forming a point of cohesion for the communities portrayed, as individuals and groups "from below" represented as characters in these films find solidarity in battling a common enemy of elite institutions and authority figures. Throughout the book, a central question is also posed: "cohesion for whom?", which sheds light on the fortunes of those characters that are excluded from these expressions of collective solidarity. This book is a valuable reference for scholars and students of film studies and visual studies as well as academic and general readers interested in topics of films and history, and disease and society.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Coping with Crisis: The Resilience and Vulnerability of Pre-Industrial SettlementsWhy in the pre-industrial period were some settlements resilient and stable over the long term wh... more Why in the pre-industrial period were some settlements resilient and stable over the long term while other settlements were vulnerable to crisis? Indeed, what made certain human habitations more prone to decline or even total collapse, than others? All pre-industrial societies had to face certain challenges: exogenous environmental hazards such as earthquakes or plagues, economic or political hazards from ‘outside’ such as warfare or expropriation of property, or hazards of their own-making such as soil erosion or subsistence crises. How then can we explain why some societies were able to overcome or negate these problems, while other societies proved susceptible to failure, as settlements contracted, stagnated, were abandoned, or even disappeared entirely?This book has been stimulated by the questions and hypotheses put forward by a recent ‘disaster studies’ literature - in particular, by placing the intrinsic arrangement of societies at the forefront of the explanatory framework. Essentially it is suggested that the resilience or vulnerability of habitation has less to do with exogenous crises themselves, but on endogenous societal responses which dictate: (a) the extent of destruction caused by crises and the capacity for society to protect itself; and (b) the capacity to create a sufficient recovery. By empirically testing the explanatory framework on a number of societies between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century in England, the Low Countries, and Italy, it is ultimately argued in this book that rather than the protective functions of the state or the market, or the implementation of technological innovation or capital investment, the most resilient human habitations in the pre-industrial period were those than displayed an equitable distribution of property and a well-balanced distribution of power between social interest groups. Equitable distributions of power and property were the underlying conditions in pre-industrial societies that allowed 'favourable' institutions to emerge with high rates of participation down the social hierarchy, giving people the freedom and room to choose their own fate - not necessarily reliant on one coping strategy but with the capacity to combine many different ones in search of optimum resilience.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We show that women have often been portrayed as symbolic ‘carriers’ or ‘spreaders’ of disease – sometimes as a punishment – often connected to female characters deviating from their ‘expected’ gender roles prescribed to them during epidemics. One prescribed role is for women to take on heavy burdens during epidemic outbreaks – often by ‘selflessly’ caring for others. In extreme cases, this leads to women sacrificing themselves for the ‘greater good’ of the wider community. Both images are mutually reinforcing.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Estimating warfare-related civilian mortality in the early modern period: Evidence from the Low Countries, 1620-99by Bram  van Besouw and Daniel R CurtisEarly modern warfare in Western Europe exposed civilian populations to violence, hardship, and di... more Early modern warfare in Western Europe exposed civilian populations to violence, hardship, and disease. Despite limited empirical evidence, the ensuing mortality effects are regularly invoked by economic historians to explain patterns of economic development. Using newly collected data on adult burials and war events in the seventeenth-century Low Countries, we estimate early modern war-driven mortality in localities close to military activity. We find a clear and significant general mortality effect consistent with the localized presence of diseases. During years with major epidemic disease outbreaks, we demonstrate a stronger and more widely spreading mortality effect. However, war-driven mortality increases during epidemic years are of similar relative magnitude is those in non-epidemic war years. Given the omnipresence of warfare in the seventeenth-century Low Countries, war-driven mortality was remarkably constant rather than a sharp discontinuity. The economic impact of warfare likely played out over the long term rather than driven by sudden large mortality spikes creating rapid structural change.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By analysing examples from a large corpus of films about epidemics across the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, this article investigates how cinema has represented public health workers. We find that the public health worker in epidemic-related films tends to be elite or an authority figure with expertise, often male – whose personal burden and sacrifice goes unrecognised by others, or even directly challenged ‘from below’. However, although the public health worker as ‘ordinary hero’ rarely features, the ‘human’ side of epidemiologists, physicians and bacteriologists – through either personal redemption and a return to more humble roots, or recognition of personal error, questioning of official regulations and authorities, and eccentric and unorthodox behaviour – makes these ‘elite’ figures appear more ordinary, bridging the gap between the two.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Modern Rendition of a Pre-modern Scenario: Imperfect Institutions and Obscured Vulnerabilitiesby Bram Hilkens, Bram  van Besouw, and Daniel R CurtisJournal for the History of Environment and Society,  2020In recent decades, the West has appeared almost ‘invincible’ when faced with the threat of exogen... more In recent decades, the West has appeared almost ‘invincible’ when faced with the threat of exogenous environmental or biological shocks. In accordance with traditional modernity narratives, infectious diseases particularly seemed to belong to either the premodern world or a contemporary ‘underdeveloped’ world. Now that the West is in the full grip of a pandemic, however, it has become increasingly difficult to uphold the same modern/non-modern dichotomy. Moreover, the arrival of COVID-19 in Western countries has been characterised as a consequence of institutional failure or at least an omen of future structural institutional change. These institutions, however, are known to have been designed for perpetuating the ‘status quo’ rather than protecting the societies they govern against environmental shocks. Accordingly, we argue that modern institutions should not be seen as smooth, hermetically sealed, protective systems, but rather as inherently uneven, imperfect structures whose imperfections come to the surface in times of crisis. That is to say that institutional systems may ultimately prove capable of withstanding environmental shocks, yet social groups and ecological systems may still remain vulnerable, raising questions with regard to theoretical frameworks and methodologies used by historians on this topic.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
From One Mortality Regime to Another?

It concludes that we should put aside any lingering notion that late medieval Holland was very lightly affected by epidemic diseases: in fact, in Haarlem, these mortality crises were more severe than those seen in the seventeenth century. The data also reveal not one overarching “medieval mortality regime” but distinct changes between fewer but more severe spikes in the first half of the fifteenth century, and higher frequency of smaller spikes later on—especially in the period 1480–1530—with the number of mortality crises damping down after 1530. These mortality crises tended to produce more adult female victims than male, supporting recent findings from elsewhere in the late medieval Low Countries.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Epidemic diseaseoutbreaks, however, also help bring into focus a number of femaleburdens and hardships in the early modern Low Countries, possiblyborn out of structural inequalities and vulnerabilities obscured fromview in ‘normal times’, and which is supported by recent demographicresearch showing heightened adult female mortality comparedto male during epidemics. For women, these includedexpectations of care both inside and outside the familial household,different forms of persecution, and social controls via authoritiesfrom above and internal regulation within communities frombelow – though these were also restrictions that women of coursedid not always passively accept, and sometimes violently rejected.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There is, however, a paucity of sex-disaggregated mortality data for the period prior to the Industrial Revolution to test this view across a broader span of history. We offer a newly compiled database of adult burial information for 293 rural localities and small towns in the seventeenth-century Low Countries, explicitly comparing mortality crises against 'normal' years. In contrast to expected results, we find no clear female mortality advantage during mortality spikes and, more to the point, women tended to die more frequently than men when only taking into account those years with very severe raised mortality. Gender-related differences in levels of protection, but also exposure to vectors and points of contagion, meant that some of these female advantages were 'lost' during food crises or epidemic disease outbreaks. Responses to mortality crises such as epidemics may shine new light on gender-based inequalities perhaps hidden from view in 'normal times'-with relevance for recent work asserting 'female agency' in the early modern Low Countries context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Suspicious minds: cinematic depiction of distrust during epidemic disease outbreaksMedical Humanities,  2020One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other so... more One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust—or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people’s trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in ‘scientific fact’ by societies. As well as providing information on the ‘correct science’ behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics—that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases—Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)—in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society—based on race, gender or wealth—to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Climate and society in long-term perspective: Opportunities and pitfalls in the use of historical datasetsby Daniel R Curtis, Bas van Bavel, and Matthew  HannafordWires Climate Change,  2019Recent advances in paleoclimatology and the growing digital availability of large historical data... more Recent advances in paleoclimatology and the growing digital availability of large historical datasets on human activity have created new opportunities to investigate long-term interactions between climate and society. However, noncritical use of historical datasets can create pitfalls, resulting in misleading findings that may become entrenched as accepted knowledge. We demonstrate pitfalls in the content, use and interpretation of historical datasets in research into climate and society interaction through a systematic review of recent studies on the link between climate and (a) conflict incidence, (b) plague outbreaks and (c) agricultural productivity changes. We propose three sets of interventions to overcome these pitfalls, which involve a more critical and multidisciplinary collection and construction of historical datasets, increased specificity and transparency about uncertainty or biases, and replacing inductive with deductive approaches to causality. This will improve the validity and robustness of interpretations on the long-term relationship between climate and society. This article is categorized under: Climate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives K E Y W O R D S climate and society, conflict, historical datasets, long-term, plague 1 | NEW OPPORTUNITIES Concerns over the implications of global climate change have given new impetus to the need to understand the effects of climatic changes on society over the long term (Adamson, Hannaford, & Rohland, 2018; Haldon, Elton, et al., 2018). Recent advances in paleoclimatology and historical climate reconstruction have resulted in increased numbers of highly-resolved series of long-term climatic changes (Emile-Geay et al., 2017). Similarly, the digital age has enhanced our capacity to produce bigger datasets on historical variations in human activity than ever before. These new opportunities have led to an increasing use of historical data to untangle climate-society linkages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

There is, however, a paucity of sex-disaggregated mortality data for the period prior to the Industrial Revolution to test this view across a broader span of history. We offer a newly compiled database of adult burial information for 293 rural localities and small towns in the seventeenth-century Low Countries, explicitly comparing mortality crises against 'normal' years. In contrast to expected results, we find no clear female mortality advantage during mortality spikes and, more to the point, women tended to die more frequently than men when only taking into account those years with very severe raised mortality. Gender-related differences in levels of protection, but also exposure to vectors and points of contagion, meant that some of these female advantages were 'lost' during food crises or epidemic disease outbreaks. Responses to mortality crises such as epidemics may shine new light on gender-based inequalities perhaps hidden from view in 'normal times'-with relevance for recent work asserting 'female agency' in the early modern Low Countries context.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Suspicious minds: cinematic depiction of distrust during epidemic disease outbreaksMedical Humanities,  2020One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other so... more One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust—or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people’s trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in ‘scientific fact’ by societies. As well as providing information on the ‘correct science’ behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics—that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases—Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)—in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society—based on race, gender or wealth—to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Climate and society in long-term perspective: Opportunities and pitfalls in the use of historical datasetsby Daniel R Curtis, Bas van Bavel, and Matthew  HannafordWires Climate Change,  2019Recent advances in paleoclimatology and the growing digital availability of large historical data... more Recent advances in paleoclimatology and the growing digital availability of large historical datasets on human activity have created new opportunities to investigate long-term interactions between climate and society. However, noncritical use of historical datasets can create pitfalls, resulting in misleading findings that may become entrenched as accepted knowledge. We demonstrate pitfalls in the content, use and interpretation of historical datasets in research into climate and society interaction through a systematic review of recent studies on the link between climate and (a) conflict incidence, (b) plague outbreaks and (c) agricultural productivity changes. We propose three sets of interventions to overcome these pitfalls, which involve a more critical and multidisciplinary collection and construction of historical datasets, increased specificity and transparency about uncertainty or biases, and replacing inductive with deductive approaches to causality. This will improve the validity and robustness of interpretations on the long-term relationship between climate and society. This article is categorized under: Climate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives K E Y W O R D S climate and society, conflict, historical datasets, long-term, plague 1 | NEW OPPORTUNITIES Concerns over the implications of global climate change have given new impetus to the need to understand the effects of climatic changes on society over the long term (Adamson, Hannaford, & Rohland, 2018; Haldon, Elton, et al., 2018). Recent advances in paleoclimatology and historical climate reconstruction have resulted in increased numbers of highly-resolved series of long-term climatic changes (Emile-Geay et al., 2017). Similarly, the digital age has enhanced our capacity to produce bigger datasets on historical variations in human activity than ever before. These new opportunities have led to an increasing use of historical data to untangle climate-society linkages.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Economic inequality and institutional adaptation in response to flood hazards: a historical analysisby Bas van Bavel, Daniel R Curtis, and Tim SoensEcology and Society,  2018To adequately respond to crises, adaptive governance is crucial, but sometimes institutional adap... more To adequately respond to crises, adaptive governance is crucial, but sometimes institutional adaptation is constrained, even when a society is faced with acute hazards. We hypothesize that economic inequality, defined as unequal ownership of wealth and access to resources, crucially interacts with the way institutions function and are adapted or not. Because the time span for societal responses may be lengthy, we use the historical record as a laboratory to test our hypothesis. In doing so, we focus on floods and water management infrastructure. The test area is one where flood hazards were very evident—the Low Countries (present-day Netherlands and Belgium) in the premodern period (1300–1800)—and we employ comparative analysis of three regions within this geographical area. We draw two conclusions: first, both equitable and inequitable societies can demonstrate resilience in the face of floods, but only if the institutions employed to deal with the hazard are suited to the distributive context. Institutions must change parallel to any changes in inequality. Second, we show that institutional adaptation was not inevitable, but also sometimes failed to occur. Institutional adaptation was never inevitably triggered by stimulus of a hazard, but dependent on socio-political context. Even when vital for the community under threat, adaptation only tended to occur when the vested interests of those with wealth, resources, and power were directly hit.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
On the Importance of History: Response to Black as DeathInference,  Oct 19, 2018It is fitting that the economic historian who has worked most diligently over the past decade to ... more It is fitting that the economic historian who has worked most diligently over the past decade to gain a masterful understanding of the paleoscientific work behind research into historical climate and infectious diseases, Bruce Campbell, is reviewed by the scholar with arguably the strongest grasp of both the literature on the scientific aspects of plague dynamics and its history as reconstructed through the documents. Many scholars can master one side; Monica Green is one of the few that have mastered both. Green has a resoundingly positive view on what the natural sciences can provide to our (re)interpretations of historical development: " the sciences are documenting events that historians had not previously known " ; " in assessing the impact of the Black Death, we too must look beyond the chronicles of Boccaccio, de Mussis, and al-Wardi " ; and " a new kind of paleoscience can make up for a lot that humans cannot see. " We agree. The history of plague can no longer be written solely with recourse to the historical documents. An increasing emphasis on the contribution of the natural sciences in the study of plague leads to the question of what the future role of historians might be. We argue that some fundamental parts of the plague enigma cannot be solved without the contribution of historians working with manuscripts. It is our contention that the importance of history and historical data will only increase from its use in conjunction with new forms of scientific evidence and methods. In this response to Green's review of The Great Transition, we highlight three vital contributions that can still be made by historians to the study of plague and other diseases of the past.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Disasters and History: The Vulnerability and Resilience of Past Societiesby Bas van Bavel, Daniel R Curtis, Matthew  Hannaford, and Tim SoensCambridge University Press   (available now in hard copy and open access),  2020This monograph provides an overview of research into disasters from a historical perspective, mak... more This monograph provides an overview of research into disasters from a historical perspective, making two new contributions. First, it introduces the field of 'disaster studies' to history, showing how we can use history to better understand how societies deal with shocks and hazards and their potentially disastrous outcomes. Despite growing recognition of the importance of historical depth by scholars investigating disasters, the temporal dimensions of disasters have been underexploited up to now. Moreover, the historical record sometimes enables us to make a long-term reconstruction of the social, economic and cultural effects of hazards and shocks simply not possible in contemporary disaster studies material. We can therefore use 'the past' as a laboratory to test hypotheses of relevance to the present in a careful way. History lends itself towards this end because of the opportunity it offers to identify distinct and divergent social and environmental patterns and trajectories. We can compare the drivers and constraints of societal responses to shocks spatially and chronologically, and therefore enrich our understanding of responses to stress today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rapid economic development over the past 30 years in China created a modern miracle. In 1990, two-thirds of the country was living below the international poverty line, while in 2016 this was less than 1% of the population. However, this escape from widespread poverty has also coincided with heightened inequality – not only within cities between wealthy property owners and migrant wage laborers, but between cities with educational and health facilities and rural areas left behind. Meanwhile, in cities of North America and Western Europe, we see the emergence of generational inequalities – perhaps a cliché with some truth when we say that Millennials have become the first generation to be economically worse off than their parents since the 19th century. And while emerging economies in India, China, and Indonesia filled us with hope of a global country-by-country leveling process, stunted progress in South America, political instability in the Middle East, and persistent low growth and de-urbanization in Africa have dampened optimism.In this course, we place the emergence of capitalism and the growth of inequality in a long-term historical perspective. How did we get here? As with most of our pernicious contemporary challenges, much has its roots in developments going back far into the past. Over these 8 weeks, it’s our job to unravel them. Has history been one relentless march towards greater inequality, or have there been periods in which we have become more egalitarian? Is it possible to prevent inequality? Furthermore, what do we mean when say “inequality” – and how does that definition apply in specific historical contexts? Is something unequal if the society in question does not observe it to be unequal? A major aspect of this course is understanding some of the mechanisms that have led societies towards inegalitarian outcomes. What is the relationship between capitalism and inequality, or colonialism and inequality? What do we mean by “extractive societies”? How have hazards, shocks and disasters affected inequality, and vice-versa, how has inequality affected societies’ resilience, vulnerability and coping strategies in the face of hazards, shocks and disasters? And finally, how has economic inequality intersected with other issues regarding gender, race and sexuality, in order to forge new kinds of marginalization?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Epidemics and famine are yet to be consigned to the past – most noticeably seen in the food price spikes seen in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008-9, and in the challenges of Ebola or COVID-19. However, measuring the causes and consequences of these traumatic events is not straightforward. Can history allow us to view these challenges in a new light by offering a deeper temporal perspective? By comparing terrible cases such as the Black Death of 1356-43, the diseases of American colonization, the worldwide influenza pandemic of 1918-20, and the Great Leap Forward Famine in China of 1958-62, can we understand more about diseases today such as Ebola or COVID-19 or famines in East Africa, Yemen and Afghanistan? Although the past may be a ‘foreign country’, we shall see that there are also many points of continuity and similarity. In this course, we will understand more about the causes and characteristics of epidemics and famines, and how they relate to development and welfare, social (dis)order, gender inequalities, public health provision, and climate change and conflict. We also consider how epidemics and famines have been represented and remembered by surviving generations, and consider controversies over ‘who is to blame’. At the heart of the course, we show how epidemics and famines can shine new light on ‘social vulnerabilities’ often hidden from view in normal times.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

After an overview of the timeframe in which Daniel works – the late medieval and early modern periods, the conversation moves to a discussion of scholarly collaboration in the humanities. Daniel then discusses the benefits and challenges in quantitative work, especially in premodern contexts, and points out that few scholars reflect upon the biases in the datasets. These issues are connected to Daniel’s current project, which looks at inequality in the aftermath of premodern pandemic. The end of the interview focuses on another of Daniel’s recent projects – looking at diseases, epidemics and pandemics in film, where he examines how women or the poor appear in these films, or how they portray heroism.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
