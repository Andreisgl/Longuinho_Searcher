The investigation examined data using cultural and social differences toward accountability as a guide. A questionnaire developed was used to measure teacher dispositions toward internal (professional) accountability and external (bureaucratic) accountability and to determine if there were differences between teachers in the two countries, China and Canada. T-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and other measures of central tendencies were used to analyze data in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 20. Canadian teacher scores (n = 169) for external accountability (M = 4.55; SD = 0.44) were higher than teacher scores for internal accountability (M = 3.81; SD = 0.60). No differences between urban and rural areas were observed among Canadian teachers.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersResearch for Inclusive Education in International Cooperation Final ReportAnderson Chikumbutso MoyoDownload Free PDFView PDFInclusive EducationAshwani SharmaDownload Free PDFView PDFThe influence of international targets and donors on privatisation in and of education2.pdfTwambilire MwabunguluDownload Free PDFView PDFINTRINSIC MOTIVATION IN PRIMARY STUDENTS WITH DYSLEXIA IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS: A CASE STUDY IN KUBANG KERIAN *ENDANG ERWANI MD DOM & RAHIMAH EMBONGRahimah EmbongDownload Free PDFView PDFeducation policy analysis archivesHigh-Stakes Testing in the Warm Heart of Africa:The Challenges and Successes of the Malawi National Examinations Board2004 • Stephen SireciDownload Free PDFView PDFSpecial Education Conference Proceedings 2011 @ NamibiaProf. Emeka Desmond Ozoji, Maria Cardona Molto, Cindy  Anderson, Eileen Raymond, Akinpelu Funmi, Richard Villa, Sonia VillabellaDownload Free PDFView PDFEducating Every Learner, Every Day: A Global  …USING GAMES/SIMULATIONS TO EXAMINE DISCRIMINATORY ATTITUDES (AS PART OF A DISABILITY AWARENESS RAISING PROGRAM)Sheena DeafDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Student Affairs in AfricaLearning Communities for Teaching Practice School Placements: A Higher Education Initiative to Promote Equity for Students with Disabilities2019 • Sachin SuknunanIn South Africa, scholarship on the teaching practice learning experiences for students with disabilities is a relatively new area of sociological inquiry. Social justice arrangements in the South African Higher Education policy frameworks identify the equity imperative as being of critical importance for social redress and transformation for all students. This qualitative study drew on the teaching practice school placement experiences of five Bachelor of Education students with either visual or physical disabilities and who were part of a teaching practice learning community. The findings of this study suggest that, for students with visual and physical disabilities, learning communities were perceived to be a structure that enhanced equity arrangements for human development and well‑being in teaching practice school placements. In addition, and in alignment with equity arrangements, the need for a social justice reform agenda for teaching practice school placements emerged from the data. The study concludes that learning communities as a context-specific institutional structure support freedom, agency, dialogue and participation, and respect for disability required for capability expansion for human development and well‑being in the teaching practice school placements of students with visual and physical disabilities. These were found to enhance equity arrangements for students with visual disabilities and physical disabilities.Download Free PDFView PDFAccess or Tokenism? A Review of the Effectiveness of Assessment AccommodationsShailen PopatBy reviewing literature in the USA and UK, this article questions whether the test scores of Special Educational Needs and Disabled (SEND) students are valid and reliable. It is argued that accommodations tend to either make no difference or create a bias, making them unreliable and incomparable. Furthermore, teachers are often not trained in how to select appropriate accommodations, and schools often only provide accommodations that their resources allow. Introduction The central question being examined in this article is " whether assessment is serving the best interests of the individual child, the school, and wider society " (Pettifor and Saklofske 2012:90). Access arrangements (or accommodations as they are referred to in the USA) are often described as an equitable way of giving students with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of the content being tested. However, this article questions whether the system really accesses the understanding of such pupils, and if it is indeed fair to require SEND pupils to sit the same summative tests as non-SEND pupils. Fairness and equity invoke discussions of power and so this review argues that any system must empower 'access' if it is not to be regarded as inadequate. It is argued that there is no conclusive evidence that access arrangements in general, or particular accommodations, result in higher attainment; nor is there consistent evidence that access arrangements benefit all students all of the time. The data presented suggests that benefits vary according to the type of accommodation, the suitability of the accommodation for the pupil, and the type of test to which it was employed. If it is accepted that tests have had to compromise on validity in order to be more reliable, and as much of the literature suggests, the reliability of accommodated tests is uncertain, then the argument for using them weakens. This is underscored by evidence that suggests that the best accommodation is not always selected due to resource and knowledge constraints. This leads one to query as to whether legal obligations under the Equality Act (2010) to make reasonable adjustments are being fulfilled.Download Free PDFView PDFChildren and Youth Services ReviewBridging policy–practice gap: Protecting rights of youth with learning disabilities in Hong Kong2012 • Kim McBrayerABSTRACTDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
