In most families, the mother tends to have the first role in caring for her child and therefore mothers endure greater psychological pressure than other family members. These mothers&#39; experiences and problems are different due to cultural and economic differences and the health services they receive. This study aimed to explore the experiences of mothers of an asthmatic child. In this qualitative study data was collected through unstructured, in-depth interviews with 10 mothers who had an asthmatic child. The Graneheim and Lundman&#39;s qualitative content analysis method was used for analyzing the data. The analysis of data showed five main themes including constant concern, feeling of having an unusual life, the need for help from others, feeling of guilt, and the desire to constantly monitor the child. The mothers of asthmatic children expressed fee...Download Free PDFView PDFPolish Psychological BulletinSharing Experiences of Illness and Effectiveness of Asthma Therapy in Children2009 • Jerzy TrzebińskiSharing Experiences of Illness and Effectiveness of Asthma Therapy in Children This research deals with relationships between openness and opportunities to share asthma experiences between an ill child and close family, and effectiveness of medical therapy of asthma. Subjects were 58 children, between the age of 12-14, from the allergic outpatient clinic with a diagnosed bronchial asthma and under pharmacological therapy. Each child answered questions on frequency and satisfaction with talking with parents, or other close family members, on his or her experiences related to asthma. A doctor conducting the therapy was asked to evaluate results of therapy, and intensity of the asthma, for each child. The data support the hypotheses that degree of sharing own asthma-related experiences with close persons correlates positively with effectiveness of therapy. This effect appears stronger among children with more severe asthma.Download Free PDFView PDFKnowledge of Asthma among Caregivers of Asthmatic Children: Outcomes of Preliminary Education2000 • Nuanchan PrapphalDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
