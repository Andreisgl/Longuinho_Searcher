A number of tools for sustainable fashion design have been developed to aid designers in the integration of sustainability into their design practices. We analyze these to determine their fitness for purpose. Among them, three categories (archetypes) of tools are identified: Universal, Participatory, and Assessment. We propose an innovation framework and a five-dimensional model of sustainability specific to fashion to facilitate the analysis of the tools. Using the archetype categorization may facilitate designers in identifying the most appropriate type of tool for a specific circumstance, depending on context and need.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It has been the basis for the man-dated framework introduced in 2009 by the Ministry of Education for environ-mental education (EE) in all Ontario schools. Based on our research and personal reflections, this paper provides a summary of the recent developments concerning EE curricula in Ontario’s schools. It also identifies the key institutional elements which contribute to and influence the course of EE implementation and focuses on their role in the development of environmental curricula in the province. Resume Le rapport Bondar de 2007, Preparons nos eleves – Preparons notre avenir, proposait une vision pour integrer l’education environnementale au curriculum ontarien, vision qui a servi de base a la Politique d’education environnementale pour les ecoles de l’Ontario adoptee par le ministere de l’Education en 2009.

The number of aid agencies, INGOs, and NGOs has increased significantly, especially in the developing world. However, this growth does not necessarily mean foreign aid and NGOs are effective at the tasks they undertake, including improving rural livelihoods and protecting local environments. Furthermore, the lack of evaluative studies on the effectiveness of foreign aid and NGOs involvement challenges claims of success often found in their reports (Anderson, 2007). Neither NGO reports nor prevailing independent research provides a comprehensive and realistic assessment of the impacts of NGOs on the communities in which they work (Rugendyke, 2007). Even though foreign aid and NGOs were established with good intentions, the results associated with NGO-led development in developing countries are mixed.

Protected Areas in Nepal: The Case for Higher Entry FeesThe Economic journal of Nepal,  2012The recent announcement by the Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation of an increase the entry ... more The recent announcement by the Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation of an increase the entry fees for most protected areas in Nepal has drawn a degree of criticism. This paper provides an evaluation of the decision based on past experience from other jurisdictions on the setting and administration of the pricing of access to protected areas, and a review of past studies which have provided an understanding of the willingness to pay of foreign tourists in Nepal for access to the nation’s protected areas. The higher entry fees are in line with the increasingly adopted “user pays” philosophy in the context of protected area financing. In comparable areas elsewhere entry fees tend to be significantly higher than those for Nepalese protected areas, even after the announced increases in fees. Furthermore, the entry fees generally have been far below what foreign visitors would be willing to pay. The evidence suggests that demand for access to protected areas in Nepal is price inelasti...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper draws on the insights related to the development and implementation of the undergraduate program in Environmental and Urban Sustainability (EUS) at Ryerson University (Toronto). The conceptual framework of the program reflects the need for a broad foundation of sustainability education which spans disciplinary boundaries. EUS has blended new and existing teaching configurations, and has embraced both cross-disciplinary and disciplinary content and academic structures in its curriculum development and course offerings. The key to success has been the merging of existing course offerings from fourteen disciplinary areas as part of the core of the EUS pr...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It analyzes curriculum expectations and enrollment data for the purpose of reporting upon and providing recommendations for place-based environmental education. The extent and prescriptiveness of the coverage of place-based environmental education by subject, course, grade, and course progression or pathway are presented. Environmental education in Ontario does not have its own discrete compulsory courses and despite having been “embedded” in the curriculum, the important arenas of place-based environmental education are being applied inconsistently across the compulsory curriculum. Poor enrollment in electives shows that the focus of students remains elsewhere, fracturing progression of environmental education in Ontario’s secondary schools. -- Resume Ce travail examine le programme d’etudes secondaires de l’Ontario a la lum...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this study, consolidated narrative interrogation (CONI) is used to quantify CEDs presented in annual and stand-alone sustainability reports published over a 15-year span between 2002 and 2016 by agrochemical companies operating in India. Results show that the diversity, the quantity, and the quality of CED vary significantly, but generally each of them has been improving over time—most notably following the revisions to the Companies Act in 2013. The study finds that the subsidiaries of multinational agrochemical corporations implemented CED practices more strongly associated with those of domestic companies than those found in the reports produced by their parent companies. The CED of both subsidiary and domestic companies appears to reflect concerns of...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Micro-sized enterprises represent a significant portion of the fashion industry and can meaningfully contribute to the transition to a more sustainable apparel and textile industry. This paper addresses this gap through the development of an original design tool, the reDesign canvas, to support design entrepreneurs in developing sustainable fashion enterprises. Informed by design thinking and systems thinking, the canvas was developed based on an in-depth review of the academic literature and the collection of qualitative data. Qualitative data were gathered through both participatory action research (PAR) and interviews with 38 sustainable fashion design entrepreneurs and experts in sustainable fashion. ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
