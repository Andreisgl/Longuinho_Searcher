What if the logic of substitution in the play goes beyond exchange and seeks out a triadic logic instead? This insistent searching for the triad appears most notably in the performance of Measure for Measure by Cheek by Jowl (2013–2019). Cheek By Jowl’s strategies of touring, simplicity, movement, and liberation create a dynamic and ever-evolving performance. This article puts Cheek by Jowl’s performance of Measure for Measure in conversation with C.S. Peirce’s (and subsequent theorists) explorations of triadic logic with Puttenham’s rhetoric of traductio (repetition with variation, and &quot;tranlacing&quot;), in addition to critical work on substitutions in the play. Tracing the superfluity of substitutions in rhetoric and performance of the play allows us to see how the play refuses binaries,...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Twitter in particular, is popular for sharing opinions and discussing current events. In this work, we collect and analyze the reaction to three shootings at different houses of worship. Three events were chosen: the massacre at the Emanuel Church in Charleston, NC, the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburg, PA, and the massacres at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The events were all committed by shooters with a similar supremacist mentality. We used the python programming language to collect the data from twitter using popular hashtags for the events. We then cleaned it up by removing punctuation, web links, stop words, hashtags, and foreign letters. We then did a word frequency count on the remaining words, and generated word clouds for each event. We also did a search for well-known hate words in the ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
