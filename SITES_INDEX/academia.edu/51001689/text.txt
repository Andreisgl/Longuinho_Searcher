However, some areas remain comparatively untouched. The region of the Caribbean, for example, seems to be mostly shrouded in legend and myth, according to popular culture. Yet a select few loyal and passionate historians have managed to dedicate their professional lives and careers to exploring, archiving, and digging up the past in the Caribbean Islands of the Greater, Lesser and Leeward Antilles. Some information on region came easily enough through research of the Imperial records of the major nations involved in the exploration and colonization process which still remain in power today, such as Great Britain and the rest of the modern United Kingdom. In analyzing the work of these historians, who provide valuable secondary source research on a geographic region relatively untouched, the groundwork is formulated for the next generation of historians.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Cambridge History of African and Caribbean StudiesIrele F.

Using the stories of ordinary people, Block illustrates how engaging with the powerful rhetoric and rituals of Christianity was central to survival. ...Isabel Criolla was a runaway slave in Cartagena who successfully lobbied the Spanish governor not to return her to an abusive mistress. Nicolas Burundel was a French Calvinist who served as henchman to the Spanish governor of Jamaica before his arrest by the Inquisition for heresy. Henry Whistler was an English sailor sent to the Caribbean under Oliver Cromwell's plan for holy war against Catholic Spain. Yaff and Nell were slaves who served a Quaker plantation owner, Lewis Morris, in Barbados. Seen from their on-the-ground perspective, the development of modern capitalism, race, and Christianity emerges as a story of negotiation, contingency, humanity, and the quest for community. *Ordinary Lives* works in both a comparative and an integrative Atlantic World frame, drawing on archival sources from Spain, England, Barbados, Colombia, and the United States. It pushes the boundaries of how historians read silences in the archive, asking difficult questions about how self-censorship, anxiety, and shame have shaped the historical record. The book also encourages readers to expand their concept of religious history beyond a focus on theology, ideals and pious exemplars to examine the communal efforts of pirates, smugglers, slaves, and adventurers who together shaped the colonial Caribbean's emerging moral economy."Download Free PDFView PDFHistoriography of the CaribbeanMichael ZeuskeA Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures in English, ed.
