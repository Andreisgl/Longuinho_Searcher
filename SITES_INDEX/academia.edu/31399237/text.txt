Civilizational and cultural concepts qualifying a combination of military and racial classification and superiority, ushered in slavery as a means to build and extend geographical and political national territorial limits, the fabrication of Empire and the destruction of millennia old civilizations and cultures. Cultural genocide has been excluded from Genocide as Crimes Against Humanity by the United Nations General Assembly. The rise and development of Greco-Roman Christianity under the aegis of the Roman Empire; the destruction of the Jewish Nation, anti-semitism, the Holocaust and near collapse of Judaism The exceptional granting of Diplomatic status and immunity to the Vatican, the Christian Roman Church, a religio-political Institution State with extraordinary powers, an appendice of the Roman Empire and later fascist Empires that invaded Asia and the Americas, is a continuous strategy of refusal to accept cultural genocide and the digestion and destruction of alien cultures, indigenous nations and cultures, the Native American cultures and nations being a prime example. Another striking example is the Tibetan nation and culture under the military occupation of China for a period of approximately 60 years with the consent, tacitly or otherwise of the United Nations. The study is divided into two parts; part I deals with sectarian Abrahamic faiths, Christianity, Islam and Political Islam, a multifaceted, militarized, socio politico economic system. Part II, to be included at a later date, deals with the Islamic Invasion of India-(and specifically) the ravages of Hyder Ali and Tippoo sultan in south India and the Moplah Rebellion.Download Free PDFView PDFFrom Heathen to Sub-Human: A Genealogy of the Influence of the Decline of Religion on the Rise of Modern RacismOludamini OgunnaikeThis essay traces a genealogy of the modern concept of race, and modern racism, in relationship to the intellectual shifts that led to the secularization of knowledge during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Through an analysis of the evolution of the central concept of " The Great Chain of Being " from the Classical through Medieval and Early Modern periods, I argue that the decline of religion in the West was a necessary condition for the rise of modern conceptions of race and racism.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean GeorgiaZaza AnchabadzeThis book is intended for any person interested in history of the beginning of Europe in Caucasus and place of Georgia in modern Europe, for students, tourists and others.Download Free PDFView PDFDating Zarathustra: Oriental Texts and the Problem of Persian Prehistory, 1700–1900Suzanne MarchandEstablishing the identity, and the chronology, of the Persian religious reformer Zarathustra has been of great interest to western scholars since antiquity—but became an urgent question in the early modern era. Scholars trained chiefly in biblical exegesis particularly wished to know if Zarathustra had preached a monotheistic or a dualistic faith. The complexity of the source material, however, made it difficult to decide this question, and impossible to securely place Zarathustra in time. Even after the deciphering of Old Avestan, the question of Zarathustra's dates has remained enormously fraught, and dependent on inferences from classical or biblical texts. The ongoing quest to date Zarathustra shows us that 'orientalism' as a scholarly enterprise exhibits many continuities across the centuries and that chronology continues even today to be a crucial and controversial subject. Keywords Zarathustra – history of philology – history of chronology – ancient Persia – orientalism – Aryans – AvestaDownload Free PDFView PDFA Revisionist View of Early Religion, Judaism & Christianity: the scholars speak A Revisionist View of Early Religion, Judaism & Christianity: the scholars speak2014 • Brent A WaterburyA nearly completed college textbook at a Graduate/PhD level the main thrust of this book is how pagan early religions, Judaism and later Christianity collided in the 4th century to form what we know as the Bible. Unlike most books on the history of religions "Revisionist..." doesn't have just one argument, rather 100's. My reasons is religion is thousands of years old and there is no one argument for the myriad of personalities that wrote out these scriptures! Also, this book is done in a 'question/answer' layout and is more aimed at the layperson rather than the scholar--although it still cites/annotates as much as possible. Within Hebrew scriptures the book uses a 'minimalist' approach to Jewish history rather than scriptural. With the NT, the book uses a Post-Modern viewpoint which I'm sure will cause more howls from evangelicals. The book uses quotes from 100's of historians, scholars and educators throughout the world--most of which head how and why scripture came into our world 3,000 years ago.

By the close of the first millennium AD, virtually every European ethny traced its spiritual, if not its biological ancestry to the once-powerless and persecuted race of Christians. In effect, Christian theology created a new ethnos. People drawn from different biological races and from many diverse ethnic groups took on an altogether novel ethno-religious identity. Christians learned to use various forms of "ethnic reasoning" to distinguish themselves from other groups. But there were limits to the plasticity of Christian racial/ethnic identity. When the Germanic peoples were brought into the fold of Christendom, Christian identity became less fluid and more fixed. By the end of the first millennium, the three element of spirit, water, and blood were the constituent elements of every Christian nation. Those three elements of Christian racial/ethnic identity reflect the unity in diversity of the three persons of the triune God.Download Free PDFView PDFHistory of Islam in German Thought (complete text)History of Islam in German Thought: From Leibniz to Nietzsche (complete text)2010 • Ian AlmondDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
