Example of change requests at gerrit.wikimedia.org
Gerrit is the website where Wikimedia hosts all its Git repositories, and reviews changes proposed to those repositories.
Before change requests are merged in Gerrit, each change is reviewed to ensure they meet standards of security, quality, and coding style.
Anyone is welcome to create an account and leave review comments on changes.
The special rights to merge or reject changes is reserved to maintainers.
Prerequisites
If you are a new to software development and are unsure where to contribute, read New Developers. If you've decide you want to contribute to MediaWiki core or an extension, read How to become a MediaWiki hacker  to learn where to find tasks for you and how to set up a local development environment.
If you are an experienced developer familiar with MediaWiki but new to its software development, visit Developer hub .
Submit your first patch
Follow the Gerrit/Tutorial  for setting up Git, creating a developer account, and opening change requests in Gerrit.
