The first assumes that Slavs came to the territory of contemporary Poland no earlier than the sixth century CE; the second postulates that they already inhabited this region in the Iron Age (IA). Testing either hypothesis is not trivial given that cremation of the dead was the prevailing custom in Central Europe from the late Bronze Age until the Middle Ages (MA). Results To address this problem, we determined the genetic makeup of representatives of the IA Wielbark- and MA Slav-associated cultures from the territory of present-day Poland. The study involved 474 individuals buried in 27 cemeteries. For 197 of them, genome-wide data were obtained. We found close genetic affinities between the IA Wielbark culture-associated individuals and contemporary to them and older northern European populations. Further, we observed that the IA individual...Save to LibraryDownloadby Małgorzata Marcinkowska-Swojak•  2  Biological Sciences, Environmental SciencesThoughts on Hurrian PhonologyMy comments and disagreements on Bomhard's thoughts on Hurrian phonology.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arnaud  Fournet•  2  Hurrian, UrartologyThoughts on Hurrian PhonologyMy comments and disagreements on Bomhard's thoughts on Hurrian phonology.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arnaud  Fournet•  3  Hurrian, Urartology, Hurrian LanguageBAHASA LORANG, BAHASA BARAKAI, DAN BAHASA DOBEL DI KEPULAUAN ARU DALAM KAJIAN LEKSIKOSTATISTIK (Lorang Languages, Barakai Languages, and Dobel Languages in Aru Islands in Lexicostatistic Study)Save to LibraryDownloadby Jusmianti Garing•  2  Linguistics, KinshipPenentuan Waktu Pisah Dan Alurkekerabatan Bahasa Aceh, Kerinci,Manado, Dan Melayu RiauAnggita, Dewi. 2017. “Determination of Time and the Kinship Plot of Aceh, Kerinci, Manado, and Melayu Riau languages”.

The dialect groups identified using lexicostatistics are compared with the classification by phonetic isoglosses. The previous research on this data was focused on highlighting the phonetic isoglosses between the discovered dialects, and in this article the classification based on phonetics is compared with the results gained from lexicostatistics. Objective: to identify the dialect groups of the Mansi XVIII till XXI centuries based on the lists of basic vocabulary.Research materials: the new expedition and archive dictionaries of the Mansi dialects published on the linguistic platform http://lingvodoc.ispras.ru/ and field materials gathered by the author.Results and novelty of the research: for the first time the lists of basic vocabulary for seven archival and three contemporary Mansi dictionaries introduced into scientific circulation in the last few years. A survey of a native speaker of the contemporary Northern dialect was also conducted. Judging by the comparison with the XIX century data, the most distinctive dialect group is the North Mansi, as it has retained many features since the XVIII century. Other dialect groups have been not so stable in time. In the late XVIII century there were dialects of Perm province, not homogenous enough as a group. And out of them the Kungur and Solikamsk dialects were closer to the Tavda (Southern) dialect that is known from the XIX–XX centuries records. The Eastern dialects disappeared in the beginning of the XXI century. Judging by the data obtained from the last native speakers, the Yukonda (Eastern) dialect shared 93% of basic vocabulary with the Northern dialects. Key words: Mansi language, dialectology, lexicostatistics approach, basic vocabulary, lexical isoglosses, Perm Mansi language.Acknowledgements: the paper was prepared with the aid of Russian Scientific Fund, grant № 20-18-00403 «Digital description of the dialects the Uralic languages based on the analysis of big data».For citation: Fedotova I.V.

Dialectal classification of Khanty is still a debatable issue with no reached consensus among researchers. The borders between dialectal groups within the Khanty language are mostly drawn by the phonetic and morphological criteria. Scholars traditionally separate Khanty dialect continuum into two dialectal groups: Northern (Western) and Eastern Khanty.However, recently many Khanty sources have become available to researchers, ranging from the unpublished 18th century archives to the printed dictionaries and digital field corpora. Having applied the method of lexicostatistics to this new material, the article shows that the Eastern group is not homogenous. As a result, the study identifies three contemporary Khanty languages: Northern Khanty, Vakh Khanty, and Surgut Khanty. Also, the article observes the correlation between these three groups and traditional ones that are distinguished by phonological and grammatical criteria (Eastern, Northern and dead Southern Khanty). Also, 13 new basic vocabulary lists based on the sources from the 18th to 21st centuries are published, which makes it possible to trace evolution of the dialects. Etymological notes and references, as well as proto-form reconstructions, are provided along the lists, which makes the supplementary material a mini-version of an etymological dictionary of Khanty dialects.Save to LibraryDownloadby Idaliya Fedotova•  10  Etymology, Language Documentation, Uralic Linguistics, LexicostatisticsGenetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal DataSave to LibraryDownloadby Vaidutis Kučinskas•  20  Medical Genetics, Phylogeography, Population Genetics, BiologyLexical evidence for the Macro-Jê-Tupian hypothesis [DRAFT, submitted]The Macro-Jê and Tupian language families of Eastern South America have long been thought to be distantly related, mainly based on morphological evidence.

This article assembles lexical evidence for the Macro-Jê-Tupian hypothesis. Reconstructed Proto-Macro-Jê and Tupian forms are compared, with special attention to the distribution of the etyma in each family, morphosyntactic behavior of the comparanda, and semantic and phonological plausibility of the proposed etymologies. Although the total number of possible cognates is very limited, the fact that they show recurrent sound correspondences renders the Macro-Jê-Tupian hypothesis promising and worthy of further research.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrey Nikulin•  7  Historical Linguistics, Comparative Linguistics, South American indigenous languages, Tupian LinguisticsPreuves de « nouvelles langues » dans la Tshopo(PDF de diapositifs pour une présentation à Bunia, RDC lors d'une conférence pour marquer la Journée Internationale de la Langue Maternelle, 21 février 2023) Les parlers likile et mokpa de la Province de la Tshopo (République Démocratique... more(PDF de diapositifs pour une présentation à Bunia, RDC lors d'une conférence pour marquer la Journée Internationale de la Langue Maternelle, 21 février 2023) Les parlers likile et mokpa de la Province de la Tshopo (République Démocratique du Congo) méritent probablement être reconnues comme langues, en ce qui concerne le standard ISO 639-3. Des locuteurs ont participé à un atelier de collecte et analyse de mots afin de proposer une orthographe pour chaque langue. Selon l'analyse préliminaire de l'auteur d'un corpus d'environ 200 mots en douze langues, le likile ressemble plus aux langues du Groupe C.50 et le mokpa ressemble plus à certaines langues du Groupe D.10. Toutefois, le taux de ressemblance est au-dessous du seuil de ressemblance lexicale qui marque un dialecte. On voit alors une première preuve qu'il s'agit de deux « nouvelles langues ».------------Based on preliminary lexicostatistical comparison of lists of approximately 200 words in each of twelve languages of the Tshopo Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, including every language of Bantu Groups C.50 and D.10, it is argued that Likile and Mokpa are languages deserving of recognition under ISO standard 639-3.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas W.

Mapping the worldwide distribution of word length shows convergence at a continent-wide level, a Pacific Rim signature, and a tendency for large word length averages to be a recessive trait. The amount of data, which is unparalleled in previous, related studies, allows us to provide more solid estimates and accounts for the interrelationships between word length, phoneme segment inventory size, and population size than was previously possible. Word length differences between items exhibit robust, universal tendencies, which are discussed in relation to other quantities, including stability, synonymy, and attestation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Søren Wichmann•Genetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal DataSave to LibraryDownloadby Sergey Koshel•  20  Medical Genetics, Phylogeography, Population Genetics, BiologyExtracting Translation Lexicons from Bilingual Corpora: Application to South-Slavonic LanguagesSave to LibraryDownloadby Elena Paskaleva•  5  Machine Translation, Content Analysis, Lexicography, Word alignmentUniversals versus historical contingencies in lexical evolutionThe frequency with which we use different words changes all the time, and every so often, a new lexical item is invented or another one ceases to be used.

Beyond a small sample of lexical items whose properties are well studied, little is known about the dynamics of lexical evolution. How do the lexical inventories of languages, viewed as entire systems, evolve? Is the rate of evolution of the lexicon contingent upon historical factors or is it driven by regularities, perhaps to do with universals of cognition and social interaction? We address these questions using the Google Books N-Gram Corpus as a source of data and relative entropy as a measure of changes in the frequency distributions of words. It turns out that there are both universals and historical contingencies at work. Across several languages, we observe similar rates of change, but only at timescales of at least around five decades. At shorter timescales, the rate of change is highly variable and differs between langua...Save to LibraryDownloadby Valery Solovyev•  6  Computer Science, Medicine, Multidisciplinary, LexiconKorespondesi Bunyi Bahasa Aceh dan Bahasa GayoAcehnese and Gayonese belong to Austronesian languages which are cognate genetically.

Adjacent location became the basis for the assumption that both language are related one of the linguistic kinship indicators described in comparative historical linguistic studies in occurrence of sound changes that occur regularly. The two languages show similar specific features. One of them is a phenomenon of sound changes that is called a phonemic correspondence. The sound changes in the two languages happen continuously. In this paper, the writer wants to prove the cognate phenomenon by using a comparative analysis, especially by applying a phonemic correspondence technique. Based on similarities in form and correspondence phonemes technique, it was found that the formula of the phonemic correspondence in Acehnese and Gayonese are:  *a and *u&gt; in phonemic correspondence /a~e/, /a~o/, /o~u/, and /e~u/ especially on position penultima bilabial, palatal, dorsovelar, and faringal.IntisariBahas...Save to LibraryDownloadby riris tiani•  3  History, Linguistics, NusAUsing Cat Systems And/Or Corpora in the Translation ProfessionDriven by the increasing requirement for efficiency at the workplace, professional translators worldwide resort to what is called “automated assistance”, which allows for more or less control over the end product, while it attempts at... moreDriven by the increasing requirement for efficiency at the workplace, professional translators worldwide resort to what is called “automated assistance”, which allows for more or less control over the end product, while it attempts at improving, not always successfully, their work quality. The paper outlines the use of electronic translation tools by the Romanian professional translator. Thus, we analyze Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) Systems which prevail as assisting tools in the translators’ work, and we consider the role of electronic parallel corpora, a rather marginal one, as it is. The paper highlights the obvious potential of electronic corpora, their advantages over traditional CAT systems, and asserts the need for an integrative approach to translations which should only be beneficial to the translated work as result of the translation profession.

However, it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails horizontal components, most commonly through lexical borrowing. For example, the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed. Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process—akin to horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution—that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic trees. Here, we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346 cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed across 84 Indo-European languages. The dataset includes 124 (5%) known borrowings. Applying the uniformitarian principle to inventory dynamics in past and present basic vocabularies, we find that 1373 (61%) of the cognates have been affected by borrowing during their history.

Our system, PivotAlign, approaches the problem from two directions. First, we collect translation candidates by pivoting through intermediary dictionaries, made available by the task organizers. Second, we decide which candidates to keep by applying scores to the candidate list, obtained by running an ensemble of word alignment tools on parallel corpora and comparing frequency of alignments to frequency of word co-occurrence in the parallel texts. Our approach outperforms all other participating systems with respect to F1 measure and recall, as well as having a very competitive precision score, showing the usefulness of a scoring mechanism based on highly accurate word alignments for this kind of task.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hrafn Loftsson•  3  Machine Translation, Bilingual Lexicon, Word alignmentEvaluation of multilingual text alignment systems: the ARCADE II project1.

This diversity reflects the legacy of thousands of years of cultural evolution. How far back we can trace this history depends largely on the rate at which the different components of language evolve. Rates of lexical evolution are widely thought to impose an upper limit of 6000–10 000 years on reliably identifying language relationships. In contrast, it has been argued that certain structural elements of language are much more stable. Just as biologists use highly conserved genes to uncover the deepest branches in the tree of life, highly stable linguistic features hold the promise of identifying deep relationships between the world&#39;s languages.

Journal of South Asian Linguistics, Philology and Grammatical Traditions is an international journal that welcomes submissions that adopt evidence-based approaches to all areas of linguistics related to South Asian literary (classical and modern/contemporary), spoken and/or endangered languages. The aim of the Journal is to collect papers devoted to the general synchronic linguistic analysis (including sociolinguistic analysis pertaining to today’s languages) of particular languages and/or particular texts, even those that incorporate a comparative analysis with other languages or texts. From the point of view of linguistics, one of the other areas of interest is understanding the evolution of the various languages employed in South Asia today and in the previous historical phases. The term ‘evolution’ is here understood from the point of view of linguistic history – according to a pure diachronic linguistic perspective – as well as from the point of view of the history of these languages, concerning thus the dynamics existing between a specific language and the culture and socio-political context of the society where this language is spoken. For this reason, the Journal also includes in its scope the analysis of the history of reading and reception studies in South Asia. Articles focusing on textual details and criticism and on the history of manuscript traditions and circulation will also be considered. Last but not the least, particular emphasis is also placed on the study of grammatical traditions that have thrived in the South Asian regions. An important part of Bhasha will be devoted to reviews of new books or specific important papers related in some way to the aims of the Journal. The Journal predominantly publishes articles in English but will occasionally also publish in Italian, French and German.Save to LibraryDownloadby Edizioni Ca’ Foscari - Venice University Press and +3Erica BiagettiGeorge van DriemMatteo  De Chiara•  5  Language Acquisition, Vedic Sanskrit, Telugu, LexicostatisticsEvaluation of multilingual text alignment systems: the ARCADE II project1.

However, the way that such data are coded into characters for phylogenetic analysis has been approached in different ways, without investigating how coding methods may affect the results. In this paper, we compare three different coding methods for lexical data (multistate meaning-based characters, binary root-meaning characters, and binary cognate characters) in a Bayesian framework, using data from the Tupi-Guarani and Chapacuran language families as case studies.

Before and after the founding of the EHL Project in 2001 other colleagues have joined in, and I believe our cumulative efforts have been successful in demonstrating that the Basque language is not a completely isolated orphan, but has its closest relatives in the North Caucasus region (Bengtson 2021). What we have been up against is an almost unanimous inertia, and outright resistance, on the part of Vasconists, who cling to the opinion of one man (though a very influential and erudite man), Luis Michelena, who pronounced in the 1980s that the Euskaro-Caucasian hypothesis was “unfruitful.” But they ignored Michelena’s further hope, published after his death in 1987, that "it is possible that an improvement in current methods or the discovery of new techniques might put more powerful instruments in our hands" to verify the Euskaro-Caucasin hypothesis. Table 1 in this essay compares Basque basic vocabulary with putative cognate words in Chechen, Avar, Tindi, Dargwa, Lak, Proto-East Cacasian, Proto-West Caucasian (per Chirikba),  and PWC (per the North Caucasian Etymological Dictionary). There are copius notes to each comparison. The simple statistical analysis in Table 1 should be regarded as a heuristic ‘thought experiment’ that engenders an approximate solution to assessing the lexical closeness or distance between Basque and North Caucasian languages..Save to LibraryDownloadby John D Bengtson•  7  Etymology, Comparative Linguistics, Basque linguistics, Dene-Caucasian languagesAutomatic Bitext Alignment for Southeast Asian LanguagesBitext alignment is the task of aligning words, phrases or sentences in one language with the equivalent translation in another.

A methodology is presented, capable of ranking meanings by a score fully representative of the four features identified as necessary for a meaning to be considered optimal for use in the initial stages of language comparison: maximal item stability, maximal resistance to replacement of form by borrowing, maximal conceptual simplicity, and maximal universality. The stability of 67 meanings is quantified using a procedure described, but not adequately implemented, by Dolgopolsky (1986) and Lohr (1999); the results are integrated with Tadmor et al.’s (2010) borrowed, analyzability, and representation scores, to form a composite score by which the meanings are ranked.

We argue that most IE ‘fox’-words go back to two distinct PIE stems: *h₂lō̆p-eḱ- ‘fox’ and *ulp-i- ‘wildcat, fox’. We provide a revised analysis of the etymology and relationship among the various Indo-Iranian ‘fox’-words, and we argue that Baltic preserves remnants of the ḱ-suffix found in Greek, Armenian, and Indo-Iranian. Additionally, we describe how *h₂lō̆p-eḱ- was borrowed from Indo-Iranian into Uralic and we outline the relationship among the reflexes of this word in various Uralic languages. Finally, we reconstruct the paradigm of *h₂lō̆p-eḱ- as a unique type of hysterodynamic stem, which nonetheless has close parallels in PIE. We observe that a similar ḱ-suffix is found in PIE adjectives and animal names.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paulus S van Sluis•  6  Indo-European Studies, Indo-European Linguistics, Comparative Indo-European Linguistics, Comparative Uralic LinguisticsSemasiologis Dalam Bahasa TorajaThis study aims to describe semasiologi in Toraja.

We cross-linguistically investigate the semantic divergence of cognate pairs in English and Romance languages, by means of word embeddings. To this end, we introduce a new curated dataset of cognates in all pairs of those languages. We describe the types of errors that occurred during the automated cognate identification process and manually correct them. Additionally, we label the English cognates according to their etymology, separating them into two groups: old borrowings and recent borrowings. On this curated dataset, we analyse word properties such as frequency and polysemy, and the distribution of similarity scores between cognate sets in different languages. We automatically identify different clusters of English cognates, setting a new direction of research in cognates, borrowings and possibly false friends analysis in related languages.Save to LibraryDownloadby Liviu P.
