Authenticity at work – a job-demands resources perspectiveJournal of Managerial Psychology,  2016Purpose – Previous research has demonstrated strong relations between work characteristics (e.g. ... more Purpose – Previous research has demonstrated strong relations between work characteristics (e.g. job demands and job resources) and work outcomes such as work performance and work engagement. So far, little attention has been given to the role of authenticity (i.e. employees’ ability to experience their true selves) in these relations. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship of state authenticity at work with job demands and resources on the one hand and work engagement, job satisfaction, and subjective performance on the other hand. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 680 Dutch bank employees participated to the study. Structural equation modelling was used to test the goodness-of-fit of the hypothesized model. Bootstrapping (Preacher and Hayes, 2008) was used to examine the meditative effect of state authenticity. Findings – Results showed that job resources were positively associated with authenticity and, in turn, that authenticity was positively related to ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Both in research and practice, the interest in work engagement, a particular form of intrinsic motivation to work hard, is increasing. However, at first glance work engagement does not seem very different from workaholism. In this research the authors want to confirm insights from the literature on workaholism and engagement as well as formulate new questions for future research. More specifically, in this research the authors investigate how workaholism and work engagement relate to each other. Are they different or mutually exclusive categories? And – when different categories – on what basis can they be distinguished from each other? On the basis of 23 interviews with engaged and workaholic employees, it is concluded that despite of the similarity of working hard – workaholism and work engageme...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Methods of analyses include analysis of variance and multiple regression.FindingsIn line with the IAM, results showed that a higher disconcordance in preferred acculturation orientations between host community and immigrant workers related to a poorer quality of intergroup work‐relations. However, intergroup contact moderated this relationship differently for host community and immigrant workers.Research limitations/implicationsData are cross‐sectional and collected in one organization.
