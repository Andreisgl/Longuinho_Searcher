I will argue, however, that this assumption became problematized from the mid-nineteenth century on, a function of new media, especially photography, and new venues in which portraits were serialized, popularized, and circulated in mass quantities. The circulation of portraits, which began in a limited way in the Renaissance, raises questions about their function and meaning, “the tension between identity and identification, between the self and the ’other,’ between depiction and characterization” (Brilliant 171). I will examine several case studies of Thomas Carlyle, Richard Burton, and colonial subjects to analyze how the material markers of their identities—gesture, dress, and props—expressed Victorians’ changing representations of identity in the public sphere. While photographic images negotiated older portrait conventions of body posture, gestures, props, and dress borrowed from painting, they destabilized earlier notions of identity by pitting surface against depth and variety against essence, as portraiture became an attenuated genre, embracing painting, photography, press illustration, engravings, and caricature.

His collections were intimately tied to his many reformist projects and related museum activities (archaeological projects, scholarly publications, public education). Cultural politics also shaped the museum's textual representations in catalogues and articles by its European directors. Sayaji Rao was a`hybrid', Anglicized in education and tastes, and a leader of modern Indian nationalism. Installing a large European collection in 1920 at a time of heated debate over British influences on Indian art, Sayaji Rao, through his strange arrangement of his collection, may have offered a view of colonial cultural exchange as requiring both assimilation and resistance. His European and Asian collections reflected his attempts to appropriate, control and segregate British culture, as they made tangible colonial political and social processes that shaped cultural identiities for Baroda and for modern India. The leading princes, whose social precedence was ®xed by the Raj with the number of`gun salutes', embarked on lavish expenditures on European art. Baroda had the ®nest collection. In the 1890s, the highly cultivated prince, Sayaji Rao III Gaekwad (reigned 1875±1939), engaged the Venetian artist A. Felici to adorn the massive Laxmi Vilas Palace with oils, bronzes and marbles. He continued to add to his collection during his European travels. .. to form an impressive collection of western art.

Writing had become a way to present themselves on the open market and to generate a public image as individuals and collectively within the new professionalism emerging in the century. Letter writing was purposed to solidify and improve artists’ social capital, and their comments were always embedded in social relationships and practices. Thus, artists’ letters reveal much about the artworld structure; its players; and its overlapping spheres of social, economic, and professional identities. Their letters combined frankness with rhetorical pleading and contained their own press releases, studio invitations, and responses to criticism and were often intended for public consumption if used in critics’ reviews. Through letters, artists and critics revealed their reciprocal authority and agency and did not simply reflect the artworld but shaped that world. ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this paper I will argue that this symbolizes the central role of aesthetics in the novel in a discourse that engages the social criticism of John Ruskin and William Morris. Some scholars have assessed Marcella (1894) as having a retrograde ending of Marcella marrying a Tory politician and landowner. Judith Wilt&#39;s critical study of Ward is entitled Behind Her Times, an indication of the general view of Ward as a political conservative, although Wilt argues that she was also progressive in many ways, and Ward has enjoyed other nuanced, sensitive re-readings and assessments (Argyle; Sutton-Ramspeck). I, too, am arguing that Ward&#39;s political and social views in this novel are complex and mixed and that examining the novel&#39;s Victorian cultural discourses can illuminate complex socio-political content that draws on late-century art world ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
