How can Joshua’s behavior be explained? This question is all-consuming for his adoptive family. Joshua was relinquished at birth, then adopted only days later. Is it his genetic inheritance of substance abuse and generational poverty that causes him to act out, run away and eventually become involved with drugs? Is it the losses he’s experienced in his adoptive family? Or is it the very fact of adoption itself—the trauma of being amputated from his gestational mother to be raised by a family unrelated to him by blood, culture, or biology?
What makes our children who they are? These voices and questions will resonate with all parents, but particularly with those who are or have been part of the adoption triangle: adoptees, mothers who have relinquished a child, and parents who’ve added a child to their family through adoption.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextFamily LifeContemporary Women'sLiterary FictionPsychologicalLanguageEnglishPublisherShe Writes PressRelease dateJun 20, 2023ISBN9781647424473Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to The Earthquake ChildRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextThe Lost Boys: inside Muzafer Sherif’s Robbers Cave experimentEbookThe Lost Boys: inside Muzafer Sherif’s Robbers Cave experimentbyGina PerryRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Lost Boys: inside Muzafer Sherif’s Robbers Cave experiment for laterForbiddenEbookForbiddenbyWayne MansfieldRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Forbidden for laterGuardian of the ValeEbookGuardian of the ValebyTamara ShoemakerRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Guardian of the Vale for laterNow and Forever 1, a Love Story: Now and Forever, #1EbookNow and Forever 1, a Love Story: Now and Forever, #1byJean C.

Using headlamps, they traveled west, hoping to reach Wilcox, the town closest to the school. At daybreak on the fifth morning, they discovered a small cave and collapsed into exhausted sleep. The weather was mild that summer in the Oregon high desert, and they slept deeply until nearly noon, when the whirring noise of a helicopter overhead woke them. Nick slowly sat up, rubbing his shoulders. The nights of walking, sometimes stumbling, through the rough terrain had made his muscles ache. Sleeping nearby were his traveling companions, Noa and Jacob. A sorry duo, Nick thought. They weren’t kids he might have deliberately chosen for this getaway and long hike, but they were the only two who remained from the original group. Noa, in Nick’s opinion, was the school’s most disagreeable girl, and her boyfriend, Jacob, a skinny, pathetic kid, had no mind of his own. The stench in the filthy cave was made worse by the smell of their unwashed bodies. Energy bar wrappers and who knew what else littered the cave’s floor. Nick stared longingly toward the entrance, at the fresh air and clear blue sky beyond. He didn’t move, though. The sound of the chopper froze him in place. Jacob woke and rubbed his eyes. In his puny voice he asked, A helicopter? They’re fucking pigs, Noa said. She walked to the cave’s opening and looked out. Her hair, with its wild red curls, would be visible to anyone watching them. Military. Probably practicing to kill babies in Iraq. Without turning back to the boys, she stomped forward and raised both middle fingers to the helicopter above. Nick quickly ran to the opening. He grabbed Noa by her sweatshirt and forcefully yanked her back into the cave. Don’t be an asshole, Noa. They’re searching for us. I keep telling you, we’ve got to stay out of sight during the day. Only sixteen, Nick was already an accomplished survivalist. Under his guidance, the three had hiked almost forty miles off-road from the school. Although their food and water supply was nearly exhausted, Nick remained confident his skills would get them to Wilcox. He just needed to impress on the other two, especially Noa with that wild red hair, that they must stay hidden during the day. They must not, under any circumstance, get picked up and dragged back to Mount Richmond, their piss-assed school. He’d run away from home in California several times and always landed on his feet, but now the stakes were higher. Noa slapped at Nick’s hand. Hey, you’re the asshole. Don’t touch me. She fixed the boy, a good foot taller than she, with a deadly stare, then reached into her pocket for another energy bar—her last. They were running from Mount Richmond Academy, a therapeutic boarding school with 120 teenaged students, most there against their will. Nick had arrived at the program less than a month before. Fake it until you make it, older students told him. They meant for him to follow the rules until he turned eighteen. After that, he could sign himself out and do as he liked. But the prospect of staying at the school for almost another two interminable years was not one he entertained. Nick knew he didn’t belong at the school. He’d been taken there, snatched off the street by goons hired by his mother, and he was not going to stay and fake anything. At night in the dorms, the kids talked. They told stories of how, before being delivered to the school by their parents (or in some cases, like Nick, by bonded and licensed escort services), most had wreaked havoc on their families. Drinking, drugs, and not coming home at night were typical reasons kids were at Mount Richmond. With the boys, the anger was directed outward. In most of their homes, as in Nick’s own, there were holes punched through Sheetrock. With the girls, more typically, there was cutting or an eating disorder, something inflicting pain upon themselves. The kids at Mount Richmond, sometimes ashamed, sometimes defiant, recounted stories to each other: the violence, trouble with the law, self-harm. From the time he was brought to the school, Nick was cautioned that no one made it more than twenty-four hours after running away before being picked up. Water was scarce in that isolated region. There were irrigation ditches, but the water in them was likely contaminated from grazing cows. Someone could get a bad case of E. coli, maybe even die, from that polluted water. Running from the school meant risking dehydration, sickness, or worse. The steep, uneven terrain also meant the chance of injury. A broken ankle might be fatal in these mountains, a person not discovered until it was too late. Mount Richmond’s isolation was intentional, the staff told him. It was for his own good he’d been removed from the temptations that got him into trouble. His own good. Nick narrowed his eyes when he heard those words. There was no way the school would contain him. His plan to escape was fueled by fury. Led by Nick, the trio had slowly made their way by night toward Wilcox, where civilization waited. All three still wore the dark polo shirts, navy sweatshirts, and khaki pants, now filthy, that was the uniform of Mount Richmond. The evening before, they’d covered nearly ten miles. Their feet were blistered and bloody, their food supplies almost depleted, and the jugs of water stashed into their backpacks were nearly empty, but none had gotten sick or hurt. Nick’s confidence was unshaken. Noa and Jacob did not share this confidence and were beginning to doubt Nick. They’d slept only a few hours at a time and were exhausted. They were sick of energy bars and trail mix and, more troublingly, there was little left to drink. When the sound of the whirring blades finally grew faint, Nick strode from the cave. He shaded his eyes, carefully scanning the valley below. Suddenly he shouted triumphantly. There it is! he said and pointed east. The eyes of the other two followed his raised arm and saw it as well: the outskirts of town. There were a few houses scattered on large parcels of land. Beyond these were regularly laid-out streets. Nick had been right. Yes, the terrain had been steep and rocky, and they were tired as well as hungry and thirsty, but they’d done it. They’d reached Wilcox. Nick had led them to freedom. Nick would never forget being kidnapped by the two thugs his mother hired to bring him, against his will, to Oregon. He kept hearing the sound of the car doors’ locks clicking shut, picturing how he’d been driven away in the ugly beige Nissan, as his friends watched. It was the most outrageous act inflicted upon him in his young life, and as soon as he’d been admitted to Mount Richmond, he knew he’d find a way out. Although confident of his survival skills, there was one problem. Nick hated being alone. He liked an audience—people to appreciate him. He also realized having good-looking girls along would be an asset, so he talked up his project to some of the braver female students. He was surprised at how difficult it had been to get any of them, either the boys or girls, to agree to the runaway. They were pussies, with no fight left in them. They hated Mount Richmond, yet running away seemed beyond their energy or imagination. Maybe Noa with her crazy conspiracy theories was correct— the school had brainwashed them. Starting out, there had originally been six. But after that first chilly night in the woods, two boys and the other girl gave up. They left their supplies with the remaining three and promised to divulge nothing. Nick wasn’t pleased to be left with only Noa and Jacob, but he was determined to keep moving. He might have been okay with only Jacob. He and the other boy had arrived at Mount Richmond the same week. Both liked the same kind of music: death metal. Both passionately hated the school. But Jacob and his hot girlfriend, Noa, were inseparable. And Noa increasingly was a problem. The previous week, Nick had seen the two lovebirds get busted for having physical contact. Touching a member of the opposite sex was one of many infractions at Mount Richmond. At admission, they’d been given a set of rules stating they were to abstain from physical contact with other students until they’d earned certain privileges. Holding hands, hugging and, God-forbid, kissing were big deals. These had to be earned through good behavior. Bullshit, the kids said to one another. There had been no privileges earned by Noa or Jacob. Neither was particularly good at following rules. Jacob was on the lazy side, easily distracted, never finishing his chores. Noa said fuck you to every staff member who spoke to her. She hated them all without exception. Both were put on restrictions after they’d been caught making out behind Jacob’s dorm. The no-touching rule, among others, was unacceptable to Noa. In group therapy, she reported she’d been avidly sexually active since middle school. Who was this place to tell her what to do with her own body? Jacob had never before had a girlfriend. To his dorm mates, he shyly admitted his surprise that Noa, with her beautiful red hair and sexy body, had chosen him. Nick couldn’t figure it out either. He was much better looking than puny Jacob and had made some moves on Noa, which she quickly rejected. He supposed Noa liked that she could call the shots with Jacob and tell him what to do and not do. She could mold him to her will. Jacob may not have understood it, but with Noa, willing and gorgeous, crawling all over him, the little fucker just accepted his good luck. As soon as Noa heard the escape plan through the underground student communication system, she passed Nick a note. Noa, and her boy toy, Jacob, would be at the designated meeting spot on the gravel road behind the boys’ dormitory at midnight on the next moonless night. I’m getting laid and I’m getting a beer, she said to Nick when they met up at the spot. Jacob nodded enthusiastically. Tall, blond Nick was different than most of the kids. He didn’t break rules, nor give the staff a hard time. But he wasn’t buying into any of the crap at the school either. He listened at the endless group therapy sessions, quickly learning what was expected. He had real talent for mastering the psychological lingo of group therapy: speaking fluently about abandonment, loss, and grief. But when alone with the other kids, with no staff around to hear, he lost the obedient smile and charm he showed the adults. Group therapy was nothing but a pity party, he said to the other students. A waste of his time. I used to buy guns. On the internet, he casually told the boys in his dorm. For the Bloods and Crips down south. He stretched his lanky body out on his bed, hands under his head. Right, Nick, said the boy in the next bunk. And how exactly did a pretty white boy like you meet the Bloods and Crips? Nick narrowed his eyes. Oh, I got my contacts, he told the kid menacingly. In LA. Nick did seem to know a lot about gang stuff; and the other kids began to be a little scared of him, which Nick liked very much. Although Noa and Jacob were a year older, Nick knew they were the ones who needed to be taken care of. He’d been on the streets. The last time he ran away from home in Northern California, he’d hooked up with a cool hippie group at a music festival in San Francisco. They were called the Dream Catchers. The music was lame, but he stayed with the group for days, until his mother found him and brought him back. From the Dream Catchers, he’d learned some serious panhandling skills, even how to get gas from pumps when someone walked away for a few moments. Nick was confident that once they got some distance from Mount Richmond, they’d survive just fine. He was unafraid. With his good sense of direction and street smarts, he was sure he’d be free of the school and even his mother. He’d travel with the other two, Jacob and Noa, until he didn’t need them any longer. Then he’d ditch them. Nick wasn’t his real name. When he’d been adopted, soon after he was born in Wisconsin, his parents named him Joshua. For as long as he could remember, Nick hated this Old Testament name. He wasn’t anti-Semitic, but he felt his name was another example of how he was living the wrong life. His parents, both Jewish, had tried molding him into something he was not. When he was adopted, he had been dropped into a world he was not meant for. The Russells, his adoptive family, couldn’t even get naming him right. Joshua. The name irritated him. It made him want to puke. When he was a little boy, he’d woken one morning and knew with certainty that his name was not Joshua. His name was Nick. He fantasized that his birth mother had actually given him the name Nick, but he had no evidence, as he’d never seen his original birth certificate from Wisconsin. As much as he knew anything, he knew he was more a Nick than a Joshua. (And that was what his mom always called him, Josh-u-a, not Josh, all three syllables clearly pronounced, like straight from the Bible.) So, at barely sixteen, when Joshua was admitted to Mount Richmond, he told everyone to call him Nick. And it worked. The staff went along with it, feeling a name change harmless. There were plenty of adopted kids at Mount Richmond. Most questioned how they fit into the family they lived with . . . the family they were not related to by blood. Some of these adopted kids were different racially or ethnically than their adoptive parents. There were Black kids or Asian kids adopted by white couples. Many did not look like their parents. Most were different temperamentally. The staff said, Sure, Nick, we’ll call you by whatever name you’d like. Nick/Joshua Russell thought there was a lot more besides his name that was wrong with his life in Northern California. The only things the Russell family cared about were money and prestige. They lived in a big, rambling house in Los Altos, a house uncomfortable to Nick in its size. When he ran away, which he’d been doing on a regular basis since he was fourteen, he saw how normal people lived. Before he’d been brought to Mount Richmond, shoved into that beige car, and forcibly taken to Oregon by the assholes his mother hired, his greatest pleasure had been listening to music. In the lyrics to the songs he loved, Nick heard about real life. Like everything else his mother found for him, he couldn’t believe what a wrong fit this school was. He wanted no more of the talking bullshit, the therapy, the rules. Noa was right. She said Mount Richmond was like a cult. He wasn’t going to let it, or his mother, control him. He considered running away as keeping his integrity, being true to his authentic self. There was no choice but to get out of Mount Richmond. He first started to get into trouble two years before and his mother shipped him off to a wilderness camp in Utah, a place some therapist friend of hers recommended. Wilderness camp had been okay; Joshua actually excelled there. He’d learned to start a bow-drill fire in mere seconds, rapidly twirling a spindle in a hole until a spark flew out. Leaning over a small pile of twigs, he blew and caressed it until a flame started from the single spark he’d created. He could cook decent meals over open fires, too. He once made a cheesecake, baking it inside an ordinary tin can, the wrapper peeled off, and then letting it cool in the chill of the evening. It’d tasted pretty damn good, but by then he and the other boys at the wilderness camp were so starved for sugar, the cake delighted their numbed palates. Counselors at the camp talked nonstop crap about the curative powers of nature and how the great outdoors should inspire you to change your life. A bunch of bull, but still, Joshua was good at it. They were assigned to write in a journal every day about their goals. Instead, he wrote rap songs, with verses about pimps and whores. He drew daggers dripping with blood. And although he was one of the most able boys at the camp, he dreamed every day of getting back to California, about getting high again with his friends. His main fear was that his friends on the street would forget him. When he returned from wilderness camp, the summer he turned fifteen, he searched for his friends, mainly kids from neighboring East Palo Alto. They had not forgotten him and welcomed him back. But his mother continued to make him feel like shit. He wasn’t studying enough. He wasn’t trying hard enough at school. He wasn’t living up to his potential. She never stopped. Who are your friends? she asked. Have you met their parents? When he got sick of her nagging, he’d run away. Always there were cars to sleep in and people to share food and drugs. He never had trouble attracting girls. Girls wanted to take care of him. Joshua would tell them he’d been kicked out at home, which he hadn’t, of course, and they’d feel sorry for him and drive him to McDonald’s, buying him whatever he wanted. In the middle of tenth grade, after several runaways, his mother looked at Joshua’s pathetic grades and tried to enroll him in a fancy private school in Los Altos. It was a school for kids with learning disabilities, but when he visited, he saw they were really just a bunch of pampered jerks, worse even than at his public school. The private school must have known he didn’t belong there, either, because they didn’t accept him. Joshua didn’t belong in that private school, just like he didn’t belong at Mount Richmond Academy. He belonged with his friends on the street, kids he hung with when he ran away. With them, not the fuckheads at school, and not with his family, the feeling he was a wrong fit lessened. When Joshua was little, living in the big house in Los Altos, he used to watch Sesame Street every morning. Eating his bowl of Fruit Loops, he watched the small television set on the kitchen counter in front of him. Sometimes there was a segment where the screen was divided into four squares. A familiar song was sung with this divided screen: One of these things is not like the other . . . Of the four items, one was always different. Kids were supposed to figure out which one didn’t belong. One morning, the screen showed three dark-haired people, with a blond head in the fourth square. It was easy to see which one didn’t belong with the others. Exactly like his own family, Joshua thought. His mother and his siblings were small, dark-haired people. By age twelve, Joshua was already the tallest. The others in his family had thick, wavy brunette hair. None of them had a big, round head like his. His mother regularly had his smooth, blond hair trimmed into a dumb-looking bowl cut that hung almost to his eyebrows. Ever since he could remember, people couldn’t seem to stop running their hands over his silky, straight hair. What an angel he is. Where did he get this golden hair? they’d ask his small, olive-skinned mother. His mom would laugh nervously, one of the few times he ever heard her at a loss for words. She’d mutter, Oh, his grandfather was a blond, and try to change the subject. Now, in the cave in the high desert of Oregon, he looked down at his filthy clothes and ran his fingers through his dirty hair. One of the first things Nick (for now he thought of himself as Nick all of the time) wanted to do when he got out of this shitty cave and could get his hands on some money was to ditch the preppie clothes the school ordered for them from Lands’ End. Then, he’d get a haircut. A Mohawk. He wondered if Noa knew how to cut hair so it stood up in the front and was shaved at the sides. It’d be a great disguise. People wouldn’t know to look for someone with a Mohawk. And a tattoo. He wanted to get a skull and crossbones tattoo with Sam-a-el written below it. It was his favorite group, a badass death metal band from Europe, which was totally hard core. He couldn’t wait to see his mother’s face when she saw her pretty little golden boy with a Mohawk and a skull and bones tattoo on his arm. He knew he had to ditch Jacob and Noa eventually. They’d slow him down. He needed Noa for a while to get them rides. But after that, he’d find a car. He was sure he could make it back down to California in a day or two. That was his plan. There was a guy back home who knew someone who could teach him to manufacture ecstasy. He had another friend who had a place where they could make the stuff, an abandoned shack in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Ecstasy was supposed to be easy to make, not any harder than the experiments they did in chemistry class. They’d have as much E as they wanted, and they’d live pretty on the money they got from selling it. Nick had good buddies, buddies a whole lot cooler than the pussy-whipped Mount Richmond kids. His drug buddies were real friends, better than anyone he’d met at Mount Richmond. They were people he could trust, who loved him unconditionally. There’d be no staff listening over their shoulders. No groups where they were supposed to talk about their feelings. He and his buddies understood each other without group therapy. He wasn’t afraid of living on the streets. He knew how to do it. When he had more cash, he’d go up to San Francisco, where there was real action. The damn helicopter circling overhead was a concern, though. And so was crazy Noa jumping out of the cave and flipping it off. He hoped the helicopter pilot hadn’t seen her, but Noa was hard to miss with her flaming red hair. Though tiny, the girl was really built. Nick hadn’t told the others, but he thought he might have heard dogs barking in the early morning. He wondered if there were dogs searching the mountains. Noa, listen, Nick said. I think they’re looking for us. I’m sure Mount Richmond didn’t like having to call our parents and tell them they’d misplaced us. So listen to me. Just shut up and chill until it gets dark again. Then we’ll make it to the town down there. Noa looked at Nick as if he were an insect. "Since when are you telling us what to do? She chewed her energy bar and looked the two boys up and down, making them squirm. She stared at Nick, pointing her finger at him. You act like you’re the boss. Don’t forget, pretty boy, you are nothing but a sixteen-year-old punk. Younger than me and Jacob. Quit talking like you’re in a gang or something. You’re full of shit; everyone knows that." Nick bristled. Noa was such a bitch. He was going to get away from her and her pussy boyfriend as soon as possible. Those two losers deserved each other. With the noise of the helicopter finally gone, Noa picked up her backpack and stepped out of the cave again. She scanned the sky, then glanced back at the boys. I’m tired of this shithole, she said. You both stink and this cave stinks. I want a drink. See that house, the one down the hill and to the right? I just know they’ve got some nice cold beer in the fridge. She started walking toward the house she’d pointed to. Good riddance, Noa, Nick called after her. She didn’t turn back. Jacob stood up and, shrugging his shoulders, brushed off his pants and lifted his own backpack to his shoulders. He followed Noa down the hill and picked his way carefully among the boulders. Wait up, he said. Shit, Nick muttered to himself. He was alone in the cave. Left behind and thirsty. The thought of a cold beer fought with his concern about the helicopter and the dogs. He tried to convince himself the school couldn’t be paying choppers to search for them. Hiring helicopters and search dogs cost serious money. Even his control-freak mother wouldn’t go that far. She didn’t have that kind of money. Of course, he never would have believed his mother would have him kidnapped, either. But a helicopter and search dogs would be too much. Nick caught up with the other two. He argued with them for a few moments. But he was hungry and thirsty and never good at waiting around. His desire for action won out over his caution. Erasing the picture of his mother from his brain, he focused on the house they’d seen. Food, drink, and who knew what other luxuries would be waiting for them. Maybe even a car. No, probably not a car. Okay, Nick said. Let’s get going. Hopefully that ’copter doesn’t make another pass this way. We’re better off together, the three of us. At least until we get back to civilization. I suppose that means you need a girl to get you rides. Nick, you are such an obvious prick, Noa said. Nick looked warily at her. It bothered him that she saw through him. They stumbled through the dry scrub. It was July, and the sun beat down on them. Nick’s fair skin burned easily and he flipped the visor of his black baseball cap from back to front. Noa, also fair, had no head covering. The sun was starting to burn the pale, freckled skin across her nose and cheeks. Up until now, they’d mostly stayed under cover during the days. Nick silently passed his baseball cap to her. She stared at him but took it and pulled it over her red curls. They walked without speaking for an hour or more, their throats parched. Nick occasionally kicked at rocks, leading the way. Jacob, the least naturally athletic of the three, began to breathe heavily, lagging behind. By the time they got to the house, they were sweating and their water was gone. They stared at the house while catching their breaths. It was silent. The place was in bad repair, run-down with peeling paint and torn screens. There was also a boxlike mobile home parked behind it, which they hadn’t noticed before, and a white Ford extended cab pickup in the driveway. The truck was fairly new, clean, and the two boys circled it appreciatively. When Nick turned away from the truck, he saw Noa had yanked open the unlocked back door. As he watched, she casually walked into the kitchen. Nick whistled though his teeth. That girl is crazy. People could be right inside. What the fuck is she doing? In a moment or two, Noa appeared again. Coast is clear, she said sweetly. Then she held up a can. Mmmm. This sure is refreshing! Jacob hesitated. It was obvious he wanted to follow the girl inside, but Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksFamily LifeFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
