Works Unprotected by Copyright Law
Some types of material are ineligible for copyright protection. Generally, these materials are
either protected by some other intellectual property, or have been considered inappropriate
for protection.  The following unprotected works are discussed in greater detail below: 
unfixed works
titles and short phrases
ideas
useful articles
Unfixed
Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression are not protected under the
Copyright Act, since fixation is one of the prerequisites for copyright protection (see the
BitLaw discussion on obtaining copyright protection for
more information). For example: choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or
improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded are both
ineligible for copyright protection.   For many years, unrecorded music concerts were also
unprotected by copyright law because they were not fixed.  This caused problems when bootleg
tapes of rock concerts would appear, since there was no cause of action under the Copyright
Act (there was often protection under  certain state statutes and common law, however).  This
meant that the availability of copyright infringement actions against bootleggers depended on
whether the performers bothered to record the concert.
In December, 1994, Congress changed the law of unrecorded music performances when it passed
The Uruguay Round Agreements Act.  This act included a new provision, which prohibited the
recording of live musical performances (that is, bootleg copies) even when there was no other
"fixation" of the work. This provision includes separate prohibitions against the
distribution and transmission of bootleg copies.   In fact, the prohibition against
transmission does not even require that a physical copy of the performance ever be made. 
While this act appears to create an exception to the fixation requirement for copyright, it is
probably best understood as an independent right that is similar to copyright, but is not
copyright.
Titles, names, short phrases, slogans
Titles,  names, short phrases, and slogans are not protected by copyright law.  Similarly, it
is clear that copyright law does not protect simple product lettering or coloring, or the mere
listing of product ingredients or contents.  The exclusion of these types of materials is not
an exception to copyright law, but merely an application of the requirements for copyright
protection.  To be protected by copyright, a work must contain at least a minimum amount of
authorship in the form of original expression.  Names, titles,  and other short phrases are
simply too minimal to meet these requirements. This is why you will often see books and movies
sharing the same title.
Of course, brand names, slogans and phrases which are used in connection with a product or
service may be protectable under trademark law (see the BitLaw discussion on trademarks for more information).  In fact, a series of books all under the
same title may even create trademark protection for that title.
Ideas
Ideas, procedures,  principles, discoveries, and devices are all specifically excluded from
copyright protection.  As stated in the Copyright Act: 
In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea,
procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless
of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such
work.
This specific exclusion helps maintain the distinction between copyright protection and patent
law.  Ideas and inventions are the subject matter for patents, while the expression of ideas
is governed by copyright law.  If copyright were extended to protect ideas, principles and
devices, then it would be possible to circumvent the rigorous prerequisites of patent law and
secure protection for an invention merely by describing the invention in a copyrightable
work.
An example is the best way to explain this idea/expression distinction. Suppose that an
inventor discovers a process for cold fusion--an invention that would revolutionize society as
we know it.  If the inventor were to write down on paper a description of the process, that
description would be protected against copyright infringement from the moment the work is
fixed.  If she were to publish her paper, no one would be able to make additional copies of
the paper without her permission. However, anyone reading her paper could implement her
process without fear of copyright infringement, since the process itself--the idea--is not
protected under copyright law. In fact, it would even be allowable for someone to write a
competing paper describing her invention, as long as the competing paper described the
invention in its own words and did not take any "expression" from the original
paper. However, only the inventor could apply for patent protection for her process.  After
applying for the patent, and going through a rigorous examination of the patentability of her
patent, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office might grant her a patent.  At that point, she
could prevent all others from using her idea.  (For more discussion on patent protection, see
the BitLaw discussion on  patents).
One consequence of the idea/expression dichotomy is that there is no copyright  protection in
basic facts.  A fact, such as George Washington's birthday or  the Pope's address and phone
number, is considered synonymous with an idea.   It makes no difference how much effort went
into discovering a particular fact.  Even if it took two years of research to discover a fact,
the fact is still not protectable under copyright laws.  It is possible that a compilation of 
facts is protectable as a compilation, as long as the compilation required a  minimum degree
of originality (see the BitLaw discussion of compilation
copyrights for more information).
A second, less expected result of the idea/expression dichotomy is the inability to obtain
copyright protection for blank forms.  Although graphical or literary  elements that might be
found on a form (such as a photograph or a detailed  explanation of a term) would be subject
to copyright protection, there is no copyright in the blank form itself.  The blank form is
considered to be a type of idea, a conclusion which stems from an old Supreme Court
decision.
Useful articles
Copyright protection is generally not available to articles which have a utilitarian function.
 Examples of these types of "useful articles" would include lamps, bathroom sinks,
clothing, and computer monitors.  Under the Copyright Act, the only copyright protection
available to these items is for "features that can be identified separately from, and are
capable of existing independently of,  the utilitarian aspects of the article." 
Unfortunately, this test is inherently ambiguous when deciding the scope of copyright
protection for certain useful articles.
Some distinctions are clear. For instance, a painting on the side of a truck is protectable
under copyright law even though the truck is a useful article. The painting is clearly
separable from the utilitarian aspects of the truck.  The overall shape of the truck, on the
other hand, would not be copyrightable since the shape is an essential part of the truck's
utility.  Another commonly considered example is that of clothing.  The print found on the
fabric of a skirt or jacket is copyrightable, since it exists separately from the utilitarian
nature of the clothing.  However, there is no copyright in the cut of the cloth, or the 
design of the skirt or jacket as a whole, since these articles are utilitarian. This is true
even of fanciful costumes; no copyright protection is granted to the costume as a whole.
One of the primary purposes for prohibiting copyright protection in useful articles is to
prevent the granting of patent-like protection through the copyright laws.  If a useful
article was protected under the copyright law, the protection against copying would be quite
similar to patent protection.  Since copyrights are so much easier to obtain than patents,
there would be no way of limiting this patent-like monopoly to inventions that are truly novel
and non-obvious. (For more discussion on patent protection, see the BitLaw  discussion on patents).
Another interesting copyright concern is the extent of copyright protection in pictoral or
sculptural works that portray a useful article.  Take, for example, a painting of a futuristic
looking automobile. Copyright protection would prevent the outright copying of the painting. 
In addition, copyright law would prevent the creation of a three-dimensional model of the
automobile found in the painting.  However, under the specific terms of the Copyright Act,
copyright law would not prevent General Motors from making a working (hence utilitarian)
automobile of the design found in the painting.
