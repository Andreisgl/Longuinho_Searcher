Using case study strategy, eighteen peri-urban settlements in Ikorodu, a Local Government Area outside Lagos Metropolitan region, were selected for this study. Data was collected through primary and secondary sources which include survey questionnaires and direct observations. Using two stage sampling techniques, questionnaire was distributed to households in purposively selected peri-urban settlements. Data collected through field survey were analysed using frequencies, percentages, cross tabulations and test of correlation while qualitative data were analysed using descriptive analysis. Findings revealed the major factors influencing housing characteristics in the study area are housing initiatives, residential segregation and residents’ socio-economic attributes. Different housing initiatives in the study area performed differently in terms of typology and resident’s p...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersATBU Journal of Science, Technology and EducationFactors Influencing Housing Development in Lagos Peri-Urban Settlements: Cases of Ibeju-Lekki And Ikorodu2017 • Funmilayo AdedireThis paper examines the factors influencing peri-urban housing development in Lagos with focus on the drivers of rapid spatial changes in the case studies of Ibeju-Lekki and Ikorodu, both rapidly urbanizing peri-urban settlements in Lagos, Nigeria. Data was collected through primary source by administration of 373 and 384 questionnaires to household heads in purposively selected peri-urban settlements in Ibeju-lekki and in Ikorodu, Lagos respectively. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and factor analysis. The result shows that major factors influencing peri-urban housing development in the study area are land affordability, low cost of living, easy linkage, proximity to the urban centre and provision of better quality housing through exclusive gated housing development. The study recommends a re-classification of Lagos peri-urban settlements based on change in land use due to housing development. This can be achieved through an appropriate policy design...Download Free PDFView PDFUrban ForumPeri-urban Expansion in Ikorodu, Lagos: Extent, Causes, Effects, and Policy Response2018 • Funmilayo AdedireDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Contemporary Urban AffairsThe Impact of Peri-Urbanisation on Housing Development: Environmental Quality and Residents' Productivity in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos2018 • Journal of Contemporary Urban AffairsDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Sustainable DevelopmentDifferentials in Metropolitanisation Trends in Lagos Peri-Urban Settlements2017 • Funmilayo AdedireThis paper examines the differential in the metropolitanisation of Lagos peri-urban settlements and the policy implication on locational quality of the emerging settlements. Two case studies of Ibeju-Lekki and Ikorodu were selected to represent the peri-urban settlements outside Lagos metropolitan regions. Using purposive sampling, thirty four settlements were selected which comprise sixteen and eighteen in Ibeju-Lekki and Ikorodu respectively. Data was sourced primarily through administration of 370 and 384 questionnaires to household heads in the selected settlements in Ibeju-Lekki and Ikorodu. Secondary data was sourced by conversion of analogue spatial images, the land use maps and satellite images of the study area to digital format. Spatial images from 1980 through 2016 were acquired for this study. Acquired satellite images from Google Earth archive were brought into ArcGIS environment for geo-referencing.

Data were collected through primary source by administration of 383 questionnaires to household heads in purposively selected eighteen peri-urban settlements and through the use of an observation schedule. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive analysis while the qualitative data were analysed by content analysis. The result shows the major benefits of residential location in Ikorodu as shown from the residents’ perception are quality environment for living and the potential for economic growth. The most prevailing challenge to residential location was inadequate infrastructure development. Enterprise wise, the major benefit is availability of good customer base. Findings also show that development in the peri-urban has outgrown the provided infrastructure. It is therefore recommended that effort should be made to update data on pattern and extent of development in order to ascertain the infrastructure needs and distribution in the peri-urban. There should be an effective policy design for improved infrastructure development.

Data collection was primarily through administration of 384 and 370 questionnaires to purposively selected housing units in Ikorodu and Ibeju-Lekki, respectively. These two settlements represent the most rapidly urbanising peri-urban in Lagos State. Primary data collected included drivers of urban expansion, residents’ demography, locational convenience and commuting frequency. To supplement the primary data, spatial images of 2006 and 2016 were acquired as satellite images from Google Earth archive for this study. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics for the quantitative data and time series and satellite image analysis for the qualitative data. The results show a varying extent of transition primarily influenced by the residents’ demography, linkages to the urban areas, quality o...Download Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental Sustainability In Lagos Periphery Housing2021 • Michael Babatunde AdegbilePeri-urban residential settlements in Nigerian cities grew phenomenally as a result of rapid urbanisation. But the spontaneous housing settlements are enmeshed in development-driven urban challenges. This study examines the environmental sustainability of a typical peri-urban settlement in Lagos, Ikorodu. A combination of case study based examination and application of International Urban Sustainability Indicators List framework (IUSIL) was used to achieve an integrated research method. Data were collected through primary and secondary sources including observation, structured questionnaires, interview and satellite images. Two stage clusters sampling was used to select 384 household heads as the study population. Quantitative data was done using descriptive analysis while satellite image analysis was used for qualitative data. Investigations were carried out on the state of infrastructure, locational quality and the commuting pattern. Findings show fair environmental sustainability...Download Free PDFView PDFDrivers Of Housing Development In Ibeju-Lekki , Lagos Peri-Urban Settlement2016 • Funmilayo AdedireUrbanisation finds expression in outward expansion of built up area and conversion of prime agricultural lands in the peri-urban into residential and industrial uses. By 2025, Lagos is supposed to be the 11th most populous city in the world (United Nations, 2016). One of the major effects of urbanisation in Lagos is inadequate and affordable housing. Lagos state is spatially the smallest state in Nigeria with approximately 3, 577 square kilometers out of which 39% are wetlands (Dekolo & Oduwaye, 2011)and which constitutes 0.4% of Nigeria’s total land mass (Opoko & Oluwatayo, 2014). An estimate of 2.55 million new homes is required for the next 5 years to meet housing needs of Lagos State. The state currently records approximately 20,000 people per square kilometer (LASG Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), 2012). There is a remarkable strain on housing and serviced land created by the rapid urbanisation. Household size has reduced to 3.8 persons per household from the 6.3 person per ho...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Contemporary Urban AffairsCorrelation between Socio-Economic Characteristics and Housing Quality of Residential Neighbourhoods in Akure, Southwest NigeriaWale OlayiwolaThere is a general paucity of explanations for the emerging social and spatial changes in the pattern and socio-economic traits of urban residential housing units in Nigeria. Hence, this study examined the spatial pattern of residential neighbourhoods; assessed the quality of residential housing units; and evaluated the correlation between the socio-economic position of respondents and housing quality in Akure, Nigeria. Data were derived from the household questionnaire, remotely sensed data (Landsat 8 OLI/TIR, 2021), a Google Earth map, a Street Map of Akure Township, and personal observations. The study adopted a step-wise sampling technique to select 383 samples from 139,069 heads of households in Akure in 2021. Data were analysed using percentage distribution, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and t-test. Results indicated varying housing qualities across three residential zones in Akure, Nigeria; houses in the low-density residential areas were of better quality than the other r...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
