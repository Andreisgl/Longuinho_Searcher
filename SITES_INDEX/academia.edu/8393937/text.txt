NaiduThe Barmer Basin of northwest India is a failed intracontinental rift that has become an established prolific hydrocarbon province in the last decade. Primary source rocks in the basin are the diatomites and interbedded lacustrine shales of the Paleocene Eocene Barmer Hill and Dharvi Dungar formations, although subordinate lacustrine shales in Lower Creta-ceous sediments beneath the main rift basin are also high-quality source rocks. Synrift deposition commenced in the Paleocene and peaked in the Eocene, with Barmer Hill Formation shales maturing as early as 55 Ma. Generation continued across the basin through to the early Miocene.

The rising oil prices, high input cost in exploration and production of hard oil resources and relative abundance of gas resources have fuelled the interest towards gas resources. As the consumption of natural gas is increasing rapidly, it is essential to identify and develop the available energy resources. India has the immense prospects of unconventional shale gas resources. Commercial exploration of these shale gas resources can effectively make the global natural gas curve more elastic. The commercial shale gas exploration requires exhaustive investigations of all the shale rock properties of hydrocarbon bearing shale beds having significant organic matter and maturity. This paper presents overview of shale gas resources as well as the prospective shale gas horizons in Indian sedimentary basins.Download Free PDFView PDFGeosciences JournalGeo-microbial and geochemical evidences in the near surface soils of Jamnagar sub-basin, Saurashtra, Gujarat, India: implications to hydrocarbon resource potential2012 • dattatray patilDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
