They served a type of cult, the heroic, as shown by both their widespread distribution in this region and their complete absence from divine sanctuaries. Their generalised and standardised iconography made them versatile offerings that could be used in various contexts, with the seated figure acquiring the identity of the locally honoured hero in a specific sanctuary setting. Distribution patterns also show variety. In Laconia, plaque findspots show this type of offering was favoured much more in the region inhabited by the homoioi. By contrast, the Messenian plaques, offered both at Bronze Age tombs and at urban sanctuaries, must have been dedicated primarily by perioikoi. The similarities between Laconian and Messenian types of plaques need not be correlated with the contested ethnic identity of the Messenians. Rather, they should be attributed to the flexibility and variety in their use. The Messenian cults that attracted plaque dedications honoured heroes not necessarily because they were Achaean, but because they were celebrated local mythical or historical figures. Creating a link with the past through heroes was a well-established way to articulate a strong local and communal, but not necessarily ethnic, identity.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers"Votive reliefs with snakes from Messene" 2017Olga  PalagiaDownload Free PDFView PDF"Heroic Plaques at Messene and Laconia", in Sanctuaries and Cults of Messene (Athens 2017)Gina SalapataRelief terracotta plaques representing a variety of subjects were a popular offering in heroic sanctuaries of Laconia and Messenia. The plaques found at several deposits in ancient Messene depend thematically and technically on the Laconian plaques, especially those from the sanctuary of Agamemnon and Kassandra at Amyklai; several were clearly made in the same Laconian or derivative moulds using local clay. The generalised and standardised iconography of the plaques made them versatile offerings that could be offered to a variety of heroes. On the other hand, some unusual subjects seem to be closely related to particular sanctuaries at Messene and Amyklai and would have been created with the specific cult in mind. The original dependence on Laconian prototypes did not preclude local Messenian originality because some types found only at Messene are probably new Messenian creations. Local variations on traditional themes were also introduced in the fourth century BC. These developments may be related to the increased importance of heroes after the liberation of Messenia and an attempt at differentiation from Laconian prototypes.Download Free PDFView PDFFemale Triads on Laconian Terracotta PlaquesGina SalapataArchaic and Classical terracotta relief plaques discovered in votive deposits in Lakonia and representing three standing females raise two questions: firstly, whether their appearance in groups of three means that they are a defined triad or is just an indication of unlimited plurality; and secondly, whether they are divine or mortal. It is concluded that no single interpretation can be ascribed to all cases. Most triads seem to represent mortal worshippers rather than a specific divine or semi-divine triad. However, an exceptional triad flanked by snakes may represent the Erinyes. Such an interpretation would harmonize with the nature of the cult at the sanctuary in which they were dedicated—that of Alexandra (Kassandra) and Agamemnon, both murdered in Lakonia, according to a local tradition. An offering with the representation of the avenging spirits would have been very appropriate for Agamemnon and especially Kassandra, who suffered a wrongful death that was never properly avenged.Download Free PDFView PDFascs.org.auTHE MORE THE BETTER? VOTIVE OFFERINGS IN SETSGina SalapataOrdinary, inexpensive and often mass-produced offerings are found in abundance in votive deposits throughout the Greek world. They have the potential not only to illuminate the type of cult and the nature and character of the recipients, but also to help us ascertain popular tastes and cult practices of the average worshipper. The main intention of this paper is to raise the issue of small offerings acquired and dedicated in groups or sets, and presumably also displayed together. In some cases, sanctuary deposits exhibiting similarities in the profile of type of offerings may indicate that objects were dedicated in groups of two or more items during a single visit to the sanctuary. Sets of offerings would have expressed complementary notions about the cult and the recipient, and could have increased the efficacy of the gift-giving ritual. In other cases, generic offerings that were appropriate for several cults could have been dedicated and displayed together in a sanctuary in order to produce more specific images.Download Free PDFView PDFИЗБРАННАЯ БИБЛИОГРАФИЯ ПО ИСТОРИИ И КУЛЬТУРЕ  ДРЕВНЕЙ СПАРТЫ  ANCIENT SPARTA : SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY / Cост.

This evidence includes tripods in Messene (hierothysion, sanctuary of Zeus on Mt. Ithome), the iconography of tripods on the coinage of Messene from 370 BCE onwards, the literary account of Pausanias regarding the legendary dedication of tripods around the altar of Zeus Ithomatas (Paus. 6.12.7-10), and the mid-fifth century BCE pillar of the Messenians at Delphi. On the basis of a careful analysis of the context and the ritual and symbolic functions of these tripods, I argue that the Messenian valorization of the tripod-cauldron after 370/369 BCE was conditioned not only by the traditional panhellenic values of this symbol but also by functions and ritual connotations that were peculiar to Boiotia, the homeland of the founder of Messene. The naturalization of the tripod cauldron in the Messenian symbolic universe and identity was largely the product of careful design and implementation instigated by Epameinondas and other Boiotian officials who contributed to the material and conceptual foundation of MesseneDownload Free PDFView PDFHeterological ethnicity: conceptualizing identities in ancient Greece2003 • Johannes SiapkasDownload Free PDFView PDFPaths of knowledge in antiquityPausanias’ Messenian itinerary and the journeys of the past2018 • Greta HawesDownload Free PDFView PDFMessene: a Bibliography on the Archaeology and History of the city.
