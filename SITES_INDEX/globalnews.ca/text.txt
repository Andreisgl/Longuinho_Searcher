With the death of Prince, the music world has not only lost one of its most prolific hit-makers but also an artist who challenged and changed the industry.

Seven years before that, he faced off with another internet user Stephanie Lenz, who uploaded a video of her toddler bopping out to his song “Let’s Go Crazy”.According to ABC News, only 28 people had viewed Lenz’s video by the time YouTube sent her a notification that the video had been taken down due to a Universal Music Group request.

 “Prince believes it is wrong for YouTube, or any user-generated site, to appropriate his music without his consent,” ABC reported the company saying in a 2007 statement. The news outlet also cited an unnamed source saying Prince “scours the internet” for copyright violations of his work.But in the end — eight years later in September 2015 — it was Lenz who wound up victorious after she sued Universal. She challenged Universal’s claim her video violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and “constituted an infringing use of a portion of a Prince composition.”The three-judge panel unanimously deciding that “parties must individually consider whether a work is a fair use before representing that the work is infringing in a takedown notice.”  Story continues below advertisement
