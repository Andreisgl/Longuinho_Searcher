Pictish as well as several pre-Proto-Germanic substrate words might be Yenisseian-related. Kartvelian and North Caucasian elements might be preserved from Basque (Caucasian, mainly Daghestanian-related) Bell Beaker culture. Hurrian elements in Proto-Germanic are confirmed by genetic link with Cyprys and Aegean influence on the Nordic Bronze Age. Etruscan consonantism is similar to Armenian and Germanic as a result of the substrate influence or preservation of archaic featuresDownload Free PDFView PDFShaving the Warrior: Archaeo-linguistic investigation of Indo-European warrior identity from the Eneolithic to the Bronze Age - prestige razors and ideologyMikkel NørtoftThis thesis deals with the linguistic and archaeological age of prestige razors and tweezers in European Bronze Age elite male warrior graves, compared with the linguistic and archaeological age of more ideological features usually assigned to the Bronze Age elite male warrior "package", such as drinking rituals, combat and raiding, warrior bands, long distance trading, guest-host relations, and immortal fame through heroic life, etc. The linguistic and archaeological age of these features is applied to investigate the development of the Indo-European elite warrior from the Copper Age to the Late Bronze Age.Download Free PDFView PDFMel Copeland, editor of academia.edu: Reviews of documents submitted to academia.eduMel Copeland, editor of academia.edu: Reviews of documents submitted to academia.edu2021 • Mel CopelandMel Copeland, editor of academia.edu: Reviews of documents submitted to academia.edu I was invited by academia.edu to become an editor September 9, 2017. The criteria for submission was then one paper review per month and with each review submission certify that: 1) I read the document, 2) the document is a work of academic research 3) the paper is a worthwhile contribution to the literature After a time academia.edu reviews became limited to a small word count (for obvious reasons).
