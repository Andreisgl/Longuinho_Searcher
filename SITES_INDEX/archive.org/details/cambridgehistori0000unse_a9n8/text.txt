392 pages : 27 cmThe history of Britain and Ireland is traditionally presented as a succession of dramatic changes, but in this reference work the reader will find instead an emphasis on the patterns of continuity. The sixty contributors have concerned themselves with political structures and social and economic forces, rather than with the highlights of ancient chronicles and more recent upheavals. The familiar outlines and landmarks of the past nevertheless remain: the Encyclopedia consists of seven chronological sections from prehistory to the present decade, completed by a biographical Who's Who. Each section is introduced with a survey or Overview describing the major features and trends of the period. Specialist articles follow, which interpret developments in the context of each of the following topics: Government and Politics; Warfare and International Relations; Economy, Society (including living conditions); Culture (including education). The interpretative articles are illustrated not only with specific visual records, buildings and portraiture, but also with representations of dress, housing, transport, and everyday objects, intended to give the reader as vivid a feeling as possible for each period consulted. Maps and genealogies are included wherever they are helpfulIncludes bibliographical references (pages 374-376) and indexBritons and Romans, c100 BC-AD 409 -- Saxons, Danes and Normans, 409-1154 -- Medieval empire: England and her neighbours, 1154-1450 -- Reformation and inflation, 1450-1625 -- Disorder to stability: Britain and Ireland, 1625-1783 -- Political reform and economic revolution, 1783-1901 -- From imperial power to European partner, 1901-1975 -- Who's who
