Drawing on the work of cultural techniques (e.g. Siegert 2015; Vismann 2013) and Levi-Strauss' The Raw and the Cooked (1970), I argued that the relationship between humans and food is primary to how the human understands itself and forms part of the ground of human ontological systems. I'd like to take this argument further today, to a system-level perspective of food production and beyond, to a posthuman future where food no longer resembles what we know it as today, and because of this, where the human as such arguably ceases to exist, as the ground upon which it has defined self and species is transcended. I'm responding both to fictional future food visions and aspirations towards technical solutions to our current food-related crises.Save to LibraryDownloadby Siobhan Watters•  28  Future Studies, Anthropology, Media Studies, Cyborg TheoryPhotobiological hydrogen productionThe principles and recent progress in the research and development of photobiological hydrogen production are reviewed.

We have previously shown that crude thylakoid membranes from the cyanobacterium Synechocytis sp. PCC 6803 can reduce the electron transfer (ET) protein cytochrome c even in the presence of the PSII inhibitor DCMU. Mutation of lysine 238 of the Photosystem II D1 protein to glutamic acid increased the cytochrome reduction rates, indicating the possible position of this unknown ET pathway. In this contribution, we show that D1-K238E is rather unique, as other mutations to K238, or to other residues in the same vicinity, are not as successful in cytochrome c reduction. This observation indicates the sensitivity of ET reactions to minor changes. As the next step in obtaining useful SEC from biological material, we describe the use of crude Synechocystis membranes in a bio-photovoltaic cell containing ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Hen Dotan•  11  Hydrogen, Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, MutationX-ray absorption spectroscopySave to LibraryDownloadby Timothy  Stemmler•  11  Inorganic Chemistry, Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, Quantum TheoryThermodynamic balance of photosynthesis and transpiration at increasing CO2 concentrations and rapid light fluctuationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Dolores Marín•  10  Engineering, Thermodynamics, Carbon Dioxide, PhotosynthesisElectron transfer in the Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction center assembled with zinc bacteriochlorophyllSave to LibraryDownloadby Ryszard Jankowiak•  20  Engineering, Microbiology, Kinetics, PhotosynthesisEtiolation Symptoms in Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) Cotyledons Partially Covered by the Pericarp of the AcheneSave to LibraryDownloadby Éva Hideg and +1Katalin Solymosi•  8  Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, Ecology, LightStudy on the Feasibility of Bacteriorhodopsin as Bio-Photosensitizer in Excitonic Solar Cell: A First ReportSave to LibraryDownloadby Sławomir Filipek•  16  Engineering, Technology, Photosynthesis, TitaniumFibrillin protein function: the tip of the iceberg?Save to LibraryDownloadby Dharmendra Singh•  6  Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, Gene expression, PhylogenyLight inhibition of leaf respiration in field-grown Eucalyptus saligna in whole-tree chambers under elevated atmospheric CO2 and summer droughtSave to LibraryDownloadby David Tissue•  19  Water, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon, PhotosynthesisThe Development of C4 Rice: Current Progress and Future ChallengesSave to LibraryDownloadby William Quick•  8  Carbon Dioxide, Molecular Evolution, Photosynthesis, SciencePhotosynthetic response of transgenic soybean plants, containing an Arabidopsis P5CR gene, during heat and drought stressSave to LibraryDownloadby Reto Strasser•  20  Water, Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, Drought StressLeaf anatomical properties in relation to differences in mesophyll conductance to CO 2 and photosynthesis in two related Mediterranean Abies speciesSave to LibraryDownloadby Domingo Sancho Knapik•  11  Carbon Dioxide, Photosynthesis, Biology, MedicineTranscriptome dynamics of developing maize leaves and genomewide prediction of cis elements and their cognate transcription factorsMaize is a major crop and a model plant for studying C4 photosynthesis and leaf development.

However, a genomewide regulatory network of leaf development is not yet available. This knowledge is useful for developing C3 crops to perform C4 photosynthesis for enhanced yields. Here, using 22 transcriptomes of developing maize leaves from dry seeds to 192 h post imbibition, we studied gene up- and down-regulation and functional transition during leaf development and inferred sets of strongly coexpressed genes. More significantly, we developed a method to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and their cognate transcription factors (TFs) using genomic sequence and transcriptomic data. The method requires not only evolutionary conservation of candidate TFBSs and sets of strongly coexpressed genes but also that the genes in a gene set share the same Gene Ontology term so that they are involved in the same biological function.

Recently, Tholen and co-workers developed a framework, in which g m better describes a physical diffusional parameter (g m,dif). They partitioned mesophyll resistance (r m,dif = 1/g m,dif) into two components, cell wall and plasmalemma resistance (r wp) and chloroplast resistance (r ch), and showed that g m,app is sensitive to the ratio of photorespiratory (F) and respiratory (R d) CO2 release to net CO2 uptake (A): g m,app = g m,dif/[1 + ω(F + R d)/A], where ω is the fraction of r ch in r m,dif. We herein extend the framework further by considering various scenarios for the intracellular arrangement of chloroplasts and mitochondria. We show that the formula of Tholen et al. implies either that mitochondria, where (photo)respired CO2 is released, locate between the plasmalemma and t...Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul Struik•  7  Carbon Dioxide, Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, MitochondriaPhytoplankton mineralization in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic OceanSave to LibraryDownloadby Alex Poulton•  19  Geochemistry, Structural Dynamics, Photosynthesis, CommunityPlasmolysis effects and osmotic potential of two phylogenetically distinct alpine strains of Klebsormidium (Streptophyta)The osmotic potential and effects of plasmolysis were investigated in two different Klebsormidium strains from alpine habitats by incubation in 300-2,000 (3,000) mM sorbitol.

Several members of this genus were previously found to tolerate desiccation in the vegetative state yet information was lacking on the osmotic potentials of these algae. The strains were morphologically determined as Klebsormidium crenulatum and Klebsormidium nitens. These species belong to distinct clades, as verified by phylogenetic analysis of the rbcL gene. K. crenulatum is part of to the K. crenulatum/mucosum (&#x27;F&#x27; clade) and K. nitens of the &#x27;E2&#x27; clade. Plasmolysis occurred in K. crenulatum at 800 mM sorbitol (961 mOsmol kg(-1), Ψ = -2.09 MPa) and in K. nitens at 600 mM sorbitol (720 mOsmol kg(-1), Ψ = -1.67 MPa).

This is true for mitochondria in all eukaryotes and plastids in plants and algae. Then how do kleptoplasts, plastids that are sequestered by some sacoglossan sea slugs, survive in the animals’ digestive gland cells in the absence of the algal nucleus encoding the vast majority of organellar proteins? For almost two decades, lateral gene transfer (LGT) from algae to slugs appeared to offer a solution, but RNA-seq analysis, later supported by genome sequencing of slug DNA, failed to find any evidence for such LGT events. Yet, isolated reports continue to be published and are readily discussed by the popular press and social media, making the data on LGT and its support for kleptoplast longevity appear controversial. However, when we take a sober look at the methods used, we realise that caution is warranted in how the results are interpreted.

Photosynthesis is the fundamental process during which CO 2 is taken up by plants and fixed into carbohydrates. The effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis in different plant species is directly related to degree-days (D-D) as well as the leaf area index (LAI). Throughout the dry season, the reduced net primary productivity is tightly correlated with increasing D-D, while the reduction in soil moisture leads to progressive canopy thinning, indicated by decreasing LAI. Forest degradation exacerbated by soil erosion and depletion of nutrients in response to high rainfall intensities during the rainy season further disturbs the ecological balance of the entire ecosystem, destabilising it beyond its natural resilience. Given this fact, ground-based evidence and remote sensing-based findings, we propose a climatically induced cascade of events leading to a gradual alteration of the tropical forest ecosystems on Borneo with a diminishing ability to absorb CO 2 and release O 2. Such a feedback loop, which is primarily triggered by increases in temperature, has potentially dangerous outcome for tropical ecosystems and has already been observed in the northwestern state of Brunei Darussalam. The island of Borneo as a whole seems to have reached a level of forest degradation that is beyond a point of no return. In the worst-case scenario, the next niche of stability may be a destruction of tropical forests and the loss of a major proportion of Earth's biodiversity. Our aim is to stimulate further research on such occurrences and inspire the implementation of future preventative measures.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kazimierz Becek and +1Aline Horwath•  5  Photosynthesis, Global Warming, LAI, Vicious CycleEffect of Pb toxicity on leaf growth, physiology and ultrastructure in the two ecotypes of Elsholtzia argyiSave to LibraryDownloadby Qaisar Mahmood•  19  Engineering, Photosynthesis, China, Transmission Electron MicroscopyGeneral effect of photosynthetic electron transport inhibitors on translation precludes their use for investigating regulation of D1 biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942Both light itself and excitation pressure have been implicated as the environmental signal that stimulates interchange of the two forms of the D1 protein of photosystem II (PS II) in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942.

We sought an explanation for conflicting reports regarding the role of photosynthetic electron transport in regulation of psbA expression and D1 interchange. Inhibitors that block at different points in the photosynthetic electron transport chain were administered and the effect on expression of psbAII, which encodes the high-light-induced form II of D1, was examined by measuring changes in transcript levels and in the activities of reporter enzymes. Both 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), an inhibitor of PSII, and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB), an inhibitor of the cytochrome b6/f complex, prevented high-light-induced increase in β-galactosidase activity from a psbAII::lacZ gene fusion when added at a concentration that completely inhibits photosynthetic electron transport (1 μM). The same effect was observed for luciferase activity from transcriptional and translational fusions of psbAII to the luxAB genes from Vibrio harveyi. DCMU (1 μM) arrested luciferase expression at low-light levels – thus eliminating the high light response – whereas a sublethal concentration (50 nM), which reduces electron transport by 50%, had intermediate effects on psbAII-driven luciferase activity. However, psbAII transcript levels, monitored by northern blot analysis, were not altered by electron transport inhibitors, either at low-light intensity or following a high-light exposure. The suppressive effect of DCMU on expression of reporter enzymes was not restricted to the high-light response of psbAII-driven reporter systems, but was also observed using an isopropyl-(-d)-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible trc promoter fused to luxAB. This construct only marginally responded to IPTG addition when DCMU was present. Thus, blocking electron transport in Synechococcus affects the translation machinery in a general way, and the use of electron transport inhibitors is of limited value when focusing on specific redox regulation of D1 protein synthesis or degradation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sp Anandan•  9  Photosynthesis, Plant Biology, Protein synthesis, Electron TransportFluorescent biosensor using whole cells in an inorganic translucent matrixAn optical biosensor based on vegetal cells entrapped in an inorganic translucent matrix and fluorescence detection has been developed.

The biosensor uses Chlorella vulgaris immobilized in a translucent support produced from sol–gel technology. The translucence of the structure enables the algal active layer to be placed directly in contact with the optical fibers for fluorescence detection. This configuration has many advantages over the use of an opaque support because no space between the optical fibers and the active layer is required to collect fluorescence. This reagentless biosensor allows determination of diuron as an anti-PSII herbicide and its long term activity is assessed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hanh Nguyen•  17  Analytical Chemistry, Photosynthesis, Pesticide, PesticidesRapid screening for the robust expression of recombinant proteins in algal plastidsChlamydomonas reinhardtii has many advantages as a photosynthetic model organism.

One of these is facile, targeted chloroplast transformation by particle bombardment. Functional recombinant proteins can be expressed to significant levels in this system, potentially outperforming higher plants in speed of scaling, cost, and space requirements. Several strategies and regulatory regions can be used for achieving transgene expression. Here we present two of those strategies: one makes use of the psbD promoter for expressing moderate levels of the recombinant protein in a photosynthetic background. The other strategy is based on the strong psbA promoter for obtaining high yields of the recombinant product in a non-photosynthetic strain. We herein describe the vectors, transformation procedures, and screening methods associated with these two strategies.Save to LibraryDownloadby daniel barrera•  8  Photosynthesis, Drug Resistance, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Anti-Bacterial AgentsSpecification of adaxial and abaxial stomata, epidermal structure and photosynthesis to CO2 enrichment in maize leavesAcclimation to CO2 enrichment was studied in maize plants grown to maturity in either 350 or 700 microl l-1 CO2.

Plants grown with CO2 enrichment were significantly taller than those grown at 350 microl l-1 CO2 but they had the same number of leaves. High CO2 concentration led to a marked decrease in whole leaf chlorophyll and protein. The ratio of stomata on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces was similar in all growth conditions, but the stomatal index was considerably increased in plants grown at 700 microl l-1 CO2. Doubling the atmospheric CO2 content altered epidermal cell size leading to fewer, much larger cells on both leaf surfaces. The photosynthesis and transpiration rates were always higher on the abaxial surface than the adaxial surface. CO2 uptake rates increased as atmospheric CO2 was increased up to the growth concentrations on both leaf surfaces. Above these values, CO2 uptake on the abaxial surface was either stable or increased as CO2 concentration increased. In marked contrast, CO2 uptake rates on the adaxial surface were progressively inhibited at concentrations above the growth CO2 value, whether light was supplied directly to this or the abaxial surface. These results show that maize leaves adjust their stomatal densities through changes in epidermal cell numbers rather than stomatal numbers. Moreover, the CO2-response curve of photosynthesis on the adaxial surface is specifically determined by growth CO2 abundance and tracks transpiration. Conversely, photosynthesis on the abaxial surface is largely independent of CO2 concentration and rather independent of stomatal function.Save to LibraryDownloadby Karl Kunert and +1Enrique Olmos•  19  Carbon Dioxide, Kinetics, Photosynthesis, Plant BiologyResponse of superoxide dismutase isoenzymes in tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) during thermo-acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatusSave to LibraryDownloadby JUAN JOSE ALARCON CABAÑERO and +1E.

A new green synthesis method involves using PI/UV system, carboxymethyl starch(CMS), silver nitrate, and water. A mechanism of the reduction of silver ions to AgNPs by PI/UV system as well as by the newly bornaldehydic groups was proposed. The synthesis process was assessed by UV-vis spectra and TEM of AgNPs colloidal solution. Thehighest absorbance was obtained using CMS, PI and AgNO3 concentrations of 10 g/L, 1 g/L, and 1 g/L, respectively; 40∘C; 60 min;pH 7; and a material : liquor ratio 1 : 20. AgNPs so-obtained were stable in aqueous solution over a period of three weeks at roomtemperature (∼25∘C) and have round shape morphology. The sizes of synthesized AgNPs were in the range of 1–21nm and thehighest counts % of these particles were for particles of 6–10 and 1–3 nm, respectively.Save to LibraryDownloadby Manal A .

A binuclear Mn-Ca metal center binding one substrate H2O on each ion is proposed to be the minimal unit of the redox center. A model for the water oxidizing metal cluster is built with molecular modeling software (HyperChem 8.0 Pro). Mn, being a transitional metal with variable valency is redox active, while Ca is redox inert. Formation and deprotonation of H2O+ on MnIII may be favorable compared to Ca. Deprotonation of H2O+ yields a stable species HO(-) on MnIV by transfer of one electron from MnIII as a consequence of first photoact. Similarly, during second photoact, it may lead to formation of MnV = O. The O-O bond may be formed in the third photoact between O on Mn and H2O on Ca. Subsequently, HO2*(-) may be formed, leading to formation of O2. Molecular models are built for each transition states.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pranab Mohapatra•  7  Water, Photosynthesis, Biomimetics, CalciumOvercoming biological constraints to enable the exploitation of microalgae for biofuelsSave to LibraryDownloadby MIchele Stanley•  9  Photosynthesis, Microalgae, Multidisciplinary, BiofuelsNextLast »Related TopicsChlorophyll FluorescenceFollowFollowingPlant Stress PhysiologyFollowFollowingPlant PhysiologyFollowFollowingPlant EcophysiologyFollowFollowingDroughtFollowFollowingDrought StressFollowFollowingTheoretical ChemistryFollowFollowingPlant BiologyFollowFollowingArtificial PhotosynthesisFollowFollowingDrug Delivery SystemFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
