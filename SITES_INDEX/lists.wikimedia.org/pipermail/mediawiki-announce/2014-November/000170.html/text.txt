Hello everyone,
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.23.7, 1.22.14 and 1.19.22. This is a
regular security and maintenance release. Download links are given at the end of this
email. 
== Security fixes ==
* (bugs 66776, 71478) SECURITY:  User PleaseStand reported a way to inject code into API
clients that used format=php to process pages that underwent flash policy mangling. This
was fixed along with improving how the mangling was done for format=json, and allowing
sites to disable the mangling using $wgMangleFlashPolicy.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T68776>
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73478>
* (bug 70901) SECURITY: User Jackmcbarn reported that the ability to update the content
model for a page could allow an unprivileged attacker to edit another user's common.js
under certain circumstances. The user right "editcontentmodel" was added, and is
needed to change a revision's content model.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T72901>
* (bug 71111) SECURITY: User PleaseStand reported that on wikis that allow raw HTML, it is
not safe to preview wikitext coming from an untrusted source such as a cross-site request.
Thus add an edit token to the form, and when raw HTML is allowed, ensure the token is
provided before showing the preview.  This check is not performed on wikis that both allow
raw HTML and anonymous editing, since there are easier ways to exploit that scenario.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73111>
* (bug 72222) SECURITY: Do not show log action when the entry is revdeleted with
DELETED_ACTION. NOTICE: this may be reverted in a future release pending a public RFC
about the desired functionality. This issue was reported by user Bawolff.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74222>
== Bugfixes ==
* (bug 71621) Make allowing site-wide styles on restricted special pages a config option.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73621>
* (bug 42723) Added updated version history from 1.19.2 to 1.22.13
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T44723>
* $wgMangleFlashPolicy was added to make MediaWiki's mangling of anything that might
be a flash policy directive configurable.
