Experiments were curried out with BALB/c mice taking ADAPT-232 forte, a fixed combination of three genuine (native) extracts of Eleutherococcus senticocus, Schisandra chinensis and Rhodiola rosea, characterised for the content of active markers eleutherosides, schisandrins, salidroside, tyrosol and rosavin and in doses of about 30, 90 and 180 mg/kg for seven consecutive days followed by forced swimming test to exhaustion. ADAPT-232 forte strongly augments endurance of mice, increasing the time taken to exhaustion (TTE) in a dose-dependent manner from 3.0±0.5 to 21.1±1.7 min, approximately seven fold. Serum Hsp72 was measured by EIA both in normal and stressful conditions before and after swimming test. Repeated administration of adaptogen dose dependently increases basal level of Hsp72 in serum of mice from 0.8–1.5 to 5.5–6.3 pg/ml.

The pharmaceutical production unit (UPHRARMA) was created to address this issue in Burkina Faso. However, it encounters serious difficulties which could lead to its closure. Objective: The objective of this study is to analyze the determinants of the survival of this production unit. Methods: The method combined a bibliographic review and field survey which consisted of a number of interviews. Results/Discussion: The results showed that the unit has no legal form enabling autonomy in management activities. Its institutional anchor does not allow it to perform its activities as a competitive commercial enterprise. The activities of the unit are trapped by the public procedures of administrative and financial management. In that line, the status of the unit should be revised as a public shareholding company with a legal form allowing financial and management autonomy. Conclusion: Regarding the results, U-PHARAMA is subject to the public administration’s principles such as subordination, dependence and control. The new legal status will allow an autonomy of a public company with adequate management and financing mechanisms. This will encourage funds raising in order to mobilize resources for boosting research and development of new phytomedicines within the health sciences research institute.Save to LibraryDownloadby European Scientific Journal ESJ•  3  Pharmacy, Medicine, PhytomedicineAntiobesity and lipid lowering effects of Glycyrrhiza chalcones: Experimental and computational studiesSave to LibraryDownloadby shikhar gupta•  25  Obesity, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Enzyme InhibitorsIcariin isolated from Epimedium pubescens regulates osteoblasts anabolism through BMP-2, SMAD4, and Cbfa1 expressionSave to LibraryDownloadby Shiow-Yunn Sheu and +1Jui-Sheng Sun•  20  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Flavonoids, Gene expressionCharacterization and biological activity of the main flavonoids from Swiss Chard (Beta vulgaris subspecies cycla)Save to LibraryDownloadby Enrica Biagiotti•  16  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Flavonoids, PhytomedicineCardiovascular effects in vitro of aqueous extract of wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca, L.) leavesSave to LibraryDownloadby Darko Modun and +2Ivana MudnićIvana Generalic•  26  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Flavonoids, PhytomedicineIsolation and biological activity studies of two triterpene glycosides from the leaves and roots of Polyscias fruticosa .Ind.J of Nat.

A phase I clinical study was designed to evaluate the effect on semen quality of healthy males in terms of spermatogenesis and quality of semen. The results of the study revealed no significant negative effect of Kan Jang on male semen quality and fertility, but rather a positive trend with respect to the number of spermatozoids in the whole ejaculate, the percentage of active (normokinetic) forms of spermatozoids, and fertility indexes, together with a decrease in the percentage of inactive (diskinetic) forms of spermatozoids. In the group receiving ginseng, no significant negative effects on the fertility parameters were revealed and there was a clear decrease in the percentage of diskinetic forms of spermatozoids. Subjects receiving valerian showed a temporary increase in the percentage of normokinetic spermatozoids and a decrease in diskinetic forms, but these changes had no effect on fertility indices. The results indicate that Kan Jang, ginseng and valerian are safe with respect to effects on human male sterility when administered at dose levels corresponding to approximately 3 times the human daily dose.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexander Panossian•  24  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Clinical Trial, Plant Biology, FertilityANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF RHIZOME OF SELECTED CURCUMA VARIETYSave to LibraryDownloadby Harit Jha and +1Anand Barapatre•  5  Medicinal Plants, Phytomedicine, Antimicrobial activity, zingiberacea family Curcuma alismatifoliaEffects of carvacrol on defects of ischemia-reperfusion in the rat liverSave to LibraryDownloadby K.

The extract at 46 ± 3 μg/ml displaced 50% of estradiol from ERα and 64 ± 4 μg/ml from ERβ. Treatment of the ER+ hormone-dependent T47D:A18 breast cancer cell line with the extract induced up-regulation of ERβ mRNA. Progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA was upregulated in the Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line. However, chaste-tree berry extract did not induce estrogen-dependent alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity in Ishikawa cells. Bioassay-guided isolation, utilizing ER binding as a monitor, resulted in the isolation of linoleic acid as one possible estrogenic component of the extract. The use of pulsed ultrafiltration liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, which is an affinity-based screening technique, also identified linoleic acid as an ER ligand based on its selective affinity, molecular weight, and retention time. Linoleic acid also stimulated mRNA ERβ expression in T47D:A18 cells, PR expression in Ishikawa cells, but not AP activity in Ishikawa cells. These data suggest that linoleic acid from the fruits of Vitex agnus-castus can bind to estrogen receptors and induce certain estrogen inducible genes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dejan Nikolic•  12  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Phytomedicine, PhytotherapyThe effect of Kan Jang extract on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin in ratsSignificant pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions between various herbal products and warfarin have recently been reported.

The aim of this study was to determine whether concomitant treatment of rats with Kan Jang (a standardized fixed combination of extracts from Andrographis paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus) and warfarin would lead to an alteration in the pharmacological effects of warfarin. Each day for 5 days a group of animals was treated orally with an aqueous solution of Kan Jang at a dose of 17 mg/kg of the active principle andrographolide (a daily dose some 17-fold higher than that recommended for humans): the control group received similar treatment with appropriate volumes of water only. Sixty minutes after the final daily administration of Kan Jang or water, an aqueous solution of warfarin (0.2 mg/ml) was given to each animal at a dose of 2 mg/kg. From each group, 6 animals were sacrificed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30 and 48 h after warfarin administration and blood samples taken. The concentration of warfarin in blood plasma was measured by capillary electrophoresis using 50 mM borate buffer (pH 9.3) as mobile phase with simultaneous detection of warfarin at 208.1 and 307.5 nm. Prothrombin time in blood plasma was measured using thromboplastin reagent. The concomitant application of Kan Jang and warfarin did not produce significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, and practically no effect on its pharmacodynamics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexander Panossian•  22  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Drug interactions, Medicinal PlantsMechanism of the vasodilator effect of Euxanthone in rat small mesenteric arteriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Steyner Cortes•  17  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Calcium, Signal TransductionOenothein B's contribution to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of Epilobium spWillow herb tea or preparation are available and relatively popular in the European market, and claimed to be effective inter alia because of their anti-inflammatory activity.

The present study is therefore aimed at comparing the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of extracts of the three most popular Epilobium species (E. angustifolium, E. hirsutum and E. parviflorum) and at juxtaposing this activity against the dominating compounds from the following extracts: oenothein B (OeB), quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside. The phytochemical analysis of the extracts has shown that OeB quantities vary between 20% and 35%, while flavonoids content does not exceed 2%. All extracts have inhibited the activity of hyaluronidase and lipoxygenase with IC50 around 5 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml. The inhibition of hyaluronidase is related with the presence of OeB, a strong inhibitor of this enzyme (IC50 1.1 μM). Additionally, the extracts inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) release from stimulated neutrophils. OeB inhibited MPO release similarly to the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin with IC50 7.7 μM and 15.4 μM, respectively. Tested extracts significantly reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from f-MLP and PMA induced neutrophils with IC50 5 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml, respectively. The flavonoids content seems to exert little influence on extracts’ activity, contrary to OeB, whose high concentration explains the activity of extract obtained from Epilobium. Tested currently marketed Epilobium preparations are often wrongly assigned, but we should stress that the level of OeB in all tested herbs was high and always exceeded 2% in raw material.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sebastian Granica•  22  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Medicinal Plants, PolandInhibitory effect of andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata on PAF-induced platelet aggregationAndrographolide, an active principle of the Chinese drug Andrographis paniculata, used for prevention and treatment of common cold in Scandinavia and known as an antiinflammatory, antiviral, antithrombotic, hypotensive and... moreAndrographolide, an active principle of the Chinese drug Andrographis paniculata, used for prevention and treatment of common cold in Scandinavia and known as an antiinflammatory, antiviral, antithrombotic, hypotensive and antiatherosclerotic drug, was investigated for its suggested influence on the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and the platelet-activating factor (PAF). Whereas in isolated human polymorphnuclear leukocytes (PMNL) no influence on the biosynthesis was found, it could be shown that andrographolide inhibits PAF-induced human blood platelet aggregation in a dose dependent manner (IC50 ~ 5 μM). These results indicate that andrographolide has a mechanism of action different from that of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and most likely associated with the cardiovascular and antithrombotic activity described of Andrographis paniculata.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alexander Panossian•  9  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Phytomedicine, HumansEffects of tenuiorin and methyl orsellinate from the lichen Peltigera leucophlebia on 5-/15-lipoxygenases and proliferation of malignant cell lines in vitroSave to LibraryDownloadby Helga Ogmundsdottir•  12  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Cell DivisionBalm mint extract (Lo-701) for topical treatment of recurring herpes labialisSave to LibraryDownloadby Rudolf-GIESBERT ALKEN•  4  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Phytomedicine, Double BlindEfficacy of an essentifal oil of Cinnamomum zeylanicum against Psoroptes cuniculiSave to LibraryDownloadby Stefania Perrucci•  5  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Phytomedicine, Essential OilKiefern, Fichte und Eukalyptus: Bäume als AromatikaBeim Stichwort Aromata denkt man unwillkürlich zunächst an Kräuter und kleine Stauden wie Kamille, Thymian oder Fenchel, kaum jemand wird einen Baum an vorderster Stelle nennen.

Hibiscus sabdariffa is a plant known in many countries and is consumed as hot and cold drinks In addition to its use in folk medicine; it has been suggested as treatment for many conditions including hypertension.The objectives of this review were to examine the evidence of effectiveness and safety of hibiscus in the treatment of hypertension.We searched several medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the specialized register of the Cochrane Hypertension Group and the general engine Google) to January 2009.We included randomized controlled trials that had examined Hibiscus's effectiveness and safety in the treatment of primary hypertension in adults. Two authors independently selected the trials for the review, extracted the data, and critically appraised the included studies.Four trials, with a total of 390 patients, met our inclusion criteria. Two studies compared Hibiscus sabdariffa to black tea; one study compared it to captopril and one to lisinopril. The studies found that Hibiscus had greater blood pressure reduction than tea but less than the ACE-inhibitors. However, all studies, except one, were short term and of poor quality with a Jadad scoring of <3 and did not meet international standards.The four randomized controlled studies identified in this review do not provide reliable evidence to support recommending Hibiscus sabdariffa for the treatment of primary hypertension in adults.Save to LibraryDownloadby Wahabi Wahabi•  12  Folk Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Global Health, Plant BiologyStroke therapy in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): prospects for drug discovery and developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Nikolaus Sucher•  19  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Traditional Medicine, Chinese Medicine, Plant BiologyTGR5 potentiates GLP-1 secretion and cause pancreatic islet regeneration in response to Tithonia diversifolia saponin-rich extract in diabetic model miceBackground: Activation of Takeda G-protein bile acid receptor 5 (TGR5) secretes glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) downstream insulin release.

Saponin which has been indicated as the antidiabetic principle in plant shared similar steroidal scaffold with cholic acid (primary agonist of TGR5), hence antidiabetic mechanism of Tithonia diversifolia leaves saponin-rich extract (TDS) was investigated via TGR5/GLP-1 pathway. Methods: Insulin secretion and expression of GLP1 were measured in MIN6 β-cells incubated with TDS and cholic acid a known agonist of TGR5 at (25, 75, 125, 325) µg/ml and treatment were compared to incubation with insulin secretagogue metformin (50 mM). The action of TDS on TGR5 was studied in vivo using swiss albino mice. Results: β-cell assay showed dose dependent increase in insulin secretion/1 × 10 6 cells incubated with TDS (25, 75, 125, 325 µg/ml) when compared with positive control (50 mM metformin) and vehicle control (Cholic acid). TDS increased GLP-1 and insulin expression and decrease the percentage of%HbA1c in treated mice when compared with control (p < 0.05). TGR5 gene were highly expressed in cell incubated with 20-60 mg/kg body weight of TDS compared to STZ-induced diabetic mice and immunoblotting of TGR5 protein showed higher expression in all groups treated with TDS compared to STZ-induced diabetic mice. Conclusion: TDS exhibit its antidiabetic mechanism via TGR5 agonism leading to increase GLP-1 expression and subsequently insulin release. Hence TDS may represent a new therapeutic strategy for type-2 diabetes, a finding which could be further investigated in clinical trials.Save to LibraryDownloadby Oluwamodupe Ejelonu•  3  Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, PhytomedicinePREPARATION AND EVALUATION OF THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND STABILITY PROPERTIES OF THREE HERBAL TEA BLENDS DERIVED FROM FOUR NATIVE HERBSHerbal teas consist of mono and sometimes poly-herbal recipes of herbs with acclaimed health benefits which are often brewed as infusion or decoction.

Three variants of poly-herbal teas containing Herbiscus sabdariffa, Moringa oleifera, Citrus limon, and Zingiber officinale were prepared and evaluated for their physicochemical and stability properties. Intrinsic physicochemical properties that include organoleptic, ash value, pH of brew solutions, extractive matter as well as non-intrinsic properties such as moisture content, flow and particle size of granules and dust leak from teabags were determined. Also, the effects of stressful storage conditions on some physicochemical properties were evaluated. The different tea blends showed remarkable differences in their physicochemical properties. The products also showed discrepancies in stability parameters such as appearance, pH of the brew and antioxidant properties when stored under different conditions. In all, the herbal tea showed good physicochemical and stability properties that are characteristic of a good finished herbal product.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zwanden Sule Yahaya•  3  Phytomedicine, Herbal Tea, Pharmaceutics and PhytomedicineWound healing activity and docking of glycogen-synthase-kinase-3- β-protein with isolated triterpenoid lupeol in ratsA triterpene compound lupeol isolated from petroleum ether extract of leaves of Celastrus paniculatus was screened for wound healing activity (8 mg/ml of 0.2% sodium alginate gel) by excision, incision and dead space wound models on Swiss... moreA triterpene compound lupeol isolated from petroleum ether extract of leaves of Celastrus paniculatus was screened for wound healing activity (8 mg/ml of 0.2% sodium alginate gel) by excision, incision and dead space wound models on Swiss Albino rats (175–225 g). In lupeol treated groups wound healing activity was more significant (17.83±0.48) than the standard skin ointment nitrofurazone (18.33±0.42). Epithelialization of the incision wound was faster with a high rate of wound contraction (571.50±5.07) as compared with the control group. In dead space wound model also the weight of the granulation tissue of the lupeol treated animal was increased indicating increase of collagenation and absence of monocytes.The comparative docking of isolated lupeol molecule and standard drug nitrofurazone to glycogen synthase kinase3-β protein by Wnt signaling pathway also supported the wound healing property of lupeol. The activation domain of GSK3-β consisted of Tyr216, with residues Asn64, Gly65, Ser66, Phe67, Gly68, Val70, Lys85, Leu132, Val135, Asp181 in the active pocket docked with lupeol at the torsional degree of freedom 0.5 units with Lamarckian genetic algorithm showed the inhibition constant of 1.38×10−7. The inhibition constant of nitrofurazone was only 1.35×10−4.Save to LibraryDownloadby santosh karanth•  13  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Wound Healing, Enzyme InhibitorsPharmacological activities of Vitex agnus-castus extracts in vitroSave to LibraryDownloadby Beat Meier•  13  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Plant Biology, Medicinal Plants, PhytomedicineExtract of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs ® 7630) inhibits the interactions of group A-streptococci and host epithelia in vitroSave to LibraryDownloadby Felipe Franz•  25  Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Kinetics, Plant Biology, Fluorescence MicroscopyAllamanda cathartica Linn.
