“Successful people aren’t born that way. They become successful by establishing the habit of doing things unsuccessful people don’t like to do.” ―William Makepeace Thackeray
As you know by now reaching goals or trying to implement new habits and sticking to them long term can be quite challenging.  
Our body and mind are designed to desire the easy way out. The path of least resistance. This is why sticking to new habits for the long term is no easy task.
One of the key factors that separate high achievers and performers, those that are able to reach their goals and make a long-lasting positive change in their lives, is their impressive ability to stick with new habits, no matter what.
Most people believe that you are either born disciplined or you aren't. There is little hope if you are a lazy, unmotivated slob. But how true is this?
Fortunately, even if you currently consider yourself to be the LEAST disciplined person you know of, there is a LOT that you can do to completely turn your life around.
In this book, you’ll discover:
-The profound effects that habits have in our lives and how we can harness their power. -Proven methods to develop willpower from scratch, even if you currently consider yourself to be the most unmotivated, lazy person ever. -A risk-free strategy to deal with the discomfort that separates us from achieving great, long-lasting change. -Discover why bad habits tend to stay in our systems and painless methods to get rid of them for good. -The time that it usually takes for habit transformation to occur and the secret to cut the time drastically. -Key strategies that create a supportive environment that will dramatically increase your chances of success. -How to effectively deal with distractions that tend to sabotage our goals. -The catastrophic effects that not being mentally disciplined can bring to your life and how to avoid ending up in this unwanted situation.
Scientific research has shown that good habits inevitably leads to better academic and life outcomes. It is also directly linked to lower levels of stress, depression, and other mood disorders that plague our society.
Years of studying how our thought patterns work has now made this type of training so easy-to-follow that even the most unmotivated person you know of can turn their life around by using the right roadmap.
So if you want to make sure that you increase your success in all areas of your life and want to have the mental discipline of the elite few, then scroll up and click the “Add to Cart” button now!Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextPersonal GrowthMotivationalOccult & ParanormalLanguageEnglishPublisherPublishdriveRelease dateNov 4, 2020Start your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleZCAuthorZac M.

Learning self-discipline is something that pretty much anyone can do, but why are so few actually able to master it? Mental discipline often feels like you are waging war against yourself. If you’ve tried changing your habits before with little success, you probably know this feeling very well. You probably have a few things that could be improved in your daily life and are already aware that some degree of mental discipline is necessary to achieve positive, long-lasting change. Mental discipline influences many aspects of our lives, such as health, finances, relationships, success, and more. It is responsible for overcoming impulses and for acting according to conscious decisions. As such, having good mental discipline gives you the ability to live life according to your conscious will. In contrast, not having mental discipline can result in a troubled existence and countless of wasted hours, days, and even years. Each bad decision that we make in our lives comes with an immediate positive reward in the form of junk food, entertainment or expensive things. Whenever you make a bad decision and experience any of those temporary rewards, they reinforce your desires, and before you know it you’ve got a set of new bad habits that are daily working against you and what you wish to achieve. Eventually, these habits become second nature, and it can be extremely difficult to stop and think about the impact that they are causing on your present and future. Whether you want to start your own company, improve your health, or stop watching time wasting videos online, self discipline is an incredibly useful skill that will help you remain focused, motivated and clear headed on your objectives. The advantages of having good mental discipline are numerous and they span so many aspects of your life from your career to your relationships. Here’s a list of quick reasons why building this skill is worth your time. Enables goal-directed actions Helps manage stress and fatigue Supports smart choices and good habits Maintains a healthy body and mind Improves relationships with others Can lead to happier relationships Gives leadership qualities Gives strength to pursue what matters to you Organizes your behavior Helps control impulses Helps in solving problems Helps you become more resilient against failures and challenges Keeps you calm in difficult situations On the other hand, what happens when someone lacks mental discipline? Here are some of the most common effects of lacking in this area: Being controlled by impulses and distractions Low self-confidence and self-esteem Have trouble handling frustration and stress Indecision or making bad decisions Procrastination Can lead to risky behaviors, substance abuse, or mental disorders Problems with school, work, finances, health, relationships, etc. Becoming unsuccessful in general Mental discipline is a complicated subject that is best studied in parts. The main components of using it are as follows: A clear goal and a strong motivation for change Monitoring one’s own behavior towards that goal Using willpower to guide one’s decisions and actions What exactly is the secret of building mental-discipline? If you’ve watched enough movies, you’re probably thinking that the only way to develop unbreakable self-discipline is to meditate at the top of a mountain or to wax an old man’s car for hours on end. Those images, although entertaining, are highly inaccurate and don’t really make sense for those that truly want to make positive change in their lives. Studies about mental discipline are ongoing, and people’s understanding of it changes as more information is discovered. This book gives updated knowledge and tried-and-tested techniques that will help you develop (and maintain) the mental discipline that makes you achieve your goals in life. By understanding exactly how mental discipline works, we can dissect it in manageable parts so that we can eventually master it and use it as the powerful tool it is. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the journey! Chapter 1: Discipline and Our Biology What is Mental Discipline? Mental discipline is also known as self-control, willpower, resolve, and determination. As the word discipline implies, it is the ability to resist short term gratification to meet long-term objectives. It enables people to control their attention, desires, thoughts, and emotions to accomplish what they want. In other words, it aligns one’s actions with one’s goals. The Biology of Mental Discipline Like with other skills, willpower may have evolved in response to experiences. Scholars theorize that humans developed willpower to enable them to survive by making difficult choices and sacrificing immediate pleasures for the sake of more important long-term goals. In particular, self-control may have developed to enable a person to fit in a group and keep long-term relationships with other group members. Those who gave in to their impulses were shunned by other humans and were forced to have a harder life compared to those who can regulate their impulses well. Since being accepted in a group increased an individual’s chance of survival, the ability to regulate ones actions and impulses may have passed on through the generations. Like with most inherited skills, self-control varies among individuals, with some being more disciplined than others. The brain’s prefrontal cortex is a relatively new development in human evolution. It is said to be the seat of willpower. It gave people the ability to control what they think about, how they feel, and what they do, and allows them to do difficult tasks. Brain studies show that people with high self-control have a more active prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain that controls executive functions), while those with low self-control showed more activity in the ventral striatum (the brain region that processes rewards and desires). Things that weaken the brain’s prefrontal cortex also weaken willpower: Sleep deprivation Alcohol intoxication Stress Illnesses Distractions Successful mental discipline involves knowing which factors can decrease your willpower and dealing with them effectively so they won’t cause significant problems at some point. Self-Discipline vs. Alarm Systems When a threat is detected, the amygdala in the brain transmits signals that activate adrenaline, which in turn activates the cardiovascular system and releases sugars and fats from the liver into the blood. The result of this is more energy is provided into the muscles, allowing a person to fight or flee from the danger. Another effect of the alarm system is it reduces the activity of the prefrontal cortex to prevent the person from overthinking. Because the situation requires immediate action, thought is discouraged. This automatic system manages the limited energy of the body and mind and directs it towards where it matters the most - for survival or keeping the body safe. The problem is, imagined or illusory threats also affect thought and attention. Thankfully, humans have developed newer brain regions that enable us to control our urges better. In particular, the upper left part of the prefrontal cortex lets us strategize and stick to tasks even if they are difficult or tedious. It gives us the will to do things we would otherwise evade. The right prefrontal cortex helps us resist cravings and impulses. It allows us to say no, even if instincts compel us to say yes. The lower middle prefrontal cortex tracks our objectives and desires, remembers what we want, and decides what we will want. It is responsible for desires and drives. The more active it is, the more motivated we feel about going after our goals or resist temptations. To counteract the alarm system, you must realize what the threat you’re dealing with is. If there is no actual danger, it’s not necessary to allow your instincts to take over and go into fight-flight mode or to instant gratification mode. You should stop, move more slowly, and plan how to respond instead. Aside from controlling responses, the brain’s prefrontal cortex keeps track of your bodily sensations, feelings, and thoughts. It can also redirect the energy from your physical body back into your mind. By relaxing more, you tell your brain that there is no danger so that it can deactivate the alarm responses. Take deep breaths to make your heart slow down and to reduce your blood pressure. Relax your muscles and take a comfortable position. Based on laboratory studies, heart rate variability exerts an effect on self-discipline. Higher heart rate variability helps a person deal with stress better, delay gratification, and ignore distractions. Our heart rate increases when we inhale and slows down when we exhale. The difference between heart rates contributes to its variability. When the heart rate increases, the heart rate variability decreases. Low heart rate variability affects our self-control by often reducing it. This is because a pounding heart and high blood pressure are results of an activated alarm system. –––––––– Stress and certain emotions such as anger or anxiety, keep the heart rate stuck at high levels. Because of this, stress reduction and emotional regulation improve self-control. Our Two Selves You have two selves: the impulsive self that is dedicated to short term affairs and the rational self that is concerned with long term affairs.  The short term self is the part of you that seeks instant pleasure, to stay in your comfort zone, and do things the easy way despite the negative long term consequences. Emotions and urges are two main factors that drive the short-term self as it is responsible for rapid, reflexive actions. The short term self cares only about the present moment. It is quite short-sighted, but it is useful in getting some of your needs met and making you avoid danger. The long term self has a bigger perspective. It is reflective and incorporates knowledge about goals, actions, feelings, and sensations to make decisions. This long term self is willing to make sacrifices for the sake of attaining a better reward later on. Unlike the short term self, it comprehends that there’s a future, and it understands that what you do now can affect you later on. Self-regulation is more suited to the long term self than the short term self. Because of this, you must prioritize the long term self. Doing this can be quite challenging, but it is doable. Understand that your impulsive self is by default stronger than your rational self because of several reasons: The former is the result of old brain structures while the latter is the product of the neocortex, which is a new development The former is designed to fight for your survival, so it is compelling. It forces you to do things without having to think about it. The subconscious mind is in charge of emotions and habit formation, and it does not understand the concept of the future. The conscious mind can come up with excuses and distract itself from making difficult decisions. The brain conserves energy, so if something was beneficial or has worked in the past, it will merely repeat that. Changing behaviors involve risk and uncertainty so it will naturally resist attempts to break habits and instill new ones at first. Since the basal ganglia are the brain part that records patterns without using conscious awareness, it means that patterns get stored regardless of whether it is helpful or harmful. Although we are still stuck with primitive brains, we also have developed ways that enable us to overcome our instincts, consider whether an action is beneficial or not, and consider long term consequences. We have the biology for it, but it’s up to us whether we make good use of it or not. Some tips for prioritizing the rational self: Recognize whenever your short term-focused self is competing with your long-term focused self. Be aware of when you are making a decision that requires your willpower. If you don’t, your brain will default to the most comfortable thing. Know the benefits of what you want to achieve. Write them down and continue adding to them to gain the cooperation of the reward-seeking self. Review them to stay on track. The Executive Self The Executive Self is the part of you that mediates the short term and the long term self. It balances short term wants and needs with long term objectives. You must develop this Self if you want to be self-disciplined. By developing the executive self we receive multiple benefits. We allocate time to consider short term and long term costs/benefits of engaging in something or aspiring to a goal. Consider the costs and benefits of not implementing the goal. More importantly, we can realize that the gains outweigh the costs and that our time is better spent elsewhere. Take advantage of loss aversion, or the natural tendency to dislike losses. Whenever you become tempted to do something that goes against your long-term interests, frame the decision as giving up the best long-term reward for the immediate reward. Imagine that you already have the long term reward. How is it like to experience the benefits of your good decision? Ask yourself whether you are willing to let go of that for the sake of fleeting gratification. Before doing something, think about what you won’t be able to do. For instance, Do you really want to go out even if it means having less time to study for that critical test tomorrow? You could have fun some other time, but you could only take that test once. Before saying yes to something, think about what you are saying no to, and vice versa. When you say yes to smoking, you’re saying no to healthier lungs, and more money in your pocket. Saying yes may seem like a good idea if you don’t consider what you’re neglecting. The way you describe the situation in your mind affects your responses towards it. Control your labels to control your actions. Physical Factors Influencing Willpower Let’s take a closer look at some of the most common things that we are exposed to on a daily basis that can affect willpower: a. Alcohol Alcohol causes people to be more impulsive. Try to cut your alcohol intake, especially if you are about to make critical decisions. There is a reason why it has become a common thing to blame things on alcohol; it greatly hinders our ability to reason appropriately and affects our decision-making process to a significant degree. b. Stress Excessive stress is terrible for our overall health because it diverts from taking care of the body into more urgent needs. Stress and stressful emotions such as anger, anxiety, and depression make it difficult for the brain to support mental discipline. Seek therapy if you have issues that are hard for you to manage alone. Managing Stress Disciplining yourself is stressful as compared to simply giving in to what is easy or pleasurable. Reducing stress greatly helps in being more disciplined. It also improves the quality of our lives in general. Stress reduces self-control; thus you must find healthy ways to reduce stress. The basic stress relief measures are as follows: Exercising Sports Listening to music Reading Spending time with loved ones Getting a massage Walking outside Meditating Engaging in a hobby Praying/Attending religious service None of the above is groundbreaking advice, but they all are known for being very effective at reducing our levels of stress. Make sure that the strategy you use is really relaxing. Some people take vacations to relax but end up getting stressed. Some paint or play music to de-stress but others get worked up in creating good pieces of art that they don’t relax much. On the other hand, doing chores may be paradoxically relaxing for some individuals. Indulging in harmful habits or cravings is often a way to relieve stress. Plan what to do so that you will do something that is genuinely stress-relieving instead of going after something Enjoying the preview?Subscribe to continue readingStart your free  daysPage 1 of 1HomeEbooksPersonal GrowthFooter menuBack to topAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAboutAbout ScribdPressOur blogJoin our team!Contact usInvite friendsGiftsScribd for enterpriseLegalTermsPrivacyCopyrightDo not sell or share my personal informationSupportHelp / FAQAccessibilityPurchase helpAdChoicesPublishersSocialInstagram InstagramTwitter TwitterFacebook FacebookPinterest PinterestGet our free appsAudiobooksBooksDocumentsMagazinesPodcastsSheet musicLanguage:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.Language:English close menuEnglish(selected)EspañolPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisРусскийItalianoRomânăBahasa IndonesiaLearn moreCopyright © 2023 Scribd Inc.
