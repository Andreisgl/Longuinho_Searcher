It drew ideas from a wide variety of traditions in linguistics, logic, and computer science. Its chief architects were Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag, and its most direct precursors were Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar and Head Grammar. The theory has been applied in the construction of computational systems for the analysis of a variety of languages; a few of these systems have been used in practical applications. This chapter sketches the history of the development and application of the theory.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper presents a detailed, movement-free account of the English Auxiliary System within Sign-Based Construction Grammar (Sag 2010, Michaelis 2011, Boas & Sag 2012) that utilizes techniques of lexicalist and construction-based analysis. The resulting conception of linguistic knowledge involves constraints that license hierarchical structures directly (as in context-free grammar), rather than by appeal to mappings over such structures. This allows English auxiliaries to be modeled as a class of verbs whose behavior is governed by general and class-specific constraints. Central to this account is a novel use of the feature aux, which is set both constructionally and lexically, allowing for a complex interplay between various grammatical constraints that captures a wide range of excepti...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Remarks on grammatical weightLanguage Variation and Change,  1997ABSTRACTLong, complex phrases tend to come at the ends of clauses; this is called “endweight.” A ... more ABSTRACTLong, complex phrases tend to come at the ends of clauses; this is called “endweight.” A variety of characterizations of weight have been proposed in the literature, but none has been sufficient to cover the full range of attested cases of end-weight. Corpus data on heavy NP shift, the dative alternation, and particle movement indicate that there are several structural measures of weight that are highly correlated with constituent ordering. Proposed explanations for endweight have been based on parsing considerations, largely ignoring the speaker; but what facilitates parsing does not always help in production. Examination of phenomena where these interests do not coincide indicates that the demands of sentence planning provide a better explanation for end-weight than parsing. Finally, accounts of end-weight cannot be purely structure-based, but must take lexical factors into consideration.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Speakers employ fine-grained probabilistic knowledgeby Robin J Melnick, T. Florian Jaeger, and Thomas  Wasow85th Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America,  2011Tests of readers’ judgments regarding optional ‘that’ introducing relative and complement clauses... more Tests of readers’ judgments regarding optional ‘that’ introducing relative and complement clauses provide evidence that fine-grained probabilistic knowledge is involved in such judgments and is arguably part of linguistic competence. Previous studies argue that probabilistic factors involved in production also influence judgment, but the predictive models involved here turn most significantly on the highly gradient predictability of an embedded clause. Lab tests were also replicated with crowdsourced populations with significantly correlated results. These results suggest that competence grammar includes not only some degree of probabilistic information, as suggested by prior work, but even access to rather fine-grained probability distributions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
