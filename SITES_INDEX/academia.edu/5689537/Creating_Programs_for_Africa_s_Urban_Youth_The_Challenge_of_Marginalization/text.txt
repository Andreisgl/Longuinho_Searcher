Sub-Saharan Africa’s youth population growth rate is the highest of any world region (North Africa’s rate is also high). In addition, Africa’s urban growth rate is the world’s highest. Taken together, the need to provide adequate, effective support for urban youth is critical to fostering Africa’s development – and its political, social and economic stability. This article is designed to help address this need in two ways. First, it focuses attention on those comprising the overwhelming majority of this population, urban youth who are poor and marginalized. Second, drawing largely on the author’s extensive professional experience with African urban youth, the article reviews the major challenges this population faces; considers the programming context for Africa’s urban youth; reviews six principles for developing programs for them; provides field-based insights on improving the assessment, monitoring and evaluation of urban youth programming; and suggest ways to enhance the inclusion of female youth in programs. The article concludes with a consideration of the particular challenge of marginalization in meeting the needs of Africa’s huge urban youth population, and a call to respond to this challenge with youth centered policy reforms and investments.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBasic Education and Policy Support (BEPS) Activity and Creative Associates InternationalUrbanization, War, and Africa’s Youth at Risk: Understanding and Addressing Future Challenges2003 • Marc SommersThis paper argues that the wealth of youthful residents in African cities constitute a largely untapped resource for ingenuity, stability, and economic growth. It will present some commonly held perspectives on Africa’s cities, and the urban youth who have come to demographically dominate them. The paper will then look at the lives of African urban youth, particularly those who have been affected by conflict, and why they are so attracted to city life. At the core of this analysis is the central irony surrounding urban youth: that they are a demographic majority that sees itself as an outcast minority. The final section will suggest ways in which programming for youth at risk in African cities might be improved to help transform how urban youth are perceived, engaged, and ultimately included in urban Africa’s civil societies and economiesDownload Free PDFView PDFVienna: United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)West Africa’s Youth Employment Challenge: The Case of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire2007 • Marc SommersThis report examines the large and complex youth employment challenge in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire, where there is an “urgent need to create employment for 4.5 million youth” and where over half of all youth lack proper work. Mindful that much of the region’s youth cohort is restive and unemployed, Liberia’s ‘rebel behaviour’ and ex-combatant youth among them, the report will also consider the implications of providing ‘productive and decent work’ for youth; that is, work that promises to put youth on the road towards acquiring respect and professional development as well as compensation. The report will conclude with a description of an employment programme for some of the region’s most marginalized and overlooked: poor, unemployed urban youth.Download Free PDFView PDFEmbracing the Margins: Working with Youth amidst War and InsecurityMarc SommersWhile there is no question that growing proportions of youth in unstable societies should be a priority concern, government and international policies may unintentionally be making the youth challenge worse. Youth are seen as dangerous in part because governments and international actors have misunderstood them and set youth priorities aside. Viewing young people through the youth bulge lens, moreover, unnecessarily fuels fearful connections between youth in certain areas of the world and terrorism. This paper will argue that the perceived threat of youth to society is distorted and must be reassessed. It will first situate the youth bulge thesis in context, consider current policies that may be further marginalizing youth, review the central tenants of known marginalized youth views, and conclude with recommendations aimed at reversing counterproductive policies and positively engaging youth to advance new policy directions. This is a Discussion Paper prepared for the 2006 Brookings Blum Roundtable in August 2006.Download Free PDFView PDFPromundo-USYouth and the Field of Countering Violent Extremism2019 • Marc SommersMost youth are peaceful. Even if the field known as “countering violent extremism” (CVE) did not exist, most young people still would not join a violent extremist organization (VEO). At the same time, the overwhelming majority of people who become violent extremists are youth — most of whom are male. The challenge at the center of CVE is thus an unusual one: identifying the fraction of youth populations most likely to enter a VEO and thwarting that option. This paper investigates that challenge, with analysis featuring interviews with 21 experts and over 400 publications on violent extremism, CVE, and youth. Two correlations inform this work: the direct relationship between nations with “youth bulge” populations and state repression, and the connection between state repression and increased violent extremism, with repressive states usually targeting male youth.Download Free PDFView PDFYOUTH EXPLOSION IN DEVELOPING WORLD CITIESUrban Myths and Street Children in Russia: Coping with Cultural and Environmental Hazards2003 • Clementine FujimuraDownload Free PDFView PDFIn "Youth in Developing World Cities." Washington: Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Youth, War, and Urban Africa: Challenges, Misunderstandings, and Opportunities2003 • Marc SommersThis chapter first attempts to contrast some commonly held perspectives on Africa’s cities and the urban youth who have come to demographically dominate them with a look at how urban youth live in large African cities, particularly those who have been affected by conflict. The chapter then uses these contrasting views of African cities and urban youth to suggest how the challenge of youth unemployment in war-affected African cities might be better addressed.Download Free PDFView PDFEnvironment & Urbanization (Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 317-332)Urban Youth in Africa2010 • Marc SommersIt is widely assumed that most Africans reside in rural areas, that African cities make little economic sense and are unusually violent because so many unemployed young men live there, and that urban migrant youth can be drawn back to their former rural homes. This paper challenges all of these assumptions. In the process, it reviews dominant trends in Africa’s rapid urban expansion and examines what life is like for urban youth. I will argue that African cities are underserved and fiercely competitive economic environments that are negatively impacted by neoliberal development policies. Urban youth life tends to take place in worlds that are largely separate from the rest of society. The pressures and dangers facing male and female youth can be extreme, yet at the same time African cities are exceptionally stimulating places that provide opportunities for re-invention for many urban youth. The paper ends with recommendations for addressing the needs of the marginalized majority of Africa’s urban youth more effectively. Its primary focus is urban areas in the region of sub-Saharan Africa.Download Free PDFView PDFYOUTH EXPLOSION IN DEVELOPING WORLD CITIESCaroline FawcettDownload Free PDFView PDFToo Poor for Peace?
