To date archaeology, archaeozoology and genetics have shed light on when and where all of our major livestock species were domesticated. Phenotypic changes associated with domestication have occurred in all farm animals. Coat colour is one of the traits that have been subjected to the strongest human selection throughout history. Here we use genotyping of coat colour SNPs in horses to investigate whether there were any regional differences or preferences for specific colours associated with specific cultural traditions in Iron Age Sweden. We do this by identifying the sex and coat colour of horses sacrificed at Skedemosse, Öland (Sweden) during the Iron Age, as well as in horses from two sites in Uppland, Ultuna and Valsgärde (dated to late Iron Age). We show that bay, black and chestnut colours were all common and two horses with tobiano spotting were found.

The system, here referred to as that of free-roaming horses (Sw. utegångshästar), are still in use in several parts of the world and known from historic Scandinavian sources. The idea of the free-roaming horse system is to keep a surplus of horses under natural conditions, which means that the animals are left to themselves during the major part of the year, and in most cases, their lives. The systems leaves few, if any, traces in the archaeological record, but different sources indicate that there are many horses hidden behind the few stalls in Iron Age byres. However, there is ample evidence in archaeological and written sources that, when put together and illuminated by modern examples from different cultures, provide fruitful information about how great men and women kept their horses c. 1500 years ago.1 The Scandinavian Iron Age This article mainly deals ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The horse equipment is put into its equestrian context. What do the artefacts tell us about the riding they were once made for? The 5th century AD was turbulent and the old Roman values were challenged by riders from the east. Where did the Sösdala riders get their equestrian influences from? The Sösdala saddles and bridles are discussed from a rider’s perspective, with emphasis on function and the impact on the horse caused by the pieces of equipment.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We show that bay, black and chestnut colours were all common and two horses with tobiano spotting were found. We also show how the combination of sex identification with genotyping of just a few SNPs underlying the basic coat colours can be used to identify the minimum number of individuals at a site on a higher level than morphological methods alone. Although separated by 500 km and from significantly different archaeological contexts the horses at Skedemosse and Ultuna are quite homogenous when it comes to coat colour phenotypes, indicating that there were no clear geographical variation in coat colouration in Sweden during the late Iron Age and early Viking Age.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
