Rock group Led Zeppelin to reunite
   By Richard Alleyne    12 September 2007 • 10:51am 
 
 
 
  
 
 The group disbanded 27 years ago
 
 Their wild hair may be thinner and their snake hips lost to middle-age spread but the news that Led Zeppelin are to reform for a one-off concert sparked the biggest scramble for tickets in rock history. 
  Have your say: Will you be buying tickets to see Led Zeppelin?

  Led Zeppelin's place in the rock pantheon  
The British band, who have sold more than 200 million albums, will play together for the first time in 19 years at London’s O2 arena in November.
 
 
  
 
 The group disbanded 27 years ago
 But with just 23,000 tickets on sale, albeit at £125 each, demand for seats is anticipated to be so high that the organisers have been forced to sell them by ballot.
Led Zeppelin’s mix of blues, folk and rock brought them huge success, particularly with their most famous song Stairway to Heaven, but they split in 1980 after drummer John Bonham choked to death during a drinking binge.
Since then guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones have only performed together twice.
They will headline a tribute concert to Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of Atlantic Records, who died last year.
Money raised from ticket sales will go to a music charity he formed.
Fans wanting tickets should register at www.ahmettribute.com. Names will be chosen at random.
 The Godfathers fo Rock: 
- Led Zeppelin never released a single, preferring the long play album.
- Their name is said to have been inspired by Keith Moon, the late drummer for The Who. He was originally going to play in the group and joked they would go down like a "lead balloon". The "a" was left out of "Led" so that Americans would not mispronounce it.
 - The band would hire entire floors of hotels and go on drunken rampages. In one incident John Bonham threw a number of televisions out the windows of the Continental Hyatt House hotel in Los Angeles, sparking a rock n' roll cliche.
- A version of Whole Lotta Love was the theme tune to Top of the Pops.
 - Bonham’s drum solos at concerts could last up to 30 minutes, during which time the others would leave the stage. His drumming was so ferocious that he often broke his sticks and continued playing with his hands.
- Stairway To Heaven is the biggest-selling piece of sheet music in rock history. Over a million copies have been sold.
