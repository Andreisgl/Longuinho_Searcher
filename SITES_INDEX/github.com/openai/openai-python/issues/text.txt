Bumping this; seeing the same issue (notebook in a Colab environment, Python 3.9). I had to revert to 0.27.0 as well in order to install.
Edit: typo

Thanks everyone for reporting!
You can work around by running pip install aiohttp requests tqdm typing_extensions before attempting to install openai
The issue seems to be that we dynamically get the version for the package from 
openai-python/setup.cfg
         Line 3
      in
      9442840
 version = attr: openai.version.VERSION 
But in order to import openai.version, the runtime dependencies of openai need to be build dependencies of openai.
We should fix by a) shipping wheels, b) maybe just hardcoding the version in setup.cfg.
Here's a repro:
Œª rm -rf env
Œª python3.9 -m venv env
Œª env/bin/pip freeze --all                         
pip==21.2.4
setuptools==58.1.0
Œª env/bin/pip install openai==0.27.1 --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation
I haven't looked into why it works for me with build isolation. Edit: possibly due to different setuptools version

Seeing the same issue in Colab still. The recommended fix above worked for me.

v0.27.2 is out and passes @hauntsaninja 's replication. That should fix this issue
