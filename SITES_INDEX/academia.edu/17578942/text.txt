Most interleukin 1-immunoreactive glia in Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease were classified as microglia. The number of interleukin 1 immunoreactive neurons did not appear to differ in Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease compared with control brain. Numerous temporal lobe astrocytes in Alzheimer disease and postnatal Down syndrome were intensely interleukin 1-, S-100-, and glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive and had reactive structure. Interleukin 1 levels in Alzheimer disease temporal lobe homogenates were elevated, as were the levels of S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, two proteins reportedly elevated in reactive astrocytes. These data suggest that increased...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papersthe brainClemen Mosco RubioThe brainDownload Free PDFView PDFBrain ResearchAmyloid-β peptide activates cultured astrocytes: morphological alterations, cytokine induction and nitric oxide release1998 • Grant KrafftDownload Free PDFView PDFNeurobiology of DiseaseRole of metallothionein-III following central nervous system damage2003 • juan hidalgoDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroscienceAltered expression of apolipoprotein E, amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 is associated with chronic reactive gliosis in rat cortical tissue2001 • Kevin TaddeiDownload Free PDFView PDFNeuroscienceNitric oxide in the cerebral cortex of amyloid-precursor protein (SW) Tg2576 transgenic mice2004 • Ricardo MartínezDownload Free PDFView PDFMicroscopy Research and TechniqueS100B in brain damage and neurodegeneration2003 • Volker AroltDownload Free PDFView PDFBritish journal of pharmacologyCannabidiol in vivo blunts beta-amyloid induced neuroinflammation by suppressing IL-1beta and iNOS expression2007 • Caterina  ScuderiPharmacological inhibition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive gliosis may represent a novel rationale to develop drugs able to blunt neuronal damage and slow the course of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychotropic natural cannabinoid, exerts in vitro a combination of neuroprotective effects in different models of Abeta neurotoxicity. The present study, performed in a mouse model of AD-related neuroinflammation, was aimed at confirming in vivo the previously reported antiinflammatory properties of CBD. Mice were inoculated with human Abeta (1-42) peptide into the right dorsal hippocampus, and treated daily with vehicle or CBD (2.5 or 10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) for 7 days. mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed by in situ hybridization. Protein expression of GFAP, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-1beta was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, ELISA assay of IL-1beta level and the measurement of NO we...Download Free PDFView PDFNeuropeptidesAminoguanidine treatment ameliorates inflammatory responses and memory impairment induced by amyloid-beta 25–35 injection in rats2014 • jorge guevaraDownload Free PDFView PDFNeurobiology of Disease Sustained Interleukin-1 Overexpression Exacerbates Tau Pathology Despite Reduced Amyloid Burden in an Alzheimer's Mouse ModelSimi Ghosh, Kerry O'BanionNeuroinflammation is an important component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and has been implicated in neurodegenera-tion. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a potent inflammatory cytokine in the CNS, is chronically upregulated in human AD and believed to serve as part of a vicious inflammatory cycle that drives AD pathology. To further understand the role of IL-1 in AD pathogenesis, we used an inducible model of sustained IL-1 overexpression (IL-1 XAT) developed in our laboratory. The triple transgenic mouse model of AD, which develops plaques and tangles later in its life cycle, was bred with IL-1 XAT mice, and effects of IL-1 overexpression on AD pathology were assessed in F1 progeny. After 1 and 3 months of transgene expression, we found robust increases in tau phosphorylation despite an 70 – 80% reduction in amyloid load and fourfold to sixfold increase in plaque-associated microglia, as well as evidence of greater microglial activation at the site of inflammation. We also found evidence of increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity, which are believed to contribute to tau phosphorylation. Thus, neuroinflammation regulates amyloid and tau pathology in opposing ways, suggesting that it provides a link between amyloid accumulation and changes in tau and raising concerns about the use of immunomodulatory therapies in AD.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of aging researchA novel mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with chronic estrogen deficiency leads to glial cell activation and hypertrophy2011 • Dusica MaysingerThe role of estrogens in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) involving β-amyloid (Aβ) generation and plaque formation was mostly tested in ovariectomized mice with or without APP mutations. The aim of the present study was to explore the abnormalities of neural cells in a novel mouse model of AD with chronic estrogen deficiency. These chimeric mice exhibit a total FSH-R knockout (FORKO) and carry two transgenes, one expressing the β-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw, Swedish mutation) and the other expressing presenilin-1 lacking exon 9 (PS1Δ9). The most prominent changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of these hypoestrogenic mice were marked hypertrophy of both cortical neurons and astrocytes and an increased number of activated microglia. There were no significant differences in the number of Aβ plaques although they appeared less compacted and larger than those in APPsw/PS1Δ9 control mice. Similar glia abnormalities were obtained in wild-type primary cortical neural cultures trea...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
