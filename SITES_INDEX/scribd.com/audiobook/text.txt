I was not super impressed with this one.. Then I realized it is a YA Thriller. I’m used to Adult Horror. This was to PG for me. Read morebrooke nowakRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5So so good! I couldn’t stop listening. I didn’t see the ending coming and the author did a great job of making each person seem like the culprit that I was positive until the very end when it was announced. Very intense and suspensefulRead moreMC ChronisterRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5I've been excited to read this book for a while now.  It was a very interesting premise and I just knew it was right up my alley.  I'm torn between a 3.5 rating and a 4.  I thought it was very well written and Natalie D. Richards definitely knows how to keep you guessing because the entire time I kept going back and forth between who I thought was the "bad guy".  In reality other than Mira all of the characters do some really shady and bad things in this book.  The only reason I did not give this a higher rating is because of the fact that there were somethings that happened in the book that are never addressed again and they really should have been.Read moreBeckyRating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5This book had a lot of hype but it was actually quite boring.  Too few scenes and too little character development …snooze alert Read moreReathaP_171707797Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I actually purchased the book from Barnes and Noble and read it in its entirety.  It was a great read.  Although the ending was a bit uneventful, it was a great imagination challenging (the purpose of letters sprinkled throughout the script) piece of work.Read morePenny DannerRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Eh, it's not bad but it's not No Exit.

The hook is just good enough to keep your attention throughout the story. This is a young adult thriller, with some gore-ish depictions throughout but I would say it’s a pretty enjoyable book. Especially for those more inclined to true crime and mysteries. I was actually very surprised by the ending, totally buying into the character’s mindset throughout the book (well with a few exceptions).The story follows a teenage girl trying to make it home to her mother on Christmas Eve when the last leg of her flight is cancelled. She decides to hitch a ride home with four strangers after the girl she sat next to on the plane offers her a spot for free. (BTW there is mention of turbulence but no plane crash.) The weather gets increasingly worse throughout the book, and Mira’s nerves are making her increasingly antsy because she feels like someone is watching her, and he is. There are letters written to Mira from the stalker’s perspective throughout the book. Along the ride, mishaps continue and violence ensues. There are car accidents, theft, drug abuse and addiction, and death. In one scene, an unfortunate incident involves running a young man over, it is unknown if he survived. Another man chases the car full of strangers around, toting a gun and threatening them, which leaves them with an ominous feeling, There are a few scenes that take place in hospitals but none are gruesome or overbearing. The final chapters of the book may be disturbing to some readers, as they involve death, stalking, violence, and drug use. In the end, Mira learns to listen to what her Father told her on the phone: Always trust your gut.im rating this a 4.5 because it is a great thrill read but did include some disturbing content that may not be well-suited for teens. I think if death and injuries make you queasy this book may not be for you, I’d be happy to recommend a less gruesome thriller for you, just let me know! This book was a fun read, but not worth a purchase for me, a one and done for sure.Read moreAlexandra Jane WelcomeRating: 1 out of 5 stars1/5Cringy. I predicted the villain very early on. It was also very different from what I was expecting. Not as isolating as I felt it was advertised. Maybe if you are into mellow mysteries and you like YA a lot, you could enjoy it. I am just used to and prefer more mature, intense, unpredictable stories.Read moreAmandaRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5This book was ok... could have been worse could have been better.  I wish there would have been a bit more excitement/things happening. It was more or less strangers driving and silly decisions being made but nothing really happens until the end and it wasn't too crazy. I expected it to be a bit more thrilling from the title.
