Adults feed on ash foliage and lay eggs in bark crevices or between bark layers. Eclosing larvae bore into the bark and feed on ash phloem, and tunneling by high numbers of larvae results in girdling and death of trees. Ash saplings can die after a year of infestation while large trees may die within 3-4 years . Since the discovery of EAB in 2002 near Detroit, Michigan, it has spread to contiguous areas of the United States and Canada. Due to the transport of infested ash firewood or nursery stock, however, infestations are now known as far east as Maryland and as far west as Minnesota. As of May 2007, infested areas in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Ontario exceeded 103,600 km 2 , and over 30 million ash trees had been killed in Michigan alone (http://www.emeraldashborer.info).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCastrillo et al 2008Luz María Escobar LópezDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Invertebrate PathologyCharacterization and virulence of Beauveria spp. recovered from emerald ash borer in southwestern Ontario, Canada2012 • Peter KrellDownload Free PDFView PDFBiocontrolIsolation and characterization of entomopathogenic fungi from hazelnut-growing region of Turkey2010 • Kees Van FrankenhuyzenAlthough Turkey is the first among all hazelnut-producing countries, yield per unit area of this crop is low in comparison to other countries, mainly because many insect species seriously damage hazelnut trees and their fruit.

Isolates were identified using morphological characters and by sequencing the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA gene and partial β-tubulin gene. Phylogenetic analysis and constructed trees based on the ITS and β-tubulin gene explicitly confirm isolates L66B, SY17-a and LHY46-a as Isaria farinosa and B3A, B59A and SY45B-a as Purpureocillium lilacinum. Pathogenicity was tested in the laboratory against adult EAB using a single concentration (2.0×107 conidia/ml) applied topically to adults. Controls included three commercial isolates: Isaria fumosorosea LRC176, Metarhizium brunneum LRC187 and Beauveria bassiana strain GHA. The native isolates I. farinosa L66B and P. lilacinum SY45B-a killed 75 and 50% of the beetles 14 days post-inoculation. Although these indigenous entomogenous fungi were less virulent compared with the commercial isolates, yearly isolation from EAB populations suggests they are one of the natural mortality factors of EAB in Canada.Download Free PDFView PDFUse of entomopathogens against invasive wood boring beetles in North AmericaAnn HajekDownload Free PDFView PDFField Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate PathologyMicrobial control of wood-boring insects attacking forest and shade trees2007 • Ann HajekDownload Free PDFView PDFBioControlPopulation responses of hymenopteran parasitoids to the emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in recently invaded areas in north central United States2012 • Leah BauerDownload Free PDFView PDFForestsProgress and Challenges of Protecting North American Ash Trees from the Emerald Ash Borer Using Biological ControlJian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFPopulation responses of hymenopteran parasitoids to the emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Bupresitidae) in recently invaded areas in north central United States2012 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFControl of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, in North America since 1878Ann HajekDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
