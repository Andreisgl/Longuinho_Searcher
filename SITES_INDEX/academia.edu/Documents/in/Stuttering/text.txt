The 52 stutterers were asked 12 questions assessing, among others, their levels of motivation for starting their speech therapies: before starting secondary school, during secondary school, and towards the end of their time in secondary school. The scale of motivation levels was set as: very high, high, medium, low, and none. In one of the questions, the stutterers were asked to name their reasons for deciding on starting a speech therapy in the aforementioned periods, and among those reasons suggestions from their mother, father, grandparents, teachers, the influence of the Internet, or the lack of them, could be found, to name a few. The surveyed group was also asked to rate those reasons from the most important (1) to the least important (6, 7, 8, 0). The stutterers also provided their own/personal reasons for starting a stuttering therapy in the aforementioned period of time and scale, and those pertained to lack of progress in earlier attempts at therapy and very low self-esteem connected to communication difficulties. The survey also provided answers to questions about the factors that influenced their final decision to choose the right method of therapy. The graphs in the article and their analysis will allow the readers to familiarise themselves with the wide spectrum of motivation and its lack to start a therapy aimed at correcting speech communication disorders in the form of stuttering in secondary school students. Towards the end of the article some research conclusions are described, pointing to the fact that the main influence on deciding to start a speech therapy is the mother, and towards the end of school-the Internet, while the lack of decision is most often influenced by little interest in the problem on the family's part and failed past attempts at therapy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Logopedia Silesiana•  4  Stuttering, Motivation, Motivation for Stuttering Therapy, Reasons for Deciding on Starting Speech TherapyThe effects of duration and frequency of occurrence of voiceless fricatives on listeners’ perceptions of sound prolongationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Norimune Kawai•  20  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Communication Disorders, PhoneticsIntensive stuttering modification therapy: A multidimensional assessment of treatment outcomesNineteen adults who stutter participated in a 3-week intensive stuttering modificationSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Blomgren•  18  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Treatment Outcome, LinguisticsScreening for personality disorders among adults seeking speech treatment for stutteringSave to LibraryDownloadby Michelle Lincoln•  27  Mental Health, Personality Disorders, Australia, Fluency disordersComparison Of Pausing Behavior In Children Who Stutter And Children Who Have Asperger SyndromeSave to LibraryDownloadby Ellen Osborn•  20  Psycholinguistics, Fluency disorders, Language, AdolescentAnxiety Levels in People Who Stutter: A Randomized Population StudySave to LibraryDownloadby ashley craig•  15  Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Adolescent, StutteringOutcome Measurement in Adult Stuttering Therapy: A Self-Rating ProfileSave to LibraryDownloadby Anne Ayre•  11  Cognitive Science, Speech-Language Pathology/ Communication Disorders, Treatment Outcome, LinguisticsInvestigations of the impact of altered auditory feedback in‐the‐ear devices on the speech of people who stutter: initial fitting and 4‐month follow‐upSave to LibraryDownloadby Tim Saltuklaroglu•  18  Cognitive Science, Speech-Language Pathology/ Communication Disorders, Speech perception, ReadingParoles, langues et disfluences : une étude linguistique et phonétique du bégaiementStuttering is a speech fluency disorder.

It can be mainly characterized by an increased presence of disfluencies that affect the speech intelligibility. The aim of this thesis is to study stuttering-like disfluencies (SLDs) produced by persons who stutter (PWS) during reading tasks and during spontaneous speech. More specifically, we propose, as our first objective, to verify if any morphological or phonetic elements can explain the presence of these disfluencies. Our second objective is to observe articulatory events before and during SLDs. For the studies dealing with the linguistic and phonetic elements that can be problematic to PWS, 10 French-speaking and 10 Slovak-speaking PWS were recorded while reading a text and while having a conversation in their mother tongue. The studies on speech motor events taking place before and during SLDs were realized by means of an EMA. 4 French-speaking subjects participated in this part of the study (2 PWS and 2 control subjects). Our results show that non-voiced consonants and stops were part of the most problematic elements to produce for PWS. The morphological study reveals that the risk of a SLD appearance was higher when the word contained more morphemes. This result should be correlated to the number of syllables that constitute the word. As for the second couple of studies, they focus on the speech motor events in stuttered speech. Our data show that similar articulatory events can take place in the supraglottic cavity during disfluencies perceived as blocks or prolongations. Furthermore, a disruption of coarticulatory gestures was observed in certain disfluencies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ivana Didirková•  3  Stuttering, Articulatory Phonetics, DisfluencySpeech fluency in neurofibromatosis type 1Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder with an estimated prevalence of about 1/3000.

Several authors mention the occurrence of various types of speech abnormalities associated with NF1. The present study investigated speech fluency in 21 Dutch speaking adults with NF1. Speech samples were collected in five different speaking modalities (spontaneous speech, monologue, repetition, automatic series and reading) and subsequently analysed for type, number and distribution of dysfluencies. It was found that dysfluencies are a common feature of the speech of individuals with NF1. Although stuttering appears to occur in some NF1 patients, as a group, they display a dysfluency pattern that is not identical to stuttering.

This form of stuttering is primarily caused by neurological incidents. Owing to controversies with regard to similarities between developmental stuttering (DS) and NS symptomatology, differential diagnosis is problematic. Differential diagnosis will guide the appropriate management of persons who stutter (PWS). The aim of this study was to describe and highlight the characteristics of NS in order to compile a preliminary checklist for accurate diagnosis and intervention. An explorative, applied mixed method, multiple case study research design was followed. Purposive sampling was used to select four participants. A comprehensive assessment battery was compiled for data collection. The results revealed a distinct pattern of core stuttering behaviours in NS, although discrepancies existed regarding stuttering severity and frequency.

In this study, a large population-based twin sample from the Australian Twin Registry (1567 pairs and 634 singles aged 17–29 years) was screened to identify twin pairs in which one or both members reported themselves to be affected by stuttering.

The Teachers' Attitudes Toward Stuttering (TATS) inventory is a tool for evaluating teachers' opinions and attitudes toward stuttering. The purpose of this study is to validate the Persian version of the TATS (TATS-Persian) and a preliminary study of the attitude of elementary teachers towards stuttering. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, which is of validation and instrumentation type, 32 teachers from elementary schools in Tehran were recruited by the available sampling method. To examine the content validity of TATS-Persian, 12 teachers were surveyed, and for the test-retest reliability of it, 12 teachers re-completed the TATS-Persian after one week. The statistical methods included the Cronbach alpha coefficient calculation and the Spearman correlation test. Results: The content validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of TATS-Persian were 0.92, 0.93, 0.96, respectively. The Mean±SD scores of teacher's attitudes were 78.09 ±11.9. Also, the teachers' attitudes score had a significant positive correlation with the number of stuttering students experienced in their teaching history. Conclusion: The Persian version of the TATS inventory is a valid and simple tool for evaluating teachers' attitudes toward stuttering.Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Modern Rehabilitation (JMR)•  6  Stuttering, Teacher, Reliability, AttitudeStuttering: a dynamic motor control disorderSave to LibraryDownloadby Torrey Loucks•  11  Motor Control, Fluency disorders, Stuttering, Speech ProcessingThe “Iowa Way” revisitedSave to LibraryDownloadby Rick Arenas•  14  Psychology, Positive Psychology, Psychotherapy, Fluency disordersEffectiveness of the Lidcombe Program for early stuttering in Australian community clinicsThis study explored the effectiveness of the Lidcombe Program for early stuttering in community clinics.

Participants were 31 speech-language pathologists (SLPs) using the Lidcombe Program in clinics across Australia, and 57 of their young stuttering clients. Percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS) was collected 9 months after beginning treatment along with information about variables likely to influence outcomes. The mean %SS for the 57 children 9 months after starting treatment was 1.7. The most significant predictor of outcome was Lidcombe Program Trainers Consortium (LPTC) training. The children of trained SLPs (n = 19), compared to the children of untrained SLPs, took 76% more sessions to complete stage 1, but achieved 54% lower %SS scores, 9 months after starting treatment. Results suggest that outcomes for the Lidcombe Program in the general community may be comparable to those obtained in clinical trials when SLPs receive formal training and support.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ross Menzies•  18  Cognitive Science, Speech Language Pathology, Community-Based Mental Health Services, AustraliaPublic attitudes toward cluttering and stuttering in four countriesSave to LibraryDownloadby Seyhun  Topbas•  2  Stuttering, Stuttering TherapyNextLast »Related TopicsStuttering TherapyFollowFollowingSpeech Language PathologyFollowFollowingVoice DisordersFollowFollowingSpeech and language therapyFollowFollowingCross-cultural Psychology (Culture)FollowFollowingSpeech-Language Pathology/ Communication DisordersFollowFollowingAphasia and Aphasia RehabilitationFollowFollowingCantoneseFollowFollowingSpecific Language ImpairmentFollowFollowingInternational CollaborationFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
