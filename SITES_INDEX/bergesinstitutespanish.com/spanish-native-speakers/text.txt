Native Spanish speakers worldwide in 2023: an estimate
We estimate that there are approximately 488 million native Spanish speakers (i.e. people
                    who speak Spanish as their first language, or L1) worldwide in 2023. Here's how we came up with this number:
                
                        We sourced the population data estimates for each Hispanophone country (i.e. a country in which
                        Spanish is an official language,
                        either de facto or de jure)
                        plus Puerto Rico from the U.S. Census Bureau's U.S. and World Population Clock [1], which is one of the best
                        population estimates available.
                    
                        To calculate the number of native Spanish speakers in each Hispanophone country, we applied Moreno-Fernandez et al.'s estimates [2]
                        of the percentage of native speakers in each Hispanophone country against its population data. We did the same thing with Puerto Rico.
                    
                        Lastly, we added Instituto Cervantes' estimate [3]
                        of the number of first-language Spanish speakers in non-Hispanophone countries and territories to the total.
                    
                    Our estimate differs slightly from other popular ones. Ethnologue's 2019 Languages of the World report [4], which estimated a total of
                    460 million first-language Spanish speakers worldwide, is outdated. Instituto Cervantes' 2022 report [3],
                    which estimated a total of 496 million first-language Spanish speakers worldwide and also uses
                    Moreno-Fernandez et al.'s estimates
                    of the percentage of native speakers in each Hispanophone country, states that the population data for each Hispanophone country has been
                    'extracted from the statistical information available in each country', without elaborating.
                    For these reasons, we believe our estimate is more accurate.
                
                    Here is the data.
