On not staying put where they have put you: mobilities disrupting the socio-spatial figurations of displacement in Greeceby Eva Papatzani, Panos Hatziprokopiou, and Filyra Vlastou DimopoulouJournal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,  2022The reception and protection system in Greece in the aftermath of the so-called refugee crisis pr... more The reception and protection system in Greece in the aftermath of the so-called refugee crisis produces a geography of specific mobility restrictions and accommodation types for migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees. These restrictions create a multilayered landscape of displacement, dominated by three sociospatial figurations: the forced containment of displaced people in 'hotspots' on eastern Aegean islands; staying in isolated and segregated camps in the mainland; and the accommodation of the most vulnerable in urban centres. At the same time, the mobility practices of displaced people often disrupt the above figurations, stemming from their survival practices and life aspirations, and largely relating to their translocal social connections. These mobilities include, but are not limited to, unregistered movements from hotspots to the mainland, mobilities from camp to camp, mobility negotiations between camp and city. This paper explores the figurations of displacement related to the impact of governance regimes on the livelihoods and mobility of displaced people in Greece. Within this frame, it focuses on the ways through which migrants and asylum-seekers negotiate, resist or transcend the geography of multiple restrictions, through translocal mobility practices that intervene and therefore reshape dominant socio-spatial figurations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Based on participant observation, we start by unfolding the discourses through which our interlocutors attempt to legitimise their religious practices, by connecting the Karbala narrative with the current political oppression of Shiite minorities, but also by articulating a poetics of similarity with equivalent acts of faith from the Greek cultural context, rather than arguments on multiculturalist difference. We then turn our attention to the way Ashura is portrayed by Greek art and media, and we unpack how the poetics of similarity and the politics of difference are presented from different viewpoints. Finally, we study how the interrelations between this migrant Shiite community and ideas regarding the “national self” are manifested in symbolic uses of blood—from murderous threats received by Neo-Nazi groups, to their rejected proposal for a blood-donation campaign parallel to the Ashura.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Migrant economies and everyday spaces in Athens at times of crisisby Frangopoulos Yannis and Panos HatziprokopiouSpecial Feature on Migration and the City: Diversity, Migrant Economies and Urban Space, 20 (1): 61-74,  Feb 2016Alongside the depressing image of closed shops as visible indicators of the crisis, migrant busin... more Alongside the depressing image of closed shops as visible indicators of the crisis, migrant businesses can be found in many parts of Athens and often play a vital role in local neighbourhood markets. This paper explores the socio-spatial dimensions of Athens’ emerging migrant economies. Drawing from a recent research project combining survey and ethnographic methods on three Athenian neighbourhoods, the paper examines migrant entrepreneurship at the local level and highlights the relevance of place, politics and everyday life. We argue that the spread of immigrant entrepreneurial activity in Athens not only forms an existing part of the urban landscape, but has also become an organic part of the everyday experience of life in the city.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Living together in multi-ethnic cities: people of migrant background, their interethnic friendships and the neighbourhood (Urban Studies 2017)by Manolis Pratsinakis and Panos HatziprokopiouUrban Studies ,  2017This paper explores the extent to which people of different origins, natives and migrants, come t... more This paper explores the extent to which people of different origins, natives and migrants, come together in everyday life in Europe. Instead of looking at overall ‘perceptions’ and ‘stances’, which are context-dependent and mediated through political-ideological currents and discourses as well as broader patterns of prejudice, we focus on sustained close contacts that suggest meaningful and organic relationships. Since it is most often people of migrant background who are blamed for leading ‘parallel lives’ and ‘not integrating’, we chose to focus on them and their interethnic friendships. Moreover, we seek to understand the relevance and role of the neighbourhood context in the development of those relationships. Despite the expressive fears in public discourses about the supposed negative impact of the presence of immigrants and ethnic minorities on social cohesion, our findings indicate that close interethnic relationships are not uncommon in diverse European cities. They further highlight that the neighbourhood context plays an important role in the first years of migrants’ settlement. Relationships in the neighbourhood develop in less formal social settings and are also less demanding in terms of host-country cultural skills on the part of the migrants, thus giving the opportunity to newcomers to develop close interethnic relationships with natives. Finally, the analysis supports the positive role of diversity at the neighbourhood level in the development of interethnic friendships and stresses the importance of the neighbourhood’s socio-spatial characteristics and its location in the wider urban net.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Through a detailed analysis of ethnographic and visual material, we investigate the ways in which Muslim communities negotiate their religious identities and belonging in a city where there is no official mosque, considering that exclusionary perceptions of Islam constitute an important element of Greek national identity. The discussion concentrates on the management of visibility of Muslim identity through public displays of religious practices. Finally, we explore the ongoing debates surrounding the building of a Central Mosque in Athens as a symbolic claim to acceptance and recognition of Muslim presence and religious diversity in the Greek capital.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, it focuses on the Chinatowns of Londonand Milan, beginning from two recent cases where their space has been contested.Alongside the different histories and contemporary patterns of Chinese migrationand settlement and the varying policies and politics of immigration and integration inBritain and Italy, we bring the urban factor in our analysis. More specifically, we look atthe political economy of the urban space and the role of Chinatown in the dynamics ofurban restructuring in the two cities. We conclude by summarizing the key dimensionsof comparison and by highlighting additional elements that are important in order tounderstand the multiple processes conditioning Chinese migrants’ incorporation inEurope, the peculiarities of Chinatown as a specific urban locale and the politics ofcontestation and protest involving immigrants in urban contexts.

This involved interviews with a range of key informants and over 50 individual Chinese people living in London about their experience and feelings about Chinatown. The paper focuses on London's Chinatown's role in the construction and maintenance of diasporic identity and practice. It highlights the importance of Chinatown to Chinese people from a range of backgrounds and migratory statuses. For many, especially newcomers, it play an essential role in their every day lives and is the first port of call for information, employment and support networks. For others, its symbolic role may be more important. Chinatown was seen as essential in acknowledging their presence and in promoting a sense of belonging. The growing importance of formal and informal economic and political links with the government of the People's Republic of China has major implications for Chinatown and for the 'diaspora' which are explored in the paper.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Inspired by the "refugee crisis" of 2015-16, the thesis mainly concerned the development of a methodology regarding the selection of suitable areas for hosting refugee population, and the location of complementary welfare infrastructure. This paper describes the process of creating the methodology, by defining a set of location criteria and briefly outlining the theoretical and empirical underpinnings justifying their choice. The methodology is then implemented in the Urban Agglomeration of Thessaloniki, and areas for placement of housing and welfare infrastructure are selected. An evaluation of the original proposal is attempted in conclusion, highlighting the main difficulties/omissions in the study, and reflecting on future improvements, and its contribution to resilient, sustainable and socially inclusive urban planning.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Βασίζεται σε εμπειρικό υλικό που αντλήθηκε από πρόσφατη έρευνα πεδίου σε μετανάστες από Βαλκανικές χώρες που ζουν και εργάζονται στη Θεσσαλονίκη. Η ανάλυση επικεντρώνει στις «εμπειρίες» των ίδιων των μεταναστών σε σχέση με τον κοινωνικό χώρο, όσον αφορά στην εργασία, κατοικία και γενικά στον τρόπο με τον οποίο οργανώνουν τη ζωή τους στην πόλη. Αναδεικνύεται η σημασία του χώρου στην πολύπλευρη διαδικασία κοινωνικής ένταξης των μεταναστών, ενώ παράλληλα συζητούνται οι αλλαγές που επιφέρει η παρουσία τους στην πόλη σε σχέση με τις μεταβαλλόμενες αστικές δομές. Το πρόσωπο της πόλης αλλάζει εξαιτίας της μετανάστευσης, αλλάζει όμως έτσι κι αλλιώς, λόγω ευρύτερων διαδικασιών διεθνοποίησης και πολιτικών αναδιοργάνωσης του χώρου, που με τη σειρά τους καθορίζουν την ενταξιακή πορεία των μεταναστών στην τοπική κοινωνία.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From the Margins to the Fore: Muslim Immigrants in Contemporary GreeceMuslims at the Margins of Europe,  2019This chapter looks at Greece’s ‘new’ Muslim residents, their growing presence and visibility in t... more This chapter looks at Greece’s ‘new’ Muslim residents, their growing presence and visibility in the public sphere and the ways they are portrayed in dominant public discourses. Building on a variety of sources, it traces the growth and diversity of immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries and explores the rise of migrant Muslim communities in the public sphere. Such a growing presence suggests a multiple shift regarding the character of Islam in Greece. Even though Islam is not new to a state that emerged from the Ottoman Empire and hosts an indigenous Muslim minority, the chapter argues that it undergoes a shift from the margins to the fore, and therefore Greece may be seen as undergoing a transition from a transition a ‘peripheral’ case in Europe to a ‘core’ one whereby Muslim communities relate to transnational migration.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Crisis and the resurgence of emigration from Greece: trends, representations, and the multiplicity of migrant trajectoriesby Manolis Pratsinakis, Panos Hatziprokopiou, and Dimitris  GrammatikasIn the context and conjuncture of the crisis affecting the Eurozone as whole, yet shaking mostly ... more In the context and conjuncture of the crisis affecting the Eurozone as whole, yet shaking mostly its “weakest links”, rising unemployment and steep decreases in salaries and welfare allowances are cited as push factors contributing to what is seen as the emergence of a new emigration wave from Southern Europe. This is especially true for Greece, the country which has been hit hardest by the crisis, recession and austerity, and their social and political consequences. In Greece, there is extended media coverage of this new emigration, which is presented as an one-way option for certain population segments, notably the young and the highly skilled, and hence a drain of the most dynamic part of the country’s labour force. Despite this media attention, however, little is known about the current intensification of emigration from Greece and its characteristics, as well as the experiences of the country’s new “crisis migrants”.This paper aims to partly fill in this gap. It begins by sketching the broad picture and identifying key trends, before moving on to explore key issues in the emerging public discourse. It then zooms into the case of recent Greek migrants to the Netherlands, providing a typology of different mobility trajectories and migration experiences. Through this, we intend to deconstruct a number of conventional assumptions. Firstly, by situating new Greek emigration in a historical continuum, whereby its structural preconditions predated the crisis. Secondly, by identifying the qualitative dimensions of rupture through which the intra-EU mobility from Greece has undergone a shift from a career choice to one largely motivated by necessity. Finally, by highlighting those aspects that problematize idealistic perceptions of life and work “in Europe” often depicted in Greek media, we bring to the fore the ambivalence of mobility decisions and the multiplicity of individual pathways.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Arguably, it has expanded quite rapidly over the past two decades, and has been, partly at least, tied to the dynamics of immigrants’ settlement and incorporation and the formation of ethnic communities (Labrianidis and Hatziprokopiou 2010). Even more, the phenomenon has been more intense and particularly visible in the Greek capital, where the spread of migrant businesses gradually forms an organic part of the city landscape and the everyday experience of the urban, even in areas not characterized by large concentrations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Beyond Migration Binaries and Linear Transitions: The Complexification of Greece's Migratory Landscape at Times of Crisisby Manolis Pratsinakis, Panos Hatziprokopiou, and Russell KingAlthough migration scholars have long acknowledged the need to move beyond opposing binaries (Coh... more Although migration scholars have long acknowledged the need to move beyond opposing binaries (Cohen 1995: 5-6), these continue to dominate thinking about migration. Binary categories may have been useful analytical tools to heuristically map the field of migration studies, but they have limited explanatory value when it comes to assessing different forms of mobility, particularly in the complex new global map of migrations. Currently, new space-time flexibilisations and forces of globalisation are changing the modalities of and motivations for migration in ways that render those binaries obsolete. King (2002), reprising Cohen’s initial formulation, critically comments on binaries such as internal–international, voluntary–forced, temporary–permanent, and legal–illegal migration, proposing ways to transcend them. To these dualisms, we further add the distinction between origin and destination countries, which – despite holding some elements of truth – rests upon assumptions of a direct causal relationship between migration and development, treating developing countries as sources of emigration and developed ones as destinations for migrants.The reification ofSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Βρήκαμε κρίσιμη πια, όχι μόνο την προώθηση της ακαδημαϊκής γνώσης και έρευνας, αλλά και τη φυσική και πνευματική μας επιβίωση. Προσπαθήσαμε έτσι, να προσεγγίσουμε τις διδακτορικές μας διατριβές ως συλλογική δουλειά, μέσα από τη συνάντηση, τον διάλογο και την κυκλοφορία της γνώσης, με την ελπίδα να αναδυθούν και να συζητηθούν περιεχόμενα και εργασίες που συχνά αποτελούν μοναχικές δουλειές κλειδωμένες σε βιβλιοθήκες και ηλεκτρονικούς υπολογιστές. Θεωρήσαμε καίρια την επικοινωνία των υποψήφιων διδακτόρων τόσο μεταξύ τους όσο και με τους προπτυχιακούς φοιτητές, ενώ παράλληλα κρίναμε απαραίτητη τη δικτύωση με ερευνητές εκτός συνόρων. Στο πλαίσιο αυτό, αναγνωρίσαμε τη διεπιστημονικότητα ως ένα απαραίτητο στοιχείο του εργαστηρίου απέναντι στον κατακερματισμό της γνώσης και την περιχαράκωση των επιστημονικών ειδικοτήτων. Απέναντι στην ιδιωτικοποιημένη και εμπορευματοποιημένη πανεπιστημιακή γνώση αλλά και στην επιδιωκόμενη ηγεμονία των νεοφιλελεύθερων πολιτικών, αναζητήσαμε εκείνα τα ριζοσπαστικά επιστημολογικά εργαλεία παραγωγής γνώσης που ενθαρρύνουν τις κινήσεις για κοινωνική χειραφέτηση. Έτσι, μας ενδιέφερε να θέσουμε υπό συζήτηση κριτικά επιστημολογικά εργαλεία για την μελέτη των χωρικών εκφράσεων της κρίσης σε πολλαπλές κλίμακες. Συνεπώς θεωρούμε πως σήμερα είναι ιδιαίτερα κρίσιμη η ανάδειξη, κυκλοφορία και εμβάθυνση σε κριτικές προσεγγίσεις καθώς και η διασύνδεσή τους με κοινωνικούς αγώνες. Μέσα από τις παρουσιάσεις και τις συζητήσεις του εργαστηρίου αναδύθηκαν προσεγγίσεις και επιστημολογικά εργαλεία όπως αυτά, της διαλεκτικής κριτικής θεωρίας του χώρου, της διαθεματικότητας, των πολιτισμικών και μεταποικιοκρατικών προσεγγίσεων. Ταυτόχρονα, οι συζητήσεις καταδύθηκαν σε πλήθος θεματικών με την διάσταση του χώρου να διαδραματίζει σημαντικό ρόλο. Συζητήθηκαν έτσι, ζητήματα σχετικά με τις σύγχρονες νεοφιλελεύθερες χωρικές πολιτικές, τα κοινωνικά και πολιτισμικά κινήματα, τις γεωγραφίες της μετανάστευσης, τον ρόλο του κράτους και του έθνους και το αστικό περιβάλλον. Στοχεύοντας τόσο στην διεπιστημονικότητα όσο και στην επικοινωνία με ερευνητές και ερευνήτριες από άλλες περιοχές ή χώρες, επιδιώξαμε οι συμμετέχουσες και συμμετέχοντες του εργαστηρίου να προέρχονται κάθε φορά από διάφορα επιστημονικά πεδία όπως αυτά της αρχιτεκτονικής, της πολεοδομίας, της χωροταξίας και της περιφερειακής ανάπτυξης, της γεωγραφίας, της αρχαιολογίας, της κοινωνιολογίας, της ανθρωπολογίας, της ζωγραφικής/visual arts, των πολιτικών, νομικών και οικονομικών επιστημών και της παιδαγωγικής. Τα μεγαλύτερο μέρος των συνολικά 57 παρουσιάσεων βρίσκεται σε αυτή τη συλλογή. Ο τόμος προσπαθώντας να οργανώσει τις παραπάνω συζητήσεις χωρίζεται σε πέντε θεματικές ενότητες: Ι. Χωρικές πολιτικές και πρακτικές εξουσίας, και ελέγχου, ΙΙ. Σώμα, φύλο και σεξουαλικότητα στον αστικό χώρο, ΙΙΙ. Η διαχείριση της τέχνης και της μνήμης, ΙV. Γεωγραφίες της μετανάστευσης και αμφισβητούμενοι τόποι, V. Κοινός Χώρος και κοινωνικά κινήματα πόλης και περιφέρειας Το εργαστήριο ξεκίνησε από τους υποψήφιους διδάκτορες Βάσω Μακρυγιάννη, Ορέστη Πάγκαλο, Χάρη Τσαβδάρογλου και Ειρήνη Ωραιοπούλου και σήμερα συμμετέχουν οι Κώστας Αθανασίου, Ελένη Βασδέκη, Ελίνα Καπετανάκη, Μαρία Καραγιάννη, Ματίνα Καψάλη, Βάσω Μακρυγιάννη, Φωτεινή Μάμαλη, Ορέστης Πάγκαλος, Χάρης Τσαβδάρογλου. Ακόμη βοήθησαν με τη συμβολή τους η Εύη Αθανασίου, η Λία Γυιόκα, ο Δημήτρης Κωτσάκης και η Σάσα Λαδά. Θέλουμε να ευχαριστήσουμε όλες και όλους όσους συμμετείχαν και βοήθησαν στην πραγματοποίηση των συναντήσεων. Κλείνοντας, νιώθουμε την ανάγκη να αναφερθούμε, έστω και σύντομα, στον χώρο στον οποίo τα σεμινάρια έλαβαν χώρα αλλά φυσικά και στον χώρο σε σχέση με τον οποίο επιλέξαμε και επιδιώξαμε συνειδητά ως εργαστήριο να τοποθετούμαστε εντός, εκτός και εναντίον. Στην πρόσφατη ιστορία του ο χώρος του Πανεπιστημίου αποτέλεσε εύφορο πεδίο συλλογικών χειραφετικών χειρονομιών, κοινωνικών αγώνων και ριζοσπαστικών πειραμάτων αυτοοργάνωσης της παραγωγής της γνώσης. Ωστόσο, τις τελευταίες δεκαετίες  επιταχύνεται η αναδιάρθρωση του Πανεπιστημίου μέσα από την επιβολή νεοφιλελεύθερων πολιτικών σε κάθε επίπεδο της λειτουργίας του, από τους τρόπους συλλογικοποίησης μέχρι τα προγράμματα σπουδών, από τους απλήρωτους ερευνητές και ερευνήτριες, μέχρι τις απολυμένες εργαζόμενες και εργαζόμενους, τη συρρίκνωση του διδακτικού προσωπικού και την αλλαγή των σπουδών προς κατευθύνσεις που απορρίπτουν κριτικές προσεγγίσεις και ευθυγραμμίζονται με τις επιταγές της αγοράς. Στον καιρό της κρίσης, η νεοφιλελευθεροποίηση του δημόσιου Πανεπιστημίου φαίνεται να εντείνεται ακόμα περισσότερο. Απέναντι σε αυτή τη συνθήκη βλέπουμε να αναπτύσσονται δυναμικές αντιστάσεις σε πολλές γωνιές του κόσμου, με κοινωνικούς αγώνες εντός των πανεπιστημιακών χώρων που εμπνέονται, μαθαίνουν, επικοινωνούν και συνδέονται με κινήματα εκτός αυτών. Σε αυτό το τοπίο, εξακολουθούμε να βλέπουμε τις εργασίες μας ως ένα μέσο προώθησης και επικοινωνίας της κριτικής σκέψης και τα πανεπιστήμια ως ένα ζωντανό ανοιχτό εργαστήριο, ως τόπο και αφετηρία συνάντησης. Θεσσαλονίκη, Ιούνιος 2015Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Refugees’ Right to Housing:  Refugee Housing Commons vs. State-run Campsby Haris Tsavdaroglou and Panos HatziprokopiouThe refugee waves deriving from conflict areas in the the Middle East, Asia and Africa are a cent... more The refugee waves deriving from conflict areas in the the Middle East, Asia and Africa are a central issue to the growing socio-spatial debate about the different facets of contemporary crisis. A noticeable body of literature is currently emerging, exploring aspects of border control and State immigration policies as well as the social philanthropy and humanitarianism underscoring NGO activities. Accordingly, refugees are often seen as passive recipients of state or NGO/philanthropy led practices, especially regarding their settlement, albeit temporary, and respective housing solutions. However, there is little attempt to research how the refugees themselves self-organize and enact the production of seemingly anonymous, yet highly personal and collective housing common spaces, often at creative encounter with local solidarity movements and activists. The proposed panel aims to fill this gap. Following recent spatial approaches on “commons” and “enclosures”, this research panel compares and contrasts refugee-led solidarity housing commons, usually emerging in urban areas, with State-run refugee camps, which are mostly located in rural areas or the urban periphery. This panel welcomes proposals from various disciplines that: -follow dialectic, postcolonial and intersectional approaches offering integrative views on the interplay between gender, class, ethnic or sexual relations and understanding migrants and refugees not only as victims but also as agents of resistance and emancipation.-question how migrants and refugees self-organize themselves beyond State provisions and NGO support, whom they build alliances with and how they (re)negotiate their various identities.-assess, document, map and monitor the refugees’ access to housing, considering it an essential step towards ‘integration’ and a precondition for the full enjoyment of social and civil rights as well as spatial justice.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
