H. NiehrAramaeans in Ancient Syria: Architecture2014 • Mirko NovákAramaean architecture can hardly be discussed in isolation from Luwian or “Neo-Hittite” one. As far as we can observe, Aramaeans and Luwians coexisted in most of the small political entities that had emerged after the collapse of the Late Bronze Age world with its huge empires. Sometimes, Luwian and Aramaean scripts and languages appear in one and the same region at the same time; in other cases it can be difficult to determine if the élites were Aramaean or Luwian in origin. Politically, the Luwo-Aramaean world was fragmented into a number of relatively small kingdoms and chiefdoms, some of them urban, some still with a strongly nomadic component. A political or cultural center never existed, although there are some hints that Carchemish played a predominant role. Another issue that modern scholars have to face when they are dealing with the culture of the Luwo-Aramaean world is the rise of Assyrian influence, which we see beginning to emerge in the late 10th century in the east and slightly later in the west. As a result, Aramaean and Neo-Hittite characteristics were altered by Assyrian ones. The process accelerated after the incorporation of the principalities into the quickly growing empire. In the following, the Aramaean architecture will be dealt with by categories rather than entities (these could also be a reasonable alternative). But it has to be taken into consideration that, due to the political fragmentation, regional differences may have been significant, even between neighboring entities.Download Free PDFView PDF'My Father was a Wandering Aramean': Biblical Views of the Ancestral Relationship between Israel and AramYigal Levinin A.
