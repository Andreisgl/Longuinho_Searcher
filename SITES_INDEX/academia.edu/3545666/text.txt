One way for chemical manufacturers to ensure profitability in the current environment is to foster innovation through the use of advanced modeling techniques. The Chemical Industry Vision2020 Technology Partnership 1 highlights opportunities to address several challenges in the chemical industry through shared pre-competitive research and development activities in many technology areas, and offers a special focus on high-end modeling. In this paper we examine the available technologies in the chemical industry and highlight several areas where major advances have been achieved through innovation fostered by advanced modeling of industrial processes.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersChemical Engineering and Processing: Process IntensificationMultiphase CFD modeling: Fluid dynamics aspects in scale-up of a fluidized-bed crystallizer2013 • Piotr Synowiec, Janusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFContents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process IntensiﬁcationJanusz WójcikDownload Free PDFView PDFOrganic Process Research & DevelopmentAssessment of Recent Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Trends: A Multiauthor Review2015 • Alfons BaikerDownload Free PDFView PDFChemical Engineering Research and DesignCFD simulation of barium carbonate precipitation in a fluidized bed reactor2010 • H. MuhrABSTRACT CFD techniques are used to study the precipitation of barium carbonate in a solid–liquid fluidized bed reactor. Experimental analysis of the hydrodynamic behaviour for a neutralization reaction in the fluidized bed column, followed by CFD simulations is carried out using different reaction models. The Eddy Dissipation model, the Eddy Dissipation model-MTS and the Eddy Dissipation Concept micro-mixing models are tested in order to simulate the acid–base instantaneous reaction.The modelling of the precipitation in a fluidized bed reactor is coupled with the Eddy Dissipation model-MTS micro-mixing model and the k-ɛ standard turbulence model. Barium carbonate is chosen as the model substance. The liquid phase reaction rate as well as the nucleation, growth and aggregation kinetics is included in the precipitation model. The discrete method is chosen to solve the population balance equation. The activity coefficient needed to calculate the supersaturation in the kinetic equations is determined using the Bromley&amp;#39;s method. A good agreement is obtained between the experimental results and the CFD results.Download Free PDFView PDF45 years recovery boiler co-operation in Finland - International Conference, Sibelius hall, Lahti, June 3 - 5, 2009Esa VakkilainenYear 2009 will be remembered for two reasons. Firstly, 2009 will probably be one of the most difficult years in the history of the pulping industry. Hard times are globally present and several pulp mills have been permanently closed. All the companies have experienced diminished revenues and have begun cost-cutting measures. Secondly, year 2009 will mark the 45th year for the activities of the Finnish Recovery Boiler Committee. To celebrate the occasion this International seminar has been arranged in Lahti, Finland. The Finnish Recovery Boiler Committee has also seen the effects of the global decline. Three pulp mills have recently been permanently shut down in Finland, which means that the committee has also lost three active members. However, the bad news always comes with the good news. One of the recent good news is defi nitely the start-up of a brand new recovery line at the UPM-Kymmene Kuusankoski mill in 2008. The investment in a new recovery line proves that pulp will be pro...Download Free PDFView PDFMODEL-BASED SCALE-UP IN PRACTICERahul  IngleDownload Free PDFView PDFBrazilian Journal of Chemical EngineeringINDUSTRIAL CRYSTALLIZATION AND PRECIPITATION FROM SOLUTIONS: STATE OF THE TECHNIQUE2001 • maria resDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Applied SciencesModification and Characterization of Phytase for Animal Feed Production2009 • Ibrahim Ali NoorbatchaDownload Free PDFView PDFComputers and Electronics in AgricultureApplication of computational fluid dynamics for modeling and designing photobioreactors for microalgae production: A review2011 • Jessie BitogDownload Free PDFView PDFApplication of Computational Fluid Dynamics for the Thermodynamic Development of a New Generation of Hermetic Reciprocating Compressor2010 • Dániel NagyDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
