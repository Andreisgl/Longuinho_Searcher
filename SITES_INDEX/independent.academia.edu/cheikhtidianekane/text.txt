This document outlines, in the context of global climate initiatives, the key research frontiers for African climate that will be addressed. In a departure from usual practice, motivated by the imperative of ‘mainstreaming use of climate information in decision making’, research priorities are ordered according to their alignment with emerging priority needs for African users. As part of its activities the conference will review and validate these ‘frontier’ research priorities (see also the conference concept note)Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In that context, the development of efficient and adapted methods for better management of weeds is critical. This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of the combination of two formulations of herbicides (Eros Gold and Londax) and two sowing methods (direct sowing and transplanting) on rice weeds in a Split Plot design with three replicates. The weed flora was evaluated through phytosociological surveys with three observations: before heading, after heading and ripening stages of rice. Floristic surveys identified 16 families, 25 genera and 28 species of weeds. In addition, the results showed that Eros Gold had a significant effect with sowing methods on the decrease of sedges and grasses density but more specifically on the abundance-dominance of broadleaf weeds (dicotyledons) before and during heading stages of rice. On family groups, Cyperaceae (15.39 ind/ha), grasses...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We measured the plasma AVP response to hypercapnia and/or hypoxia in catheterized intact or sinoaortic-denervated fetal sheep between 123 and 144 days of gestation. Ewes were exposed to the following inspired gases: two successive 30-min periods of normocapnic normoxia, 30 min of normocapnic normoxia followed by 30 min of normocapnic hypoxia, two successive 30-min periods of hypercapnic normoxia, or 30 min of hypercapnic normoxia followed by 30 min of hypercapnic hypoxia (i.e., asphyxia). Hypercapnia per se had no significant effect on fetal plasma AVP. Normocapnic hypoxia per se resulted in a significant increase in fetal plasma AVP. Although hypercapnia resulted in a significant acidemia, the decrease in arterial pH was more marked under hypox...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It contains a diversity of aquifers units that are the main sources of drinking water sup-ply for over 80% of the population. Some of them are shared by 2 or 3 countries, and their management should receive attention by the various countries. With increasing pressure on water resources, groundwater use will augment progres-sively to provide sources of water and to satisfy the new demand with regard to the population growth, the living standard improvement, and new trend of irrigated agriculture development, as well. This paper is intended to characterize the groundwater potential in the sedimentary basin that bears groundwater con-tained in various (spatially and stratigraphically) aquifer units, with two major transboundary aquifers: the deep Maas-trichtian aquifer and the alluvial aquifer in the Senegal River basin. Belong the necessary characterization of this aqui-fer system, the paper will aim to discuss the institutionalized groundwater management bearing in mind the existence of River Basin Organisations in the regional.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
