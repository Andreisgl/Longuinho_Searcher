Spoelstra, J.B.M. Thissen, K.J. Canters & J.C. Buys (redactie). Atlas van de Nederlandse zoogdieren. Natuur van Nederland 12. Naturalis Biodiversity Center & EIS, Leiden 2016.The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is native to North and Central America. The first raccoons in the Netherlands escaped from fur farms. From the 1960s onwards, there have also been reports of raccoons crossing into the Netherlands from Germany. Most sightings during the most recent period covered by this atlas are from the part of the Netherlands north of the large rivers Rhine, Meuse and Waal. In a typical year, no more than a couple of animals are observed. These may be either raccoons escaped from fur farms or vagrants entering from Germany. The steady increase of the latter suggests chat a permanent population will be established in the Netherlands in the coming decades.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
