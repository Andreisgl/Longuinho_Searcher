Breitenfeld2004Stroke is the leading cause of mortality and disability in Slavonia and Baranya. The aim of the study was to identify stroke risk factors and subtypes in the region. The study included 130 stroke patients, mean age 67 years, treated at neurology departments in Osijek and Slavonski Brod during 2003. On making the diagnosis of stroke, computed tomography of the brain was done in 100%, extracranial color Doppler sonography of blood vessels in 44.1%, transcranial Doppler sonography in 55.2%, and laboratory testing in all of the study patients. The patients were classified into the groups of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, the former being subdivided into those with subarachnoidal hemorrhage and those with intracerebral hemorrhage. On classifying the patients with ischemic stroke, we used TOAST classification with five subtypes: stroke involving large blood vessels, small blood vessels, cardioembolic, other known causes, and multiple causes and/or unknown causes of stroke.

The combination of interpleural (IP) injection of bupivacaine and intramuscular injection. (I.M) NSAIDs has not been reported. Therefore we conducted this randomized controlled trial to compare this technique to other reported techniques described for postoperative analgesia following TS. 40 patients scheduled to have TS under general anesthesia for the treatment of hyperhidrosis were randomly allocated into 4 groups. Group 1 received 1.5 mg/kg b.w I.M pethidine at end of surgery. Group 2 received ketoprofen 100 mg I.M at end of surgery. Group 3 received 0.4 ml/kg b.w interpleural bupivacaine 0.5%. Group 4 received a combination of I.M ketoprofen (100 mg) in addition to interpleural bupivacaine (0.4 ml/kg). Postoperative pain was assessed using the 11- point numeric rating score (NRS) at 7 different intervals.

Pérez-mayoralRetrospective case series with a control group. To measure the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR myelography (MRM) for symptomatic foraminal stenosis in patients who need surgery. MR images are extensively used in the evaluation of foraminal stenosis and are often used to evaluate nerves exiting from the foramen. There has been no published report of the diagnostic performance of these imaging methods (MRI and MRM). Diagnostic performances were studied in 90 patients in whom the site of the stenosis was confirmed by means of selective decompression surgeries. The disease prevalence among patients was 26% (23 of 90 patients). The disease prevalence among foramens was 3% (25 of 936 foramens). The prevalence of abnormal findings in 27 asymptomatic volunteers was also studied. Two blinded observers interpreted foraminal narrowing on combinations of sagittal and axial MR images, abnormalities of the course of the nerve root in the foramen, and spinal nerve swelling on MRM. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI for the diagnosis of symptomatic foraminal stenosis were 96%, 67%, 4%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding values for abnormal nerve root course on MRM were 96%, 83%, 7%, and 100%, respectively, and for spinal nerve swelling on MRM were 60%, 99%, 35%, and 99%, respectively. Compared with conventional MRI, MRM affords more specific information for the presurgical diagnosis of symptomatic foraminal stenosis.Download Free PDFView PDFRadiologíaEspectroscopía e imagen del pH intra y extracelular mediante métodos de resonancia magnética. Implicaciones clínicas2008 • E. Pérez-mayoralABSTRACT We review the different methods for measuring pH by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy and discuss their potential diagnostic repercussions. We begin with a brief description of intra- and extracellular pH regulation in physiological and pathological conditions. Then we present the main 31P or 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy procedures, which are based on the dependence of the pH on the chemical displacements of the intrinsic intracellular inorganic phosphate or of the H2 proton of imidazole in extrinsic indicators. Finally, we describe the procedures that use magnetic resonance imaging, whose main tool is the dependence of the pH (i) on the relaxivity of certain paramagnetic contrast agents, or (ii) on the processes of magnetic transference between diamagnetic molecules (DIACEST) or paramagnetic molecules (PARACEST) and the free water in the tissues. We briefly illustrate the potential clinical applications of these new procedures.Download Free PDFView PDFLivestock Science - LIVEST SCIFarming for Health; exploring the Benefits of Green Care Farms for Dementia Patients in the Netherlands2011 • J.m.g.a.

The aim is to find out their characteristics, aggressiveness and the possibility of radical surgical excision as well as the frequency of complications. Method and material: retrospective study on 69 patients operated for recurrent thyroid tumors. Results: Recurrent tumors were found in 42 patients with papillary, 11 with follicular (8 with Hurthle), 9 with medullary and 7 with anaplastic thyroid tumors. Relapse in thyroid bed on dominant side had 41 patients (59.4%), relapse on the opposite side we found in 19 patients (27.5%) and relapse in lymph nodes outside of thyroid bed in 37 patients (53.6%). In 33/69 patients, the first procedure was incomplete (reduction in 5, partial resection in 19, hemithyroidectomy in 9). The second procedure was incomplete in 14, near total thyroidectomy in 2, total thyroidectomy in 33 and dissection of lymph nodes in 33, among them in 20 with the operation in thy...Download Free PDFView PDFActa Clinica CroaticaCorrelation of Neurological Symptoms and Breath Holding Index Values in Patients With Severe Internal Carotid Stenosis2006 • Iris ZavoreoDownload Free PDFView PDFActa clinica CroaticaDevelopment of postoperative internal carotid artery occlusion due to the presence of risk factorsIvo LovričevićPostoperative internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is a rare condition with few data on the risk factors. The aim of the study was to analyze risk factors and ischemic symptomatology in patients with postoperative ICA occlusion. During one year period, 33 patients with postoperative ICA occlusion were examined at Cerebrovascular Laboratory. Medical history, clinical findings and atherosclerosis risk factors were compared with data on 33 patients with satisfactory postoperative finding. Student&#39;s t-test was used on data comparison (P &lt; 0.05). In 31 of 33 patients, ICA occlusion was recorded on the first postoperative examination, 3 months after carotid endarterectomy (18 right and 15 left). In 8 patients, combined occlusion of the common carotid artery and ICA was found (4 right, 4 left). One patient ICA developed occlusion during the first and third postoperative year each. Clinically, three patients presented with ischemic symptoms (one stroke and two transitory ischemic ...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
