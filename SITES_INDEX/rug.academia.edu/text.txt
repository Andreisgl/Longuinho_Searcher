These included civic praise, crowns, proedria, public funerals, honorific statues and monuments. The authors discuss the development of this honorific system, and in particular the epigraphic texts and the monuments through which it is accessible. The focus is on the Imperial period (1st-3rd centuries AD). The papers investigate the forms of honour, the procedures and formulae of local practices, as well as the changes in local honorific habits that resulted from the integration of the Greek cities in the Roman Empire.

The workshop was dedicated to processes of civic education in the cities of pre-modern Europe -ranging from classical antiquity to the early modern era. We suggest that civic education often relied on what we might call 'civic mirrors' , i.e. texts, images, monuments, and rituals that offered instruction to citizens about acceptable and expected styles of citizenship and civic leadership, by presenting them with a positive or negative ideal type.

An international team of scholars considers the continuities of traditional Greek religious practices, and seeks to understand the impact of new influences on those practices, notably the deeper engagement with Judaism and how the emergence of Christianity redefined polis religion. The essays illustrate the inadequacy of 'decline' as a model for understanding Greek religion, exploring how dynamic change in religious life corresponded to the transformations in the Greek city. The volume explores how the citizens of the Greek city after the classical age used religion to construct their cultural identities and political experiences and how many of the features of traditional polis religion survived into and shaped the religious mentalities of the Christian era.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Squares, streets, gymnasia and bathhouses were central to the urban experience of the Greeks and Romans and it is increasingly being recognised that investigating such spaces offers great potential for furthering our understanding of these ancient cultures. By combining archaeological and historical evidence research into subjects such as the design and layout of public spaces, day-to-day behaviour and the erection of public monuments is leading to valuable new insights into the nature of ancient society. This volume brings together contributions by scholars working on such topics for different periods and different parts of the Greek and Roman world. These papers range chronologically from the Hellenistic to the Roman Imperial period and geographically from Asia Minor to Italy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The article offers a chronological overview from the Archaic period to late Antiquity, with an emphasis on Athens. It opens with a brief discussion of the archaeological and ritual contexts in which funerary inscriptions were set up, followed by a discussion of archaic epigrams and the social strategies that lay behind them. This is followed by a discussion of public and private graves that shows how epigraphic habits changed over time.

The Romaia were a driving force that played a crucial and active role in the cultural and political transformations that connected the loosely integrated Greek world to the new global empire. They were collective rituals that captured audience attention through spectacle. At the Romaia the power of Rome was experienced en masse, making them exceptional coordinating mechanisms for the rapid transfer of ideas and information at a local level. Moreover, network theory helps us to understand how festivals contributed to the spread of Roman influence. The Romaia linked Rome to the Panhellenic festival network, which played a major role in the constitution of an imagined community of Greeks.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Processions meandered through the streets every week, and perhaps even every day, carrying processional statues and driving along sacrificial animals. The air was frequently filled with the smells and sounds of sacrificial banquets. In public places benches were set up, on which people sat to drink and eat together. On some days flocks of people could be seen rushing towards the theatre or the stadium, eager to take up their places in the auditorium, from where they could watch traditional Greek athletic or artistic contests. It must have seemed as though at any given time some part or other of the population was involved in some public ritual. The Greek city in the Roman period was – to borrow a phrase of Walter Burkert – a Festgemeinschaft, a festive community.

Monumental honours: framing elite authority in Roman Asia MinorMark Depauw of Leuven University invited me to give another airing of the paper that I prepared f... more Mark Depauw of Leuven University invited me to give another airing of the paper that I prepared for the München conference last November.  "One of the most striking characteristics of the urban landscape of the imperial Greek city was the proliferation of statues and inscriptions. Aligning the streets, framing the agora’s, and adorning public buildings, was a chorus of monuments commemporating the deeds, names and faces of local priests, magistrates and benefactors, and those of their families - vying for the attention of citiznes and other passers-by. This monumentalization has been recognised as a manifestation of the transformation of Greek political culture under Roman rule, but its importance has not been fully explored. I propose to look at public honour as a discursive practice, and I want to investigate how honorific ceremonies and monuments were experienced by both parties (mass and elite) and in particular I want to find out how such honorific exchanges were used to control and frame elite power from below."Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Re-inventing agonistic traditions: Greek festival culture under RomeConnected contests: the project
Connected contests is a joint project directed by Prof. Dr. O.M. ... more Connected contests: the projectConnected contests is a joint project directed by Prof. Dr. O.M. van Nijf and Dr. C.G. Williamson (University of Groningen)  in collaboration with Prof. C. Mann and Dr.S Remijsen (Mannheim) Prof. M dePauw (Leuven) and Dr. A. Farringon (Komotini). The main aim of this project is to study Greek agonistic (festival) culture as a major ingredient of the wider political and cultural transformations of the Greek world under Roman rule (200 BC-300AD). This project is part of the Anchoring Innovation Research Initiative of OIKOS the National Research School in Classical Studies, The Netherlands. http://www.ru.nl/oikos/anchoring-innovation/anchoring-innovation/The main objective of this project is to study the development of a shared festival culture in  the late Hellenistic and Roman periods that was firmly anchored in Greek festival traditions. Increasing connectivity via panhellenic festivals contributed to an heightened sense of shared identity among Greek cities. When Rome became the dominant power in the East its hegemony found an anchor in these festival practices as well. We suggest that this connectivitity can best be conceptualized in network terms, and secondly that these agonistic networks gradually became dominated and unified as one globalizing (small-world) network under Roman dominance.OutcomesOne outcome of the project will be a complete prosopographical database of all athletes and other competitors as well as organisers and officials who were responsible for the ancient festival culture that will be made available online via a websitePublicationsOnno van Nijf & Christina Williamson ‘Netwerken, Panhelleense festivals, en de globalisering van de Hellenistische wereld’ in Groniek 200 (2014):O.M van Nijf and C.

Leur grand nombre présente un contraste fort avec la cité classique, où la circulation d’honneurs était contrôlée par une culture civique qui avait empêché la "monumentalisation" des notables locaux. L’attribution d’honneurs publics a bien sûr connu une longue tradition dans la cité grecque, mais la monumentalisation des honneurs était autre chose. Celle-ci a commencé à l’époque hellénistique, et cette tendance a continué sous l’empire, qui connaît l'apogée d’un système complexe d’honneurs allant de simples éloges jusqu’aux grandes inscriptions avec des décrets civiques pour les grands bienfaiteurs et les magistrats des cités grecques. Je soutiens comme argument que ces inscriptions honorifiques ne sont pas simplement un reflet passif d’une activité politique ayant lieu ailleurs, mais qu’elles jouent un rôle actif qui les met au cœur du politique de la cité grecque impériale. Je suggère que les inscriptions peuvent être vues comme des miroirs civiques (civic mirrors, Bürgerspiegel) qui ont joué un rôle fondamental dans l’éducation civique des élites et de leurs concitoyens."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Often seen as a reflection of oligarchization, I argue that such monuments play an active part in the construction of elite authority. I  look at public honour as a discursive practice, and investigate how it was experienced by by both parties (mass and elite) , and in particular how honorific exchanges were used to control and frame power from below.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Staying Roman Becoming Greek: associations of Romaioi in Greek citiesIn this paper I’ll present a rough sketch of the changing nature of Roman presence in the Greek c... more In this paper I’ll present a rough sketch of the changing nature of Roman presence in the Greek city in a period of a crucial transformation of the Imperium Romanum in the East.  I shall argue that we conceive of this contact zone best in terms of a Middle Ground - a space of negotiation and improvisation between Greek elites and city authorities, and associations of Romans.There are various way in which these Romaioi engaged with the cities in which they settled. At the early stages Roman negotiatores settled in Greek cities in the slipstream of Roman diplomatic moves and of the  arm y. Initially they seem to have settled as individual expats, who showed considerable sign of adaptation and acculturation to their new environments.  Greek cities responded by granting these newcomers a kind of collective status, that found expression i.a. in their collective participation in growing numbers of community rituals, and in particular public banquets, with which the cities celebrated their collective identity. In the imperial period these Romans started to organise themselves more formally. Roman identity was the basis of increasingly formally structured associations that seem to have acquired a fixed place in the social and political hierarchies of the cities. In this context it turned out that the association of Romans began to play the role as a kind of symbolic or ideological intermediaries. They had a key role in the spread of the imperial cult and in the representation of Roman imperial power in the city.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

New poleis were founded by Alexander and his successors, and later by Roman emperors - but ancient Greek cities flourished too. These cities were remarkably similar in terms of architecture, but there were also strong similarities on the level of political culture, where democratic institutions went often  hand in hand with an increasing oligarchization[globalization led to a homogeneization].   It is a striking illustration of the priorities of these new cities that so much effort was put into the construction and maintenance of institutions that were concerned with Greek athletics. Every city constructed a stadium, and one or more gymnasia, that became the symbolic centers of Greek urban life (a „second agora”in the words of Louis Robert). Moreover, we also see a virtual explosion of athletic contests that  functioned at local, regional and interregional levels. Cities appointed liturgists and magistrates to oversee these institutions, sent out and received festival observers, and invited or subsidized successful athletes; and athletic victors could expect to receive the highest forms of civic praise. In fact athletic training and competition provided each city with a package  of values, institutions, laws, and symbols, that was crucial to the self identification of the later Greek city. I suggest two reasons why this was the case. A rich athletic life offered all cities, even those with less than impeccable Greek credentials, a chance to partake of a  Panhellenic festival culture, whose symbolic gravity point  was formed by the great traditional sites of Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia and Nemea.  In this way Greek cities were able to feel part  of a global  -imagined- community of Greeks. At an individual level these festivals offered the new polis elites a chance to acquire symbolic and political capital as generous festival organizers; but also as athletes and performers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Connected contests: festival networks in the ancient world.by Onno van Nijf and Christina WilliamsonThis  is a joint project of Prof. Dr. O.M. van Nijf and Dr. C.G. Williamson (Brown University and... more This  is a joint project of Prof. Dr. O.M. van Nijf and Dr. C.G. Williamson (Brown University and RUG) . The main aim of this project is to study Greek agonistic (festival) culture as a major ingredient of the wider political and cultural transformations of the Greek world under Roman rule (200 BC-300AD). The main objective of this project is to demonstrate that a shared festival culture led first to increasing connectivity between the Greek cities at a panhellenic level, which can best be conceptualized in network terms, and secondly that these agonistic networks gradually became dominated and unified as one globalizing (small-world) network under Roman dominance. Greek festival culture and Roman power were ultimately fully implicated with one another: the spectacular rise of Greek agonistic festivals would have been impossible without the protective aegis of Rome – while Rome used this agonistic culture as a means of securing its hold over the Greek cities. Our analysis will focus on the activities of and links between the actors at different scales: i.e. the individual competitors, professional associations, ambassadors, and city officials, and the Roman authorities, as well as on the festival sites that served as the nodes in this globalizing network.  One outcome of the project will be a complete prosopographical database of all athletes and other competitors as well as organisers and officials who were responsible for the ancient festival culture that will be made available online via a website  www.connectedcontests.orgSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In Italy and the West a struggle for power in the Republic led to political crises, periods of terror, and most of all to horrible civil wars. At the same time the Greek world was plagued by internal warfare and doomed attempts to resist Roman power. Moreover, the Roman civil wars were also largely fought out in the Greek provinces. This period of crisis only came to an end with the establishment of the Principate, by Octavian-Augustus. The central question of our project is how, after a century marked by crisis and (civil) war, new beginnings were made and (re-) anchored in in the Greek provinces and in Rome itself. two postdoctoral projects are foreseen:The sub-project in Ancient History is entitled (Re-)Anchoring Innovation: Politics and Culture in Roman Athens (supervisors: prof. dr. Onno van Nijf, dr. Jan Willem Drijvers). The sub-project in Greek and Latin literature is entitled After the Civil Wars: Re-Anchoring and Innovation in Greek and Latin Literature (supervisors: Prof. Ruurd Nauta and Prof. Annette Harder).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
