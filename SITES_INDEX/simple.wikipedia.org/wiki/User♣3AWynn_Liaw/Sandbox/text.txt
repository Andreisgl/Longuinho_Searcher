The English Wikipedia is the English version of Wikipedia. English is the first language Wikipedia was written. It started on 15 January 2001. It is the largest encyclopedia in the world, and the largest version of Wikipedia since April 2019. [1] It has more than 6,085,700 articles as of May 2020. [2]. In October 2015, the total volume of the compressed texts of the English Wikipedia's articles added up to 11.5 gigabytes.
The Simple English Wikipedia is a variation where most of the articles use only basic English vocabulary (simplewiki).  There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon) Wikipedia (angwiki). It has a newsletter called The Signpost.
Starting edition[change | change source]
See also: en:Wikipedia:Milestones
The English Wikipedia was the first and largest Wikipedia edition. It has started many ideas as rules or items which were later used by Wikipedia editions in other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",[3]
the neutral-point-of-view rule,[4] navigation templates,[5]
the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[6] dispute resolution tools such as mediation and arbitration,[7]
and weekly collaborations.[8]
The English Wikipedia has used items from other Wikipedias. These items include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia (dewiki) and town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia (nlwiki).
Although the English Wikipedia stores images, audio files and text files, many of them have been moved to Wikimedia Commons. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use images and audio/video files (with copyright conditions). Most are not allowed on Commons.
Many of the most active members in the Wikimedia Foundation and the developers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia are English users.

Wikipedians[change | change source]
The English Wikipedia had 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007,[9] just a little over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an account in late February 2006.[10]
Over 1,100,000 editors have changed Wikipedia more than 10 times.[11] Over 30,000 editors do more than 5 changes per month, and a little over 3,000 do more than 100 changes per month.[12] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million changes had been done on the English Wikipedia.[source?]
As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used language, the English Wikipedia draws many people whose first language is not English. Such people may find out information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their first language because the English Wikipedia often have more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations have been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add content to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors for them.[source?]
Arbitration committee[change | change source]
See the main article: Wikipedia Arbitration Committee
The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that is made up of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[13] The committee was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.[14][15]
When firstly founded, the committee was made up of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each.[14][16] Since then, the committee has gradually expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[17][not in the source given]
As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister projects have imitated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[18] For example, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikipedia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[19]
As the English Wikipedia is very famous, there can be many people changing the wiki in one minute. This made the Special:RecentChanges less effective for understanding changes. Instead, editors can select and watch for changes in particular articles, using the "watchlist" feature of MediaWiki. Some also use special software to detect and fix vandalism.[source?]
Some people think that the English Language Wikipedia shows bias and unfairness.[20] Editors of reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned Wikipedia's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[21] An example of bias is that around 90% of Wikipedia editors are male.[22] Other people think that Wikipedia is more useful than other encyclopedias because it is large and can be updated quickly.
The English language Wikipedia page from 18 January 2012, illustrating its international blackout in opposition to SOPA and PIPA.
In 2012 the logo of the English Wikipedia like most Wikipedias was slightly changed. However, some Wikipedias, like the Simple English Wikipedia, still kept the old logo.
