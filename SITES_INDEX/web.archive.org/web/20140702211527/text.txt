                Nasi lemak, our 'national dish'
            
by dwayne a. rules
Does Malaysia have a national dish? No authority or national agency  has yet come forward to set things in stone, but by default, that honour  would have to go to nasi lemak.
Simply rice cooked in coconut milk (knotted pandanus leaves and  even ginger or a stalk of lemon grass may be tossed into the pot to add  fragrance), imparting a creamy texture to the grains, nasi lemak is  available on almost every street corner and in almost every local-themed  restaurant, served with everything from chicken to beef to cuttlefish.
It can be eaten at any time - breakfast, second breakfast,  elevenses, lunch, tea, dinner, supper, post-boozeup - and the mingling  of flavours and textures (creamy, hot & spicy, crunchy, nutty, etc)  makes it simply... sheer ambrosia.
Essential condiments:
Fried ikan bilis (anchovies), fried peanuts, cucumber slices,  wedges of hardboiled egg (variations: fried eggs, or slices of omelette)  and sambal (a kind of cooked chili paste, plain with onions or with  ikan bilis too)
Extras:
Chicken curry or rendang, beef curry or rendang, mutton curry  or rendang, cuttlefish sambal or curry, chicken liver and gizzard curry,  fried chicken, fried cow lung (paru), begedil (potato cutlets  sometimes mixed with minced meat), dried prawns sambal (some non-halal  outlets cook this with minced pork), cockles in sambal and stewed  kangkong (water spinach).
Some of the ways nasi lemak is sold/served:
Nasi lemak bungkus: "Bungkus" is Bahasa Melayu for  "pack" or "wrap" and this is exactly what you get here - a simple  pre-packed serving of nasi lemak topped with sambal, a sprinkling of  fried peanuts and ikan bilis, sliced cucumber and a wedge of hardboiled  egg.
Typically costing RM1 to RM2, depending on the amount of rice and the quantity of condiments that accompany it.
Many street vendors even toss in a plastic spoon to eat it  with, so you can just dispose of everything after you've fed. NLB is  mostly sold by street vendors, although lately it is not unusual to find  it in delis, bakeries and even at the food counters of some  supermarkets.
Sometimes it's sold pre-packed in microwaveable plastic  containers with chicken or beef rendang for a little extra, say between  RM3 and RM5 per pack.
Nasi lemak bungkus 'to order': Street vendors dealing in  NLBTO typically set up a table on a street corner somewhere, and spread  various pots and plastic containers out in front of them.
A large wooden tub or insulated plastic pail contains the rice  while the pots and containers will hold an assortment of condiments,  rendang (a dry, spicy meat dish), curries, sambal and boiled or fried  eggs.
Customers can just come up, pick what they want to accompany  the nasi lemak, and the vendor will pack it all neatly in a paper  wrapper. A typical NLBTO can cost from RM2 (plain with no meat) to RM4  or RM5 (with one type of meat and a fried egg). If  you pick more to  pack, expect to pay more too.
Nasi lemak a la carte: Sold at restaurants and hotel  eateries, and served with most of the ingredients as described above,  except a little more pricey than if purchased at streetcorners.
Prices range from RM3 to RM6 a plate (if you eat it at a  coffeeshop or non-airconditioned restaurant); and upwards of RM8,  ranging as high as RM15 to RM20, as you progress up the poshness pole. - By Dwayne A. Rules
Rules has 40-plus years' experience eating Malaysian food. He used to write a column on pro wrestling in The Star, so if you're going to disagree with him, be forewarned: he knows how to lay the smack down.
