A new method to determinepeak positions of Raman bands and atomic emission lines in a discontinuousspectrum without numerical manipulations is tested in this study: modifiedscanning multichannel technique. Relocation of the gratings with a Sinus ArmDrive can be performed over a distance that is only a fraction of the pixel sizethat allows peak position estimations with precisions smaller than the pixelresolution and to determine the uncertainty in this estimation. This uncertaintywas not determined in previous studies about gas densimeters, resultingin a large variety of inconsistent data. The new method is tested with fluidinclusions in quartz. A CO2 density of 0.1477 ± 0.0006 gcm-3 and 0.8880± 0.0007 gcm-3 determined with microthermometry correspond to a Fermidyad of 103.12 ± 0.27 cm-1 and 104.71 ± 0.26 cm-1. A CH4 density of 0.3461± 0.0002 gcm-3 and 0.4011 ± 0.0001 gcm-3 correspond to peak positions of2910.66 ± 0.12 cm-1 and 2910.57 ± 0.12 cm-1. The error in these numbersmust be regarded as the best estimated uncertainties of peak positions, whichare probably slightly adjusted to higher values due to mechanical irregularitiesof the Sinus Arm Drive in modern Raman systems.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These rocks are associated with high-temperature shear zones. Garnetites from the upper part of the metamorphic unit close to the contact with EKC gabbronorite are chemically and texturally analysed to estimate their formation conditions and fluid regime. Fluids provide crucial information of formation conditions and evolution of these garnetites during high-grade metamorphism, and are preserved in channel positions within Si6O1812- rings of cordierite, and in fluid inclusions in quartz and garnet. Minerals and fluid inclusions of the garnetites are studied with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, electron microprobe analyses, Raman spectroscopy, and microthermometry.

It forms tiny inclusions (from a few μm up to about 40–50 μm) intergrown in galena, chalcopyrite, and also in bornite. Thalhammerite is brittle and has a metallic lustre. In plane-polarized light, thalhammerite is light yellow with weak bireflectance, weak pleochroism, in shades of slightly yellowish brown and weak anisotropy; it exhibits no internal reflections. Reflectance values of thalhammerite in air (R1, R2 in %) are: 41.9/43.0 at 470 nm, 43.9/45.1 at 546 nm, 44.9/46.1 at 589 nm, and 46.3/47.5 at 650 nm.

From diopside-titanite pegmatites to hematite-quartz growth: the development of a magmatic-hydrothermal system in Arkaroola (northern Flinders Ranges, South Australia)A set of Palaeozoic diopside–titanite veins are present in Mesoproterozoic metagranites and metas... more A set of Palaeozoic diopside–titanite veins are present in Mesoproterozoic metagranites and metasediments that constitute the basement (Mt Painter Inlier) of the Adelaide Fold Belt (South Australia). These massive veins (up to 1 m) of pegmatitic nature contain large crystals of diopside, LREE–Yenriched titanite (up to 40 cm in length) and minor amounts of quartz. They can be used to trace the system’s development from a high-temperature magmatic stage through to a massive hydrothermal event. The pegmatitic origin of these veins is evident from a complex fluid-melt inclusion assemblage, consisting of a highly saline inhomogeneous fluid and relicts of melt. Immiscibility of melt and heterogeneous highly saline fluids (exceeding 61 eq. mass% NaCl) is preserved in primary inclusions in diopside and secondary inclusions in titanite, indicating relatively shallow conditions offormation (510 ± 20°C and 130 ± 10 MPa). Graphic intergrowth of diopside and albite occurs at the contact with granitic pegmatites. The system evolved into hydrothermal conditions, which can be deduced from a later population of only fluid inclusions (homogeneous and less saline, 40 eq. mass% NaCl), trapped around 350 ± 20°C and 80 ± 10 MPa. During quartz crystallization, the conditions moved across the haliteliquidus resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of brine and halite crystals, which were trapped at 200 ± 20°C and 50 ± 10 MPa. Brecciation and a palaeo-geothermal system overprinted the pegmatitic veins with an epithermal hematite–quartz assemblage and lesser amounts of bladed calcite and fluorite, in an intermittently boiling hydrothermal system of fairly pure H2O at 100–140°C and 1–5 MPa. Remobilization of LREEs and Y from titanite and/or the granitic host rock is evidenced by precipitation of apatite, allanite and wakefieldite in an intermediate stage. Occasional incorporation of radioactive elements or minerals, presumably U-rich, in the fluorite is responsible forradiolysis of H2O to H2.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
