FOSDEM 2013/Schedule/Events/Devrooms/Testing and Automation/How MediaWiki is tested
How MediaWiki is tested
How MediaWiki, software that runs Wikipedia, is tested
 Track: Testing and Automation devroom
 Room: H.1309
 Day: Saturday
 Start: 13:30
 End: 14:10
The software that runs Wikipedia, named MediaWIki, is tested in the open just like Wikipedia itself. This talk will cover how MediaWiki is tested, along with mistakes and successes made along the way.
The code and Jenkins jobs are visible to everybody. Only one file
with passwords is hidden. If you are interested in contributing, you will
learn how to get involved.
I will mention one pattern, page object, and a lot of tools: Git,
Ruby, RVM, RubyGems, Cucumber, Selenium
WebDriver, Watir, Bundler, page-object gem,
RubyMine, Jenkins, CloudBees, Sauce Labs and
probably a few more.
I think it is important to have a few reference implementations of open
source test automation projects available to everybody. This is our
contribution.
