Preface
This Low German dictionary is offered as an encouragement towards the preservation of a much-loved Mennonite language. The majority of words in this version have been in basic use for over two and a half centuries.
The word stock of this dictionary was compiled from oral and written information obtained from a host of sources. Herman Rempel, 1995
Introduction
 Rempel's Kjenn Jie Noch Plautdietsch of 1984 has proven to be a mine of information for lay people and scholars interested in Plautdietsch. The Plautdietsch-English/English-Plautdietsch dictionary is repeatedly quoted in Preussisches WÃ¶rterbuch currently being compiled at the  University of Kiel, Germany.  Rempel's new and expanded revision, the culmination of eleven additional years of diligent research and writing in his  mother tongue, promises to extend the accumulated additional information to readers in an understandable and easy-to-read written form.
