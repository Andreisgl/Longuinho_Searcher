A longitudinal prospective design was used whereby 70 patients attending private physiotherapy clinics completed a battery of questionnaires both pre- and post-rehabilitation treatment based on the adapted framework. All participants were receiving treatment for tendonitis-related injuries. Adherence was monitored prospectively over the entire rehabilitation program using an observational measure of clinic adherence, a self-report measure of home-based adherence, in addition to monitoring attendance at rehabilitation sessions. In the initial phase of rehabilitation learning goal orientation, attitudes and perceived severity were found to predict rehabilitation intention. Intentions were also found to mediate the relationship between the aforementioned variables and clinic rehabilitation. Self-efficacy and self-motivation were predictors of clinic rehabilitation and attendance but not home rehabilitation. During the maintenance phase of rehabilitation coping ability and social support were predictors regarding all three measures of adherence. Implications for practitioners rehabilitating injured athletes are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Remco Polman•  24  Mechanical Engineering, Psychology, Sports Medicine, Literature ReviewNurse staffing, quality of nursing care and nurse job outcomes in intensive care unitsAim.  To examine the relationship between nurse staffing and nurse-rated quality of nursing care and job outcomes.Background.  Nurse staffing has been reported to influence patient and nurse outcomes.Design.  A cross-sectional study with... moreAim.  To examine the relationship between nurse staffing and nurse-rated quality of nursing care and job outcomes.Background.  Nurse staffing has been reported to influence patient and nurse outcomes.Design.  A cross-sectional study with a survey conducted August–October 2007.Methods.  The survey included 1365 nurses from 65 intensive care units in 22 hospitals in Korea. Staffing was measured using two indicators: the number of patients per nurse measured at the unit level and perception of staffing adequacy at the nurse level. Quality of care and job dissatisfaction were measured with a four-point scale and burnout measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to determine the relationships between staffing and quality of care and job outcomes.Results.  The average patient-to-nurse ratio was 2·8 patients per nurse. A fifth of nurses perceived that there were enough nurses to provide quality care, one third were dissatisfied, half were highly burnt out and a quarter planned to leave in the next year. Nurses were more likely to rate quality of care as high when they cared for two or fewer patients (odds ratio, 3·26; 95% confidence interval, 1·14–9·31) or 2·0–2·5 patients (odds ratio, 2·44; 95% confidence interval, 1·32–4·52), compared with having more than three patients. Perceived adequate staffing was related to a threefold increase (odds ratio, 2·97; 95% confidence interval, 2·22–3·97) in the odds of nurses’ rating high quality and decreases in the odds of dissatisfaction (odds ratio, 0·30; 95% confidence interval, 0·23–0·40), burnout (odds ratio, 0·50; 95% confidence interval, 0·34–0·73) and plan to leave (odds ratio, 0·40; 95% confidence interval, 0·28–0·56).Conclusions.  Nurse staffing was associated with quality of care and job outcomes in the context of Korean intensive care units.Relevance to clinical practice.  Adequate staffing must be assured to achieve better quality of care and job outcomes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kyung Ja June•  23  Psychology, Nursing, Job Satisfaction, Quality of Mental Health CareAttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: characteristics, interventions and modelsSave to LibraryDownloadby Merle Paule•  34  Cognitive Science, Anxiety Disorders, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Motor ControlPreliminary carbon sequestration modelling for the Australian macadamia industrySave to LibraryDownloadby Jerome K Vanclay•  12  Genetics, Sustainable Development, Carbon Sequestration, Carbon FootprintFormelsammlung – StatistikFormelsammlung für die Grundlagenvorlesung Statistik im berufsbegleitenden Bachelor-Studiengang BWL am Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissenschaften der HS Harz.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christian Reinboth•  20  Statistics, Applied Statistics, Regression Models, Bayesian AnalysisOrthographic learning during reading: examining the role of self-teachingSave to LibraryDownloadby Keith Stanovich•  14  Psychology, Cognitive Science, Phonetics, CognitionObesity as a Risk Factor for Sciatica: A Meta-AnalysisSave to LibraryDownloadby R.

Controlled for environment-market, geographic-region, and hospital-related variables, the results show almost no measurable effect of strategic adoption on rural hospital profitability and liquidity. Where statistically significant relationships existed, they were more often negative than positive. These findings were not expected; it was hypothesized that positive effects across a broad range of strategies would emerge, other things being equal. Discussed are possible explanations for these findings as well as their implication for a rural health policy relying on individual rural hospital strategic adaptation to environmental change.Save to LibraryDownloadby David Salkever•  12  Nursing, Health Services Research, Ownership, Rural HealthPhysiological and anthropometric determinants of rhythmic gymnastics performanceTo identify the physiological and anthropometric predictors of rhythmic gymnastics performance, which was defined from the total ranking score of each athlete in a national competition.

Thirty-four rhythmic gymnasts were divided into 2 groups, elite (n = 15) and nonelite (n = 19), and they underwent a battery of anthropometric, physical fitness, and physiological measurements. The principal-components analysis extracted 6 components: anthropometric, flexibility, explosive strength, aerobic capacity, body dimensions, and anaerobic metabolism. These were used in a simultaneous multiple-regression procedure to determine which best explain the variance in rhythmic gymnastics performance. Based on the principal-component analysis, the anthropometric component explained 45% of the total variance, flexibility 12.1%, explosive strength 9.2%, aerobic capacity 7.4%, body dimensions 6.8%, and anaerobic metabolism 4.6%.

The physico-chemical characterization of dodols such as proximate analysis, pH, moisture content, protein, fat, carbohydrate, ash and fibre contents are investigated. The rheological characterization of dodols were modelled by several models such Bingham, Power Law and Casson models. Regression analysis shows good agreements for all three models applied in this study. Dodol exhibits pseudoplastic behaviour under the conditions tested, as indicated by flow behaviour indices (n) ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 and is further confirmed with the data of decreasing apparent viscosity with increasing shear rate, indicating strong shear-thinning behaviour.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nyuk Chin•  7  Food Engineering, Food, Power Law, Regression AnalysisLeadership style and organizational learning: the mediate effect of school visionSave to LibraryDownloadby Rachel Hertz-lazarowitz and +1Hilla Peretz•  14  Educational Administration, Organizational Learning, Lifelong Learning, Transformational LeadershipAnth.106 Ppt. lecture-12: summary of & supplement to Renfrew & Bahn textbook, chp. 9: What contact did they have?

We also made the measurements by radial immunodiffusion (RID) in a 20% subset of the samples. Aliquots of this subset were also analyzed in the Northwest Lipid Research Laboratories by fixed-time INA calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO)-International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) First International Reference Materials for Apolipoproteins A-I and B. The CVs for the rate INA and RID measurements were: apoA-I, 4.5-7.7% and 2.5-7.6%, respectively; apoB, 2.3-5.3% and 2.3-6.4%, respectively. In NHANES III, rate INA values (x) can be transformed to WHO-IFCC Reference Material-based values (y) as follows: for apoA-I, y = 0.87x + 251.8 mg/L (r = 0.93, SEslope = 0.13, SEintercept = 17, n = 708); for apoB (mg/L), y = 1.068x + 112.8 mg/L (r = 0.98, SEslope = 0.08, SEintercept = 7, n = 646).Save to LibraryDownloadby John Albers•  16  Quality Control, Clinical Chemistry, Humans, Medical BiotechnologyHypovitaminosis D in female patients with chronic low back painSave to LibraryDownloadby Mahmoud Omran•  20  Inflammation, Calcium, Low back pain, PhosphorusImpact of Light Rail Implementation on Labor Market AccessibilitySave to LibraryDownloadby Yingling Fan•  9  Human Geography, Accessibility, Transportation, Urban And Regional PlanningThe relationship of individual, family, and community characteristics with physical health: An adult study in 27 rural Minnesota countiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Thulitha Wickrama•  14  Nursing, Humans, Chronic Disease, FemaleLipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities of< i> Euphorbia millii</i> hyperhydric shootsSave to LibraryDownloadby Yaser Dewir•  67  Andrology, Immunology, Nonparametric Statistics, AgingInfluence of Stroke Survivor Characteristics and Family Conflict Surrounding Recovery on Caregivers???

In general, generic drugs have the same active ingredients as brand-name drugs, but this is not always the case. Thus, toxicity profiles may vary when brand-name and generic drugs are compared. We retrospectively investigated the incidence of hyponatremia in patients receiving brand-name cisplatin (CDDP) and a generic counterpart thereof. We reviewed the medical records of patients treated with brand-name CDDP (n=53) and a generic formulation (n=26), and compared the incidences of hyponatremia and renal toxicity. Toxicities were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Differences between groups were evaluated using the Student&#39;s t-test, and the odds ratio for hyponatremia was estimated via logistic regression analysis.

All icefish species lack hemoglobin and red blood cells in their circulating blood. All icefishes examined to date also lack the intracellular oxygen-binding protein myoglobin (Mb) in their oxidative skeletal muscles. However, some icefish species do express Mb in their heart ventricles. It is unknown whether Mb in those species in which it is present represents an evolutionary relic or has functional significance. To address this problem, we compared mechanical performance of isolated, perfused hearts from two species of icefish in which Mb is either present (Chionodraco rastrospinosus) or is absent (Chaenocephalus aceratus). Hearts were challenged with increasing afterload (2.5-4.0 kPa) under conditions of defined basal flow (approximately 100 ml.min-1.kg-1), in both the presence and absence of 5 mM sodium nitrite, a Mb poison. Unlike hearts from C. aceratus, which were unable to maintain a constant cardiac ...Save to LibraryDownloadby C.
