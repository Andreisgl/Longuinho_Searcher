This report explores the key issues concerning how tourism might facilitate inclusive growth. It provides detailed analysis of both the direct and indirect channels through which the gains from tourism are achieved, and the existing gaps that prevent a fuller capturing of forward and backward linkages.  Using robust statistical data from Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles and other small states, the study also examines land-based and cruise tourism operations and explores how local supply chains could be enhanced. The two key overarching recommendations - improving data collection and promoting niche markets - serve both as rallying points for policy action and as points of focus for partnerships. The book is valuable reading for policy-makers looking to maximise the contribution of tourism to the economy, as well as international development agencies and students of tourism studies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Backpacker Tourism and Economic Development: Perspectives from the Less Developed World.

As a result there has been significant economic development impacts of backpacker tourism upon local communities especially in areas with the largest concentrations of backpackers (South and South-East Asia particularly Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and India), as well as increasingly in Latin America. This volume provides a focused review of the economic development impacts of backpacker tourism in developing regions furthering knowledge on how backpacker tourism can play a crucial role in development strategies in these areas. First, it reviews the origins of the backpackers with a detailed examination of their "hippy" predecessors on the overland trail, before discussing the emergence of modern backpackers including social and cultural aspects, and how new technologies are changing their experience. It then analyses the powerful economic development impacts of backpackers on local host communities in cities and rural areas with a special focus on coastal destinations. Extensive case study material is used from backpacker destinations across Asia, Latin America and Africa. In doing so the book provides original insights into how backpacker tourism is highly significant for poverty alleviation and effective local development since it has strong linkages to the local economy, and less economic leakage than conventional tourism.

Backpacker tourism has replaced agriculture as the dominant economic activity and this chapter explores the relationship between small-scale tourism and the island’s environment. Fieldwork investigated terrestrial and marine environmental impacts, examining water use, solid waste, sewage and building materials before presenting a coral reef survey. Preliminary findings suggest - contradicting conventional wisdom that considers small-scale tourism to have less negative environmental effects than large-scale tourism -  that even such small-scale tourism was stressing the island’s environment, particularly the coral reef. Finally, the implications for other islands are discussed and increased local community management suggested.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The growth of this region has radically altered the global tourism landscape and contributed to new modes of tourism practice, while engendering a decentering of Anglo-Western centrism in tourism theory. In this inaugural conference of the Critical Tourism Studies Asia Pacific network (CTS-AP), we seek to draw attention to the multiple modalities and recenterings of critical tourism scholarship. See full call for papers here. We are accepting workshops, films and other non-traditional presentation formats. Confirmed films so far include Waiting for John (Jessica Sherry) and Paradise Paradigm (Britta Boyer).

Analysing Backpacker Tourism in Rural Colombia: Towards a Political Economy FrameworkTourist arrivals have grown at more than 5% in Latin America, growing at 12% in Colombia in 2014 ... more Tourist arrivals have grown at more than 5% in Latin America, growing at 12% in Colombia in 2014 (UNWTO). Although little official data exists, it seems that backpacker tourism is a thriving segment in Latin America. Both the improved security and the improved economic situation in those countries means that more people are able to travel within Latin America, though the impacts of tourism development there have not been sufficiently explored yet. This paper introduces a new framework to analyse tourism development and its impacts on rural, local communities in Less Developed Countries (LDCs), adopting a Political Economy approach, building on Ferguson&#39;s (2011) and Mosedale&#39;s (2011) work.

This article applies Social Exchange Theory to assess multistakeholders&#39; perspectives of dive tourism for two Malaysian islands: the Perhentians and Sipadan. We argue that multiple interest groups exist within the sites, with heterogeneous attitudes relating to dive tourism. We found that dive instructors (most knowledgeable and engaged) have the most polarized views and clearly identify links between environment, society, and development. Nondive businesses show greater engagement with economic development impact, but may not link this to environmental preservation. Tourists were surprisingly indifferent—highlighting their lack of loyalty to &quot;place&quot; per se or opportunities for alternative travel choices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The OFC is the largest contributor to Jersey&#39;s tax revenue, and accounts for about 20% of local employment. Jersey has become a major OFC in a global industry and is a conduit for sizeable capital flows. However, an unparalleled crisis in 1996 generated international media interest. The crisis involved three separate but related issues: a US $26 million fraud; the fast-tracking of Limited Liability Partnership legislation through the island&#39;s parliament; and a political crisis resulting in the unprecedented expulsion of an outspoken Senator from the parliament. The anatomy of this crisis reveals several causes of concern for other OFC hosts, especially regulatory failure and the overlap of interests between the local political elite and those of international financial capital.

Coastal tourism and local impacts in Vietnam: lessons from Ha Long Bay.This paper explores the local impacts of rapidly growing coastal tourism and presents key finding... more This paper explores the local impacts of rapidly growing coastal tourism and presents key findings from an international research project between UK and Vietnamese universities. It draws from fieldwork that analysed economic impacts and tested the notion of tourism-led inclusive growth.  Inclusive growth remains a contested concept, yet has been adopted by the World Bank as a means to reduce poverty and inequality through rapid economic growth. Research to date has focused on sectors such as agriculture to test the inclusive growth paradigm, but has been little applied to tourism. Given the importance of tourism for income generation, employment and government revenue, the paper examines the main economic components of tourism-led inclusive growth: supply chain, economic linkages/leakages, ownership, employment and tourist expenditure.  Since Vietnam opened up to international tourism in the 1990s under the Doi Moi reforms, Ha Long Bay has been one of Vietnam’s most important destinations receiving over three million visitors p.a. The research utilised a broadly qualitative approach using insights from rapid appraisal type techniques and deployed semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from the tourism industry and government. It was shown that coastal tourism had developed rapidly in Ha Long Bay with some clear economic benefits for the host community but did not appear to fall within the inclusive growth paradigm. It is unclear if - given the large-scale capital-intensive developments being built - tourism-led growth will become any more inclusive in Ha Long in the short or medium term. The paper ends by considering lessons for other developing countries considering tourism, especially coastal tourism, to drive economic growth. At present, despite tourism’s potential for local economic development, this research questions whether tourism can reduce inequality in developing economies such as Vietnam and lead to more inclusive growth.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper then examines main tourism research trends noting the growth of high level ‘systems’ type work in the 1980s such as Britton’s application of dependency theory to tourism or Leiper’s work on the international tourism system, before noting the continuing rise of managerial/business perspectives from the 1990s and the relative decline of research on geographical/spatial aspects such as resort morphology. This section ends by observing the twin trends in some major tourism journals of either ‘hard’ positivism or ‘fuzzy’ post-modernity (both arguably of little interest to policy-makers) and the relative difficulties of placing applied research with leading journals. The next section discusses applied tourism research and ethnographic type approaches using examples from my own projects in Indonesia and Malaysia and discusses some of the key findings on tourism and local economic development. The paper ends by noting the growing pressures on academics from funding rationing, the growing ‘bureaucratic burden’ including the rise of managerialism, and the challenge stemming from powerful ethics committees and seemingly risk-adverse universities that risk affecting the ability of academics to raise difficult questions.Key words: tourism research; applied research; ethnographies; publications strategies; research ethicsSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Islands ... more "Coastal tourism is growing rapidly across South-East Asia, especially in small islands. Islands and coastal areas face significant issues of how to manage the rapid growth of tourism whilst retaining economic benefits for the local host community. First, the paper sets the context and charts the scale and significance of international dive tourism, especially in less developed countries The paper draws upon extensive fieldwork in small island destinations in Malaysia and Indonesia and explores how to research this area and the particular practicalities of fieldwork. Next the paper analyses the main socio-economic impacts of dive tourism drawing upon findings published in Haddock-Fraser and Hampton (2012); Daldeniz and Hampton (2013) and Hamzah and Hampton (2013) before introducing new analysis that is 'work in progress.' Finally, the paper concludes by considering lessons for other destinations in South-East Asia learning from success, and helping avoid mistakes being repeated."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Hot beaches, cool cities. Tourism and economic development in South-East Asia.International tourism is booming across South-East Asia with rapid growth rates and more than 93 ... more International tourism is booming across South-East Asia with rapid growth rates and more than 93 million international arrivals in 2013 (UN WTO, 2014). Long-established destinations such as Thailand and Indonesia face growing competition from new destinations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and, most recently, Myanmar. As a region, South-East Asia hosts a great variety of tourism forms, from luxury, high-end resorts to backpackers and independent travellers and specialist eco-tourism and homestays.  This paper explores the rise of international tourism from its earliest days in the colonial period through the overland 'hippy trail' to the emergence of modern mass tourism and integrated resorts. The paper then discusses the main socio-economic impacts of the rapid growth of tourism in the region and highlights key sectors such as ecotourism, conventional mass tourism and the growth of regional and domestic tourism. The paper ends by considering the future of tourism in South-East Asia.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper outlines the key socio-economic impacts of international tourism using case study material from research projects undertaken in South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean with examples cited from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Seychelles and Vietnam. The paper examines economic linkages to local communities, the benefits (and costs) of hosting small-scale tourism, and the challenge of minimising economic leakages from less developed countries.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper explores the economic benefits and costs for local communities but also suggests that an explicitly multi-sectoral approach is necessary to facilitate a managed mass tourism sector operating alongside niche tourism such as eco-tourism or community-based tourism. This should take place within a framework of responsible tourism and will require an integrated approach and regular monitoring.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Governments of small islands in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean and Pacific have seemingly put most of their eggs in one development basket – the all-inclusive holiday in a luxury hotel, resort or cruise ship. While this industry generates employment, foreign direct investment, and income for the government and private sector, it also brings with it dependencies borne from the transnational ownership of these all-inclusive accommodations, and risks from exogenous factors, many of which are tied to the wider security of the global system as well as the domestic economies in the main source markets in Europe and North America. We reflect upon these dependencies and risks through a case study of the Seychelles based on detailed qualitative and quantitative fieldwork research conducted in May 2012. Our findings highlight that the international tourism industry in the Seychelles – even in a situation of high or growing demand – creates structurally driven precarity for tourism workers who are predominantly low paid, low-skilled, and increasingly recruited from overseas. These findings contribute new empirical evidence that can contribute to ongoing conceptual debates in IPE around the internationalisation of the state.  We believe that there is no better evidence of this phenomenon in the contemporary international political economy than the growth of tourism in small island states in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere.         Key words: international political economy; island economies; precarious work; tourism; SeychellesSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Bio-rock and roll? Dive Tourism and Island Communities: the case of Gili Trawangan, Indonesia.by Mark  Hampton and Julia  Jeyacheya""Tourism in Gili Trawangan, located off Lombok, Indonesia, appears to be moving upmarket, progre... more ""Tourism in Gili Trawangan, located off Lombok, Indonesia, appears to be moving upmarket, progressing up the resort life cycle (Butler, 1980). The destination has changed from being a backpackers’ ‘party island’ (Hampton and Hampton, 2009) to increasingly hosting dive tourism and more upmarket tourists. This paper reports part of a longitudinal study that began with fieldwork in the 1990s (Hampton, 1998) and was updated with more recent fieldwork in late 2011. Direct fast boat access from Bali has facilitated rapidly growing tourist arrivals and the number of dive operators has increased significantly, as has the supply of accommodation, restaurants and other facilities. The island’s coral reefs and marine resources have been under pressure from rapid tourism growth, and local responses have included forming an NGO - Gili Eco Trust – to better manage the resource (Graci, 2013). However, Indonesia’s changing political economy demonstrates a complex mix of actors and influences, with divergence between adat (traditional law) and commercial pressures, and this acts in combination with layers of governance under decentralisation. The result is that island tourism, and dive tourism in particular, is operating within a challenging and fast-changing political economy which has serious implications for future sustainability of this island destination. ""Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This lecture from a leading international academic expert, presents recent research which shows the significant impacts of backpacker tourism and how this can drive local economic development. Backpackers and independent travellers are typically 'under the radar' of tourism policy makers, yet international research has shown this sector to have extensive and powerful economic linkages to many local businesses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For data compilers key challenges include: data collection and/or collation issues and technical issues. these can lead to significant data gaps in tourism statistics for small islands. In particular more needs to be known about economic linkages, leakages and expenditure patterns. For data users such as policy-makers, the key challenges can include the lack of good, detailed and robust data on island tourism overall and these knowledge gaps can seriously affect evidence- based policy making for the tourism sector .Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, since de Kadt (1979) asked whether tourism was a ‘passport to development’, debate has moved from focussing on economic impacts, to broader discussion of long-term sustainability and environmental concerns including climate change (Graci and Dodds, 2010). Nevertheless, international arrivals and receipts continued to rise year on year and tourism was seen as an expanding sector suitable for island and small state development. 2009 saw the first significant fall in international arrivals since 1950 as the global recession began to be felt (UNWTO, 2010). Continuing economic turbulence has significantly slowed international tourism’s growth but the results are spatially uneven.  This paper examines key issues now facing island and small state tourism, with reflections drawn from policy-relevant research. It explores the key issues of tourism in times of economic uncertainty; its relationships with other industries; product diversification; and responsible/sustainable tourism."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The growth of this region has radically altered the global tourism landscape and contributed to new modes of tourism practice, while engendering a decentering of Anglo-Western centrism in tourism theory. In this inaugural conference of the Critical Tourism Studies Asia Pacific network (CTS-AP), we seek to draw attention to the multiple modalities and recenterings of critical tourism scholarship. See full call for papers here. We are accepting workshops, films and other non-traditional presentation formats. Confirmed films so far include Waiting for John (Jessica Sherry) and Paradise Paradigm (Britta Boyer). Additionally, several workshops will be offered (e.g. travel writing by Lonely Planet authors) and tourism related films will be shown at the conference.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
