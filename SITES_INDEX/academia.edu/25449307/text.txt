(Hilmi S. Salem, et al.)Hilmi S.  Salem (Prof. Dr.)FOR CITATION: UNEP 2016. GEO-6 (Sixth Global Environment Outlook) Regional Assessment for West Asia. United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi, Kenya. 145 Pages. (Hilmi S. Salem: Coordinating Lead Author, Lead Author, and Main Contributor, See Pages: 143 and 145). ABSTRACT: The GEO-6 Regional Assessment1 for West Asia2 is guided by seven regional priorities: water, land, marine resources, biodiversity, air, climate change and waste management. These were identified by member States and stakeholders at the Regional Environmental Information Network (REIN) Conference held in Amman, 10-14 May 2015. Along with the identified regional priorities, 2 themes governed the West Asia assessment report; Peace, Security and Environment, along with the water, energy and food nexus. This document provides a summary of key findings and policy messages. State and Trends of the West Asia Environment: Following trends highlighted in previous editions of the GEO report series, the current analysis of drivers, pressures, state, impact and responses of the West Asia environment, shows that a holistic and integrated approach is needed to identify challenges related to the environment and address the two themes. Several regional environmental challenges that are continuing include: • Despite some efforts on integrated water resource management and the short lived solutions applied for managing increasing water demand, there is deteriorating water quality, in addition to persistent overexploitation of groundwater resources; • Shared water resources continue to be a source of major regional concern due to lack of regional cooperation; • Unsustainable consumption patterns threaten water, energy and food security; • Biodiversity loss, desertification and ecosystem degradation are ongoing challenges; • Air pollution continues to greatly impact human health and the environment; • Waste management continues to be addressed through ad-hoc initiatives without an integrated waste management outlook; • Energy efficiency and energy mix continue to be a priority; and • The environment continues to be threatened by and a cause for lack of peace and security and increasing levels of conflicts.Download Free PDFView PDFSICK WATER? THE CENTRAL ROLE OF WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT A RAPID RESPONSE ASSESSMENTDavid OsbornThe world is facing a global water quality crisis. Continuing population growth and urbanisation, rapid industralisation, and expanding and intensifying food production are all putting pressure on water resources and increasing the unregulated or illegal discharge of contaminated water within and beyond national borders. This presents a global threat to human health and wellbeing, with both immediate and long term consequences for efforts to reduce poverty whilst sustaining the integrity of some of our most productive ecosystems. There are many causes driving this crisis, but it is clear that freshwater and coastal ecosystems across the globe, upon which humanity has depended for millennia, are increasingly threatened. It is equally clear that future demands for water cannot be met unless wastewater management is revolutionized.Download Free PDFView PDF33 Governance: Legal and Institutional Frameworks bACkgrOund And COntextRuth NjugunaDownload Free PDFView PDFRegional Assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in Eastern and Southern AfricaJohn MathewDownload Free PDFView PDFForesight Report-21 Issues for the 21st CenturyDesalegn AregaDownload Free PDFView PDFOcean & Coastal ManagementNine nations, one ocean: A benchmark appraisal of the South Western Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (2008–2012)2009 • Johan Groeneveld, F.
