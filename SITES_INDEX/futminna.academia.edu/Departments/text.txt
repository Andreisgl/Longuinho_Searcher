Cloud computing is the delivery of hosting services that are provided to clients over the web. It is quite common, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that may be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Sensitive information on the cloud is developing unexpectedly and bringing up several challenges and massive security concerns of the modern-day world. The cloud data and services reside in massively scalable data centers and may be accessed ubiquitously. Some issues concern in accessing this data is the security and confidentiality of consumer dat...Save to LibraryDownloadby Aliu  Daniel•  3  Computer Science, Encryption, Cloud ComputingStructual analysis of ball-on-sphere system using bond graph techniqueThis paper presents the novel structural analysis of ball-on-sphere system using bond graph technique.

The structural analyses carried out are controllability and observability of the system. To achieve these analyses, the system was modelled using bond graph modelling technique. In the modelling procedures, the various subsystems, storage elements, junction structures, transformer elements with appropriate causality assignments and energy exchange that make up the ball-on-sphere system were identified and modelled. The structural controllability and observability properties of the system were carried out on the developed causal bond graph model of the system based on bond graph rules. From the structural analyses, it was established that the developed model was controllable and observable.Save to Libraryby Aliu  Daniel•Computer ScienceComparative Performance Analysis of  Selected Routing Algorithms by Load Variation of 2-Dimensional Mesh Topology Based  Network-On-ChipNetwork-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed as a viable solution to the communication challenges on System-on-Chips (SoCs).

As the communication paradigm of SoC, NoCs performance depends mainly on the type of routing algorithm chosen. In this paper different categories of routing algorithms were compared. These include XY routing, OE turn model adaptive routing, DyAD routing and Age-Aware adaptive routing.  By varying the load at different Packet Injection Rate (PIR) under random traffic pattern, comparison was conducted using a 4 × 4 mesh topology. The Noxim simulator, a cycle accurate systemC based simulator was employed. The packets were modeled as a Poisson distribution; first-in-first-out (FIFO) input buffer channel with a depth of five (5) flits and a flit size of 32 bits; and a packet size of 3 flits respectively. The simulation time was 10,000 cycles. The findings showed that the XY routing algorithm performed better when the PIR is low.  In a similar vein, the DyAD routing and ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Aliu  Daniel•Educational FinTech: Promoting Stakeholder Confidence Through Automatic Incidence ResolutionSave to Libraryby Aliu  Daniel•  3  Computer Science, Workflow, PaymentA Qos Estimation Algorithm from Caller Ringtone Analysis in GSM NetworkCall Setup Time (CST) is one of the key performance indicators (KPIs) that Mobile Network Providers (MNPs) are mostly appertain.

It has been established that long CST usually severely affects the user experience. Owing to the limitations associated with gleaning the CST data from MNPs, this paper provides the development of QoS estimation algorithm from various CST parameters. The algorithm involves the determination of CST; Inter-Burst time; Intra-Burst time and Call duration in time domain. The caller Frequency content was also determined by the application of fast Fourier Transform before computing the Mean Square Error (MSE). The eventual QoS rating is done after the computation of the MSE from various individual parameters. Four hourly data consisting of 10 sets each were collected three times in a week for four weeks for each MNP’s for creating Caller Ringtone dataset and testing the developed algorithm.

Hence, the 5G slice networks should be as flexible as possible to accommodate the different network dynamics such as of user location and distribution, different slice use case QoS requirement, cell load, intra-cluster interference and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) Service Level Agreement (SLA). Motivated by this, this paper addresses a latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem for 5G Slice Networks in a multi-tenant multi-tier heterogeneous environment, for efficient radio resource allocation. The latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem.

We first report on the comorbidities and symptoms found in a cohort of 845 South African Long COVID/PASC patients who filled in the South African Long COVID/PASC registry, of which hypertension and high cholesterol levels (dyslipidaemia) were the most important comorbidities. The gender balance (70% female) and the most commonly reported Long COVID/PASC symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, loss of concentration and forgetfulness, shortness of breath, as well as joint and muscle pains) were comparable to those reported elsewhere. This suggests that our sample was not at all atypical.

We explore the social-awareness of the network operators to efficiently match users during any form of peer-to-peer communication. Thus, we proposed a peer-selection scheme to improve the overall utility of the network amid limited spectral resources while exploiting the social-ties of network users’. Consequently, we formulate a utility maximization problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem to be solved using genetic algorithm. We perform extensive Monte-Carlo simulations alongside several meta-heuristic algorithms for comparison. The results reveal that our proposed scheme is a good candidate to appreciably and significantly improve the expected utility and network performance.Save to Libraryby sunday oladejo•  2  Computer Science, Resource AllocationMulti-tier multi-tenant network slicing: A multi-domain games approachThe 5G slice networks will play a critical role in meeting the stringent quality-of-service requirements of different use cases, reducing the Capital Expenditure (CapEX) and Operational Expenditure (OpEX) of mobile network operators.... moreThe 5G slice networks will play a critical role in meeting the stringent quality-of-service requirements of different use cases, reducing the Capital Expenditure (CapEX) and Operational Expenditure (OpEX) of mobile network operators. Owing to the flexibility and ability of 5G slice networks to meet the needs of different verticals, it attracts new network players and entities to the mobile network ecosystem, and therefore it creates new business models and structures. Motivated by this development, this paper addresses the dynamic resource allocation in a multi-slice multi-tier multi-domain network with different network players. The dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem from a multiplayer multi-domain perspective.

The dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem from multi-player multi-domain perspective. Furthermore, a 3-level hierarchical business model comprising infrastructure providers (InPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), service providers (SP) and slice users is investigated. We propose a multi-tier multi-domain slice user matching game and a distributed backtracking multi-player multi-domain game schemes in solving the transformed maximum utility optimisation problem. We compare the multi-tier multi-tenant multi-domain game scheme with a genetic algorithm (GA) intelligent latency- aware resource allocation scheme (GI-LARE) and, a static slicing resource allocation scheme via Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms these other schemes.Save to Libraryby sunday oladejo•  2  Computer Science, Resource AllocationRF EMF Radiation Exposure Assessment of 5G Networks: Analysis, Computation and Mitigation MethodsThis paper presents the impact of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation exposure induced by wireless networks, most importantly 5G cellular networks for both the uplink and downlink radio emissions using exposure... moreThis paper presents the impact of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation exposure induced by wireless networks, most importantly 5G cellular networks for both the uplink and downlink radio emissions using exposure index-based power control algorithm (EIPCA), a novel simulation method that quantifies the realistic electromagnetic exposure of the human user. The exposure index (EI) is used to characterize the EMF exposure taking in account the power density, specific absorption rate (SAR); using both the electric field strength and magnetic field strength as well as considering the variability of other factors such as environment, the conductivity and the mass density of tissue. This work aims at simulating the radiations emitted from access points (APs) and mobile devices, analyzing and comparing them with the threshold set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) for the understanding of radiation impact. The numerical results reveal that the maximum radiation exposure emitted is far lower than the ICNIRP standard. It is shown that the exposure from mobile devices (uplink) has more EI compared with the ones due with the transmitting stations (downlink) radio emissions, and both can be minimized when there is an optimal power control scheme in the network as revealed in the power density received from the APs. Moreover, it compares the exposure level in both the fourth-generation (4G) and the fifth-generation (5G) networks, this will increase the health awareness concerning radiation exposure of 5G networks to the general public.Save to Libraryby sunday oladejo•Computer ScienceJournal of Science, Technology, Mathematics and Education (JOSTMED), 14(), March, 2018MEDUGU, J.
