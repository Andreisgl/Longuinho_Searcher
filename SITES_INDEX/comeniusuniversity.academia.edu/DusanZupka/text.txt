The contributions examine the legitimation of rule of the first local dynasties, the ritual practice of power, the ruling strategies and practices of power in the established monarchies, and the manifold influences on the rulership in East Central Europe from outside the region (such as from Byzantium, and the Holy Roman Empire). The collection shows that these ideas and practices enabled the new polities to become legitimate members of Latin Christendom.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Particular attention is paid to symbolic acts such as festive coronations, liturgical praises, welcoming of rulers ( adventus regis), ritualised settlement of disputes, and symbolic rites during encounters between rulers. The power and meaning of rituals were understandable to contemporary protagonists and to their chroniclers. These rituals therefore played an essential role in medieval political culture. The book concludes with an outline of ritual communication as a coherent system.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The realms of East Central Europe witnessed augmented use of rituals of war, holy war rhetoric and crusading ideology in the course of their political, cultural and military integration to the sphere of the Latin Christendom. This book deals with the political, religious and social framework of religiouswarfare and its influences on rulership in medieval East Central Europe. The religious rites of war performed before the battle or directly on the battlefield and the symbolical meaning attached to them by the chroniclers in their renditions of the events resulted in a complex picture of a real liturgy of war. Rulers from Bohemia, Poland and Hungary used tools of religious warfare to legitimize their political position and tostrengthen their rule.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Royal funeral ceremonies in fourteenth century Central EuropeForum historiae,  2023Death and dying were a ubiquitous reality of the world of medieval society, with lasting effects ... more Death and dying were a ubiquitous reality of the world of medieval society, with lasting effects on the living from all social groups in equal measure. However, for the rulers of the day, the process of dying and the subsequent burial was an important social, political and cultural event. Over time, special funerary ceremonial complexes developed that included a variety of rituals and symbols which indicated the status and importance of the medieval monarchs. This paper compares the funerary rituals and symbols of power on display during the processions of three Central European kings: King Charles I Robert of Hungary (1342) in Visegrád, Buda and Szkésfehérvár, Polish King Casimir III the Great (1370) in Kraków and Bohemian King and Roman Emperor Charles IV (1378) in Prague. Each of these monumental events included a number of common motifs and ritual sequences, though at the same time, local flavour or innovations always came into play. The common denominator of these three ceremonies was that in the spirit of the political theology of the time, all referenced the immortality of the sovereign power and its timeless essence, which sprung from a sacred character sanctioned by God's grace.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Polish, Hungarian and Bohemian rulers and their family members used holy wars as a means of territorial expansion against pagan neighbours, and thus the spreading of the power and influence of their own monarchy. At the same time, they in this way integrated their dynastic possessions into Latin Christianity. What’s more, they also had defensive-preventive importance, since they protected their lands on the one hand from the expansion of the neighbours and on the other hand from incursions and looting of pagan ethnic groups living beyond the borders. All these aspects subsequently helped the sacralization of the local ruling dynasties and reinforced their standing both at home and abroad. The consequences for rulership and the ruling ideology in the presentation by period sources were thus threefold: they provided legitimacy, sacralization and the integration of ruling power.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since the creation of the Christian monarchy, religion, Christian rhetoric, and religious rituals have been present on the battlefields of Árpád rulers. Similar pre- and post-battle religious rites were well-knownto rulers in Central Europe, as they were also attested in many cases in neighbouring Poland and Bohemia. Support from heavenly powers was sought before decisive military encounters. This was done either by celebrating masses, the administration of the Eucharist, provision of special clerical (episcopal) benedictions for the belligerents and their arms, or by spontaneous imploration of aid from God and His saints. The Virgin Mary had a preeminent place in this respect. Besides the Mother of God, Árpád kings and dukes also sought intercession from traditional military saints such as St. Martin and St. George. In later periods, they also looked up to homegrown dynastic patrons—Saint Stephen, St. Ladislaus, and St. Emeric. In spite of the (relative) lack of contemporarysources for Árpád-era Hungary, the role, meaning, and structure of religious rites of war do not appear to have differed substantially from neighbouring Central and East Central European realms of the period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The present study will focus exclusively on the role of the cathedral as a ritual centre, not only for the city, but also for the whole realm.

Religion, Christian rhetoric, and religious rituals were present on the battlefields of Christian rulers since the adoption of Christianity in Late Antique Roman Empire. Pre- and post-battle religious rites as developed during the Carolingian and Ottonian period were well-known to rulers in virtually all parts of the Latin Christendom. Support from heavenly powers was sought before decisive militaryencounters. This was done either by celebrating masses, the administration of the Eucharist, provision of special clerical (episcopal) benedictions for the belligerents and their arms, or by spontaneous imploration of aid from God and His saints. A group of military saints (Michael, George, Demetrius, Denis, Martin) and Virgin Mary had a preeminent place in this respect, perceived as Schlachtenhelfer. The article draws on rich examples from the early and high medieval sources, especially depicting the military conflicts between Christian troops and their pagan opponents (Carolingians against Avars, Ottonians against Magyars, Crusaders against Muslims, etc.).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Religion, Christian rhetoric, and religious rituals were present on the battlefields of Christian rulers since the adoption of Christianity in Late Antique Roman Empire. Pre- and post-battle religious rites as developed during the Carolingian and Ottonian period were well-known to rulers in virtually all parts of the Latin Christendom. Support from heavenly powers was sought before decisive militaryencounters. This was done either by celebrating masses, the administration of the Eucharist, provision of special clerical (episcopal) benedictions for the belligerents and their arms, or by spontaneous imploration of aid from God and His saints. A group of military saints (Michael, George, Demetrius, Denis, Martin) and Virgin Mary had a preeminent place in this respect, perceived as Schlachtenhelfer. The article draws on rich examples from the early and high medieval sources, especially depicting the military conflicts between Christian troops and their pagan opponents (Carolingians against Avars, Ottonians against Magyars, Crusaders against Muslims, etc.).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We tried to give an overview of the vast corpus of genealogical literature, sermons, treaties, depictions and artistic representations dating to the sixteenth and early seventeenth century.  What appears as evident is that the Jagiellonian identity in the genealogies of the Holy Roman Empire is first and foremost regnal.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
AIUNT NON VOS ESSE PAPAM, SED ME.

Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153) belongs to the most important historical figures of the first half of the twelfth century. Almost 500 letters were preserved form his monumental works until today. These letters were sent to most important personalities of the secular and spiritual world of his day. This article seeks to analyse and interpret the relation of Saint Bernard with popes as leader of the Catholic Church and with the papacy as an institution destined to lead the faithful to the eternal salvation. The abbot of Clairvaux kept vivid contacts with all the popes reigning between 1124 and 1153. In the case of Innocent II and Eugene III one can say that he even actively enabled their instalment on the throne of St. Peter. Just like in the case of monasticism, episcopate or lay princes, Bernard took a similar approach towards the popes. He enforced his vision of the papacy. Bernard was also able to transform these visions to real life and so he exercised a double impact on the most important institution of the Christian world.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Medieval Dynasties in Medieval Studies: A Historiographic ContributionForum Historiae,  2019The article provides an overview of the current research on the notion, idea and perception of dy... more The article provides an overview of the current research on the notion, idea and perception of dynasties in medieval Europe. It deals with a variety of studies and books that focus on dynasty and dynastichistorical writing within Central Europe, as well as outside this region. The main goal is to provide a selection of examples of how the notion of dynasty can be used in current historiographic discourse. First and foremost, dynasty in medieval studies seems to be (to a certain extent) another intellectual construct applied to the period in question. Just like any other similar concepts, like medieval, feudalism, ritual, community, etc., it helps historians to describe our modern understanding of the phenomena. As a result, dynasty has become a highly fashionable term and a popular recurring theme used in the historiography of the Middle Ages. Medieval dynasties are defined based on family, kinship and shared tradition. In fact, they should not be seen only as a biological line of relatives, but, even more importantly, as a political construct. Last, but by no means least, dynasty should always be scrutinized in connectionwith genealogy, idoneity and legitimacy.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses on the neighbouring realms of Bohemia, Hungary and Austria in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (c. 1250 – c. 1350). It argues that the ruling communities were formed from diverse political groups, most prominently represented by the ruler and his entourage (dynasty, court) on the one hand and the elites (both lay and spiritual) on the other. The rule (lordship) over a particular realm was a mixture of co-operation, competition and compromise between these groups. Secondly, these political communities therefore felt the constant need for public representation of their status, rank and symbolic role within the society. Effective ways to express belonging to a political group included a range of symbols, gestures and specific rhetoric.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Their place in historical consciousness gradually shifted from centrality to a genuinely marginal, if not completely neglected, position. The memory of Jagiellonian princesses also remained present in most of these lands for practical reasons. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries these memories became a potent weapon in the succession crises and inheritance disputes of several German princely houses. This essay attempts to sketch theessential paths and crucial moments of the long journey of the Jagiellonians, from high estimation to neglect and disappearance in the memory of the German-speaking lands.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The contributors analyze cultures that lay outside Charle-magne's limes and the frontiers of the Byzantine Empire, to consider a region stretching from the Balkans to the south, through Hungary and the Slavic lands (Poland, Bohemia, Rus), to the Baltic coastline with Polabia, Pomerania, Prussia, and Estonia, and reaching into Scandinavia. The volume considers clerics as military leaders and propagandists, the role of Christian ritual and doctrine in warfare, and the adaptation and transformation of indigenous military cultures. It uncovers new information on perceptions of war and analyzes how local practices were incorporated into clerical narratives, enabling the reader to achieve a complete understanding of the period. CONTENTS:Christianity and War in Medieval East Central Europe and Scandinavia: An Introduction -- RADOSŁAW KOTECKI, CARSTEN SELCH JENSEN, and STEPHEN BENNETTPART ONE: THE CHURCH AND WARChapter 1.
