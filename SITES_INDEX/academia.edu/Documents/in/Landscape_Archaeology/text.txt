We examine the anthropogenic landscape of the ancient port of Macurany, located along the middle Amazon River in Parintins, Brazil, and identify four classes of anthropogenic landscape features at the site: wharfs, middens, terra preta (dark or black earths), and cultural forests. Middens, terra preta, and cultural forests have been found at archaeological sites in regions surrounding Macurany, but wharfs have not previously been reported in Amazonian contexts predating European contact. Taken together, these features are clearly the result of anthropogenesis and represent a range of subsistence, settlement, and infrastructure-building activities pointing to an ancient society that was actively engaged in modifying the surrounding landscape for purposes beyond settlement and subsistence.

The full text is available here: https://www.barpublishing.com/gis-applications-in-roman-landscape-and-territory.htmlThe Bay of Cadiz has historically been characterised as a very dynamic socio-natural space. The current landscape is the result of a series of natural phenomena such as erosion, sedimentation and the influence of the tides, to which must be added intense anthropic action. For the High Imperial Roman period, mobility in this area must have been complex, as there are several elements to take into account: several areas of intertidal influence, where rivers and tidal channels converge, as well as the configuration of the coastline up to the city of Gades, elements that were very sensitive to anthropic modifications such as the construction of the main Roman roads and the aqueduct that supplied water to the city. This configuration makes the space comprising the Bay of Cadiz ideal for testing, through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the potential mobility that would have taken place in ancient times. To this end, this article reconstructs the palaeoenvironment of Cadiz through the creation of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), defining the different conditions of mobility for a given case, and assigning different forms of mobility (terrestrial, fluvial, intertidal and maritime). Finally, the articulation of this space is discussed, using a "Model of Accumulation of Optimal Displacements from an Origin" (MADO)Save to LibraryDownloadby Francisco Javier Catalán González and +1Pedro Trapero Fernandez•  4  Landscape Archaeology, Gades, Bay of Cádiz, Mobility AnalysisO navio seiscentista Arade 1: resultados preliminares das intervenções arqueológicas de 2004 e 2005R E S U M O A relocalização no verão de 2001 de um dos mais importantes navios antigos jamais descobertos em Portugal, desaparecido após a sua semidestruição por dragagens em 1970, tornou-se, desde logo, uma das primeiras prioridades do... moreR E S U M O A relocalização no verão de 2001 de um dos mais importantes navios antigos jamais descobertos em Portugal, desaparecido após a sua semidestruição por dragagens em 1970, tornou-se, desde logo, uma das primeiras prioridades do CNANS, a qual tem vindo ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Vanessa Loureiro•  2  Humanities, ArtÅlyst.

During the surveys, 102 new archaeological sites were discovered (see Fig. 1). Two sites date back to the Late Chalcolithic period, four to the Late Bronze Age, and nine small settlements to the Early Iron Age. These settlements were located along the banks of the Aheloy River and Hadzhiiska River. The majority of the sites (51 settlements) date back to the second half of the 1st millennium BC. Eleven settlements were dated to the Archaic and Classical periods, and ten to the Hellenistic period.

These tools are especially powerful when ground-truthed through excavation and survey, and when informed by local environmental histories. This response engages with propositions put forward by Hammer (2022): "Multicentric, Marsh-based urbanism at the early Mesopotamian city of Lagash (Tell al-Hiba)." Using a mix of UAV photography and magnetic gradiometry data, Hammer argues that Lagash was a marsh-based city toward the end of the Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia (c. 2,900-2,292 BCE), and that on-site habitation had previously been restricted to points of high elevation because of excess water. Fundamental geoarchaeological and chronometric data, however, are absent. Based on evidence from previous excavations and general conditions of site preservation, we review Hammer's interpretations, including the validity and reliability of the data that the paper uses to advance its arguments. Ongoing work at that site has the potential substantially to enhance our understanding of ancient urbanism. Ultimately, this response seeks to rectify basic principles of chronology, taphonomy, and paleoenvironment at Lagash, and to highlight the importance of verifiable representation in the presentation of remotely-sensed datasets.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul C .

Pacific Island sedimentology provides an invaluable record of geomorphic and environmental consequences of coastal evolution in response to changes in sea level and local tectonics. A series of coastal auger cores obtained from eastern ʻUpolu reveal a subsurface carbonate sand envelope predominately composed of coral and coralline algae derived from the reef framework. Coupling the sedimentological record with geophysical models of Holocene sea level, we identify a critical value (0.3–1.0 m) during the falling phase of the sea-level high stand (1899–2103 cal yr BP) that represents the transition from a transgressive to a regressive environment and initiates coastal progradation. Correlating the critical value with time, we observe nearly a millennium of coastal plain development is required before a small human population is esta...Save to LibraryDownloadby Ethan Cochrane•  7  Archaeology, Geology, Oceanography, SedimentologyHow is visibility important for defence?

They are knownas Kuyavian barrows because of their frequent presence inthe Kuyavia region in central Poland. In Greater Poland,they were known from antiquarian records dating back tothe 19th century. However, contemporary surveys carriedout in open arable fields did not bring positive results. It islikely that the enclosing erratic boulders were removed atthe turn of the 19th and 20th centuries by farmers, and themounds quickly destroyed as a result of ploughing and erosion.A breakthrough in the search for earthen long barrowsin Poland was the introduction of airborne LiDAR (LightDetection and Ranging) survey and the public disclosureof the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data collected bythe governmental institutions for the purpose of naturaldisasters modelling. It resulted in the discovery of numerousarchaeological sites, including earthen long barrows,preserved in woodlands.The article discusses the results of previous archaeologicalresearch and archive material surveys, and selected casestudies of the newly discovered clusters of earthen longbarrows on the Szamotuły Plain in the central part of theGreater Poland region, and also on the Kleczew Plain inthe eastern part of the region, neighbouring with Kuyavia.The shortcomings of using ALS data in archaeology, andlimitations of woodland and fieldwalking surveys, are alsoreviewed. In conclusion, we argue that the number of earthenlong barrows suggest that the construction of them, andthe practice of burying the dead in them, was a commonpractice of the Middle Neolithic Funnel Beaker societiesin northern Poland.Save to LibraryDownloadby Łukasz Pospieszny•  4  Megalithic Monuments, Long barrows and chambered barrows, Neolithic Europe, LiDAR for Landscape ArchaeologySmelting Experiments with Chalcopyrite Ore based on Evidence from the Eastern AlpsIn order to assess the fractionation of copper isotopes during smelting under reconstructed conditions, smelting experiments with chalcopyrite ore were conducted in built furnaces based on archaeometallurgical evidence from the Bronze Age... moreIn order to assess the fractionation of copper isotopes during smelting under reconstructed conditions, smelting experiments with chalcopyrite ore were conducted in built furnaces based on archaeometallurgical evidence from the Bronze Age Eastern Alps and ethnographic examples from Nepal. Two experimental series, S2 and S4 were chosen for analysis. Each series consisted of a number of roasting and smelting experiments with different experimental parameters, and both series yielded metallic copper. Each type of experiment, their outcomes, and observations made during them are described in detail to facilitate future experimental work. Both series differ significantly in their outcome. XRD analyses and chemical analyses were carried out to reveal the reasons for the observed differences.  The chemistry of the obtained matte shows that roasting is pivotal for a successful smelting process and that two cycles of matte roasting and subsequent smelting can be sufficient to remove most of ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Erica Hanning•  17  Archaeology, Experimental Archaeology, Prehistoric Archaeology, MetallurgyCorrection: Life and death of a leprosy sufferer from the 8th-century-CE cemetery of Kiskundorozsma–Kettőshatár I (Duna-Tisza Interfluve, Hungary)—Biological and social consequences of having Hansen’s disease in a late Avar Age population from HungarySave to LibraryDownloadby Erika Molnar•  3  Multidisciplinary, Leprosy, PLoS oneEl Entorno Arqueológico De La Camareta (Hellín, Albacete)Save to LibraryDownloadby Juan Jordan•  5  Geography, Archaeology, Art, PrehistoryTel 'Ein Jezreel in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Periods: New Finds, New Insights (contact me for a copy)Recent survey and excavation of Tel 'Ein Jezreel, located in the Jezreel Valley directly above the spring of 'Ein Jezreel, revealed evidence for settlement from the Neolithic Period through the modern era.

While most of the finds date to the Early Bronze Age, there is also substantial evidence for settlement in the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. This essay presents some of the pottery, flint, and ground stone artifacts from the Yarmukian culture of the Pottery Neolithic period, the Wadi Rabah culture of the Late Pottery Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic, and the Ghassulian culture of the Late Chalcolithic period.

By the reconstruction of these dimensions of a community it is possible to understand not only the aspects linked to the exploitation of a territory, the subsistence and demography of a given group, but also more generally the group’s social organization itself. With a series of GIS tools, capable of applying the FAO’s land evaluation techniques, it has been possible to generate a predictive raster model of the landscape with the degree of agro-pastoral suitability inside each cell. Thanks to this model, the agro-pastoral exploitation of a territory can be simulated, calculating the food production of each settlement, as well as the consequent demography maximum sustainability. Thanks to the identification of specialized productions sites and of settlements capable of producing a ‘surplus’, or vice versa ‘not-self-sufficient’, it will be possible to articulate socio-political models, hypothesizing exchange networks or relationships between the different sites. The text illustrates in detail the structure and functioning of the developed model, as well as its applications in the archaeological context of the ‘Ager Tarquiniorum’ during the Final Bronze Age.Save to LibraryDownloadby Agostino Sotgia•  8  Archaeology, Landscape Archaeology, Ancient Agriculture & Farming (Archaeology), Early Iron AgeModelling the Landscape.

Knowledge of its political setting, structure, and conflicts is necessary for an understanding of the rice economy and government policies toward it. One needs a model in which the relationships, variables, and parameters are political as well as economic. A number of important developments in the rice economy-changes in prices, production, consumption, farmers&#39; incomes, and so on-may be traced to changes in the political components of the model. This paper is an attempt to inventory components for such a model, within the context of the New Society, i.e., the government from September 21, 1972 (when the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand E. Marcos, declared martial law and thereby assumed vast powers) up to the present writing.

According to legend, the Hill of Udine (NE Italy) was built by Attila the Hun’s soldiers, but its origin (natural or anthropogenic) has been debated until now. Our research analyzed five new 40-m long stratigraphic cores, investigating for the first time the total thickness of the hill and compared the data with the available archaeological information. Moreover, we considered other hills and mounds in northern Italy and other European regions where folklore traditions relate their origin to Attila. The geoarchaeological and ethnographic data prove that the Hill of Udine is a Bronze Age anthropogenic mound erected between 1400 and 1150 BCE and that, later, folklore has transformed the ancestral memory of its origin into legend.
