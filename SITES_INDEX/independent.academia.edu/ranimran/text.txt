We find that the fraction of J/psi coming from the feed-down decay of psi' and chi_c in the midrapidity region ($|\eta|<0.35$) is 9.6+/-2.4% and 32+/-9%, respectively. We also report new, higher statistics p_T and rapidity dependencies of the J/psi yield via dielectron decay in the same midrapidity range and at forward rapidity (1.2<|eta|<2.4) via dimuon decay. These results are compared with measurements from other experiments and discussed in the context of current charmonium production models.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Azimuthal correlations of electrons from heavy-flavor decay with hadrons in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeVMeasurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have shown that the yields a... more Measurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to expectations from binary scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot-dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side jet suppression is consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain two-particle azimuthal correlations at sqrt(s_NN)=$200 GeV between electrons from heavy-flavor decay with charged hadrons in p+p and also first results in Au+Au collisions. We find the away-side-jet shape and yield to be modified in Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Suppression of away-side jet fragments with respect to the reaction plane in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeVPair correlations between large transverse momentum neutral pion triggers (p_T=4--7 GeV/c) and ch... more Pair correlations between large transverse momentum neutral pion triggers (p_T=4--7 GeV/c) and charged hadron partners (p_T=3--7 GeV/c) in central (0--20%) and midcentral (20--60%) Au+Au collisions are presented as a function of trigger orientation with respect to the reaction plane. The particles are at larger momentum than where jet shape modifications have been observed, and the correlations are sensitive to the energy loss of partons traveling through hot dense matter. An out-of-plane trigger particle produces only 26+/-20% of the away-side pairs that are observed opposite of an in-plane trigger particle. In contrast, near-side jet fragments are consistent with no suppression or dependence on trigger orientation with respect to the reaction plane. These observations are qualitatively consistent with a picture of little near-side parton energy loss either due to surface bias or fluctuations and increased away-side parton energy loss due to a long path through the medium. The away-side suppression as a function of reaction-plane angle is shown to be sensitive to both the energy loss mechanism in and the space-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Cold Nuclear Matter Effects on J/psi Yields as a Function of Rapidity and Nuclear Geometry in Deuteron-Gold Collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeVWe present measurements of J/psi yields in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV recorded by th... more We present measurements of J/psi yields in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV recorded by the PHENIX experiment and compare with yields in p+p collisions at the same energy per nucleon-nucleon collision. The measurements cover a large kinematic range in J/psi rapidity (-2.2 < y < 2.4) with high statistical precision and are compared with two theoretical models: one with nuclear shadowing combined with final state breakup and one with coherent gluon saturation effects. To remove model dependent systematic uncertainties we also compare the data to a simple geometric model. We find that calculations where the nuclear modification is linear or exponential in the density weighted longitudinal thickness are difficult to reconcile with the forward rapidity data.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this protocol, a special function which is a combination of a picture function and a distortion function e.g. CAPTCHA, is combined to authenticate the user and protect the password from the dictionary attacks that are major threats for most of the weak password-based protocols. They claim that the proposed protocol is secure against some well known attacks. However Tang and Mitchell show that the protocol suffers from an offline dictionary attack requiring a machine-based search of size 223 which takes only about 2.3 hours. So designing such a protocol with providing practical security against offline attack is still an open problem. In this study, we introduce two password-based authenticated key establishment protocols that provide practical security against offline dictionary attacks by only using symmetric key cryptography.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Measurements \omega and \phi production in different decay channels give consistent results. New results for the \phi are in agreement with previously published data and extend the measured pT coverage. The spectral shapes of all hadron transverse momentum distributions measured by PHENIX are well described by a Tsallis distribution functional form with only two parameters, n and T, determining the high-pT and characterizing the low-pT regions of the spectra, respectively. The values of these parameters are very similar for all analyzed meson spectra, but with a lower parameter T extracted for protons. The integrated invariant cross sections calculated from the fitted distributions are found to be consistent with existing measurements and with statistical model predictions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Therefore, this dem... more The evolving necessity of the Internet increases the demand on the bandwidth. Therefore, this demand opens the doors for the hackers' community to develop new methods and techniques to gain control over networking systems. Hence, the intrusion detection systems (IDS) are insufficient to prevent/detect unauthorized access the network. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one example that still suffers from performance degradation due the increase of the link speed in today's networks. In This paper we proposed a novel algorithm to detect the intruders, who's trying to gain access to the network using the packets header parameters such as; source/destination address, source/destination port, and protocol without the need to inspect each packet content looking for signatures/patterns. However, the "Packet Header Matching" algorithm enhances the overall speed of the matching process between the incoming packet headers against the rule set. We ran the proposed algorithm to proof the proposed concept in coping with the traffic arrival speeds and the various bandwidth demands. The achieved results were of significant enhancement of the overall performance in terms of detection speed.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with p_T < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for p_T > 6 GeV/c a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for p_T > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the p_T < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v_2 comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v_2.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
