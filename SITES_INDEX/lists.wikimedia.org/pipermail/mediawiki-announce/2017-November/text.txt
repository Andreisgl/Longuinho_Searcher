I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.29.2, 1.28.3 and 1.27.4!
These releases fix nine security issues in core and one related issue in
the vendor
folder. Download links are given at the end of this email.
Patches will be pushed to gerrit after this email is sent, and will land
into the relevant
branches as fast as our CI infrastructure allows. Git tags will follow soon
after. All related
tasks will be made public in phabricator too in the following few hours.
Please note that this month is the End-Of-Life date for MediaWiki 1.28. This
means that MediaWiki 1.28.3 will be the last security release for that
version, barring any unforeseen issues. We would strongly encourage users of
MediaWiki 1.28 to upgrade to MediaWiki 1.29, released in July 2017, or a yet
newer version as soon as possible. MediaWiki 1.29 will be supported until
July
2018. See <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Version_lifecycle> for more
information.
This release also serves as a maintenance release for these branches.
== Security fixes ==
* (T128209) Reflected File Download from api.php. Reported by Abdullah
Hussam. (CVE-2017-8809)
* (T165846) BotPasswords doesn't throttle login attempts.
* (T134100) On private wikis, login form shouldn't distinguish between
login failure
  due to bad username and bad password. (CVE-2017-8810)
* (T178451) XSS when $wgShowExceptionDetails = false and browser sends
  non-standard url escaping. (CVE-2017-8808)
* (T176247) It's possible to mangle HTML via raw message parameter
expansion.
  (CVE-2017-8811)
* (T125163) id attribute on headlines allow raw >. (CVE-2017-8812)
* (T124404) language converter can be tricked into replacing text inside
tags by
  adding a lot of junk after the rule definition. (CVE-2017-8814)
* (T119158) Language converter: unsafe attribute injection via glossary
rules (CVE-2017-8815)
The following only affects 1.29:
* (T180488) (T125177) "api.log contains passwords in plaintext" wasn't
correctly fixed in all
  branches in the previous security release. (CVE-2017-0361)
The following only affects 1.27 and 1.28:
* (T180231) composer.json has require-dev versions of PHPUnit with known
security
  issues. Reported by Tom Hutchison. (CVE-2017-9841)
It is recommended to run `composer update --no-dev` after upgrading to MW
1.27.4 or
1.28.3 if you installed MediaWiki via git. If you are using the tarball,
you are not affected,
and you do not need to run this command. This will remove developer
dependancies that
production wikis do not require. If you require developer dependancies, run
`composer update` which will update to a version of PHPUnit without known
RCE.
If you cannot run `composer update` for any reason, it is recommended that
you delete the
offending file as a minimum yourself using the following command:
`rm -rf vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php`
