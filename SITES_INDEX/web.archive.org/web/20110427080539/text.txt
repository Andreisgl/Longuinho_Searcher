 About this capture
COLLECTED BY
Organization: Internet Archive
  The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.

At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.

View the web archive through the Wayback Machine.
Collection: Wide Crawl started March 2011
Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011.  This uses the new HQ software for distributed crawling by Kenji Nagahashi.
What’s in the data set:
Crawl start date: 09 March, 2011
Crawl end date: 23 December, 2011
Number of captures: 2,713,676,341
Number of unique URLs: 2,273,840,159
Number of hosts: 29,032,069
The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date.  We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives.  The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites.
However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it.  For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them).  We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.
We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with.  We have also done some further analysis of the content.
If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it.  We may not be able to say “yes” to all requests, since we’re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered.

Key Facts
TV Licence Fee: facts & figures
Last updated April 2010
The BBC's domestic broadcasting services are financed by the TV Licence.
The Government sets the level of the licence fee.  
The current fee – from 1 April 2010 – is £145.50 for a colour licence and £49.00 for a black-and-white licence.
The licence fee pays for: 
                          
 the television channels BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, BBC News, BBC Parliament, CBBC and CBeebies;
  five network radio services,  and digital radio services BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Radio 1Xtra, BBC Radio 7, BBC 6 Music and BBC Asian Network; 
 regional television programmes and Local Radio services in England;
national radio and television in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; 
 BBC Red Button, BBC Mobile and the BBC website (bbc.co.uk). 
Anyone aged 75 or over is entitled to a free TV Licence for their principal address.  
Blind people only pay 50% of the full licence fee.    
The Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) Concessionary Licence is available to those who live in certain types of accommodation and are either retired and aged over 60, or are disabled or mentally disordered.    
An ARC Concessionary Licence costs £7.50 for each person's home in the accommodation.    
The BBC became the Licensing Authority with responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system in 1991.    
In turn the BBC subcontracts the collection to third-party suppliers.    
The first licence fee - for radio - was issued in November 1922. The amount was 10 shillings (50p).
 The first combined Radio/TV licence - for £2 - was issued in June 1946.    
Radio only licences were abolished in February 1971.
 The first supplementary licence fee for colour TV was introduced in January 1968.
