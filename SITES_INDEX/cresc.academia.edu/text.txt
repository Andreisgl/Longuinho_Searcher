However, since then this research has largely faded from our scholarship. This volume of AIM is designed to spark new life into the research on the organizational design of the MNC. The world - and environmental forces - has changed substantially in the last decades placing new constrains on the MNCs. External shocks have increased and MNCs need to learn how to live with this increased market volatility. Integrating value chains makes MNCs more efficient but also vulnerable. The relentless forces of competition and globalization are forcing MNCs to divide their activities and reach for foreign inputs, markets and partners. By dividing their value chain into discrete pieces -- - some to be performed in-house, while others are outsourced to partner organizations -- - MNCs hope to reduce overall costs and risks, while also reaping the benefits of ideas from contractors or alliance partners worldwide. These challenges call for new research on the organizational design of the MNC.It is our intention with this AIM volume to motivate new research on the proper organizational design mechanisms of MNCs as of today.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this volume we look more deliberatively at how, and whether, we have developed as a social science – what we know and how we study it – as well as looking at the extent of our accumulated knowledge on a number of critical topics in the field. The contributions in this volume present a mixture of research that uses two lenses to examine the maturity of our field.  One set focus on philosophy of science to understand the value of what we do.  The second set looks at key topics and asks, from a meta-analytic and meta-knowledge perspective, what do we really know. The collection of research published in this volume will be of interest not only to established scholars but also to doctoral students and junior scholars wanting a broader perspective on the evolution of the international business and international management research program. This link contains the table of contents for the volume.  The volume will be available in June 2013.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although early international business studies focused on multinationals from the United States, the developed countries of Western Europe and Japan, some of the largest multinational enterprises today are from non-Triad countries, including Brazil, China, Korea, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Taiwan. These new multinationals exhibited behaviors different from those of established Triad multinationals and, in many cases, competed with distinctly different strategies. The result was that international business scholars, who traditionally concentrated on studying host country factors as the key to understanding corporate behavior began to pay much more attention to the characteristics of the multinationals’ home institutional environments as a potential determinant of the multinationals’ internationalization strategy. The attachment is the Table of Contents for the VolumeSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One major source of this neglect is in our conceptualization of firms' location-specific advantages as completely distinct from firm-specific advantages – i.e. a factor that only explains the choice of location for different activities but not the variation in firm-specific advantages. However, increased globalization has, in many ways, put the location factor back onto the map of international business and management scholarship once again. As the contributions in the 2011 volume of Advances in International Management bear out, old questions have been revitalized in a new context and new and challenging questions have been raised pertaining to the importance of location in international business and management.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet when companies offer such products they are often met with indifference and limited uptake. It seems that survey radicals turn into economic conservatives at the checkout. This book reveals not only why the search for the “ethical consumer” is futile but also why the social aspects of consumption cannot be ignored. Consumers are revealed to be much more deliberative and sophisticated in how they do or do not incorporate social factors into their decision making. Using first-hand findings and extensive research, The Myth of the Ethical Consumer provides academics, students, and leaders in corporations and NGOs with an enlightening picture of the interface between social causes and consumption.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Thorough treatment of context and phenomena are what distinguish IB research from other social sciences. However, the state of the art in IB research is arguably less-developed with respect to theoretical development. We argue that this is partly a function of the prevailing approach to testing theory. Drawing on key principles from philosophy of science, we argue for a change in the manner in which theory is tested and that 'contribution to theory' should be viewed as less valuable than meaningful 'testing of theory'philosophy of science, and analysis of the quantitative papers from theJournal of International Business StudiesSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies – the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although there are a number of different surveys that collect data on these issues they are mainly done within the context of accreditation agencies, government monitoring bodies or at an aggregate university level by various publication. This work was meant to fill in the gap that has made a lot of that information less than operational, particularly with respect to the management of business school academics. In this report, we utilise individual responses or institutional aggregates where appropriate. We also make comparisons between administrators and faculty and across regions where there are meaningful differences to be highlighted. Who Was Studied? The survey was conducted in two waves. The first focused on Deans and Associate/Pro-Deans of Research, dominantly in UK and European business schools. The second wave was open to all and targeted both academic administrators and ordinary academics. The idea of doing this in two waves was to generate variety in responses-e.g., between those setting the 'incentives' and those subject to those 'incentives'-as well as getting information about what the 'standard' might be at an institution versus what the reality was at that institution for specific individuals.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Varieties of Populism: The Rise of Populism and the Challenge for Global Business Strategyby Timothy Devinney and Christopher A.

The upsurge in populist political parties, to the point of their achieving power (either individually or in coalitions with other parties), is a key feature of the current political environment and appears to be so for the foreseeable future, and as such will have important ramifications for country institutional structures. While we do not seek explain the why of this upsurge, we do seek to show – or at least lay out as a relevant hypothesis – that what is occurring today has parallels in the past and fits with scholarly political logics applied in various fields (see, e.g., Bonikowski [2018] and Hawkins, Read and Pauwels [2017] as examples of the expanding literature speculating on the “why’s” of the recent rise of populism). Previous episodes of policy and institutional shifts provide guidance as to: (a) how we might theoretically and practically understand implications for business, and (b) if, and what, we might need to do to adjust our current global strategy and international business theories to incorporate the reality of the form of populism we are seeing today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Semi-Formalization of the Dynamic Capability Viewby Timothy Devinney and Ralf WildenSome management scholars doubt the value of the dynamic capability view when compared to existing... more Some management scholars doubt the value of the dynamic capability view when compared to existing theories. The concern expressed is, more often than not, related to unclear definitions of the core construct and the relationship amongst the components that make up that construct. The end result is potentially confused and conflicting interpretations of empirical findings and non-commensurate measurement. One solution to this problem is to formalize the core components of the theory at hand. The purpose of this paper is not to discuss or argue for (or against) the theoretical status of the DCV but to provide a simple, yet insightful, structured model of its core components. Specifically, this paper takes as its basis the perspective of dynamic capabilities as comprising the sensing, seizing and reconfiguring processes that are deployed to create a resource base aimed at satisfying an evolving market demand and presents a simple but formal way of characterizing it components.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the first instance, one could question the predictive power of our theoretical understanding at the macro level in not having foreseen the likelihood of such a shift in the political and social environment. At a more empirical perspective, the popularity of populism implies that there may be a blind spot in the manner in which we study and characterize institutional environments. In this paper, we focus on the nature of populism and populist leaders and their parties and ask the question of whether or not we need a more foundational approach to institutions, one that includes not just institutions but the controllers and executives of those institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although there are a number of different surveys that collect data on these issues they are mainly done within the context of accreditation agencies, government monitoring bodies or at an aggregate university level by various publication. This work was meant to fill in the gap that has made a lot of that information less than operational, particularly with respect to the management of business school academics. In this report, we utilise individual responses or institutional aggregates where appropriate. We also make comparisons between administrators and faculty and across regions where there are meaningful differences to be highlighted. Who Was Studied? The survey was conducted in two waves. The first focused on Deans and Associate/Pro-Deans of Research, dominantly in UK and European business schools. The second wave was open to all and targeted both academic administrators and ordinary academics. The idea of doing this in two waves was to generate variety in responses-e.g., between those setting the 'incentives' and those subject to those 'incentives'-as well as getting information about what the 'standard' might be at an institution versus what the reality was at that institution for specific individuals.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Varieties of Populism: The Rise of Populism and the Challenge for Global Business Strategyby Timothy Devinney and Christopher A.

The upsurge in populist political parties, to the point of their achieving power (either individually or in coalitions with other parties), is a key feature of the current political environment and appears to be so for the foreseeable future, and as such will have important ramifications for country institutional structures. While we do not seek explain the why of this upsurge, we do seek to show – or at least lay out as a relevant hypothesis – that what is occurring today has parallels in the past and fits with scholarly political logics applied in various fields (see, e.g., Bonikowski [2018] and Hawkins, Read and Pauwels [2017] as examples of the expanding literature speculating on the “why’s” of the recent rise of populism). Previous episodes of policy and institutional shifts provide guidance as to: (a) how we might theoretically and practically understand implications for business, and (b) if, and what, we might need to do to adjust our current global strategy and international business theories to incorporate the reality of the form of populism we are seeing today.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Semi-Formalization of the Dynamic Capability Viewby Timothy Devinney and Ralf WildenSome management scholars doubt the value of the dynamic capability view when compared to existing... more Some management scholars doubt the value of the dynamic capability view when compared to existing theories. The concern expressed is, more often than not, related to unclear definitions of the core construct and the relationship amongst the components that make up that construct. The end result is potentially confused and conflicting interpretations of empirical findings and non-commensurate measurement. One solution to this problem is to formalize the core components of the theory at hand. The purpose of this paper is not to discuss or argue for (or against) the theoretical status of the DCV but to provide a simple, yet insightful, structured model of its core components. Specifically, this paper takes as its basis the perspective of dynamic capabilities as comprising the sensing, seizing and reconfiguring processes that are deployed to create a resource base aimed at satisfying an evolving market demand and presents a simple but formal way of characterizing it components.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the first instance, one could question the predictive power of our theoretical understanding at the macro level in not having foreseen the likelihood of such a shift in the political and social environment. At a more empirical perspective, the popularity of populism implies that there may be a blind spot in the manner in which we study and characterize institutional environments. In this paper, we focus on the nature of populism and populist leaders and their parties and ask the question of whether or not we need a more foundational approach to institutions, one that includes not just institutions but the controllers and executives of those institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Let me outline this in a bit of detail.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Are University Leaders Really Overpaid? by Timothy DevinneyModern Cynic Blog,  May 2013Across three continents we have seen questions being raised about the compensation paid to the he... more Across three continents we have seen questions being raised about the compensation paid to the heads of academic institutions.  This has mostly played out in the USA and the UK where the impact of the financial crisis and the downturn in the economy has impacted but the ability of students and governments to pay for education and scholarship but also put a dent in the ability of these institutions had been hit further by a downturn in the return on investment from their endowments.  In Australia this has, until recently, been less of an issue as the resources boom and the influx of overseas students kept the system afloat.  However, even in the “lucky country” there have been financial concerns raised most recently because of the Labor government’s reduction of university funding via an “efficiency dividend”. This pressure for efficiency and austerity has prompted many people to question the level of pay received by university presidents and vice chancellors.  But is this fair?  From one perspective these individuals are heading billion dollar organizations whose complexity rivals many large corporations.  From another perspective they are quasi public servants with few opportunities to really change the institutions they run.  While each perspective guides us to a different market for talent, it is clear that there is an active market for these positions.  It is this aspect of the debate we investigate.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We have outlined four goals for this volume. First, we would like to provide an overview of successful strategies that global entrepreneurs and SMEs have employed that have allowed them to establish regional and international footprints. Second, we wish to examine how local resources, culture and managerial capabilities have contributed to startups’ global success (or the lack thereof). Third, we would like to study the interactions between SMEs and multinational enterprises (MNEs) both at the level of MNEs as incubators for entrepreneurial ventures and as competitors to those ventures. Fourth, we aim to publish a collection of chapters with original, even edgy ideas and theoretical advances that will provide the foundation for future doctoral dissertations and other research projects on international entrepreneurship.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
