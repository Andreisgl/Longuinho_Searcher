Time-lapse Electrical Resistivity Monitoring of Subsurface CO2 Storage at the Maguelone Experimental Site (France)Near Surface Geoscience 2016 - 22nd European Meeting of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics,  2016CO2 geological storage remains a recent research field and many questions are still open, particu... more CO2 geological storage remains a recent research field and many questions are still open, particularly for saline formations, which are expected to provide over time a larger storage capacity than depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. The Maguelone shallow experimental site for shallow CO2 injection (Mediterranean coastline, Gulf of Lions, France) has been developed to study in an integrated manner surface and in-situ (downhole) monitoring methods. The presence of two small reservoirs with impermeable boundaries (R1: 13-16 m and R2: 8-9 m) provides an opportunity to study a saline formation for gas geological storage both in the field and in a laboratory context. During the shallow injection experiment (~48 m3 of CO2 was injected over ~2 hours on December 4, 2014), traces of the CO2 plume were detected by time-lapse downhole and surface electrical resistivity monitoring techniques, although some of the injected CO2 appeared to leak along the new injection hole, which should be corrected in the future with additional cementing around the new holes.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A New Downhole, Real Time and Near Field Hydrogeophysical Observatory of Groundwater QualityNear Surface Geoscience 2012 – 18th European Meeting of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics,  2012The downhole imaGeau observatory provides an opportunity to deploy a vertical string of sensors p... more The downhole imaGeau observatory provides an opportunity to deploy a vertical string of sensors probing outward into the reservoir in order to study changes over time of pore fluid electrical conductivity (hence salinity) and/or saturation. This in-situ set-up is based on near-field and high resolution (in space and time) measurements of formation electrical resistivity in aquifers. This paper presents results related to the salinization of a coastal aquifer exploited for the city of Hossegor (SW France). The subsurface monitoring device (SMD) downhole observatory has been located in the near vicinity of the city pumping station for domestic use, where increasing water salinity has been measured over the past 10 years. More than 9 months of daily probing shows not only seasonal changes but also a heterogeneous profile of pore fluid salinity, far from the first order model expected from the Ghyben-Herzberg gravity model. These more detailed data will lead to a more adequate aquifer management strategy in Hossegor. As a consequence, the technology deployed by imaGeau provides an answer to a series of hydrogeological issues such as salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers, pollution studies whether in a petrochemical or a dump site context, or other pollution prevention or remediation cases.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Settled into two piezometers drilled into a basaltic coastal aquifer, between the ocean and a production well, they allow the record of groundwater electrical conductivity (ECw) logs on a 30 min basis. Thanks to those two tools, water operator continuously knows the shape and the position of the SWI as data are available online on a secured web application designed especially for SWI data management. During the observation period a 5,15 m rise of SWI interface has been recorded. Knowing the average porosity, water table elevation and SWI interface position it is possible to estimate available fresh groundwater volume. Along a 1 km band between extraction well and the ocean, available fresh groundwater volume was found to be 1 259 000 m3 in June 2016. In June 2017, due to SWI progression this volume was found to be 777 000 m3, that to say a 480 000 ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For this, a shallow injection experiment through permeable sediment was designed and conducted at Svelvik (Norway) in September 2011. The goal was to produce a CO2 leak in order to assess the relative sensitivity of several geochemical and geophysical CO2 monitoring tools. A total mass of 1.67 tons of CO2 was injected at a depth of 20 m through a 45° inclined well over a 6 day period. Time-lapse induction logging and downhole resistivity monitoring from a permanent dipole–dipole array observatory prove to be very sensitive to the presence of CO2 in the shallow subsurface after the start of injection. Electrical resistivity response correlates with progressive CO2 dissolution in groundwater, with resistivity and pH values decreasing due to the increase of bicarbonate and dissolved species. The CO2 plume is channelled by enhanced permeability layers, with updip migration of the gas plume to the North. Other processes responsible for resistivity changes were fresh/salt water mixing, tidal effects and rainfall.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Limited to the north by a coastal lagoon and to the south by the Mediterranean sea, this site offers a natural laboratory to study porous coastal reservoirs in a clastic and clay-rich context saturated with mostly saline fluids. Drilled and cored in 2003 for sedimentological purpose, the Maguelone site crosses from surface to 9 m depth a thin Holocene sequence constituted with lagoonal sediments made mostly of dark green clays. This sequence forms an impermeable seal overlying unconformably a Pliocene sequence consisting mainly of relatively homogeneous fine grained continental deposits (clays, silts, and clayey silts). The clayey fraction is relatively high all along, making those deposits poorly permeable. In this sequence, a single remarkable depositional unit located from 14 to 17 m, consists of porous and permeable conglomerates and sands interpreted as fluvial deposits. Sedimentary and geophysical measurements suggest a high permeability for this 3 m-thick reservoir. Hydrogen sulphite (H2S) (possibly resulting from lagoonal organic matter decomposition and compaction) encountered during coring operations near 15 m depth confirmed the presence of a small reservoir at this depth. As part of the ALIANCE EC project (FP5), a new downhole resistivity observatory prototype was constructed and set-up in 2004, tested in a dipole-dipole mode, and calibrated against induction resistivity logs. From this, time lapse measurements were emplaced and made automatic showing gradual changes over time in electrical resistivity. Taking advantage of this shallow and thin reservoir embedded in clays and silts, a new shallow experimental site is to be developed in the context of MUSTANG EC project (FP7). In particular, the downhole technology jointly developed by "Géosciences Montpellier" and "imaGeau" is to be adapted to resist the aggressive conditions encountered in CO2 underground storage, and pressure conditions down to 1500 m depth. The SIMEx ("Shallow Integrated Monitoring Experiment") monitoring experiment is consequently to be deployed at Maguelone by mid 2010. It is a unique opportunity to test in an integrated manner a full suite of coordinated monitoring techniques, either from surface or downhole. While gas injection will be restricted to the reservoir located from about 14 to 17 m, all new holes will be drilled down to 25 m and instrumented over their entire length. The field spread includes, along with the existing holes (MAG4 resistivity observatory and MAG1), a new injection hole perforated only over the 3 meter long interval corresponding to the conglomeratic reservoir, additional downhole electrical observatories (DEO's) placed at variable distance from the injection point, a downhole hydrodynamic observatory (DHO) based on a pore fluid sampling completion from WestBay (SWS), a downhole seismic observatory (DSO) in order to complete the electrical strategy and study how the two methods might be combined for a more efficient description of the saturation/desaturation process associated with the injection (to be installed in MAG1), surface electrical observatory (SEO) and seismic observatory (SSO) with permanent flutes during the injection period, in order to study how surface and downhole monitoring strategies shall complete each other, looking at different volumes, with possible surface/downhole tomographic approaches.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
