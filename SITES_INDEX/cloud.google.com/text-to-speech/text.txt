Pricing
 Pricing 
Text-to-Speech is priced based on the number of characters
                    sent to the service to be synthesized into audio each month.
                    The first 1 million characters for WaveNet voices are free
                    each month. For Standard (non-WaveNet) voices, the first 4
                    million characters are free each month. After the free tier
                    has been reached, Text-to-Speech is priced per 1 million
                    characters of text processed.
