[MediaWiki-announce] Security and maintenance release: 1.31.6 /1.32.6 / 1.33.12

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.33.2, 1.32.6 and 1.31.6!
These releases also serve as a maintenance release for these branches.
While tarballs have already been uploaded, git tags will follow later on
today.
As a reminder, 1.32.6 will also be the final release for 1.32 (barring any
unforeseen issues), which is scheduled to become end of life in January
2020 [1]. If you're using 1.32, it is recommended that you upgrade to the
latest point release of the 1.33 branch (1.33.2, to be released tomorrow)
or 1.34.0 to carry on using a maintained and supported release.
An "MediaWiki Extensions Security Release Supplement" email will follow
this one.
== Security fixes ==
* (T192134) Personal and site-wide CSS and JavaScript is loaded on
Special:PasswordReset.
* (T212067) wfParseUrl() incorrectly parses hostnames in older PHP and HHVM
versions due to bug in parse_url(). This is only potentially an issue on MW
< 1.34 where it supports PHP version (see PHP bug 73192) 7.0.0–7.0.12, or
HHVM less than 3.18.6.
* (T239466) Possible to circumvent title-blacklist (CVE-2019-19709).
