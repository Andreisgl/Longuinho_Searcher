The report also recommended that research testbeds be established, such as the Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) DFW Testbed, to ascertain the potential benefit of proposed observing systems. In this work, we use various conventional and non-conventional observing systems from the DFW Testbed in a series of observing system experiments (OSEs). Of special interest are radar data from Terminal Doppler Weather Radars and CASA X-band radars, as well as novel surface observations. The Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model is used to perform OSEs that are designed to assess the impact of these observing systems. A three-dimensional variational analysis system and companion complex cloud analysis are used to produce analysis increments, which are assimilated in ARPS using Increme...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersE-Journal of Severe Storms MeteorologyInvestigating the Impacts of Assimilating Surface Observations on High-Resolution Forecasts of the 15 May 2013 Tornado Event2015 • Frederick CarrIn this study, the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), and its associated three-dimensional variational analysis (3DVAR) package are used to simulate a tornadic supercell at 400-m grid spacing. This storm produced an EF3 tornado in Johnson County, TX during the evening of 15 March 2013. Data from Doppler radar, satellite, aircraft, radiosondes, profilers, and surface observations are assimilated in this work. We show that the assimilation of non-conventional surface observations from three networks: the Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP), Global Science and Technology (GST) and Automated Weather Stations (AWS) operated by EarthNetworks, in and around the storm inflow, were fundamentally important to the development of an intense low-level mesocyclone. Simulations that did not incorporate this non-conventional data either developed a weak mesocyclone that was displaced to the east of the actual tornado track, or were unable to develop a defined mesocyclone in the fir...Download Free PDFView PDFMonthly Weather ReviewThe Analysis and Prediction of the 8–9 May 2007 Oklahoma Tornadic Mesoscale Convective System by Assimilating WSR-88D and CASA Radar Data Using 3DVAR2011 • K. BrewsterThe Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model is employed to perform high-resolution numerical simulations of a mesoscale convective system and associated cyclonic line-end vortex (LEV) that spawned several tornadoes in central Oklahoma on 8–9 May 2007. The simulation uses a 1000 km × 1000 km domain with 2-km horizontal grid spacing. The ARPS three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) is used to assimilate a variety of data types. All experiments assimilate routine surface and upper-air observations as well as wind profiler and Oklahoma Mesonet data over a 1-h assimilation window. A subset of experiments assimilates radar data. Cloud and hydrometeor fields as well as in-cloud temperature are adjusted based on radar reflectivity data through the ARPS complex cloud analysis procedure. Radar data are assimilated from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network as well as from the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative and Adaptive Sensing of...Download Free PDFView PDFObserving System Experiments in the Dallas-Fort Worth Testbed2016 • Frederick CarrDownload Free PDFView PDFImpact of Radar Data Assimilation on the Analysis and Prediction of the 8-9 May 2007 Oklahoma Tornadic Mesoscale Convective System, Part I: Mesoscale Features on a 2 km Grid2009 • Keith  BrewsterThe Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) prediction model is employed to perform high resolution numerical simulations of a mesoscale convective system and associated cyclonic line-end vortex (LEV) that spawned several tornadoes in central Oklahoma on 8-9 May 2007.

Reflectivity and radial velocity data from five operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) S-band radars as well as four experimental Collaborative and Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) X-band radars are assimilated over a 1-h period using either single-moment (SM) or DM microphysics schemes within the forecast ensemble. Three-hour deterministic forecasts are initialized from the final ensemble mean analyses using a SM or DM scheme, respectively. Polarimetric radar variables are simulated from the analyses and compared with polarimetric WSR-88D observations for verification.

The system includes two components, an ensemble analysis and forecast component, and a deterministic hybrid three-dimensional ensemble–variational (3DEnVAR) analysis and forecast component. The goal of the system is to provide on-demand, ensemble-based, and physically consistent gridded analysis and forecast products to forecasters for making warning decisions. Both components, the WRF-DART system with 36 ensemble members and the hybrid 3DEnVAR system, assimilate radar data, satellite-retrieved cloud water path, and surface observations at 15-min intervals with dual-resolution capability. In the current hybrid configuration, one-way coupling of the two analysis systems is performed: ensemble covariances derived from the WRF-DART system are incorporated into the hybrid 3DEnVAR system with each data assimilation...Download Free PDFView PDFMonthly Weather ReviewImpact of CASA Radar and Oklahoma Mesonet Data Assimilation on the Analysis and Prediction of Tornadic Mesovortices in an MCS2011 • Keith  BrewsterDownload Free PDFView PDFMeteorology and Atmospheric PhysicsThe Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), storm-scale numerical weather prediction and data assimilation2003 • K.

The data used in these experiments are those from the Mobile Weather Radar, 2005 X-band, Phased Array (MWR-05XP); two mobile mesonets (MM); and several mobile sounding units. Data sources are divided into “routine,” including those from operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Dopplers (WSR-88Ds) and the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) network, and “special” observations from the VORTEX2 project. VORTEX2 data sources are denied individually from a total of six ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) data assimilation and forecasting experiments. The EnSRF data assimilation uses 40 ensemble members on a 1-km grid nested inside a 3-km grid. Each experiment assimilates data every 5 min for 1 h, followed...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
