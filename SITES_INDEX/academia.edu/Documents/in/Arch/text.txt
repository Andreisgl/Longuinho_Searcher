Materials and Methods: A sample of 66 patients (mean age: 11.5 ± 1.0 years) with 22 unilateral palatally displaced canines (UPDCs), 22 bilateral palatally displaced canines (BPDCs), and 22 controls (C) were consecutively recruited. All three groups had dental casts that were scanned digitally using the OrthoX three-dimensional model scanner. Tooth size, palatal vault height, dental arch width, dental arch depth, dental arch length, and dental arch space were measured by the same examiner using the GOM software. Remeasurements were made in 10 randomly identified patients. Results: The palatal vault height was significantly lower in the BPDC group compared with controls. A significantly smaller mesial-distal crown width and, in general, more spacing in the maxilla were found in the UPDC and BPDC groups. ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Julia Naoumova•  6  Dentistry, Orthodontics, Medicine, ArchImplementation of a dynamic monitoring system on a wind turbineSave to LibraryDownloadby Álvaro Cunha•  2  Engineering, TurbineHallazgos radiológicos de la neumonía lipoidea exógena en pacientes laringectomizadosSave to LibraryDownloadby Ricardo Andrés Castillo Diaz•  2  Medicine, Clinical SciencesPatología respiratoria en los jóvenes y hábito tabáquicoSave to LibraryDownloadby Rosa Gloria Suárez López de Vergara•  4  Humanities, Medicine, Arch, Clinical SciencesDirofilaria immitis: uma zoonose presente a nível mundialSave to LibraryDownloadby Marta Elena Sánchez Klinge•  2  Biology, Dirofilaria immitisDirofilaria Immitis: A Zoonoses Present on a Global LevelSave to LibraryDownloadby Marta Elena Sánchez Klinge•  2  Medicine, Dirofilaria immitisDetecting osteoporosis in elderly women using panoramic radiography techniqueSave to LibraryDownloadby Rezky Amalia•  4  Dentistry, Medicine, Osteoporosis, RadiographyOntological Anarché: Beyond Arché & AnarchéSave to LibraryDownloadby Jason Harman•  3  Computer Science, Arch, ADCsDas Nepal-Experiment.

These, associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LoS), may trigger critical manifestations in individuals undergoing this surgical procedure. To investigate the relationships between postoperative cardiac risk factors, LoS, and changes in functioning state. Methods: Patients undergoing reconstructive, substitutive, or corrective cardiac surgeries were evaluated. The presence of postoperative cardiovascular risks was assessed using the InsCor score, while LoS and functionality were collected from medical records. Results: One-hundred patients with a mean age of 59.2±12.3 years were included. Significant correlations between functionality and both the hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) LoS (p&lt;0.0001, ρ= 0.56; p=0.002, ρ=0.29, respectively), as well as between hospital LoS and the number of comorbid...Save to LibraryDownloadby Kátia Elizabete Galdino•  4  Medicine, Cardiac Surgery, Intensive Care Unit, Medical RecordHistorical Beam Bridge Model Identification after Changing its Structural System into an ArchSave to LibraryDownloadby Marek Salamak•  6  Engineering, Structural Engineering, Multidisciplinary, ArchThe Bagouria Barrage 1281 AH / 1864 AD:An Archaeological Architectural StudySave to LibraryDownloadby Badr badr•  4  Engineering, Archaeology, Irrigation, ArchTeoria Do Caos Aplicada Aos Contratos De Café No Mercado De DerivativosSave to LibraryDownloadby Marcelo Perlin•  6  Geography, Econometrics, Stock Market, PredictabilityTuberculosis pulmonar en un paciente con lepra lepromatosa.

The lamella structure is usually in a diamond pattern, so it relies on additional elements to achieve stability. The analysis of the elements precedes the design of a prototype of a timber lamella vault. The characteristic diamond pattern can be kept for the design of rigid or semi-rigid joints. The design of the joints is challenging, so this paper focused on the analysis and systematization of joints designed for timber lamella structures. The existing timber lamella joints were classified and analyzed based on five parameters: eccentricity, load capacity, the number of elements, easiness of assembly, and adaptability to the circular cylindrical surface, to systemize the existing joints and propose a new one. A design for a new joint was proposed based on the presented joints. The systematization and discussion gave a comparison of all joints, their advantages, and limitations. ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Nenad Sekularac•  3  Structural Engineering, Arch, BuildingsInspection and Assessment of Masonry Arch Bridges: Ivanjica Case StudyThe importance of masonry arch bridges as a traffic network element calls for a thorough analysis focused on both structural stability and loading capacity of these historical structures, considering the usage of these bridges in... moreThe importance of masonry arch bridges as a traffic network element calls for a thorough analysis focused on both structural stability and loading capacity of these historical structures, considering the usage of these bridges in contemporary traffic conditions. This paper focuses on the analysis of longitudinal cracks in a single span masonry arch bridge to evaluate its influence on structural behaviour of the system. As longitudinal cracks do not necessarily present an inevitable collapse mechanism, analysis of the causes is crucial for evaluating the serviceability and functionality of the bridge investigated. The methodology is based on the following: literature review, observation of the stone bridge in Ivanjica, geological testing of the site, geophysical testing of the bridge, laboratory testing of mechanical characteristics of stone used for the bridge construction and biological analysis of the samples of implemented materials on the bridge.

Arch morphology alone may affect cardiac function and outcome. We sought to uncover the relationship of arch three-dimensional shape features with functional and short-term outcome data after total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). Aortic arch shape models of 37 patients with HLHS (age, 2.89 ± 0.99 years) were reconstructed from magnetic resonance data before TCPC completion. A novel, validated statistical shape analysis method was used to compute a three-dimensional anatomic mean shape from the cohort and calculate the deformation vectors of the mean shape toward each patient&#39;s specific anatomy. From these deformations, three-dimensional shape features most related to ventricular ejection fraction, indexed end-diastolic volume, and superior cavopulmonary pressure were extracted by partial least-square regression analysis.

As a result, the creep deformation curve can be divided into two stages including initial creep deformation stage and softening deformation stage, which can explain the case that deformation of roadway intersection is little before a certain time, but then increases at a high speed; only when total shear plastic value exceeds the critical value can second creep stage take place; reinforcement measurement with bolting in roof and ribs has little effect on floor heave, yet exerting pressure against floor can reduce floor heave obviously.Save to LibraryDownloadby sohail kibria•Developmental Changes in Tongue Strength, Swallow Pressures, and Tongue EnduranceSave to LibraryDownloadby Anmol Bajwa•  5  Dysphagia, Medicine, Swallowing, Clinical SciencesThe Effect of Two Types of Silicone Insole on Selected Kinetic Variables on the Skill landing-Jumping-Landing Active Young Women with Flat footIntroduction: Since the use of medical insole is recommended as one of the strategies to deal with the potential for joint injuries, Flatfoot is one of the most common abnormalities in body structure that Due to the decrease in the height... moreIntroduction: Since the use of medical insole is recommended as one of the strategies to deal with the potential for joint injuries, Flatfoot is one of the most common abnormalities in body structure that Due to the decrease in the height of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and its functional defect, the increases risk of joint damage due to changes in the transfer of ground reaction forces. One of the treatment options that is suggested is the use of a medical insole. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two different forms of silicone insoles on the peak of the ground reaction force, loading rate and time to stability in the landing-jumping-landing skill of active young women with flat foot. Materials and methods: 28 women with a history of regular activity exercise were divided into two groups of 14 (flat foot and normal foot).

It is important to review the adverse events profile related to antibiotic exposure during the clinical development of drugs that are or have been recently included in the therapeutic armamentarium. Safety data from all 13 clinical trials of cefditoren on community acquired respiratory infections were reviewed. Safety population was defined as all randomized patients with at least one dose intake. Adverse events considered by investigators as related during antibiotic exposure were considered. The overall safety population consisted in 4,592 patients for cefditoren and 2,784 for comparators. Overall reported diarrhoea related to cefditoren administration was significantly higher (p &lt; or = 0.001) than comparators (9.9% vs 6.9%) due to the significant difference in the pooled pharyngotonsillitis studies (8.3% vs 3.2%), while no significant differences in othe...Save to LibraryDownloadby María-José Giménez•  20  Clinical Trial, Medicine, Population, HumansVariations in the Pattern of the Deep Palmar Arch of the Hand and Its Surgical ImportanceSave to LibraryDownloadby Sabita Mishra•  4  Medicine, Anatomy, Arch, AnastomosisComparison of the effectiveness of butterfly arch versus transpalatal arch in anchorage reinforcement: A linear 3D finite element studySave to LibraryDownloadby Prashantha Govinakovi Shivamurthy•  4  Finite element method, Arch, Maxilla, MolarPerencanaan Struktur Atas Jembatan Komposit Sungai Nipah Desa Darul Aman Kecamatan RupatThe  Darul Aman Village Bridge was originally a wooden bridge connecting community settlements with harbor and plantation areas.

Yhe current condition of the bridge is not worth crossing because the wooden structure on the bridge has severe weathering, so it is very risky if forced to pass through the vehicle continuously and will cause further damage.for this purpose a nwe bridge is planned using a composite structure between steel girder and concrete slab. This plan refers to SNI T-02-2005 for loading bridge and SNI T-03-2005 fot steel structure planning. The planned plan includes bridge slab, girders, diaphragms and bridge elastomeric placement.             From the result of the planning, the steel girder profile is using WF 800.300.14.26 , with a gap between 1,125 m.

The shear strength model for corroded RC columns is proposed based on modifying the existing strut-and-tie model, which considers the deformational compatibility between truss and arch mechanisms. The contributions to the shear strength from both truss and arch mechanisms are incorporated in the proposed model. The effects of corrosion level of transverse reinforcements are considered in the proposed model through the minimum residual cross-sectional area of transverse reinforcements and the reduction of concrete compressive strength for the cover area. The shear strengths calculated from the developed model are compared with the experimental results from Vu\&#39;s study (2017), which consisted of RC columns with corroded transverse reinforcements showing shear failure under the cyclic loading.

DI reproduces the space flight factors such as lack of support, mechanical and axial unloading, physical inactivity, elimination of vertical vascular gradient. Long-term bed rest is also associated with similar factors, so the results of the study may be useful for clinical medicine. Computer plantography and measuring the stiffness of the soft tissues of the foot and superficial muscles of the shin (mm. tibialis anterior and peroneus longus) were performed twice before DI exposure, on the 2nd and 4th days of DI exposure, as well as on the 2nd day of the recovery period. DI exposure effects the parameters under study in two ways: by raising the longitudinal arch and by flattening the transverse arch, which is accompanied by a decrease in the soft tissues stiffness of the foot and superficial muscles of the shin.

The connection of the metal framework of fixed (fixed dental prosthesis (FPD)) and removable partial denture using adhesive attachments is a good alternative prosthetic option when solely fixed prosthesis (FPD or implant) cannot be used due to anatomical limitation. Attachments are the tiny interlocking devices that act as a hybrid link to join removable prosthesis to the abutment and direct the masticatory forces along the long axis of the abutment. This joint acts as a non-rigid stress breaker, which helps in distributing the occlusal load. Precision and semiprecision attachment have always been bordered by an aura of mystery due to technique sensitive procedure and lack of knowledge.

A geometrically non-linear finite element model is used together with an updated Lagrangian formulation to obtained the non-linear equilibrium paths for perfect and imperfect structural models. The unilateral constraints are imposed by tensionless elastic or rigid foundations. At each load step, in order to obtain the equilibrium configuration and contact regions, the equilibrium equations are linearized and the contact problem is treated as a minimization problem with inequality constraints. The resulting linear programming problem is solved by the use of Lemke&#39;s algorithm and the contact regions are identified. Next, the Newton-Raphson method is used with path following methods to obtain the new contact forces and equilibrium configurations. Some structural systems are analyzed and th...Save to LibraryDownloadby Ricardo Gonçalves Mendonça Silveira•  14  Mathematics, Linear Programming, Finite element method, Contact MechanicsA numerical approach for equilibrium and stability analysis of slender arches and rings under contact constraintsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ricardo Gonçalves Mendonça Silveira•  8  Engineering, Mathematics, Contact Mechanics, Structural StabilityArch perimeter changes on rapid palatal expansionSave to LibraryDownloadby Fräns Currier•  20  Dentistry, Orthodontics, Biomedical Engineering, AdolescentPalmar Arch Anatomy: Ajmer Working Group ClassificationSave to LibraryDownloadby Kamal Kishor•  6  Medicine, Anatomy, Arch, VascularDisnea Como Síntoma De Alarma.
