The majority of dengue viral infections are self-limiting, but complications may cause high morbidity and mortality. Objectives: To assess the clinical profile of the dengue infection in children less than 14 years of age and to evaluate the outcomes of dengue fever from Results: A total of 75 cases were classified into 63(84%) non severe and 12(16%) severe dengue cases. The most common age of presentation was above 5 yrs. The mean age of admission was 8.7 yrs. The most common presenting symptom was fever seen in 100% and hepatomegaly (64%) the most common physical finding. Gastrointestinal bleeding was markedly seen in severe dengue (76.9%). Elevation in aspartate transaminase (SGOT) was found in 47.42% and thrombocytopenia in 27.5%.The correlation between hepatomegaly and elevated SGOT was significant (í µí± value 0.0346). Case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.03%.The mean duration of hospitalization was 4days. Conclusion: In children, if symptoms like fever, pain, rashes, and vomiting are associated with hepatomegaly and elevated SGOT in context of low TPC, a strong possibility of dengue fever is present, especially in an epidemic setting. Early suspicion and effective management can reduce the severity.Download Free PDFView PDFClinical Profile of Dengue Fever in Children: A Study from Southern Odisha, IndiaShubhankar Mishra, Sunil  agarwallaBackground. In India, dengue epidemics are becoming more frequent (WHO, 2008). The majority of dengue viral infections are self-limiting, but complications may cause high morbidity and mortality. Objectives. To assess the clinical profile of the dengue infection in children less than 14 years of age and to evaluate the outcomes of dengue fever from September 2013 to August 2015 at the Pediatric Department of Maharaja Krishna Chandra Gajapati Medical College, the largest tertiary care hospital of southern Odisha. Results. A total of 97 cases were classified into 84 (86.59%) nonsevere and 13 (13.40%) severe dengue cases. The most common age of presentation was above 11 yrs. The mean age of admission was 8.7 yrs. The most common presenting symptom was fever seen in 100% and hepatomegaly (43.8%), the most common physical finding. Gastrointestinal bleeding was markedly seen in severe dengue (76.9%). Elevation in aspartate transaminase (SGOT) was found in 47.42% and thrombocytopenia in 27.5%. The correlation between hepatomegaly and elevated SGOT was significant (í µí± value 0.0346). Case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.03%. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 3.8 days. Conclusion. In children, if symptoms like fever, pain, rashes, and vomiting are associated with hepatomegaly and elevated SGOT in context of low TPC, a strong possibility of dengue fever is present, especially in an epidemic setting. Early suspicion and effective management can reduce the severity.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational HealthComparison and critical appraisal of dengue clinical guidelines and their use in Asia and Latin America2009 • Andrea NuñezDownload Free PDFView PDFCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINESShirley Dueñas LabánDownload Free PDFView PDFDENGUE ILLNESSES (Chapter from text book pediatric Infectious diseases. IAP ID chapter.Ashok  KapseDengue-like diseases were known to be present all over the world during the 18th and 19th century except in Antarctica. Till the mid 20’s Dengue was assumed to be an innocuous non fatal disease but views on this changed in the 1950’s as the disease went under some strange evolution. People started dying from Dengue in the South East Asian countries and two major serious symptoms were found in these patients: (1) bleeding diathesis and (2) shock. Dengue was now named as ‘Dengue hemorrhagic fever-dengue shock syndrome’ and by 1975 because of this newly evolved disease many children were hospitalised and lost their lives. In 1980’s disease expanded and many Asian countries like India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Pakistan were hit by Dengue. With invasion of every nook and corner India is one of the worst hit countries. Hyperendemicity that is circulation of multiple serotypes has become frequent. The recent epidemics in Sri Lanka and India were associated with multiple dengue virus serotypes, although DEN-3 is clearly more prominent. By end of the last century, this disease moved on from Asia to the Pacific regions and the United States of America (Fig-1). Currently 50 million Dengue viruses occur annually with the outcome of 500,000 hospitalization cases and deaths over 20,000.Download Free PDFView PDFQJMPatterns of disease among adults hospitalized with dengue infections2006 • Eranga  WijewickramaDownload Free PDFView PDFWHO 2011 Guideline of Dengue Infection (2)Motz GamingDownload Free PDFView PDFCPG Dengue Infection PDF FinalIsrar MohtarDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of clinical medicine researchSimple Prognostic Criteria can Definitively Identify Patients who Develop Severe Versus Non-Severe Dengue Disease, or Have Other Febrile Illnesses2012 • Andrew  FalconarSEVERE DENGUE DISEASE (SDD) (DHF/DSS: dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) results from either primary or secondary dengue virus (DENV) infections, which occur 4 - 6 days after the onset of fever. As yet, there are no definitive clinical or hematological criteria that can specifically identify SDD patients during the early acute febrile-phase of disease (day 0 - 3: &lt; 72 hours). This study was performed during a SDD (DHF/DSS) epidemic to: 1) identify the DENV serotypes that caused SDD during primary or secondary DENV infections; 2) identify simple clinical and hematological criteria that could significantly discriminate between patients who subsequently developed SDD versus non-SDD (N-SDD), or had a non-DENV fever of unknown origin (FUO) during day 0 - 3 of fever; 3) assess whether DENV serotype co-infections resulted in SDD. First serum samples, with clinical and hematological criteria, were collected from 100 patients during the early acute febrile-phase (day 0 - 3: &...Download Free PDFView PDFComprehensive Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Dengue and Dengue Haemorrhagic FeverSyifa  MustikaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
